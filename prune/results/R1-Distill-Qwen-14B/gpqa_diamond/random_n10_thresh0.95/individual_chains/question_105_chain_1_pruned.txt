Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the setup: there's a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. The question is about photometric observations showing brightness variations because the star is rotating, so the spots come into and out of view. But the twist is, this setup could look like an exoplanet's effect on the star's light curve. So they're asking what the radius of such an exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation.

Wait, so if the star wasn't spotted, what exoplanet size would cause the same amplitude in the brightness? That's the key.

First, I remember that the brightness variation (the depth of the dip) when a planet transits a star is given by the formula: (Rp / Rstar)^2. Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio.

But wait, in this case, the star has spots, so the observed brightness change is different. Hmm. Normally, for a planet transit, the dip is when the planet blocks some of the star's light. But for spots, it's the opposite: when the spots rotate into view, the brightness decreases because the spots are cooler. So the star's overall brightness changes periodically as the spots rotate in and out of view.

So the problem is comparing the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by these spots to that of a planet transit. The goal is to find the exoplanet radius that would cause the same amplitude.

Let me break this down.

First, the star has a radius equal to the Sun, Rstar = R_sun.

The spots are on one hemisphere, covering 20% of that hemisphere. So the filling factor, f, is 20% or 0.2. But wait, the question says one hemisphere is covered, so the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (4π R^2 / 2) )? Because a hemisphere is half the surface area. So 0.2 * (0.5 * 4π R²) ) = 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So the total area is 0.4 π R².

Wait, but the filling factor is usually the fraction of the solar surface covered by spots. So if the star's total surface area is 4π R², and one hemisphere (2π R²) is covered 20%, then the spot area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So the total spot area is 0.4 π R².

Now, the star's effective temperature is Teff = 6000 K. The spots are cooler by 1000 K, so their temperature is 5000 K.

The brightness variation comes from the change in the star's flux as spots rotate into and out of view. When the star rotates, the spots come into the line of sight, reducing the observed flux because they are cooler.

The observed flux from the star when the spots are visible is lower than when the spots are not visible.

The flux from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R^2 σ Teff^4. But when part of the star is cooler, the flux is reduced by the area of the spots times the difference in their flux.

So the total flux without spots is F_total = σ Teff^4.

When the spots are visible, the flux is F = F_total - (Area of spots) * (σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)).

Wait, maybe a better way is to compute the fractional change in brightness.

The change in flux when the spots are visible is ΔF = F_spot - F_quiet, where F_quiet is the flux without spots, and F_spot is the flux when spots are present.

Wait, no. Let's think in terms of the fraction of the star's surface emitting at a different temperature.

The unspotted star emits at Teff. When a spot is visible, that area emits at T_spot. So the total flux is the sum of the flux from the quiet areas and the spots.

The fractional change in flux (ΔF / F) when the spots are fully visible would be:

ΔF = F_quiet - F_spots

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the difference as the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots multiplied by (Teff^4 - T_spot^4), all divided by the total flux.

So the fractional change is:

ΔF/F = (Area_spots / Area_star) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4.

Wait, but the spots are cooler, so their flux is less than the surrounding. So when they come into view, the total flux decreases. The fractional change in flux would be negative, so the amplitude is a dip.

So the amplitude (A_spot) is:

A_spot = [ (f) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4 ]

Wait, wait, f is the filling factor, which is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. But wait, in this case, the spots are only on one hemisphere, but the filling factor is 20% for that hemisphere. So the total area covered is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R², as I thought earlier. The total area of the star is 4 π R², so the fraction is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.4 /4 = 0.1, or 10% coverage.

Wait, wait, wait. So the total area covered is 20% of a hemisphere. So f = 0.2, but the total surface area is 4π R². So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is (0.2 * 2π R²) / (4 π R²) = 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1, so 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots.

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. The problem states that one hemisphere has dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2 π R²) ) = 0.4 π R². The total surface area of the star is 4 π R². So the fractional area is 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1, or 10% of the star's surface is spots.

So f = 0.1.

Wait, but the problem says the filling factor is 20% on one hemisphere. So perhaps my initial calculation was correct.

So, the fractional change in flux when the spots are visible is:

ΔF/F = (f) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The flux without spots is F = σ Teff^4 * (4 π R²) / (4 π) ) = σ Teff^4 R².

Wait, the flux (power) from the star is F = 4 π R² σ Teff^4.

When a fraction f of the surface is spots, which are cooler, the flux is F' = F * (1 - f) * (Teff^4) / Teff^4 + f * T_spot^4 / Teff^4 * F.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to think of the fractional change in flux when the spots are present.

The total flux without any spots (F0) is:

F0 = 4 π R² σ Teff^4.

When the spots are present, the flux is F_spots = F0 * (1 - f ( (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4 ) )

Wait, no. Because the spots contribute less flux. So the total flux is:

F_spots = F0 * [ (1 - f) * 1 + f * (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ) ]

So F_spots = F0 [ 1 - f (1 - T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ) ]

So the fractional change is:

(F0 - F_spots)/F0 = f (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )).

So this is the amplitude of the dip when the spots are fully visible.

Let me plug in the numbers.

Teff is 6000 K, T_spot is 5000 K.

Compute (1 - (5000^4)/(6000^4)).

Compute 5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

So (5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 ≈ 0.517747.

Multiply by f, which is 0.1:

0.1 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.051775.

So the amplitude of the dip is about 5.1775%.

Wait, but wait: when the star is rotating, the spots are only visible on one side, but the star's rotation will cause the spots to come into view and then go out of view. So the maximum dip is when the spots are fully visible. But since only one hemisphere is spotty, when the star is at a certain rotation phase, the spots are fully visible, and when it's rotated 180 degrees, the spots are on the opposite side, so no dip.

Wait, no. Because the star is rotating, and only one hemisphere has spots. So when the spotted side is facing us, the flux is lower. The maximum dip is when maximum spots are visible. So the amplitude is the maximum dip, which we calculated as about 5.1775%.

Now, the question is, what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve if it transited the star.

The amplitude (A_planet) for a planet transit is (Rp / Rstar)^2.

We want A_planet = A_spot ≈ 0.051775.

So (Rp / Rstar)^2 = 0.051775.

Take square root:

Rp / Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ sqrt(0.051775).

Compute sqrt(0.051775). Let's see:

0.051775 is about 5.1775% of 1.

sqrt(0.05) is about 0.2236.

sqrt(0.051775) is a bit higher. Let's compute.

0.051775 ≈ 0.051775.

Let me compute 0.051775^(1/2).

I can approximate it:

0.227^2 = 0.051529.

0.2275^2 = (0.227 + 0.0005)^2 = 0.227^2 + 2*0.227*0.0005 + (0.0005)^2 ≈ 0.051529 + 0.000227 + 0.00000025 ≈ 0.051756.

That's very close to our target of 0.051775.

So sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275.

So Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

Wait, but wait. The options given are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Wait, 0.2275 is approximately 0.23. None of the options are close to that. Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, wait. Did I calculate the correct amplitude for the spot?

Let me recheck.

The fractional change in flux is f * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)).

f is 0.1, so 0.1*(1 - (5000^4/6000^4)).

Wait, 5000/6000 = 5/6.

(5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.0517747.

So amplitude is ~5.177%.

Wait, but when a planet transits, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So if we set (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517747, then Rp/Rstar is sqrt(0.0517747) ≈ 0.2275.

But none of the options are ~0.23. The closest option is D) 0.32, which is about 0.32. Or perhaps I made a mistake in calculating f.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the filling factor.

Wait, the problem says that one hemisphere has a filling factor of 20%. So the area of the spots is 20% of a hemisphere. The star's total surface area is 4πR². One hemisphere is 2πR².

So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4 π R².

The total surface area of the star is 4 π R².

So the fraction f is 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1, or 10%.

Wait, so f is 0.1.

But wait, perhaps the problem says that the filling factor is 20% of the entire surface, not just the hemisphere. Let me re-read the question.

The question states: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%."

Ah, the filling factor is 20% for that hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * (hemisphere area).

So hemisphere area is 2π R².

So area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Total surface area is 4 π R².

So f = 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1.

So f is 0.1.

So all my previous calculations are correct. So the amplitude is ~5.177%, planet radius ratio is ~0.2275.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial approach. Because when the star rotates, the spots come into view. But the brightness variation is not just a dip, but a variation as the spots rotate in and out.

Wait, but the problem states that the photometric time-series will show periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. The amplitude of that variation is what we're comparing to the planet transit amplitude.

Wait, but the maximum dip would be when the spot is fully visible, which is when the star's rotation brings the spotted hemisphere into our full view. So the amplitude is 5.177%, as I had.

Wait, but perhaps the way brightness variation is calculated in the star's light curve is different. Let's think about the star's brightness when the spots are on the same side as us versus when they are not.

Wait, when the star is rotating, the spots come into view at some phases. The brightness variation is due to the spots being cooler. So the maximum dip is when the maximum area of the spots is visible.

Wait, but in reality, when the star is rotating, the spots may only cover a portion of the visible disk as it turns. So the amplitude of the brightness variation depends on how much of the spot is visible as the star rotates.

Wait, no, because the star is rotating, and the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots are fully visible, and the brightness is at its lowest. When the other hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the far side, so brightness is at maximum.

So the amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness.

So the amplitude is A = F_max - F_min.

F_max is when no spots are visible (or when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us). F_min is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, but the star's overall flux is the sum of all the areas we can see. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spots = (1-f)*Teff^4 + f*T_spot^4 multiplied by the area.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the star as a sphere with two hemispheres: one with spots (f=0.1, T=5000K) and the other at Teff=6000K.

But when the star rotates, the visible surface changes. So the maximum brightness is when the unspotted hemisphere is fully visible, and the minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is fully visible.

So the maximum flux F_max is when the unspotted hemisphere is visible: (since the star has two hemispheres, one spotted (f=0.1) and the other not. So when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is (unspotted area + unspotted hemisphere with no spots) ?

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let's model the star as having two regions: the spotted hemisphere and the quiet hemisphere.

The spotted hemisphere has 10% of the total surface area covered by spots. The rest is quiet.

Wait, no, the spotted hemisphere is the entire hemisphere, which is 2π R². 20% of that is spots. So the spotted hemisphere has 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R² of spots, and 1.6 π R² of quiet area. The quiet hemisphere is 2π R².

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the total flux is:

Flux = (Spotted hemisphere's quiet area + Spotted hemisphere's spot area) * (their respective fluxes) + (Quiet hemisphere's flux).

Wait, no, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire spotted hemisphere is visible. So the total flux is:

F_spotted = (Area of spotted hemisphere's quiet part) * σ Teff^4 + (Area of spots) * σ T_spot^4.

And the quiet hemisphere's area is 2 π R²? No, wait, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the quiet hemisphere is on the other side and not visible. So the visible flux is only from the spotted hemisphere.

Wait, no, the entire star's surface is being observed, but the spotted hemisphere has some spots and some quiet regions, while the opposite hemisphere is entirely quiet.

Wait, perhaps I should model the star as having two hemispheres: one (the spotted hemisphere) where 20% of its surface is spots, and the other (quiet hemisphere) has no spots. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

Flux_spotted = ( (1 - f) * (hemisphere area) * σ Teff^4 ) + ( f * (hemisphere area) * σ
