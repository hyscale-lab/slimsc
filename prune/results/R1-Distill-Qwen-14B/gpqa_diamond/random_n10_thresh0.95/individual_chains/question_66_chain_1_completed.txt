Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices given are A, B, C, D, each combining some of these.

Wait, first, what's SMEFT again? Oh right, it's a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators, which are suppressed by some high energy scale, like the Planck scale. These operators are organized by their dimension and their transformation properties under the SM symmetries.

Now, the question is about which symmetries all operators must respect. I remember that in constructing operators for SMEFT, you have to maintain the symmetries of the Standard Model. But which ones?

Let me recall each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is the symmetry of special relativity, including rotations and boosts. All terms in the Lagrangian must respect this because relativity is a fundamental aspect of our spacetime.

2. **Poincare Symmetry**: This includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So it's the full symmetry of Minkowski spacetime. Well, if the theory is a Lorentz-invariant field theory, then yes, Poincare symmetry would be respected as well. Because the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, all operators must respect this too.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. So if something respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But in the context of the question, the options are presented as separate. So the question is about which symmetries are required. So for SMEFT, all operators must be Poincare-invariant, which implies Lorentz invariance. So both 1 and 2 would be required.

But wait, some sources say that the Poincaré symmetry is automatically satisfied if the theory is relativistic and the Lagrangian is invariant under Lorentz transformations and has appropriate terms for energy-momentum conservation. So perhaps the main point is that they respect Lorentz symmetry, and Poincare comes alongside.

But in terms of SMEFT, the operators must transform covariantly under Lorentz symmetry. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely required.

3. **CP symmetry**: CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. In the Standard Model, CP is not a good symmetry, as we know from the CKM matrix leading to CP violation. So in SMEFT, operators can violate CP. Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the SM itself doesn't have CP symmetry, then SMEFT shouldn't enforce it either. So not all operators have to respect CP. For example, operators that change CP are allowed. So option 3 isn't necessarily required.

4. **CPT symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories because of the spin-statistics theorem and the requirement of unitarity. So in any renormalizable theory, CPT is respected. But wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory. Do effective theories have to respect CPT?

Hmm, I think effective theories must respect CPT symmetry because it's a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

So putting it all together:

Which symmetries must all operators respect? Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the correct options are 1,2,4.

Wait, but earlier I was thinking about whether Poincare is automatically included. Because Lorentz symmetry is part of Poincare, but the question lists them as separate options. So if an operator respects Poincare, it also respects Lorentz. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected. So if an operator respects Poincare, it's included in that. But in the options, 1 and 2 are separate. So perhaps the correct approach is to think that all operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare.

Wait, no. Because Poincare includes translations (like momentum conservation), but SMEFT is a theory that's built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. So both 1 and 2 are required.

Wait, but in reality, Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz and translation. So if the theory is Lorentz-invariant, but does that automatically include translation invariance? No. Because if you have higher-dimensional operators, for example, their derivatives could be such that translation invariance is maintained. So perhaps in SMEFT, the operators are constructed to be Lorentz and translation-invariant, which together make Poincare symmetry.

So each operator must respect both Lorentz and Poincare. So 1 and 2 must be respected.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So which of these are symmetries that the operators must have.

So the operators must transform correctly under the Lorentz group, so they respect Lorentz symmetry (1). Additionally, since the theory is a Poincare-invariant one (because it's a relativistic theory), the operators must also respect Poincare symmetry (2). So both 1 and 2 are required.

But wait, I might be mixing up the concepts. For example, Poincare symmetry includes the possibility of having terms that are not invariant under Lorentz, but that's not the case here. Because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory, all operators must be Lorentz scalars, and thus, Poincare-invariant.

So 1 and 2 must be respected.

Then 3, CP symmetry, is not necessarily required, because some operators can violate CP.

4, CPT symmetry: As I thought earlier, any QFT must respect CPT symmetry. So all operators must respect CPT.

Wait, but wait. The SMEFT is an effective theory, so it's a Lorentz-invariant, renormalizable (or at least power-counting renormalizable) theory. So it has to respect CPT.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The Standard Model itself doesn't have CP symmetry, as I mentioned. However, CPT is still a symmetry. So in SMEFT, operators must respect CPT symmetry.

So the required symmetries are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). But wait, wait. Wait, Poincare is a bigger symmetry which includes translations. So SMEFT being a Lorentz-invariant QFT would automatically respect Poincare symmetry, because you can have a Lorentz-invariant theory that's also Poincare-invariant.

Wait, perhaps. Let me think: Poincare symmetry includes translations. So in the Lagrangian, translation invariance is achieved by having the equations of motion and the Lagrangian density being such that the integral over space is invariant under translations. So when you write down operators in SMEFT, they are local and translation-invariant, right? Because each term is local and the integral over space is invariant.

So SMEFT operators must respect both Lorentz and translation symmetries, which together give Poincare symmetry. So 1 and 2 are both required.

So far, that's 1 and 2. But also, 4, CPT symmetry, must be respected because it's required for any QFT, including SMEFT.

So the correct answer includes 1, 2, and 4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So option C is the answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought the options were:

Options:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4.

So option C is 1,2,4. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain. Let me think again.

Wait, does SMEFT require Poincare symmetry, or is it just Lorentz?

Because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, but does it necessarily respect Poincare? Wait, Poincare includes translations, which are necessary to have a good energy-momentum. But SMEFT is written as a theory with local operators, so yes, it must be Poincare-invariant.

So 1 and 2 must be respected.

And 4, CPT symmetry, is also a must.

So the correct answer would have 1, 2, and 4. So option C, which is 1,2,4.

So the correct answer is C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators, which are suppressed by a high energy scale. These operators must respect certain symmetries of the Standard Model. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is the symmetry of special relativity, encompassing rotations and boosts. Since SMEFT is a relativistic theory, all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: This includes Lorentz symmetry plus translation symmetry. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and its operators are constructed to be local and translation-invariant. Therefore, Poincaré symmetry must also be respected.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry combines charge conjugation and parity. The Standard Model does not respect CP symmetry (e.g., due to CP violation in the CKM matrix), and SMEFT allows operators that violate CP. Thus, CP symmetry is not a requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental requirement for any quantum field theory, including SMEFT, due to the spin-statistics theorem and unitarity. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct answer is the option that includes these three symmetries.

**Answer: C**
