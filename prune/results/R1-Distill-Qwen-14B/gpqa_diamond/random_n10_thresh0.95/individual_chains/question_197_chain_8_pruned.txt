Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again and see what I can do.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the HI (hydroiodic) acid cleavage reaction. This reaction is usually used to cleave alkenes, especially when the alkene is part of a conjugated diene or in a cyclic structure. Wait, or is it for something else? Oh right, I think it's for the cleavage of alkenes to form diiodides, which can then undergo elimination or substitution. But wait, another thing comes to mind. Oh yeah, when you have an alkene and treat it with HI, it's a halogenation, but with red phosphorus, maybe it's the hydroboration reaction? No, wait, no, that's with BH3. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility—maybe it's the oxymercuration reaction? No, that's mercury-based. Okay, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. Red phosphorus with HI—I think this is the Hunsdiecker reaction, which is used for the cleavage of alkenes to form iodides. Oh yes, the Hunsdiecker reaction cleaves alkenes using red phosphorus and HI, producing iodides. So, if the starting compound has a double bond, this reaction would break it into two iodides.

But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact specifics. Let me think: when an alkene reacts with HI in the presence of red phosphorus, it typically leads to the formation of vicinal diiodide. Oh wait, no—wait, red phosphorus and HI is used in the hydrohalogenation, but perhaps in a different way. Alternatively, I think that when an alkene is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it's undergoing a reaction to form alcohols. No, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe it's a diiodination, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should first analyze the IR and NMR data to figure out what Compound X is, then I can determine what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Let's look at the IR data first. The IR peaks are at 3400-2500, 1720, 1610, 1450, and 1450 cm-1. The 3400-2500 region is a broad peak, which usually indicates an -OH group, maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, a carboxylic acid has a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300. But then, also, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which is indicative of a carbonyl group. A carboxylic acid has a carbonyl around 1700 cm-1 but perhaps a bit higher if it's an ester or ketone. Wait, the 1720 is a bit higher, so maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid with a strong hydrogen bonding. But I'm not too sure.

The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks could be aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe the compound has an aromatic ring with conjugated carbonyl groups or something else.

Now looking at the NMR. The 1H NMR data is as follows: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

The 10.5 ppm peak is probably an -OH proton, maybe a carboxylic acid. Because alcohols typically don't go that high, unless they are acidic, like in a carboxylic acid. So if that's the case, the compound has a carboxylic acid group. But wait, if that's a carboxylic acid, then the carbonyl would be around 1700, which matches the IR's 1720. So that's a good sign.

The aromatic region: 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. Each being a doublet (d) with 2H each. So that would suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in a para-substituted benzene, the protons would be in two sets of doublets. For example, if substituents are at positions 1 and 4, the protons ortho to substituent A would be in one doublet, and the protons meta to substituent A (i.e., para to substituent B) would be another doublet. Wait, I think in a para-disubstituted benzene, the two sets of protons are each a doublet, each integrating to 2H, with coupling constants indicating the coupling between adjacent protons.

So, perhaps the aromatic ring has two substituents in the para positions. But wait, wait—benzoic acid has a substituent (the COOH) in position 1, and another group in position 4. Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl group and a COOH group in para positions.

Wait, but the NMR also shows a peak at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). The doublet (3H) at 1.4 could be a CH3 group attached to a CH2 or CH group. The triplet (3H) at 0.9 suggests a terminal CH3, like a methyl group attached to a CH2 or something. So perhaps a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group or similar.

Let me try to piece this together. If the aromatic ring has a COOH group and another substituent, and the substituent is an alkyl chain that leads to branching.

So, the substituent on the benzene could be a carbonyl group (like COOH) and another group which is an isobutyl or sec-butyl group.

Wait, the NMR also shows a multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H), which is a single proton. That could be a CH group attached to something else. Let's see—maybe a CH connected to two other groups. For example, in an isobutyl group, the central CH would have two CH2 groups attached. So, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let me try to draw the structure. The aromatic ring has two substituents in para positions. One is a COOH group (from the 10.5 ppm peak and the IR). The other substituent is an alkyl chain. Let's see. The NMR shows a peak at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which suggests a -CH(CH3) group because the doublet indicates that the CH3 is attached to a CH that's split into a doublet. The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH2.

Wait, putting that together: perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Or maybe a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, but what kind?

Wait, the multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H, m) could be a methylene group adjacent to the aromatic ring. Maybe it's a CH2 group attached to a branching point. Let me think—maybe the substituent is a propyl group, but with a branch.

Wait, let me think about the possible structure. Suppose the substituent is an isopropyl group. But the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9, which would fit a CH2CH2CH3, but wait, no, a triplet in NMR usually comes from a CH2 next to a CH3. For example, in a CH2CH2CH3 group, the middle CH2 would be a triplet because each proton in the middle is coupled with two CH3 protons and two other CH2 protons. Wait, no, the coupling in a CH2CH2CH3 group would be as follows: the end CH3 would be a triplet because it's next to a CH2, which has two protons. The middle CH2 would be a quartet because it's next to the CH3 (with two protons) and another CH2 (two protons). Hmm, but in the NMR data, the 0.9 is a triplet (3H), which suggests that the CH3 is attached to a CH2 group that has two neighboring protons. So the structure would be CH2CH2CH3. So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH2R group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, putting all this together: The compound has a benzene ring with a COOH group at position 1 and another substituent at position 4. The substituent is an isobutyl group. Isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, no. Isobutyl is -CH(CH2CH3)2? No, wait, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, the isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, that's not right. Wait, no: n-butyl is -CH2CH2CH2CH2-, but isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, no, wait, no. Wait, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: an isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, because isobutyl is a four-carbon group where the branching is on the second carbon. So, the structure would be CH2CH(CH3)2, but that's not possible because that would require two CH3 groups on the same carbon. Wait, perhaps it's -CH(CH2CH3)CH2-? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let me think about the NMR data again. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which itself is attached to another group. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3, so perhaps part of an ethyl group.

Putting that together, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Wait, perhaps the substituent is an iso-propyl group. No, iso-propyl would have a CH(CH3)2 group attached to the benzene. But wait, the NMR shows 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), which would be more consistent with an ethyl group attached to a branching point.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. So the substituent would be a secondary butyl group, like a sec-butyl group. Because sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, but how does that connect to the benzene ring?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let me think: if the substituent is a propyl group, the NMR would show certain peaks. For example, a -CH2CH2CH3 group would give a triplet at 1.2 (the middle CH2), a quartet for the adjacent CH2, and a triplet for the terminal CH3. But the NMR data here don't show that. Instead, the data shows a doublet at 1.4 (3H) and a triplet at 0.9 (3H). Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the options given and see what each structure looks like. The options are A through D.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

Structure: Benzene ring with ethyl group at position 4 (para) and propanoic acid at position 2? Wait, no, the numbering might be different. Wait, 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid would mean that the benzene has an ethyl group at position 4, and the propanoic acid is at position 2. But wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? Or wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the substituent would be the propanoic acid group at one position, and the ethyl group at the para position.

But wait, let me draw it: the benzene ring would have -COOH at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. So for the NMR, the aromatic protons would be ortho and para to the substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions 1 and 4. Hmm.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Structure: Benzoic acid (COOH at position 1) and a sec-butyl group at position 4. The sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, the sec-butyl group is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-? No, wait, the structure of sec-butyl is -CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. Wait, no, no, the correct structure for sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. Wait, no, I think the correct structure is -CH2CH(CH3)2. No, sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me clarify: the butyl group can be either n-butyl (-CH2CH2CH2CH2-), iso-butyl (-CH(CH2CH3)2), or sec-butyl (-CH2CH(CH3)-CH2-). No, wait, that's not correct. Let me think of the four carbons: the first carbon attached to the benzene
