Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the layer of a star where photosynthesis happens, but wait, no, that's plants. Oh right, photosphere is the outer part of the star where light is emitted. So the question is about the excitation of iron atoms in two stars.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, no, the exact wording is "twice as excited in a specific energy level". Wait, maybe that's referring to the excitation energy or the population of that energy level. Oh, right, in stellar atmospheres, under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the populations of energy levels are determined by the Boltzmann distribution.

So the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is N2/N1 = exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), where N2 and N1 are the number of atoms in the higher and lower energy levels respectively, E2>E1, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. So E2 - E1 = ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

In star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in that level. So I'm thinking that the population ratio is 2:1 between the excited level and another level. Wait, maybe it's the ratio of the number of atoms in a certain energy level compared to another. Alternatively, maybe it's the ratio of the excitation to another state.

Wait, the question says "twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmm, perhaps for each star, the population of a particular energy level is being compared. So for star 1, the population is twice that of star 2 for the same energy level. Or perhaps the excitation is higher, which relates to the temperature.

Wait, let me think. Let's denote for star 1: N1_1 and star 2: N2_1. The problem states that N1_1 = 2 * N2_1. Wait, no, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So perhaps the excitation level refers to the relative population in a higher energy state compared to a lower one.

Wait, maybe each star has two energy levels. For star 1, the ratio of higher to lower is N1_high/N1_low. Similarly for star 2, it's N2_high/N2_low. The problem states that in star_1, the ratio is twice that of star_2. Or perhaps the number in the excited state is twice as much.

Alternatively, maybe the question is that the excitation is twice as much, which could mean that the ratio is higher.

Wait, the exact wording: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps N1/N2 = 2, where N is the number in that specific energy level.

But wait, that can't be right because temperature affects the distribution, so if star_1 has higher temperature, the same energy level could be more populated.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Boltzmann factor. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by N_high / N_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, no, wait: the higher energy level is less populated, so the ratio is exponential of the negative of the energy difference over kT. So N_high/N_low = exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So for star_1, that ratio is N1_high/N1_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2, it's N2_high/N2_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the question says that the excitation in star_1 is twice as excited in a specific energy level. Wait, perhaps the specific energy level is the excited state, so N_high is twice that in star_2. Or maybe N_high is twice as much as N_low in star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me read the question again. It says "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps, for that specific level, the number in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So let's say the number in the excited level is N1 = 2 N2.

But wait, the problem also mentions the energy difference between the considered energy levels is 1.38e-23 J. So perhaps it's the ratio between two energy levels in each star.

Wait, maybe the question is that for each star, the atoms are in two energy levels. Let's say E1 and E2, with E2 > E1. For star_1, the population in E2 is twice that of E1. Similarly, for star_2, maybe the population in E2 is a different value.

Wait, but the problem says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So perhaps the ratio N2/N1 (where N2 is the number in the excited state) is 2 for star_1, and something else for star_2.

Wait, no. The problem says that in star_1, the excited level is twice as much compared to star_2. No, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

Let me denote for star_1, the ratio of excited to ground state is R1 = N_high1/N_low1.

For star_2, it's R2 = N_high2/N_low2.

The problem says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited, so perhaps R1 = 2 * R2.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the populations in the specific energy level are twice as much. So N1 = 2 N2, where N is the population in that energy level.

Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of the relative excitation. So if the energy difference is ΔE, the excitation depends on temperature. The ratio of the populations (N_high/N_low) depends exponentially on temperature.

Wait, from the Boltzmann factor, N_high/N_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, for star_1, N_high1/N_low1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = e^(-ΔE/(k T1)).

Similarly, for star_2, N_high2/N_low2 = e^(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But the problem states that in star_1, the number in the excited state (N_high) is twice that of star_2. Or is it that the ratio of N_high to N_low in star_1 is twice that of star_2's ratio?

Wait, the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2. So perhaps for star_1, N_high = 2 * N_high2.

Wait, that's unclear. Alternatively, it could mean that N_high1 / N_high2 = 2. Or perhaps the ratio N_high1 / N_low1 = 2 * (N_high2 / N_low2).

Wait, perhaps the problem is comparing the ratio of the same energy level across the two stars. Like, the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2 for the same energy level. But that might not make sense because the temperature would influence that.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the number of excited atoms to the total atoms is twice. But I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, another approach: the question gives us that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. Let's compute the ratio of the Boltzmann factors for the two stars. Since the question is about finding the correct equation relating T1 and T2.

So let's denote for star_1: N1_high = 2 * N2_high.

Wait, no, the problem says that in star_1, the excited level is twice as much as in star_2. So perhaps N_high1 = 2 * N_high2.

But considering that the population depends on temperature and the energy level difference.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the number in the excited state between the two stars depends on their temperatures. So N_high1/N_high2 = ?

Wait, perhaps the question is that the ratio N_high1/N_low1 = 2 * (N_high2/N_low2).

Wait, that could be. So the ratio of excited to lower in star1 is twice that in star2.

So R1 = 2 R2.

So R1 = 2 R2.

But R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So, exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Wait, but that would lead to:

exp(ΔE/(k T2)) / exp(ΔE/(k T1)) ) = 2.

Alternatively, rearranging, ln( (ΔE/(k T2)) ) - ln(ΔE/(k T1)) ) = ln(2).

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's take the ratio R1/R2 = 2.

R1/R2 = [ exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) ) 

So set that equal to 2.

So ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, but ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's compute:

k is Boltzmann's constant, approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, that's interesting. So ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, which is the same as k. So ΔE = k * 1 K.

So ΔE = k * 1. So substituting into the equation:

ln(2) = (k * 1 )/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

The k's cancel.

ln(2) = 1 [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ]

So ln(2) = ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 * T2 )

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which is the same as ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Looking at the options:

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Yes, that's exactly what we have here.

So the correct equation is option D.


The question involves determining the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2, and the energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J. The photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann distribution applies.

The Boltzmann factor relates the relative populations of two energy levels as:

\[
\frac{N_{\text{high}}}{N_{\text{low}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(N_{\text{high}}\) and \(N_{\text{low}}\) are the populations of the higher and lower energy levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the ratios of populations are:

\[
\frac{N_{\text{high,1}}}{N_{\text{low,1}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{N_{\text{high,2}}}{N_{\text{low,2}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Assuming this refers to the ratio of populations in the higher energy level relative to the lower one, we set:

\[
\frac{N_{\text{high,1}}}{N_{\text{low,1}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{N_{\text{high,2}}}{N_{\text{low,2}}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Dividing through by \(\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right)\):

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \(\Delta E/k\):

\[
\Delta E/k \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Since \(\Delta E = k\) (given \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\) and \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\)):

\[
\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. The correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
