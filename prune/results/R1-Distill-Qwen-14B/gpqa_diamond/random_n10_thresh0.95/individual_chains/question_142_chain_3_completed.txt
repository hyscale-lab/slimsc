Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the geometrical position of this density matrix in the qubit space. Hmm, the density matrix given is ρ = 1/2 (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. 

Let me think about what this matrix actually represents. The state |0⟩⟨0| is a projector, right? It's a matrix with a 1 in the top-left corner and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has a 1 in the bottom-right corner. Adding them together would give a matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s off-diagonal. But wait, each of those projectors is multiplied by 1/2. So the resulting matrix ρ would have 1/2 on the diagonal and 0s off-diagonal.

So ρ is a diagonal matrix with entries [1/2, 0; 0, 1/2]. That looks familiar. Oh, that's the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. Because each basis state has equal probability, meaning the qubit isn't in a definite state but is completely mixed between |0⟩ and |1⟩.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position of this state in the qubit space. I think qubit states are often represented on the Bloch sphere. For a single qubit, the Bloch vector r = (x,y,z) describes the state. The pure states |0⟩ and |1⟩ correspond to the points (0,0,1) and (0,0,-1) respectively. But this is a mixed state, so it's different.

Wait, the density matrix for a mixed state can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So let's see what that gives us. 

Given ρ = (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let's compute r·σ. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. If I write I as the identity matrix, then (I + r·σ)/2 would equal ρ.

So (I + r·σ)/2 = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me compute the right-hand side. I is the identity matrix, so (I + r·σ)/2 would be [ [ (1 + r_z)/2 , (r_x - i r_y)/2 ], [ (r_x + i r_y)/2 , (1 - r_z)/2 ] ].

But the given ρ is diagonal with 1/2 on the diagonal. That implies that the off-diagonal terms must be zero. Looking at the off-diagonal terms (r_x - i r_y)/2 and their conjugate, they must be zero. So r_x - i r_y = 0. That would mean that r_x = 0 and r_y = 0. Because the real part is r_x and the imaginary part is r_y, right?

So then r_x and r_y are zero. Also, looking at the diagonal elements: (1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2. So 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0. Similarly, the other diagonal element (1 - r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 - r_z = 1 → r_z = 0. So overall, the vector r is (0,0,0). 

Wait, but that can't be right because I thought the maximally mixed state is at the origin. Or is it? Because the maximally mixed state is indeed represented by the origin of the Bloch sphere. That makes sense because it's completely mixed; there's no direction in which the state is polarized. 

Looking back at the options: option C is r=(0,0,0). So the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. The density matrix is diagonal with entries \([1/2, 0; 0, 1/2]\), meaning there are no coherences (off-diagonal terms) and equal probability for the qubit to be in either the \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\) state.

In the Bloch sphere representation, the state of a qubit is described by a vector \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\), where the components correspond to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. For a general density matrix, it can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r}\) is the Bloch vector. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), the off-diagonal terms must vanish, which implies \(r_x = 0\) and \(r_y = 0\). Additionally, the diagonal terms yield \(r_z = 0\). Thus, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\).

This corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere, which represents the maximally mixed state. Among the given options, the correct geometrical position is:

**A) \(r = (1,1,0)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the maximally mixed state.  
**B) \(r = (0,0,1):** Incorrect, as this represents the pure state \(|0\rangle\).  
**C) \(r = (0,0,0):** Correct, as this represents the maximally mixed state.  
**D) \(r = (1,1,1):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the maximally mixed state.  

Answer: C
