Okay, so I've got this problem here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let me try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, this looks like a two-dimensional metric because it's in terms of dx and dy. So the space described by this metric is two-dimensional, right? And the question is about a pseudosphere, which I think refers to a surface in anti-de Sitter space or something like that.

Pseudosphere usually means a surface with constant negative curvature. In two dimensions, a pseudosphere would have hyperbolic geometry. But wait, the term might also be used in other contexts, but I think in this case, it's about a surface with negative curvature.

Now, the area of a pseudosphere. In Euclidean geometry, the area of a sphere is 4πr². But in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a sphere (which would actually be a pseudosphere here) is different. Wait, but wait—I'm a bit confused. No, in 2D, a pseudosphere isn't a sphere; it's more like an infinite surface. Hmm.

Wait, but the options given include 4π(x² + y²) and 4π(x² - y²), and also infinity. Oh, and option A is zero, which doesn't seem right.

Wait, let's think about the metric. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So when that denominator approaches zero, the metric blows up. That suggests that the radius of curvature is related to this denominator. Since the pseudosphere's radius is given as 2, perhaps that's connected.

Wait, the metric's denominator is 4 - (x² + y²) = 4 - r², where r is the radial coordinate in 2D (r² = x² + y²). So when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, and the metric becomes singular. That suggests that the space ends at r=2, maybe like a boundary.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps it's a 2D surface that extends infinitely in some way, making the area infinite.

Alternatively, maybe it's a compact surface, but I don't think so. Let me think: for a pseudosphere in 2D, it's like a hyperbolic plane, which is non-compact and has infinite area. But wait, in this metric, when r approaches 2, the coefficients go to infinity. So maybe this is a model of hyperbolic space.

Wait, the metric is given in terms of x and y, but I think it's more like a 2D space embedded in higher dimensions, but perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe it's a 2D surface with a specific geometry.

Wait, the metric is conformally flat because it's written as (something) times (dx² + dy²). That something is 32/(4 - r²), where r² is x² + y². So the conformal factor affects the area.

The area element in 2D is usually dx dy, but with this metric, the area element would be sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is (32/(4 - r²)) * (32/(4 - r²)) )? Wait no. Wait, the metric tensor here is diagonal, with each dx² and dy² multiplied by 32/(4 - r²). So the determinant g would be [32/(4 - r²)]². But since the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, that would be [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy.

Wait, but wait, wait—when the space is two-dimensional, and the metric is diagonal with components g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - r²), then the area element is sqrt(g_xx * g_yy) dx dy. So that's (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy.

So the area over a region would be the integral of (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy over that region.

But what's the region here? The denominator 4 - r² must be positive, so r² <4, meaning r <2. So the space is defined only for r <2. So the maximum r is 2, at which the denominator goes to zero.

Wait, but if the pseudosphere has radius r=2, then perhaps it's the boundary at r=2. But wait, the area in 2D would be the integral over all space where r <2, but with the area element increasing as 1/(4 - r²). That suggests that as r approaches 2, the area element blows up.

So the area would be the integral from r=0 to r=2 of 32/(4 - r²) * 2π r dr.

Wait, because in polar coordinates, dx dy = r dr dθ, so the area element becomes (32/(4 - r²)) * r dr dθ.

So the total area would be the integral over θ from 0 to 2π, and r from 0 to 2.

So area = ∫ (0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] r dr

The θ integral is just 2π. So area = 2π * ∫ (0 to 2) [32 r ]/(4 - r²) dr.

Let me compute that integral. Let's make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes:

∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2 → 32 ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) ) from 0 to 2.

Substitute u=4 - r² → r dr = - du/2.

So the integral becomes 32 ∫ [ ( - du/2 ) / u ] from u=4 to u=0.

Which is 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du from 4 to 0.

But when you switch the limits, it becomes 32*(1/2) ∫ (1/u) du from 0 to4.

So integral is (32/2) ( ln |u| from 0 to 4 )

Wait, but as u approaches 0 from the positive side, ln u approaches negative infinity. So the integral becomes (16)( ln 4 - ln 0 ). ln 0 is -infinity, so ln4 is finite, so the integral is 16 ( ln4 - (-infty )) = 16 * infty → infinity.

So the area is 2π * (a divergent integral) → infinite.

Wait, but that would imply the area is infinite. Looking back at the options, option D is +infty, which would be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again. The metric is defined for r <2, but when you compute the area, it's the integral from 0 to 2, and the integrand goes to infinity as r approaches 2. So the integral diverges, which means the area is infinite.

So the correct answer would be option D, +infty.

Alternatively, maybe the pseudosphere is a one-dimensional object, but I don't think so. The metric is 2D, so the pseudosphere is a 2D surface.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional space. The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) suggests that the space is defined only for \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), or equivalently \(r < 2\), where \(r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\). At \(r = 2\), the metric becomes singular, indicating a boundary.

To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\), we use the area element in polar coordinates, which is \(\sqrt{g} \, dx \, dy\), where \(g\) is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is \(\left(\frac{32}{4 - r^2}\right)^2\), and the area element becomes:

\[
\text{Area element} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

In polar coordinates, \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\), so the area element is:

\[
\text{Area element} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta\) evaluates to \(2\pi\), so the area becomes:

\[
\text{Area} = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, we use the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), which gives \(du = -2r \, dr\), or equivalently, \(r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du\). Changing the limits of integration, when \(r = 0\), \(u = 4\), and when \(r = 2\), \(u = 0\). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_4^0 \frac{-\frac{1}{2}}{u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \(\int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du\) diverges because \(\ln u\) approaches \(-\infty\) as \(u \to 0\). Therefore, the area is infinite.

Given the options, the correct answer is:

**A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.  
**B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this does not represent the area of the pseudosphere.  
**C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this is not relevant to the area.  
**D) \(+\infty\)**: Correct, as the integral diverges due to the singularity at \(r = 2\).

Answer: D
