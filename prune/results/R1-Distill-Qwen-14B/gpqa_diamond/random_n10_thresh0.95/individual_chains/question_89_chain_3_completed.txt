--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through the question carefully and try to break it down step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me jot down the reactions and what each step might do.

First, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. The product is a light yellow solid. Looking at the NMR data: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I think is a carbonyl group, maybe an ester or ketone.

Hmm, when dibromides react with a strong base like KOH, especially in elimination reactions, they often form alkenes via dehydrohalogenation. But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe it's an elimination followed by some kind of cyclization or maybe another reaction. Alternatively, could it be a nucleophilic substitution? But with excess KOH, I think elimination is more likely, but if the molecule can form a ring, maybe it's a ring-opening or something else.

Wait, adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on adjacent carbons in the structure. Heating with KOH might cause elimination, forming a double bond. But wait, the IR has a carbonyl, which suggests maybe a ketone or ester. So maybe it's forming an epoxide? No, because epoxides don't have carbonyls. Alternatively, perhaps a Dieckmann condensation? No, that's for cyclic esters.

Wait, another possibility: when vicinal dihalides (like 1,3-dibromoadamantane) are treated with a strong base, they can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But if the base is in excess and the heating is significant, maybe it's a more complex elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's an E2 elimination to form an alkene, but then what about the carbonyl? Oh, wait, maybe it's a peroxide or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but that usually involves amines.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclopropane? No, that doesn't fit the IR. Let me think differently. The IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. So the product after the first step must have a carbonyl group. That suggests maybe a ketone or an ester.

Wait, wait. Maybe it's an elimination to form a ketone. How? If the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a carbonyl. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a pinacol-like elimination, but pinacol is more about vicinal diols.

Wait, let's think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has four fused cyclohexane rings in a diamondoid structure. The 1 and 3 positions are on the same face, perhaps adjacent carbons. When treated with KOH, the two bromides might eliminate, but I'm not sure how that would form a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction. But with KOH, that's more likely to be elimination.

Wait, another thought: maybe the two bromides are on opposite ends, but in the same face, and elimination leads to a conjugated double bond. But I'm not sure how that leads to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps it's forming an epoxide via a neighboring group participation, but I don't think so because KOH is a strong base, not an oxidizing agent for epoxide formation.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a double elimination. But forming what? Maybe it's a ring-opening of the adamantane structure. Wait, maybe the KOH acts as a base, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group via elimination.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. But how? Oh! Maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation followed by a hydride shift. Let's imagine: two bromides on adjacent carbons. Elimination would form a double bond, but perhaps a hydride shift could form a ketone. For example, in a vicinal dihalide, when both are eliminated, you might form an allene, but that's less likely. Alternatively, perhaps one elimination occurs, forming a carbene or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclohexenone derivative. But I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the NMR data for the first product.

The NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm integrating for 2H. That's a common region for an ether's oxygen-bearing CH2 or perhaps a carbonyl group. Wait, but 4.79 is more like an oxygen-bearing CH2, perhaps as in an epoxide. But wait, an epoxide's CH2 groups usually are around 3-4 ppm, but maybe more deshielded if it's adjacent to something else.

Alternatively, the 4.79 ppm could be a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or ester. The 10H between 2.23 and 2.41 ppm are likely to be the adamantane's bridgehead protons. Adamantane has a lot of equivalent protons in symmetrical positions, so that fits.

The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be a methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl. Wait, but that's quite upfield for a carbonyl-adjacent CH2. Alternatively, maybe it's a bridgehead CH2 group.

Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl. So perhaps the first product is an epoxide. But then where's the oxygen? Or maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, another thought: when a vicinal dihalide is treated with KOH, sometimes it can form a glycol via substitution, but that's when there's water involved. But in this case, it's KOH, which is a strong base and a good nucleophile. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination to form a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the two bromides are on adjacent carbons, so eliminating both would form a double bond. But that doesn't form a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps a neighboring group elimination forms a carbonyl. For example, in a vicinal dihalide, when one bromide is eliminated as Br⁻, the adjacent C-Br could form a double bond, and perhaps a hydride shift occurs to form a carbonyl.

Wait, let's model it. Suppose we have C1-Br and C2-Br. KOH abstracts a β-hydrogen from C2, leading to elimination of Br⁻, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. But that would give an alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps a neighboring group elimination where the base abstracts a hydrogen from a position that allows the formation of a carbonyl. Like, maybe a hydride shift after elimination.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from a carbon adjacent to the Br, leading to the formation of a carbene or some other structure that rearranges. Alternatively, perhaps the two bromides are on the same carbon, but that's not the case since it's 1,3-dibromo.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the IR. The carbonyl is strong at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is in the range of esters or ketones. Esters are usually a bit lower (like 1710-1740), but it's possible. So the product is likely a ketone or an ester.

Wait, maybe it's forming an epoxide but then undergoing some ring-opening. Oh, but KOH is a base, so maybe it's an SN2 reaction, but with two bromides? I'm not sure.

Another possibility: the reaction forms an alkene, but then that alkene undergoes some reaction. Wait, but the product after KOH is a solid, and the IR shows a carbonyl. Maybe it's a ketone formed via oxidation, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. So I'm back to elimination.

Wait, perhaps the two bromides are on adjacent carbons, and the elimination leads to a double bond, but then a hydride shift forms a carbonyl. Like, for example, converting a vicinal dihalide to a ketone via elimination and rearrangement. Hmm.

Let me think: if you have a vicinal dihalide, and you eliminate both X groups, you form a double bond. But if the base is strong enough, perhaps it can abstract a hydrogen from a gamma position, leading to a hydride shift that forms a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's a case of forming a carbonyl via a 1,2-elimination and a 1,3-shift. Alternatively, perhaps the two bromides are on adjacent carbons, and elimination of both with a hydride shift forms a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring with a ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. No, that would have two carbonyl peaks, but the IR only shows one.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ester. Hmm. Wait, how would that happen? Maybe the KOH doesn't just eliminate but also reacts in a different way. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution forming an alcohol, but that wouldn't give a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of a double substitution, but I don't see how that would form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone formed via elimination of both bromides and a rearrangement. Let me think of a specific example. For instance, if you have a molecule where the two bromides are on adjacent carbons, and when both leave, a double bond forms. But then, maybe a hydride or alkyl shift occurs to form a more stable carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe it's a case of forming an allylic carbonyl. Like, if the double bond is formed, and then a shift occurs to form a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a geminal diol, but that would require two OH groups, and the IR would show broad peaks around 3300 cm⁻¹, which isn't mentioned. So that's probably not it.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the NMR data again. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a methylene group attached to an oxygen, like in an ether or an ester. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's imagine that the structure after the first step is a ketone with an adjacent methylene group.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone, where the carbonyl is part of a bridge. For example, if the two bromides were eliminated, and a carbonyl formed. So the structure would be a cyclohexenone or something similar within the adamantane framework.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let's move on to the next step and see if that helps.

The first product is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is often used as a Lewis acid catalyst, especially in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation reactions. But wait, product 2 comes from heating with Al-isopropoxide, which is a strong Lewis acid. So, maybe product 1 is an acyl chloride or something that can undergo Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, but product 1 was formed from KOH and dibromide. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and Al-isopropoxide could facilitate some kind of acylation or alkylation.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. Product 1 could be a ketone, perhaps adamantanone. Then, when treated with Al-isopropoxide, maybe it undergoes some kind of enolization or acylation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's typically for aromatic rings. Wait, adamantane is a polycyclic structure, but it's not aromatic. So maybe that's not the case.

Another possibility: Al-isopropoxide could be used in the formation of epoxides from alkenes via acid-catalyzed epoxidation. But if product 1 is an alkene, then product 2 would be an epoxide.

Wait, but the first step's product has a carbonyl, so maybe the second step is esterification or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR data.

Wait, another angle: the IR of product 1 has a strong carbonyl. So let's assume it's a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with Al-isopropoxide. Maybe the ketone undergoes some kind of cyclization or forms an enol ether or something else.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and Al-isopropoxide is acting as a catalyst for some alkylation. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an epoxide. Wait, the first step produces a diene or an alkene, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, product 1 could be an alkene, and then Al-isopropoxide might cause some addition.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting off track. Let me think about the third step. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So product 2 must have a double bond because ozone reacts with alkenes.

So, product 3 comes from ozonolysis of product 2. Therefore, product 2 must be an alkene. So, working backward, product 1 is something that, when treated with Al-isopropoxide, gives an alkene.

Wait, that makes more sense. So, product 1 is an epoxide, perhaps, and product 2 is the alkene formed by acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me retrace. Product 1 is formed by heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Product 1's IR has a carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is an epoxide, but that would have an ether group, not a carbonyl.

Wait another angle. Maybe product 1 is an ester. Because esters have carbonyls. So, how would 1,3-dibromoadamantane react with KOH to form an ester? I'm not sure. KOH is a strong base, so perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution, but forming an ester would require an alcohol and a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps in the first step, the dibromide is treated with KOH, which leads to the formation of a diol. But that wouldn't have a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination followed by an oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the overall process. The initial reaction with KOH produces a carbonyl (product 1), which is then treated with Al-isopropoxide to make product 2, which is an alkene (so that when ozonolysis is done, product 3 is formed).

Wait, so product 2 must be an alkene. So, product 1 must have a carbonyl, and product 2 is an alkene derived from product 1.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something else.

Wait, product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with Al-isopropoxide. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and Al-isopropoxide is a Lewis acid that helps in the formation of an enol ether via some kind of rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a cyclic ether, but I don't see how that would form a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and the IR's carbonyl is something else, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction forms a ketone via elimination and rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when heated with KOH, undergoes a double elimination, losing two HBr molecules and forming a double bond. But that would give an alkene, not a ketone. Unless there's a hydride shift.

Wait! Maybe it's a case where the elimination leads to a carbene or some other structure that then forms a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps a neighboring group elimination forms a carbonyl.

Wait, let's model the structure. Suppose the molecule is a diamondoid, with Br on carbons 1 and 3. Eliminating both Br groups would require the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2, but then maybe a hydride shift occurs, leading to a carbonyl.

For example, if the structure after elimination is a double bond, but then a hydride from C3 shifts to C2, leading to the formation of a carbonyl at C2. So the product would be a ketone.

So product 1 would be a ketone, specifically 2-adamantanone or something similar.

Then, product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with Al-isopropoxide. Al-isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid. Maybe it's used to form an enol ether, but more likely, perhaps it's used in a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but adamantane isn't aromatic. Alternatively, maybe it's a Lewis acid catalyzed aldol condensation, but that's usually for carbonyl compounds.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone formed via some kind of elimination. Because then product 2 would be an alkene, which would undergo ozonolysis in the third step.

Wait, how would product 1 (a ketone) form product 2 (an alkene) when treated with Al-isopropoxide?

Perhaps the Al-isopropoxide facilitates the dehydration of the ketone. Wait, but that would require a beta-hydroxy ketone. Oh! Maybe product 1 is a secondary alcohol, and when treated with Al-isopropoxide, it undergoes elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, but product 1's IR has a carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone formed via elimination.

Wait, to get an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone from a ketone, you'd need an enol formation followed by elimination, but I'm not sure how Al-isopropoxide would facilitate that.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a secondary alcohol, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a bromide that can undergo elimination with Al-isopropoxide. No, product 1 is after KOH.

I'm getting stuck again. Let me try to think of the overall process.

The initial reaction forms a ketone (product 1). Then, product 1 is heated with Al-isopropoxide to form product 2, which is an alkene. Then, ozonolysis of product 2 gives product 3.

So, the key is that product 2 is an alkene, which is then cleaved by ozone.

So, product 2 must be an alkene derived from product 1. How does a ketone become an alkene? Maybe through some kind of elimination. Perhaps product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is formed by elimination to form an alkene. But product 1's IR doesn't show broad peaks for OH groups, so maybe it's not a diol.

Alternatively, product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and product 2 is an alkene formed by ring-opening.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Alternatively, product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. How?

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a geminal diol, but I don't think that's the case. Or perhaps product 1 is a secondary alcohol, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about the ozonolysis step.

Product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis of an alkene typically cleaves it into carbonyl compounds. The number of carbonyl groups depends on the structure of the alkene.

If product 2 is a simple alkene, say between two bridgehead carbons, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl compounds. But considering the structure of adamantane, the alkene would likely be in a bridge position.

Now, the question is about the NMR of product 3. Specifically, what's the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange with the solvent.

Wait, the most deshielded hydrogen would likely be near an electronegative atom or a carbonyl group. In the case of ozonolysis, the products are typically carbonyl compounds, like ketones or aldehydes, depending on the substitution of the alkene.

If product 2 is a trans-alkene, ozonolysis would give two aldehydes or ketones. But considering the adamantane structure, the ozonolysis would probably break a bridge, forming two ketones.

Wait, but let me think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so if product 2 is an alkene within the adamantane structure, ozonolysis would break the bridge and form two carbonyl groups.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups, and the hydrogens adjacent to them would be deshielded.

Assuming that the alkene in product 2 is between two bridgehead carbons, the ozonolysis would form two ketone groups. So, product 3 might be two ketones connected by some structure, but the exact structure depends on where the alkene was.

Now, the NMR of product 3 would show the hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Those hydrogens would be deshielded and would have specific coupling patterns.

In the case of a ketone, the alpha hydrogens (next to the carbonyl) are typically deshielded and couple with neighboring protons. The coupling pattern depends on the number of neighboring hydrogens and their splitting.

If each carbonyl group is adjacent to a methylene group (CH₂), then the hydrogens on that CH₂ would couple with each other (giving a triplet) and possibly with other adjacent groups.

Wait, but in a bridge structure, each bridgehead would have specific symmetry. Let me think about a specific example.

Suppose the ozonolysis breaks a bridge, creating two ketones. Each ketone would have a CH₂ group adjacent to it. The protons on these CH₂ groups would be next to the carbonyl and would be split by neighboring protons.

If each CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂ group, then each proton would couple with two neighboring protons from each side. But maybe in this case, each CH₂ is adjacent to only one other CH₂ group.

Wait, perhaps each CH₂ is between two carbonyl groups. Alternatively, each CH₂ is part of a larger structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone, where each ketone has adjacent CH₂ groups. The protons on these CH₂ groups would be split by each other and possibly by other groups.

Wait, the most deshielded hydrogen would be on a CH₂ adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say each of these CH₂ groups has two protons. Each proton would be adjacent to another CH₂ group. So, each proton would split into a triplet due to coupling with two neighboring protons (from the adjacent CH₂).

But wait, if each CH₂ is only next to one other CH₂ group, then each proton would have two neighboring protons (one on each side), leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if each CH₂ is next to two other CH₂ groups, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, but in the ozonolysis product, each ketone would have a CH₂ group adjacent. If the molecule is symmetric, the CH₂ groups would be equivalent, and each CH₂ would only be adjacent to one other CH₂ group.

So, for each CH₂ adjacent to the carbonyl, the two protons would be split by the two protons on the adjacent CH₂. That would result in a quartet (each proton is split by two neighboring protons, giving a quartet). Wait, no—if each proton on CH₂ A is next to two protons on CH₂ B, then each would split into a triplet. Because each proton in A would see two protons in B, giving a triplet. So each CH₂ would be a triplet.

But wait, that's the case for each CH₂ group. Alternatively, if the CH₂ groups are each next to two others, the splitting could be more.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH₂ is part of a larger chain, leading to more splitting.

Wait, perhaps each CH₂ is adjacent to one other CH₂ group, so each proton would couple with two protons (the two on the adjacent CH₂), resulting in a triplet.

So, in the NMR, the most deshielded protons (on the CH₂ next to the carbonyl) would be a triplet, each split by the two protons on the adjacent group.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH₂ is next to two other CH₂ groups, leading to more splitting.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the options.

The options are:
A) triplet
B) triplet of triplets
C) doublet of triplets
D) pentet

Wait, a triplet of triplets would mean that each peak is split into a triplet, and then each of those is further split into another triplet. That would happen if a proton is coupled to two different sets of protons, each giving a triplet. For example, if a proton is adjacent to two different CH₂ groups, each with two protons, then you'd have a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, a doublet of triplets would be if a proton is coupled to two different groups: one giving a doublet and another giving a triplet.

A pentet (five peaks) would occur if a proton is coupled to four equivalent protons, but that's less common in symmetric structures.

So, considering all this, the most deshielded protons (on the CH₂ next to the carbonyl) would be adjacent to another CH₂ group. Each proton in this CH₂ would couple with two protons from the adjacent CH₂, giving a triplet. But if there's another coupling, perhaps with another group, that could change the pattern.

Wait, but if each CH₂ is only adjacent to one other CH₂ group, then each proton would be a triplet. But if there's another coupling, say with a bridgehead proton, that might lead to a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH₂ is adjacent to two different CH₂ groups, leading to a more complex pattern.

Wait, maybe each CH₂ is adjacent to two other CH₂ groups. For example, in a bridged structure, each CH₂ might be connected to two others. Then, each proton would have coupling with two different CH₂ groups, each contributing two protons.

In that case, each proton would be split by 2 protons from one group (giving a triplet) and another 2 protons from another group (another triplet), leading to a triplet of triplets (option B). But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH₂ groups are each adjacent to only one other CH₂ group, leading to a simple triplet.

Wait, but considering the adamantane structure, after ozonolysis, the product would likely have a structure where each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH₂ group, which is then adjacent to another CH₂ group on each side. But I'm not certain.

Let me try to visualize. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings fused together. If the double bond was in a bridge, then ozonolysis would break that bridge, creating two ketone groups. Each ketone would be adjacent to a CH₂ group, which is connected to another CH₂ group on the other side.

So, each CH₂ group would be next to two other CH₂ groups (on either side of the ketone). So, each CH₂ group would have two neighboring CH₂ groups, each adjacent on one side.

Wait, not sure. Maybe each CH₂ is only adjacent to one CH₂ group. Let me think: Imagine the bridge is between two bridgeheads. Ozonolysis would cut the bridge, turning each bridgehead into a carbonyl. So, each carbonyl would have a CH₂ group attached, which is connected to another CH₂ group on the same side.

So, each CH₂ group would have two neighboring CH₂ groups: one on the same bridge and another from the adjacent bridge.

Wait, perhaps each CH₂ is adjacent to two other CH₂ groups, leading to each proton being split into a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH₂ is only adjacent to one other CH₂ group, leading to a simple triplet.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the coupling in a simple example. If a CH₂ group is next to another CH₂ group, each proton in the first CH₂ will couple with the two protons in the adjacent CH₂, resulting in a triplet. So, the NMR peak would be a triplet.

But if the CH₂ group is adjacent to two different CH₂ groups, then each proton would couple with four protons (two from each adjacent group), leading to a quintet (n+1 where n=4, so five peaks). But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, if the couplings are from two different groups, each with two protons, you'd get a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but if the two adjacent groups are equivalent (same environment), then the splitting would be the same, leading to a triplet. If they're non-equivalent, then you'd have a triplet of triplets.

In the case of adamantane, the structure is highly symmetrical, so the adjacent groups would be equivalent. So, each CH₂ would be adjacent to one other CH₂ group, and each proton would be a triplet.

So, the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be a triplet.

Looking at the options, the answer would be A) triplet.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **First Reaction (1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH):**  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH at 240°C likely results in a double elimination of HBr, forming a carbonyl-containing product. The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, consistent with a ketone. The NMR data supports this:  
   - 4.79 ppm (2H) suggests a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen or carbonyl.  
   - 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) corresponds to the equivalent bridgehead protons of adamantane.  
   - 1.94 ppm (2H) likely corresponds to a methylene group adjacent to the carbonyl.  
   Thus, the first product is likely a ketone, such as 2-adamantanone.

2. **Second Reaction (Product 1 + Al-isopropoxide):**  
   Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, facilitates the formation of an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (product 2) via dehydration of the ketone. This product contains a double bond, as required for the subsequent ozonolysis step.

3. **Third Reaction (Product 2 + Ozonolysis):**  
   Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3. The cleavage of the double bond in the adamantane structure results in two carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is on a methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **NMR Analysis of Product 3:**  
   The most deshielded hydrogen (on the CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl) couples with the two protons of the adjacent CH₂ group. This coupling pattern results in a triplet due to the splitting by the two equivalent protons. There is no evidence of additional coupling that would complicate the pattern further.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet. 

**Answer: A**
