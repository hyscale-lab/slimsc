--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the setup is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. So, the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels. I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms between energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio should depend exponentially on the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the degeneracies of the levels, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, the ratio in question is n1/n2, the number of atoms in level 1 over level 2. So using the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Because the exponent would be positive if E2 is higher than E1. Or wait, let me make sure: the formula is n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if E2 > E1, then E_i (if i is level 2) minus E_j (level 1) is positive. So the exponent is negative, making the ratio (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )? Wait, maybe I should think more carefully.

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of populations is proportional to their Boltzmann factors. So for two states, level 1 and level 2, the ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ). So if E2 is higher than E1, then E1 - E2 is negative, so the exponent is positive, so the ratio n1/n2 increases when E2 > E1.

But wait, in the problem, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature decreases. So when the star has spots, T is lower. The observed ratio decreases—so when there are spots, n1/n2 is lower than when there are no spots.

Wait, let's think again. When the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. So the photosphere is at a lower temperature. The ratio n1/n2 is decreasing. So when T decreases, the ratio goes down.

So the ratio when no spots (T=6000 K) is higher than when spots are present (T=5500 K). Because when T goes down, the ratio n1/n2 decreases.

Wait, the question is: what is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Right. So we need to compute the ratio R = (n1/n2)_6000K / (n1/n2)_5500K.

But to compute this, I need to know how n1/n2 depends on temperature. From Boltzmann, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1) / (k T) ). Since the problem says that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. So the energy difference between the levels can be found using the relation E = hc/λ.

Wait, the transition corresponds to a photon of wavelength 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet or perhaps the far-ultraviolet. So that's the energy difference E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

Let me compute that. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. Wavelength λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 meters.

So E = hc / λ = (6.626e-34)(3e8) / (1448e-10) = let's compute that.

Let me compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = (1.9878 / 1448) * 1e-15 J.

1.9878 /1448 is approximately 0.001373. So E ≈ 0.001373e-15 J = 1.373e-18 J.

But wait, that's in joules. Let me convert that into eV because that's easier for dealing with atomic energy levels. 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So E = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) = approximately 8.57 eV.

Wait, that seems high. Wait, wait. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divided by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 m.

Wait, 1.9878e-25 /1.448e-7 = (1.9878 /1.448) * 1e-18 J.

1.9878 / 1.448 ≈ 1.373. So 1.373e-18 J per photon.

Then converting to eV: 1.373e-18 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) = approx (1.373 / 0.1602) eV. Wait, wait, that can’t be right. Let me compute 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 = (1.373 / 1.602) *10^( -18 +19 ) = (0.857) *10^1 = 8.57 eV.

Wait, but that seems very high for an energy transition. Titanium's ionization energy is about 6.94 eV, so if E is 8.57 eV, it's higher than that. That would mean that the energy is sufficient to ionize the atom, which might not make sense because the question is about neutral Ti. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the transition is between two bound states, so the energy is much lower. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 1448 Å is 1448 * 1e-10 m, right? So 1448e-10 = 1.448e-7 meters.

So E = (6.626e-34 J s * 3e8 m/s) / 1.448e-7 m.

So numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Then E = 1.9878e-25 J m / 1.448e-7 m = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) J.

That is 1.9878 /1.448 = approx 1.373, and 1e-25 / 1e-7=1e-18.

So E = 1.373e-18 J.

Converting to eV:

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So E = 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = (1.373 / 0.1602) eV.

Which is approximately 8.57 eV. Hmm, that's correct? Maybe I'm missing something because 8.57 eV seems high for a transition in neutral Ti.

Alternatively, maybe the transition is in the ionized state, but the question says neutral atoms. Wait, but the ionization energy for Ti is about 6.94 eV, so an 8.57 eV transition would imply that Ti would be ionized, but the question says it's neutral. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it in terms of wavenumbers first. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used wavelength in meters correctly. Let me recompute E.

Wait, 1448 Å is 1448 * 1e-10 meters = 1.448e-7 meters.

So E = hc / λ = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m) = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.448e-7 m) = 1.9878e-25 /1.448e-7 = 1.373e-18 J. Yes, same as before.

Then converting to eV: 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = (1.373e-18)/(1.602e-19) = (1.373 / 0.1602) * (1e-18 / 1e-19) = (8.57) * (10) = 85.7 eV? Wait, no, wait the exponents: 1e-18 / 1e-19 is 10. So 8.57 *10 is 85.7 eV? That can't be right. Because that's way too high. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, 1e-18 divided by 1e-19 is 10, so (1.373e-18 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) = (1.373 / 1.602) * (1e-18 / 1e-19) ) = (0.857) * (10) = 8.57 eV. Oh, right! Because 1e-18 /1e-19 = 10. So 0.857 *10=8.57 eV. So E is 8.57 eV.

Hmm, that's a big energy for a transition in neutral Ti. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference is actually E = 8.57 eV, which would cause ionization. But the problem refers to neutral Ti, so perhaps there's an error. Maybe the transition is not ionization but a higher excitation? Or maybe I should proceed regardless.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the energy. Let me think—maybe the wavelength is 1448 Angstroms, which is 1448 A. So, 1448 A = 1448 x 10^-10 m = 1.448e-7 m. Hmm, that's correct. So E is indeed about 8.57 eV. But that's higher than the ionization energy of Ti, which is about 6.94 eV. That would imply that the transition energy is sufficient to ionize the atom, which can't be happening if the atoms are neutral. Wait, maybe I'm missing a decimal point. Because 1448 A is 0.1448 nm, which is in the near UV. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is in terms of per photon, but the transition is from level 1 to level 2, which requires that the photon is emitted or absorbed. If the photon is emitted when an atom de-excites from level 2 to 1, then E2 - E1 is positive. But if the energy is 8.57 eV, that's higher than the ionization energy, so such a transition would result in ionization rather than excitation. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.

Wait, maybe the transition is in the ionized state, Ti+? But the problem says "neutral atoms of Ti", so it's Ti I. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is actually 0.857 eV, but I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant 1448 nm, which would be in the infrared, but that would make E much smaller. Wait, 1448 nm is 1448 x 1e-9 meters = 1.448e-6 meters. Then E = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (1.448e-6) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-6) ) ≈ 1.373e-19 J. Converting to eV: 1.373e-19 / 1.602e-19 = 0.857 eV. That makes more sense because 0.857 eV is less than the ionization energy, so it's a valid excitation energy.

Wait, but the question says 1448 Å, which is 1448 Angstroms, not 1448 nm. Oh, I see! I think I made a mistake in the unit conversion. 1448 Å is 1448 * 1e-10 meters, which is 1.448e-7 m. But 1448 nm is 1448e-9 m, which is 1.448e-6 m. So the initial assumption was correct, but the wavelength is 1448 Å, which is 0.1448 nm, a very short wavelength in the far-ultraviolet. So the energy is indeed 8.57 eV, which is higher than the ionization energy of Ti. That suggests that I'm either misunderstanding the problem, or perhaps the transition is from a higher to lower energy level, but the energy is so high that it causes ionization.

Wait, but the problem states that the atoms are neutral, so perhaps the energy is actually for a transition in a different element, or maybe the problem has a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the energy is correct, and the ratio can be computed regardless.

Well, maybe I should proceed with the given data. So the energy difference is 8.57 eV. Then, the Boltzmann factor for the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), since n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ).

Wait, let me clarify. The Boltzmann equation is:

n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j) / (k T) )

So for level 1 and level 2, where E2 > E1, the exponent becomes -(E2 - E1)/(k T).

So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, but E2 is higher than E1, so E2 - E1 is positive. So the exponent is negative, so exp(-x) is smaller than 1, so n1/n2 is (g1/g2) multiplied by a number less than 1. So if E2 > E1, n1 is less than n2, assuming g1 and g2 are similar.

But in any case, the ratio R is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.

So R = [ (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k * 6000) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k * 5500) ) ]

The g1/g2 terms cancel out because they are the same in numerator and denominator. So R = exp( [ -(E2-E1)/(k * 6000) + (E2-E1)/(k * 5500) ] )

Wait, because when you divide exponents with same base, you subtract the exponents. So [ exp(a) ] / [ exp(b) ] = exp(a - b). So let me compute the exponent.

Let me compute the exponent: [ -(E2-E1)/(k * 6000) ) ] - [ -(E2-E1)/(k * 5500) ) ]

Which is equal to (E2-E1)/(k) [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ) ]

So let's compute (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) ) = 500 / (33,000,000) ) = 5e2 / 3.3e7 = approx 1.515e-5.

Wait, more accurately, 500/(5500 * 6000) = 500/(33,000,000) )= 1.51515e-5.

So the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) * (1.515e-5).

Wait, E2-E1 is 8.57 eV, and k is Boltzmann's constant. Let me compute in terms of eV.

k is 8.617e-5 eV per Kelvin.

So (E2-E1) = 8.57 eV.

So (E2-E1)/k = 8.57 / (8.617e-5) ≈ 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ 99430. So approximately 99,430 K.

Then, multiply by 1.515e-5: 99,430 * 1.515e-5 ≈ let's compute.

99,430 * 1.515e-5 = (99,430) * (0.00001515) ≈ 0.1505.

So the exponent is approximately 0.1505.

So R = exp(0.1505) ≈ e^0.1505 ≈ approximately 1.162.

Wait, wait, because the exponent is positive, so e^0.15 is around 1.16.

But wait, this would mean that the ratio (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 is about 1.16, which is a factor of about 1.16. So the ratio is higher when the star is hotter, which makes sense because when T increases, exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ) increases, making n1/n2 larger. Wait, but earlier I thought that when T decreases, n1/n2 decreases. Because when T is lower, the exponent is more negative, making n1/n2 smaller.

Wait, but in the problem, when the star has spots (T=5500 K), the ratio n1/n2 is lower. So when T is higher (6000 K), the ratio is higher. So the factor R is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 ≈ 1.16, so the ratio increases by a factor of ~1.16, which is about 1.1. So the closest option is A) ~1.1.

But wait, wait. Let me recheck the exponent calculation.

Wait, the exponent when computing R is (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000).

Which is (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) * (1/5500 - 1/6000)

Wait, (1/5500 -1/6000) is positive, because 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4, 1/6000≈1.667e-4, so their difference is 0.151e-4 = 1.51e-5.

So the exponent is 8.57 / 8.617e-5 * 1.51e-5.

Let me compute 8.57 / 8.617e-5.

8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ 8.57 * (1 / 0.00008617) ≈ 8.57 * 11600 ≈ 99,512.

Wait, 8.617e-5 = 0.00008617, so 1/0.00008617 ≈ 11600.

So 8.57 * 11600 ≈ 8.57 *11.6e3 = 99, 512.

Then multiply by 1.51e-5: 99,512 * 1.51e-5 = 99,512 * 0.0000151 ≈ let's compute:

99,512 * 0.0000151:

Let me approximate: 1e5 * 0.000015 is 1.5. So 99,512 is ~1e5, so 1e5 * 0.0000151 = 1.51. So 99,512 *0.0000151 ≈ 1.506.

Wait, so the exponent is 1.506, not 0.15.

Wait, wait a minute, I think I made a mistake in the earlier calculation. Oh no! I think I missed a factor of 1e5 somewhere.

Wait, the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/5500 -1/6000).

E2-E1 is 8.57 eV.

k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So (E2-E1)/(k) = 8.57 / 8.617e-5 = 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ 99,430 K.

Then multiply by (1/5500 -1/6000) = 1.51e-5 1/K.

So 99,430 K * 1.51e-5 1/K = 99,430 * 1.51e-5 ≈ Let's compute that.

99,430 * 1.51e-5 = 99,430 * 0.0000151.

Let me compute 99,430 * 0.0000151.

0.0000151 is 1.51e-5.

99,430 * 1.51e-5 = (approx 1e5 * 1.51e-5) )= 1.51.

But 99,430 is 0.9943e5, so 0.9943e5 *1.51e-5 = 0.9943 *1.51 ≈ 1.502.

So the exponent is approximately 1.502.

So R = exp(1.502) ≈ e^1.502 ≈ 4.49.

So the ratio is about 4.49. So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but earlier when I thought the exponent was ~0.15, I thought the factor was ~1.16. But that was a mistake. Once I corrected the exponent, it's about 1.5, leading to a factor of ~4.49.

So the factor is approximately 4.5, which is option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the degeneracies of the energy levels, \( E_2 - E_1 \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The ratio of ratios is given by:

\[
R = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{6000\,\text{K}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{5500\,\text{K}}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k \cdot 6000}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k \cdot 5500}\right)}.
\]

The degeneracy factor \( g_1/g_2 \) cancels out, leaving:

\[
R = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Compute the energy difference \( E_2 - E_1 \)
The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448\,\text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7}\,\text{m} \). Using the relation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34}\,\text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8\,\text{m/s} \):

\[
E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} = 1.373 \times 10^{-18}\,\text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1\,\text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19}\,\text{J} \)):

\[
E = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.57\,\text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the exponent
The temperature dependence is handled using Boltzmann's constant \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5}\,\text{eV/K} \). The term \( \frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \) is:

\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} = \frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99,430\,\text{K}.
\]

Next, compute \( \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \):

\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \cdot 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5}\,\text{K}^{-1}.
\]

The exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right) = 99,430 \cdot 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.502.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the factor \( R \)
The factor \( R \) is:

\[
R = \exp(1.502) \approx 4.49.
\]

Thus, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots changes by a factor of approximately **4.5**.

### Final Answer:
**C) ~4.5**
