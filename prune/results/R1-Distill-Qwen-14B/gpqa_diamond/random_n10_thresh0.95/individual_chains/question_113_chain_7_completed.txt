--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, let me look at all the information provided. The compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry.

Starting with the FTIR data. The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 suggests the presence of O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, wait. Broad peaks can be an -OH stretch, but I also remember that in IR, a very broad peak around 3000 could also indicate something else. Oh right, maybe it's an O-H in an alcohol or perhaps a carbonyl group, but no, the carbonyl is usually around 1700. Oh wait, the other peaks are at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, 1700 is a strong peak, which typically indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde or maybe an ester. The 1650 peak is a bit lower. Could that be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an aromatic ring? Or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents? Or perhaps an amide, but amide carbonyls are usually lower.

So combining FTIR: O-H (maybe alcohol or carboxylic acid), and a carbonyl group. Wait, but the 1700 and 1650 could be two different carbonyl groups, which would be interesting. Alternatively, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is something else, like an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. Because aromatic C=C absorption is usually around 1600-1680 cm^-1. So 1650 could be that. But then, the 1700 would be a carbonyl.

So, maybe the compound has both a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring. Or maybe the 1650 is another type of functional group.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that means the compound has a double bond, perhaps an alkene, or maybe part of an aromatic ring. Wait, aromatic protons are usually in certain regions, like around 7 ppm, but vinyl hydrogens could be in different regions. So presence of alkenes is indicated.

Now, the mass spec shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Let's think about what fragments give m/z 45. The common ones include the methyl group attached to something (like CH3O, but that's 31). Wait, 45 is the molecular ion of certain compounds. Alternatively, perhaps it's a fragment. Let me think about possible fragments:

- The fragment could be a CH3CO group, which is 43, but that's close. Wait, 45 is 45, so maybe (CH3)2O is 45? No, (CH3)2O is (2*15 +16) =46. Hmm. Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a ketene ion or a different fragment. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment from a larger structure.

But wait, 45 is also the molecular weight of HCOOH (formic acid, 46? Wait, HCOOH is 46. So no. Or maybe CH3CH2OH is 46. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment like (CH2)2O, but that's 44. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps a CH2CHO group? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, considering the molecular formula options, let's think about possible structures.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So the possible formulas are based on the molecular formulas. Let's compute the molecular weights.

A) 6*12 +12 + 2*16 =72 +12 +32=116 g/mol
B)6*12 +10 +16=72+10+16=98
C)6*12 +10 +32=72+10+32=114
D)6*12 +12 +16=72+12+16=100.

So the possible molecular weights are 116, 98, 114, 100.

The mass spec fragment is at 45. Let's see if any of these have a fragment that would break off into something with molecular weight 45.

For example, if the compound is something like an ester, perhaps the ester group would break, releasing an alkoxy group. Or perhaps a ketone or a carbonyl group.

Wait, another approach: looking for common fragments. One common fragment is the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's m/z 91. Another is the benzyl group, which could be 91 as well. Alternatively, maybe a CH2=CHCO group. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketone. For example, acetone has a molecular weight of 58. Hmm. Wait, what if the parent ion loses a fragment of 45. Let's see: the molecular weight minus 45. So for each option:

Option A: 116-45=71. 71 is a possible mass? Maybe. But what's 71? Maybe a fragment like CH2CH2CO... No, perhaps something else. Let's think about possible structures.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from an ester. For example, if the molecule has an ester group, maybe the ester breaks into the R-O- group and the carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps a cleavage occurs between the ester oxygen and the adjacent carbon.

Wait, another approach: think about possible functional groups. The FTIR indicates O-H (probably) and a carbonyl. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid? Because carboxylic acids have both O-H (broad) and a carbonyl (around 1700). But then, would a carboxylic acid have a vinyl group? Or perhaps it's an ester, which also has a carbonyl and an ether oxygen.

Wait, the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000. If it's a carboxylic acid, that broad peak is due to the O-H stretch. If it's an alcohol, the peak is also broad. But in the case of a carboxylic acid, the O-H is usually very broad and might appear around 2500-3300 cm^-1. The 1700 peak would align with the carboxylic acid's carbonyl.

But then, the other peak at 1650 might be from something else. Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with conjugation, which would lower the carbonyl's absorption.

Alternatively, if the compound is an ester, the carbonyl would be around 1700-1750. The 1650 peak could be from an aromatic ring's C=C. So perhaps the compound is something like methyl benzoate or another aromatic ester.

Wait, but the 1H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So, maybe the compound has a double bond. So perhaps it's an aromatic ester with a vinyl group. Or an ester with an alkene.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a ketone with an alcohol group. But then, the IR's 3000 would be the O-H, and 1700 the ketone.

Wait, the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests a structure with a double bond. So perhaps the compound is something like an allyl ester or an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Alpha,beta-unsaturated esters (like acrylic esters) would have a conjugated system, which could lower the carbonyl's IR absorption. So the carbonyl in such a system might appear around 1700 or lower.

So putting it all together: the compound has a carbonyl group (from IR), an O-H group (from the broad IR peak), and a double bond (from the vinyl H in NMR). Also, the mass spec shows a peak at m/z 45.

Now, considering the possible molecular formulas:

Option A: C6H12O2. So molecular weight 116. If this is an ester, for example, it could be something like methyl cyclopentanoate or similar. Alternatively, it could be a diol ester or something like that.

Option C: C6H10O2. MW 114. This could be a cyclic ester or another structure.

Option D: C6H12O. MW 100. Could be something like cyclohexanol with another substituent, but not sure.

Option B: C6H10O. MW 98. Maybe a cyclic ether with an O, but not sure.

Now, the mass spec fragment of 45. Let me think about possible structures. Let's imagine the compound is an ester, which is common for O2 and a carbonyl.

Ester structures are R-O-CO-R'. The ester group can cleave in mass spec. For example, the ester might break into R-O- and CO-R' fragments. So perhaps one fragment would be the R-O- group. If the R-O- group has a molecular weight of 45, that could explain the m/z 45 peak.

So let's see: If R-O- is 45, then R-O would be 45. Let me compute. For example, if R is CH2CH2O, wait no. Let me think about possible R-O groups with molecular weight 45.

Wait, molecular weight of R-O is 45. So R is (45 - 16) = 29. Wait, 16 is the oxygen. So R is 29. What's a group with molecular weight 29? Let's see: 

- CH2CH2CH2CH3-O- would be (12*4 + 10) +16 = 58+16=74. No. Wait, no, the R-O group's molecular weight is 45. So R is (45 - 16) =29. So R must have 29 g/mol. Let me think about what gives 29.

29 g/mol could be:

- C3H7 (but C3H7 is 56? Wait, C=12, H=1. C3H7 is 3*12 +7=43. Oh, that's too big. Hmm.)

Wait, maybe R is CH2CH2O- but that can't be. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps another approach: what if the fragment is not R-O but something else?

Wait another possibility: the fragment could be a ketene ion (CH2=C=O), which is 44. Close to 45. Or maybe a CH2=CH-O group. Hmm. Or perhaps the fragment is a (CH2)2O group, which is 44 (12*2 +6 +16=44). So that's close to 45 but not exactly. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3CO-OH group, but that's formic acid, which is 46.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment isn't R-O but something else. Let's think about possible structures that could lose a fragment of 45. For example, the loss of a methyl group (15) or a larger fragment.

Wait, let's think about the molecular formulas again. Option A is C6H12O2, which is 6 carbons, 12 hydrogens, 2 oxygens. So possible structures could be esters, like an aromatic ester or something like an ester with a double bond.

Wait, if the compound is an ester with a benzene ring, like phenyl propionate or something. But I don't know. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diester or something else.

But let's think about the mass spec. The fragment at m/z 45 is a major fragment. So perhaps the molecule breaks into a small piece (45) and a larger piece.

Wait, another approach: calculating the degree of unsaturation for each option. That might help.

Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogens here.

For each option:

A) C6H12O2. C=6, H=12, O=2. DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU. That could be a ring and/or a double bond. But the presence of a carbonyl (which is a double bond) would account for one DoU, so perhaps an ester group (which has a carbonyl) and maybe a ring or another double bond.

But wait, the 1H NMR shows vinyl H, so that's a double bond (another DoU). So DoU would be 2. Because 1 from the carbonyl and 1 from the double bond.

So for option A: DoU is 1. But we have two DoU (carbonyl and double bond). So that would require DoU of 2. So option A can't be correct because its DoU is only 1. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe the correct formula must have a higher DoU.

Wait, let me recalculate the DoU for each option.

Option A: C=6, H=12, O=2. DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 =1.

So one DoU, which would correspond to either one ring or one double bond or a combination. But if the compound has both a carbonyl (double bond) and a vinyl group (another double bond), that would require two DoU. So this option can't be right.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU=(12 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=4/2=2. DoU=2. So two degrees: could be two double bonds, or a double bond and a ring, or two rings. Hmm, possible.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=(12 +2 -10)/2=(14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. That works if there are two double bonds, or a ring and a double bond.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU=(12+2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU. If the compound has a carbonyl and a double bond, that would require two DoU, so this option is out.

So now, the possible options are B and C, since they have DoU of 2, which would account for a carbonyl (C=O) and a double bond (vinyl H in NMR).

So now, let me focus on options B and C.

Option B: C6H10O. Formula suggests a structure with two DoU. So possible structures could be an aromatic ring with an O group, like phenol or something else. Or perhaps a cyclic ether with a double bond.

But considering the IR, there's a strong carbonyl peak. So if the compound has a carbonyl, that would require a C=O. So the formula must include O from that. So option B is C6H10O, which has only one O. So if there's a carbonyl (C=O), that uses up the one O. So the compound would have a carbonyl and another group that contributes to the DoU, like a double bond.

Wait, but the IR has a peak around 1700, which is a carbonyl. So the O in B is part of the carbonyl. So the structure could be a ketone with a double bond, or an aldehyde with a double bond. But the presence of an O-H (from the broad IR) suggests an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But if it's a carbonyl and an O-H, that would require two O's. So wait, option B has only one O. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me re-examine. The FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000 (O-H) and two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 (carbonyl and perhaps C=C). So that would require two O's in the structure. Because the O-H is from an alcohol or carboxylic acid. So the compound must have at least two O's. So option B (C6H10O) has only one O, which can't account for both the O-H and the carbonyl. So that would rule out option B.

Ah, that's a key point. So option B is out because it only has one oxygen, but we have two functional groups (O-H and C=O) each requiring an O. So only options A, C, or D. Wait, but earlier analysis showed that options A and D don't have enough DoU.

Wait, but wait. Let me re-examine. Option A is C6H12O2, which has two O's. So that could account for O-H and C=O. But its DoU is 1, but we need two DoU (because of C=O and a double bond from vinyl H). So if option A has DoU of 1, but the structure requires two DoU, that's a problem.

Wait, but maybe the carbonyl is in a cyclic structure, which could account for the DoU. Hmm, not sure. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the O's are in different groups. For example, an ester group has two O's (COO). So in an ester, the carbonyl is part of the ester group (O from the carbonyl and O from the ester oxygen). So in that case, the compound would have two O's. So for example, an ester with a vinyl group.

So let me think about option C: C6H10O2. DoU is 2. So that would fit if there's a carbonyl (one DoU) and another double bond (another DoU).

So perhaps the structure is an ester (two O's) with a vinyl group (another double bond). So, for example, something like methyl acrylate (but that's C4H6O2). Or perhaps a larger ester with a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, which is a lactone. But then, the vinyl group would be part of the ring, which would require more carbons.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diester or something else.

In any case, let's think about the mass spec. The fragment at m/z 45. If the compound is an ester, perhaps the ester group breaks into the R-O- and the COOR' fragments. Alternatively, the molecule could lose a fragment of 45, which would be the molecular weight of something like (CH3)2CO (which is 58? No, wait. Wait 45 is 45. Let's see:

Wait, 45 is the molecular weight. So possible fragments could be:

- CH3CO (43) → but that's 43. So maybe a CH2 group attached to something else.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula for each option.

Option C: C6H10O2. Let's compute the possible degrees. Two O's, so possible functional groups: ester, ketone plus alcohol, carboxylic acid (but that's one O?), or others.

Wait, if the compound is an ester, then R-O-CO-R'. The ester functional group would account for two O's. So the structure could be an ester with a vinyl group.

So, for example, if R is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-, but that would require more carbons.

Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ester, but that would require a benzene ring.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C6H10O2. If it's an aromatic ester, perhaps with a benzene ring (which is 6 carbons?), wait, but the formula is C6H10O2. Benzene is C6H6, so if it's an ester attached to benzene, perhaps something like phenyl acetate (Ph-O-CO-CH2CH3), but that would have more than six carbons.

Wait, no, phenyl acetate would be C6H5-O-CO-CH2CH3, which is C8H8O2. So that's more than six carbons. So not matching option C.

Hmm, perhaps the structure is something else. Maybe it's a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. For example, a five-membered ring with an ester and a double bond. Alternatively, a six-membered ring with an ester and a double bond.

Wait, another approach: the presence of a vinyl group suggests a double bond, so perhaps the compound has a conjugated diene or a substituted alkene.

Putting it all together:

IR: O-H (broad, ~3000), C=O (1700), and possibly a C=C (1650).

NMR: vinyl H, so a double bond.

Mass spec: m/z=45.

Possible structures: ester with a double bond.

So the molecular formula must have two O's (for ester) and a double bond.

So options with two O's are A and C. Option A's DoU is 1, but we need two.

So option C: DoU is 2. So that's possible.

Let me think about the possible structure for option C.

C6H10O2. Let's see the possible structures. If it's an ester, the general formula is CnH2nO2. Wait, no, esters have the formula RCOOR', so the formula would be (n+ m +2) O's? Wait, no. The ester functional group is O-C-O, so the overall formula for an ester is something like (Cn+1H2n+1O2). Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of possible structures.

If the compound is an ester with a vinyl group, such as CH2=CHCOOR, but that might not fit the formula.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's more than six carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's a smaller molecule. Let's consider the molecular formula C6H10O2.

If it's a cyclic ester (lactone), the formula would be C5H8O2, but that's not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's an unsaturated ester, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, but that may not fit.

Wait, another approach: the degrees of unsaturation. DoU of 2.

So for option C: C6H10O2.

DoU is 2. So either two rings, one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds.

If it's an ester (which has a carbonyl, one DoU) and a vinyl group (another DoU), that fits.

So structure could be an ester with a vinyl group.

So, for example, a structure like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's more than six carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's a five-membered ring with an ester and a double bond. Let me think: a five-membered ring would have four carbons in the ring plus the ester group.

Alternatively, perhaps a more straightforward approach is to think about the mass spec. The fragment at m/z 45. Let's think of possible structures that could lose a fragment with m/z 45.

If the compound is an ester, perhaps it's something like methyl something. For instance, the ester R-O-CO-R' could lose the R-O group, which would be a fragment of 45. So R-O is 45. So R would be (45 -16) = 29. But 29 isn't a common group. Maybe it's another way.

Alternatively, the fragment could be the (CH2)2O group, which is 44, but that's close to 45. Hmm, but not exactly. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a CH3CO group (43) plus something else.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is a CH2=CHCOO group, which is 58. No, that's too high.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH2=CH-O group. Let's compute that. CH2=CH-O is 30 (12*2 + 6 +16)= 24 +16=40? Wait, no. Let me recalculate. C=12, H=1, O=16.

CH2=CH-O- would have the formula C2H4O. Molecular weight is (2*12) + (4*1) +16 =24 +4 +16=44. So the fragment would be m/z 44, close to 45 but not exactly. So maybe that's not it.

Another possibility: the fragment is a (CH3)2CO group, which is acetone. That's 58. Not matching.

Wait, what about a CH3CH2O group? That's (2*12) + 5*1 +16 =24 +5 +16=45! Oh! So the fragment could be CH2CH2O (but wait, CH3CH2O is 45). So if the ester group is CH2CH2O-CO- something, then the fragment would be CH2CH2O with m/z 45.

So, for example, if the compound is ethyl something ester, the ethoxy group (CH2CH2O-) would have a molecular weight of 45. Then, the ester would break into the ethoxy group and the rest.

So, the parent compound would be R-O-CO-R', where R is ethyl (CH2CH3). So the molecular formula would be Cn+2 H2n+4 O2.

Wait, let me compute. The molecular formula of the compound would be (ethyl) ester: for example, COOCH2CH3.

So, if the acid part is, say, CH2CH2COO-, then the ester would be CH2CH2COOCH2CH3. The formula would be C4H8O2. But option C is C6H10O2. Hmm, so that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the acid part is longer. For example, if the acid is CH2CH2CH2COOH, then the ester would be CH2CH2CH2COOCH2CH3. The formula would be C6H12O2. But option A is C6H12O2. But earlier, option A had a DoU of 1, which can't fit because we need two DoU. Unless the structure has a ring, but that might complicate things.

Wait, but option C is C6H10O2. Let me see: the ester formula is (RCOO)(OR'). So RCOO has (n+2) O's? Wait, no, R is the acid part. So R is (n carbons), R' is (m carbons). So, the ester would be (n + m + 2) carbons? No, wait: R is (n carbons, acid: RCOOH), R' is (m carbons, alcohol: R'OH). Ester is RCOOR', which is (n+ m +1) carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the molecular formula is C6H10O2, and the fragment is from the ester group. So, for example, if the ester is CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that would be longer than 6 carbons.

Wait, perhaps another approach: looking at the possible molecular formulas and their possible structures that could have a vinyl group, O-H, and a carbonyl.

Option C is C6H10O2. If the structure is a diester, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's a beta-keto ester, which has two carbonyl groups. But then, the IR would show two peaks around 1700. But the IR in the question shows peaks at 1700 and 1650. So maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, where the conjugation lowers the carbonyl's wavenumber.

So, for example, the structure could be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's longer than 6 carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like methyl acrylate: CH2=CHCOOCH3. Let's see, that's C4H6O2. So molecular formula is C4H6O2. Which isn't one of our options.

Hmm. Another approach: the presence of a vinyl group suggests a double bond. So when the molecule breaks apart in mass spec, perhaps the double bond is involved in the fragment.

If the fragment is m/z 45, maybe it's a CH2CH2O group (45), which would mean the parent ester has an ethoxy group. So the ester would be RCOOCH2CH3. So the formula would be RCOOCH2CH3.

The molecular formula of the parent compound would be (R's carbons) + 3 (from COOCH2CH3) = 6. So R must be 3 carbons. So R would be CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, RCOOCH2CH3 would be (n+3) carbons. So if the parent is C6H10O2, RCOOCH2CH3 has (n+3) carbons. So n+3=6 → n=3. So R is propyl? No, wait, RCOO would be (n+1) carbons. Wait, no. Let me think again.

If R is (n) carbons, then RCOO is (n+1) carbons. So RCOOCH2CH3 is (n+1) + 2 = n+3. So for the molecular formula to be C6H10O2, n+3=6 → n=3. So R is 3 carbons. So R is CH2CH2CH2? Wait, but that would make RCOOCH2CH3 as (CH2CH2CH2)COOCH2CH3, which is C5H10O2. But that's not matching C6H10O2.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting tangled up here. Let me think about the molecular formula again. Option C is C6H10O2.

If it's an ester, the formula is (n + m + 2) H? Wait, the general formula for esters is CnH2nO2 (if the ester is from a carboxylic acid with n carbons and an alcohol with m carbons, the ester would be (n + m) carbons, 2n + 2m O's? Or wait, correct formula for an ester is RCOOR', so the formula is (n+1) carbons from RCOO and (m) from R', so total (n+1 +m) carbons. The hydrogens would be 2n + 2m +1? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should just think about the molecular formula.

Option C is C6H10O2. So the ester would have 6 carbons. So the R group (acid) and R' group (alcohol) would add up to 6 - 2 (from COO) =4 carbons. Wait, no, COO is part of the ester. So R is (n-1) carbons in the acid, R' is m carbons in the alcohol. So (n-1 + m) =6 - 2 (because COO is 2 O's but for carbons it's part of R and R')? I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula can be broken down as:

Ester: RCOOR' → (n+1 + m) carbons → 6 = n +1 + m → n + m =5.

Hydrogen count: The acid RCOOH has 2n+1 H. The alcohol R'OH has 2m+1 H. The ester would have (2n+1) + (2m+1) - 2 H (since we lose water) → 2n + 2m +2 -2= 2(n+m) H. So for option C, H=10, so 2(n+m)=10 → n +m=5.

So n + m =5, and from carbons, n +1 + m =6 → n +m =5. So that fits.

So n + m=5. So possible pairs (n, m) are (2,3), (3,2), (1,4), (4,1), (5,0) but m=0 isn't possible.

So possible combinations:

n=2, m=3 → R is CH2CH2 (but that's not possible; wait, R is CH3CH2 for n=2). Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, for n=2 (acid is propanoic acid, RCOOH is CH2CH2COOH), and R' is C3H7 (m=3). So the ester would be CH2CH2COO-C3H7. The formula would be C5H10O2, but our option is C6H10O2. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps n=3 and m=2. So acid is butanoic acid (CH2CH2CH2COOH), R' is C2H5. The ester would be CH2CH2CH2COO-C2H5. That would be C5H10O2, but again, our option is C6.

Hmm, not matching. So perhaps this approach isn't leading me anywhere.

Let me think about the mass spec again. If the fragment is 45, and that's from the R-O group in the ester, then R-O would be 45. So R would be (45 -16) =29. That's not a typical group. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the COOR' part.

Wait, COO has a molecular weight of 44 (12+16+16). So if the COO group is 44, then the fragment could be the COO plus something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment comes from losing a group. For example, the ester could lose the R group, leaving the R'O-CO- part. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula of the parent compound is C6H10O2. The possible structure could be a cyclic ester with a double bond, like a gamma or delta lactone with a double bond. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diethyl maleate or something similar, but that's probably more complex.

Wait, perhaps I should consider another functional group. The IR shows a peak at 1650 cm^-1, which could be an aromatic ring's C=C stretch. So maybe the compound has an aromatic ring. If that's the case, then the structure would include a benzene ring with substituents.

But then, the molecular formula would have to account for the aromatic ring. For example, benzene is C6H6. So if the compound is an ester with a benzene ring, like phenyl acetate (C6H5-O-CO-CH2CH3), but that formula is C8H8O2, which is more than option C's C6H10O2. So that's not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the ring is not benzene but another unsaturated structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is C6H10O2. Let me calculate the possible structures that fit this formula and have both an ester group and a vinyl group.

Wait, another possibility: the structure could be a di-ester with a double bond. For example, something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COO-R. But that would have more O's, so not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an unsaturated ester like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's longer than 6 carbons.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like methyl vinyl ester. Wait, methyl vinyl ester would be CH2=CHCOOCH3. Let's compute the formula: C4H6O2. Not matching option C's C6H10O2.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently. The mass fragment is 45. If it's an ester, perhaps the ester group breaks off, and the R-O- group has a molecular weight of 45. So, as before, R-O would be 45. So R is 29. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the R' part is 45.

Wait, another approach: looking for common m/z values. For example, the tropylium ion (C7H7+) is at m/z 91. Benzyl (C7H7) is m/z 91. Acetone is 58, but that's not matching.

Wait, what about the (CH2)3O group? That would be 12*3 +6 +16=36+16=52. Not 45.

Wait, what about (CH2CH2O) group (45). So, CH2CH2O is 45. So if the ester is of the form O-CO-R, then the R would be CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-, but that's getting too long.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's way beyond six carbons.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a ketone. For example, acetone is (CH3)2CO, molecular weight 58. Not matching.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is a CH2CO group, which is 44. So 44 is close to 45, but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH3CO-O group, which is formate ester. So molecular weight of CH3CO-O is 45 (12*2 +3 +16 +16? Wait no. Wait, CH3CO-O- is (12*2 + 3*1 + 16 + 16)= 24 +3 +32=59. Hmm, no.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is CH2COO, which is (12*2 +1 + 16*2)=24 +1 +32=57. Not matching.

I'm not making progress here. Let me try to summarize:

Key points:

- FTIR: O-H (broad), C=O (1700), possible C=C (1650)
- 1H NMR: vinyl H → double bond
- Mass spec: fragment at m/z=45
- Options: C6H12O2 (A), C6H10O (B), C6H10O2 (C), C6H12O (D)

From the O-H and C=O in IR, the compound has at least two O's. So options B and D (each with one O) are out, leaving A and C.

Looking at the degrees of unsaturation:

- A: C6H12O2. DoU =1. Needs two DoU (C=O and double bond), so A is out.
- C: C6H10O2. DoU=2. Fits with C=O and double bond.

So the correct answer must be option C: C6H10O2.

But earlier thoughts about the mass spec fragment suggest that the fragment is from the ester group, perhaps the ethoxy group (45). So the ester would be something like ethyl something ester, but with a double bond.

Now, the molecular formula is C6H10O2. Let's think of a structure with an ethoxy group (C2H5O) and a COO group. So the structure would be RCOOCH2CH3. The R group would have to be C4H7COO... Wait, no.

Wait, RCOOCH2CH3 has formula (n+3) carbons. So, RCOOCH2CH3 → R is (6-3)=3 carbons? So R is propyl. But wait, RCOO is (n+1) carbons; if n=3, RCOO is 4 carbons, so ester would be 4 + 2 =6 carbons. Yes, that matches.

So R is propyl: CH2CH2CH2. But wait, wait. RCOO would be CH2CH2CH2COO. So the ester would be CH2CH2CH2COOCH2CH3. The formula would be C6H12O2. But option C is C6H10O2. Wait, that formula would have more H's. Let me compute.

CH2CH2CH2COOCH2CH3 → formula is C6H12O2. So that's option A.

But earlier, option A has a DoU of 1, which doesn't fit because we need two DoU. So perhaps that structure is not correct.

Alternatively, maybe the R group has a double bond. So, R is CH2CH=CH2. So the acid is CH2CH=CHCOOH, and the ester is CH2CH=CHCOOCH2CH3. The formula would be C6H10O2. Because the acid part is C4H6O2 (since it's an unsaturated acid) and the ester would be C6H10O2. Wait, let me compute:

The acid: CH2CH=CHCOOH is C4H6O2? No, wait, the acid formula is C4H6O2. Ester would be C4H5O2 (since it loses a water molecule when forming the ester). Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the ester is formed from a unsaturated acid and an alcohol. For example, if the acid is CH2=CHCOOH (propiolic acid, C3H4O2) and the alcohol is ethanol (C2H5OH), then the ester would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. The formula would be C5H8O2. But our option is C6H10O2. So that's not matching.

Hmm.

I think I'm going in circles here. Given the time I've spent, I'll make a conclusion based on the DoU and the functional groups.

The correct answer is option C: C6H10O2.


To identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, the following spectroscopic data was analyzed:

### FTIR Data:
- A broad absorption peak at **3000 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of an **O-H group** (likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid).
- A strong absorption peak at **1700 cm⁻¹** indicates a **carbonyl group** (C=O), likely from an ester, ketone, or aldehyde.
- A peak at **1650 cm⁻¹** could correspond to a **C=C stretch**, possibly from an aromatic ring or an unsaturated system.

### ¹H NMR Data:
- The presence of peaks corresponding to **vinyl hydrogens** indicates the presence of a **double bond** (C=C).

### Mass Spectrometry Data:
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** suggests the presence of a small fragment, possibly an **ethoxy group (CH₂CH₂O)** or a similar group.

### Analysis of Options:
The molecular formulas provided are:
- **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**
- **B) C₆H₁₀O**
- **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**
- **D) C₆H₁₂O**

#### Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):
The DoU for each formula was calculated as:
- **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 1
- **B) C₆H₁₀O**: DoU = 2
- **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**: DoU = 2
- **D) C₆H₁₂O**: DoU = 1

From the IR and NMR data, the compound must have **two degrees of unsaturation** (one from the carbonyl group and one from the double bond). This eliminates **A** and **D**, which have only one degree of unsaturation.

#### Oxygen Count:
The IR data indicates the presence of both an **O-H group** and a **carbonyl group**, requiring at least **two oxygen atoms**. This eliminates **B** (C₆H₁₀O), which has only one oxygen atom.

#### Remaining Option:
The only remaining option is **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**, which satisfies the following:
- It has **two oxygen atoms**, accounting for both the O-H and carbonyl groups.
- It has **two degrees of unsaturation**, consistent with the carbonyl group and the double bond.
- The fragment peak at **m/z = 45** can be explained by the presence of an **ethoxy group (CH₂CH₂O)** in the ester structure.

### Conclusion:
The compound is most consistent with the formula **C₆H₁₀O₂**.

**Answer: C**
