Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. 

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor describes the geometry of spacetime, and the area element can be found using the determinant of the metric tensor. 

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, kind of like a hyperbolic space. But wait, in 2D, a pseudosphere might just be a surface embedded in 3D, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, in higher dimensions, it could be part of a hyperbolic geometry.

But looking at the metric, it's in terms of x and y coordinates, so maybe it's a 2D surface. Let me think: The metric is given as ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So it's a two-dimensional metric.

To find the area, I remember that in differential geometry, the area element dA is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor g_μν. Since it's diagonal here, the determinant is just the product of the diagonal terms. 

Wait, let's write the metric in matrix form. The metric tensor g has components:
g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²)
g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²)
and off-diagonal terms are zero because it's diagonal. So the determinant g is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) * (32/(4 - x² - y²)) )? Wait, no, in 2D, the determinant is (g_xx * g_yy) - (g_xy^2). But here, g_xy is zero, so determinant is (g_xx)(g_yy) = [32/(4 - x² - y²)]^2.

But wait, no, I think I'm mixing dimensions. Wait, in 2D, the metric is a 2x2 matrix. So the determinant would be (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2, because both g_xx and g_yy are the same. So the area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy, which would be [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but wait, the determinant is [32/(4−x²−y²)]², so sqrt of that is 32/(4−x²−y²). So dA = [32/(4−x²−y²)] dx dy.

But wait, the integral for the area would be the integral of dA over the region where the metric is valid. So I need to find the domain of x and y. Because the denominator is 4 - x² - y², which must be positive (since otherwise the metric would have issues like negative or infinite terms). So 4 - x² - y² > 0 → x² + y² <4. So the domain is a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. So the area is the integral of [32/(4 - r²)] dr dθ, where r is the radial coordinate and θ is the angle. Wait, since x² + y² = r², maybe it's easier to switch to polar coordinates. 

So in polar coordinates, dx dy becomes r dr dθ. So dA = [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

The area A is the integral over θ from 0 to 2π and r from 0 to 2, because the radius can't exceed 2 (since 4 - r² must be positive). So:

A = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute this integral. First, separate the integrals:

A = [ ∫0^{2π} dθ ] * [ ∫0^2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr ]

The θ integral is straightforward: ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

Now compute the r integral: ∫0^2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr. Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → r dr = -du/2. 

When r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=4 -4=0. So the integral becomes:

∫u=4 to u=0 [32 * (-du/2) / u ] = ∫4^0 (-16) (du/u) ) → Let's reverse the limits and remove the negative sign:

= ∫0^4 (16/u) du = 16 ∫0^4 (1/u) du.

But wait, the integral of 1/u is ln|u|. So:

16 [ ln u ] from 0 to 4.

Wait, but ln(4) is a finite number, but ln(0) is negative infinity. This suggests that the integral diverges to infinity. So the area would be infinite. 

But wait, that's not possible. Hmm. Let me double-check the substitution.

Wait, let me redo the substitution. So u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So the integral becomes:

∫ [32 r dr / (4 - r²)] = 32 ∫ [ r dr / (4 - r²) ].

Substitute u = 4 - r² → r dr = -(du)/2.

So 32 * ∫ [ (-(du)/2) / u ].

The limits when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes:

32 * (-1/2) ∫ u=4 to u=0 [ du / u ] → which is 32*(-1/2)* [ ln u ] from 4 to 0.

Which is 32*(-1/2) [ ln 0 - ln4 ].

But ln 0 is -infinity, so the integral becomes 32*(-1/2) [ (-infty) - ln4 ] → 32*(-1/2)* (-infty) → which is 32*(1/2)*infty = 16 * infty = infty.

So the integral diverges, meaning the area is infinite. 

So the answer would be option D, which says +infty.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. So the area being infinite makes sense because a pseudosphere in hyperbolic space has infinite area, I think. Wait, no, wait—pseudosphere is a surface in Euclidean space, but in hyperbolic geometry, perhaps the area is finite? Or maybe it's the other way around.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric given is that of a hyperbolic space, which is a 2D space of constant negative curvature. The hyperbolic plane has infinite area, so integrating over the entire space would give infinite area. But in this case, because the domain is x² + y² <4, perhaps it's a finite region, but the metric makes the area element blow up at the boundary.

Wait, no, the domain is up to x² + y²=4, but the metric's denominator approaches zero as r approaches 2, so the area element becomes singular there. So the integral over r from 0 to 2 is divergent, hence the area is infinite.

So the answer is D) +infty.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

and the task is to find the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\). To compute the area, we use the area element in differential geometry, \(dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy\), where \(g\) is the metric tensor. For this metric, the determinant of the metric tensor is 

\[
\det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element becomes 

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The domain of integration is determined by the condition \(4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0\), which corresponds to \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\). This is a circle of radius 2 in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. Switching to polar coordinates (\(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\)), the area element becomes 

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then 

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, separate the integrals:

\[
A = \left(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta\right) \cdot \left(\int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr\right).
\]

The angular integral evaluates to \(2\pi\). For the radial integral, use the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), so \(du = -2r \, dr\) or \(r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du\). When \(r = 0\), \(u = 4\), and when \(r = 2\), \(u = 0\). The radial integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \cdot \int_4^0 \frac{-\frac{1}{2}}{u} \, du = 16 \cdot \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral of \(1/u\) is \(\ln|u|\), so:

\[
\int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln(4) - \ln(0).
\]

Since \(\ln(0) = -\infty\), the integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the area is infinite.

The pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) has an infinite area due to the singular behavior of the metric near the boundary \(r = 2\). Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
