Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again and break it down.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When it doesn't have any dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K.

Wait, dark spots on a star... I remember that starspots are cooler regions, like sunspots. So when part of the star's surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature of the star changes. But how does that affect the photosphere's properties?

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). The ratio decreases when the star has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet range, I think. And it's mentioned that the photosphere is in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies, so the usual Boltzmann equation for population ratios should hold.

So the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio (level 1 / level 2) changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So we need to find (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_spots. Or wait, the ratio decreases when there are spots, so n1/n2 is lower in spots. So without spots, it's higher. So the factor would be (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

But why does the ratio change? Because the temperature affects the population of the energy levels. The ratio depends exponentially on the temperature. The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of populations is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, the energy difference ΔE can be found from the wavelength of the transition. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. So ΔE = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is 1448 Å.

Let me calculate ΔE. Hmm, but maybe I don't need the exact value because the temperatures are given, and I can relate the ratios using the temperatures.

Wait, the ratio of the populations is (n1)/(n2) = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), assuming E2 is higher than E1. Because according to the Boltzmann factor, higher energy levels have fewer atoms. Wait, if the transition is from level 1 to level 2, then E2 is higher than E1. So if the star is hotter, more excitation, so the ratio n1/n2 would decrease because more atoms are in the higher level. Wait, but the ratio is n1/n2, so when T increases, the denominator (n2) increases more, making the ratio smaller.

In this problem, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower, 5500 K, compared to 6000 K. But wait, wait—no, wait. Wait, when the spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So without spots, T is 6000 K, with spots, it's 5500 K.

So when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower. So for the same element Ti, the ratio n1/n2 would be higher when T is lower, because the lower T means less excitation. So without spots, n1/n2 is higher, and when there are spots, it's lower.

But the question says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Wait, wait, that doesn't fit. Oh wait, no. Let me think again. The ratio is n1/n2. If the star is cooler, the atoms are less likely to be excited to higher energy levels. So more atoms remain in the lower level. So n1 increases, n2 decreases. So n1/n2 increases.

Wait no, wait. The ratio n1/n2 is (exp(-E1/(kT)))/(exp(-E2/(kT))) ) ) = exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So if E2>E1, then higher T makes the exponent larger, so ratio increases. Wait, no—wait, (E2 - E1) is positive, so for higher T, the exponent is higher, so the ratio is larger. So if temperature increases, n1/n2 increases.

Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm. Let me get this straight. The Boltzmann distribution says that the population of a state is proportional to g_i exp( -E_i / (k T) ), where g_i is the statistical weight.

So the ratio n1/n2 = (g1 exp( -E1/(kT))) ) / (g2 exp( -E2/(kT))) )

Assuming that g1 and g2 are the same (if the levels have the same degeneracy), then n1/n2 = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So if E2 > E1, then as T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so the exponent is larger, so the ratio increases. So higher T leads to higher ratio n1/n2.

Wait, that makes sense because in higher T, the lower energy level is more populated relative to the higher one. Wait, no. Wait, let's see: higher T means higher thermal energy. So the probability of being in a higher energy level is higher.

Wait, the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So if T increases, the exponent increases, so ratio increases. So n1/n2 is higher for higher T. That is, the number of atoms in level 1 relative to level 2 increases with temperature. That's because at higher T, more atoms are in higher energy levels, but since the ratio is n1/n2, if n2 increases more, the ratio would decrease. Wait, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of when T increases, the population in higher energy levels increases. So if you have two levels, 1 and 2, with E2 > E1, at higher T, the population of level 2 (n2) is higher than at lower T. So n1/n2 = n1/(n2). If n2 increases, n1/n2 decreases. So higher T leads to lower n1/n2.

Wait, that seems correct. Let me plug in some numbers. Suppose E2-E1 is 10 eV. At T=6000 K, what's the ratio? At T=5500 K, what's the ratio?

Wait, but the ratio depends on T as follows: n1/n2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So if E2-E1 is positive, and T increases, then (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes smaller, because T is larger. So the exponent becomes smaller, so the ratio decreases.

Wait, that's right. So when T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So when T is higher, the ratio is smaller.

So in our problem, without spots, T is 6000 K, so the ratio is lower. When there are spots, T is 5500 K, so the ratio is higher. But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Wait, that can't be. Because according to this, the ratio would be higher when T is lower.

Hmm, this is conflicting with the problem statement. Let me read the problem again. 

The problem says, "when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K." Then, "when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots."

Wait, so when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. But according to my earlier reasoning, when T decreases, the ratio n1/n2 should increase. Because n1/n2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So lower T makes the exponent bigger (since T is in the denominator), so the ratio is higher. So why does the problem say the ratio decreases when T is lower?

Hmm, perhaps I have the ratio inverted. Maybe the ratio is n2/n1 instead of n1/n2. Let me check.

Wait, the problem says the "ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)", but it's unclear which is numerator and denominator. Oh, it says "the ratio decreases when the star has spots." So when T goes down, ratio goes down. So assuming that the ratio is n1/n2, then that would mean that when T decreases, the ratio should decrease. But according to the Boltzmann equation, that's not what we found earlier. So perhaps I mixed up the levels.

Wait, maybe the energy levels are the other way around. Suppose level 2 is lower in energy than level 1. Then E2 < E1. Then the exponent would be negative. So n1/n2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) = exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T) )

So, when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio increases. So if E2 is lower than E1, then higher T would make the ratio (n1/n2) larger.

Wait, but in that case, when the star has spots, T is lower. So (n1/n2) would be lower because the exponent is more negative. So that would fit with the problem statement: spots cause the ratio to decrease.

So perhaps in this case, level 2 is lower in energy than level 1. So E2 < E1, which would mean that the transition from level 1 to level 2 is a downward transition, which I think is not the case for emission lines. Wait, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Angstroms. If it's emission, then the electron transitions from a higher to a lower energy level, emitting a photon. So the higher level is level 1, and the lower is level 2.

Wait, but that would make E1 > E2. So then, n1 is the higher level, and n2 is the lower level. So the ratio is n1/n2.

Wait, but that complicates things. Let me think again.

If the transition is from level 1 to level 2, and the photon emitted has wavelength 1448 Å, then E1 must be higher than E2 because energy is emitted when moving from higher to lower energy.

Wait, no, wait. If you have an emission line, the electron drops from a higher energy level (level 1) to a lower one (level 2), emitting a photon. So E1 > E2.

So, level 1 is higher in energy than level 2. So the energy difference ΔE is E1 - E2 = hc/λ.

So, the ratio n1/n2 is given by (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Assuming that g1 and g2 are the same, or the ratio is taken as (n1/n2) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, that makes more sense. So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio increases. So higher T leads to higher n1/n2.

Wait, but wait. If the ratio is n1/n2, and E1 > E2, then the exponent is negative. So increasing T makes the exponent (which is negative) less negative, so the ratio increases. So when T is higher, the ratio n1/n2 is higher.

So, in this problem, when the star has spots, T is lower (5500 K), so the ratio n1/n2 would be lower because the exponent is more negative. So when the star has spots, the ratio decreases, which matches the problem statement.

So the ratio without spots is higher than when spots are present.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Let me compute this factor.

The ratio is given by:

(n1/n2) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

But ΔE = hc/λ. So ΔE/(k T) = (hc)/(λ k T)

So the factor is:

[exp( -ΔE/(k T_no_spots) ) ] / [exp( -ΔE/(k T_spots) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k T_no_spots) - ΔE/(k T_spots) )

Factor out ΔE/(k):

= exp( ΔE/(k) [1/T_no_spots - 1/T_spots} )

But ΔE/(k) is (hc)/(λ k) = (h c)/(λ k)

Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to compute the ratio of the exponents. Let me compute the ratio as [exp(a)] / [exp(b)] = exp(a - b), where a is for no spots, and b is for spots.

Wait, no: for no spots, T is 6000 K, and for spots, it's 5500 K.

So a = -ΔE/(k * 6000), and b = -ΔE/(k * 5500).

So the ratio (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots is exp(a - b) = exp( [ -ΔE/(k * 6000) ) - ( -ΔE/(k *5500) ) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(5500) - 1/(6000) ] )

Wait, let me compute the term inside the exponent.

Compute 1/5500 -1/6000.

Find a common denominator, which is 5500 *6000 = 33,000,000. 

1/5500 = (6000)/(5500*6000) = 6000 / 33,000,000 = 6 / 3,300,000 = 0.0000001818...

Wait, wait, better to compute 1/5500 and 1/6000.

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818
1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667
Difference ≈ 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 ≈ 0.000015151.

So 1/5500 - 1/6000 ≈ 0.000015151 ≈ 1.5151e-5.

So the term inside the exponent is ΔE/(k) multiplied by this difference.

Wait, let's compute ΔE/(k).

ΔE = hc/λ. Let me compute hc/(λ k).

h is Planck's constant: 6.62607015e-34 J·s.
c is speed of light: 299792458 m/s.
λ is 1448 Angstroms, which is 1448e-10 meters.

k is Boltzmann's constant: 1.380649e-23 J/K.

Compute hc/(λ k):

h * c = 6.62607e-34 * 2.99792e8 = approx 1.9864e-25 J·m.

λ = 1448e-10 m.

So hc/λ = 1.9864e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.371e-18 J.

Then, hc/(λ k) = 1.371e-18 J / (1.3806e-23 J/K) ≈ 9.937e4 K.

So ΔE/(k) ≈ 99,370 K.

So the exponent is 99,370 K * (1.5151e-5 1/K) ≈ 99,370 * 0.000015151 ≈ let's compute that.

Well, 1e5 * 0.000015151 is 1.5151.

But 99,370 is approx 9.937e4.

So 9.937e4 * 1.5151e-5 ≈ 9.937 * 1.5151 * (1e4 * 1e-5) )= 9.937 *1.5151 * 0.1.

Compute 9.937 * 1.5151 ≈ let's see: 10 *1.5151=15.151, minus 0.063 *1.5151≈0.095. So approx 15.056.

Multiply by 0.1: 1.5056.

So the exponent is approximately 1.5056.

So the factor is exp(1.5056) ≈ e^1.5056.

We know that e^1 ≈ 2.718, e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817, e^1.6≈4.953.

Wait, 1.5056 is just under 1.5, so e^1.5056 ≈ approx 4.49 (since e^1.5 ≈4.4817). Alternatively, precise calculation: 1.5056.

Compute using calculator steps: e^1.5056.

We can break it down:

e^1 = 2.71828

e^0.5 = 1.64872

e^0.0056: approx 1 + 0.0056 + (0.0056)^2/2 ≈ 1.0056 + 0.000015 ≈ 1.005615.

So e^1.5 = e^1 * e^0.5 ≈ 2.71828 * 1.64872 ≈ 4.4817.

e^1.5056 = e^1.5 * e^0.0056 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.005615 ≈ 4.4817 *1.0056 ≈ let's compute 4.4817 *1.0056.

Calculate 4.4817 *1 = 4.4817.

4.4817 *0.0056 = 0.0251775.

So total ≈ 4.4817 + 0.0251775 ≈4.5069.

So exp(1.5056) ≈ 4.5069.

So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the answer should be C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we analyze the problem using the Boltzmann equation for population ratios in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of populations is given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the two levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The energy difference \( \Delta E \) is related to the wavelength of the transition by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \). The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{spots}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left[\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right]\right).
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \Delta E / k \)
Using \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(2.998 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.371 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Then,

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.371 \times 10^{-18}}{1.381 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99,370 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the temperature difference term
The effective temperatures are \( T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \). The difference term is:

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}.
\]

Converting to a common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} \approx 0.0001818, \quad \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001667, \quad \text{so} \quad \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.00001515 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the factor
Substituting into the factor equation:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(99,370 \times 0.00001515\right).
\]

Simplify the exponent:

\[
99,370 \times 0.00001515 \approx 1.5056.
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.5056) \approx 4.5.
\]

### Conclusion
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases when the star has spots, and the factor by which this ratio changes is approximately **4.5**. This corresponds to option **C**.
