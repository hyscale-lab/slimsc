Alright, let's try to figure out this astronomy problem. Okay, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm... I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. Oh right, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The problem says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly distributed, so the number of stars doesn't depend on direction, only on distance. Wait, but how does that translate into the number of stars per unit parallax?

I think I should consider the volume of space at a certain distance. Because stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a volume depends on the volume. So if I can find how the volume changes with parallax, I can find how the number of stars per unit parallax changes.

Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So for a small change in parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding change in distance? Let's see, d is 1/plx. So if plx changes by a small amount dplx, then the distance changes by dd = d(d)/d(plx)*dplx. Let me compute that derivative. d = 1/plx → dd/dplx = -1/(plx²). So dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Oh but since we're dealing with absolute terms, the sign might not matter here. So the change in distance is about (1/plx²) * dplx.

Wait, but how does the volume relate to the distance? The volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd. Because the volume element in spherical coordinates is 4πr² dr. Oh right, so the volume between d and d+dd is 4πd² dd.

So substituting dd from earlier, the volume is approximately 4π (1/(plx)^2) * (1/(plx)^2) dplx. Wait wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, d = 1/plx → dd = -d(plx)/ (plx²). So the volume is 4π d² dd. Substituting d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/(plx²). And dd = (d plx) / (plx²) → but wait, no. Wait, plx is the variable, so when plx increases, d decreases. Let's take plx as a variable, and the corresponding d is 1/plx.

So for a small change in plx, dplx, the corresponding change in d is dd = (d plx) * ( -1/(plx^2) ). So the thickness in distance terms is |dd| = (d plx) / plx² = d plx / (plx^2) = (d plx) * (1/plx²) )= (d plx) * (1/(plx²)).

Wait, maybe it's easier to express the volume in terms of plx. Let's see:

Volume, V = 4π d² dd.

But d = 1/plx → d² = 1/(plx)^2.

And dd is the change in d for a change in plx. So plx increases by dplx → d decreases by (d plx)/(plx^2).

Wait, perhaps it's better to express d in terms of plx and find how the volume changes with plx.

Alternatively, think about plx as a function of d: plx = 1/d. So for a given plx, the distance is d = 1/plx.

The number of stars in a volume depends on the volume. So the number of stars per unit plx range would be proportional to the volume per unit plx.

So the number of stars, N, in a range of plx from plx to plx + dplx is proportional to the volume between d and d + dd, where d = 1/plx and dd is the change in d due to the change in plx.

Wait, let me think of it in terms of a differential. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is proportional to the volume, which is 4π d² dd.

But since we're changing plx, I need to express everything in terms of plx.

So, d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting into the volume:

dV = 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx²) * (-1/plx² dplx) → but since we're dealing with magnitudes, the negative sign might indicate direction, but in terms of absolute volume, we can take the absolute value.

So dV = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

But wait, no. Because dV is the volume between plx and plx + dplx. Let me make sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find how the volume per unit plx changes.

The volume V between plx and plx + dplx is the volume of the shell at distance d with thickness dd, which is 4π d² dd.

But d = 1/plx → dd = - (d plx) / plx².

So V = 4π (1/plx²) * |dd| → substitute dd:

V = 4π (1/plx²) * (d plx)/(plx²) ) → 4π (1/plx²) * (d plx)/(plx²) ) = 4π d plx / plx^4.

Wait, that simplifies to 4π (d plx) / plx^4 = 4π d / plx³.

But d plx is the change in plx (dplx = Δplx), so the volume is proportional to (d plx) * (d / plx³) ) → but let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the differential. The number of stars per unit plx interval is the number of stars per unit volume multiplied by the volume per unit plx.

Wait, but the number density (number per unit volume) is uniform because stars are uniformly distributed. Let's denote the number density as n, which is constant.

So the number of stars in a volume dV is n * dV. Thus, the number per unit plx is n * dV/dplx.

So let's compute dV/dplx.

From earlier, V between plx and plx + dplx is 4π (1/plx²) * (d plx / plx²) ) → Wait, that's not quite correct.

Wait, V = 4π d² dd, and dd = (d plx)/ (plx²).

So V = 4π (1/plx^2) * (d plx / plx^2) ) = 4π (d plx) / plx^4.

So the differential volume is dV = 4π (d plx) / plx^4.

Thus, dV/dplx = 4π (d plx) / plx^4 / dplx → wait, no, wait, dV is for a change dplx, so dV = (something)*dplx.

Wait, no, V is the volume between plx and plx + dplx. So in terms of calculus, dV = (4π (d^2) ) * (dd) ), where dd is the change in d for a change dplx. And dd = - (d plx)/ (plx^2).

So dV = 4π ( (1/plx)^2 ) * (d plx/(plx^2) ) ) → but I think I messed up the substitution there.

Wait, let's express everything in terms of plx.

d = 1/plx → dd/dplx = -1/(plx²).

So for a small change dplx, the change in d is dd = (-1/plx²) * dplx.

So the volume is V = 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx^2) * (-dplx / plx^2) ) → V = 4π (-dplx) / plx^4.

But since we're considering the magnitude, perhaps it's V = 4π (d plx) / plx^4.

Thus, dV = 4π (d plx) / plx^4.

So the number of stars in this volume is n * dV, where n is the number density.

The number per unit plx is (n * dV) / (dplx) ) → because dV is the volume per dplx, and we want the number per dplx.

Wait, no. n * dV is the number of stars in the shell. So the number per unit plx is (n * dV) / (dplx) → but since dV already includes dplx as a factor, when we take (n dV)/dplx, it's n * (dV/dplx). Which would be n * (4π (d plx)/ plx^4 ) / (d plx) ) → which simplifies to n * 4π / plx^4.

Wait, wait, let me compute this carefully.

n is number per unit volume. So the number of stars in a thin shell of thickness dd is n * 4π d² dd.

But dd = (d plx) / plx², as established earlier.

So the number of stars is n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx / plx^2 ) ) = n * 4π (d plx) / plx^4.

So the number per unit plx (d plx=1) is n * 4π / plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that would mean the number of stars per unit range of plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, which is option A.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Because I thought the density of stars in space is uniform, so the number should depend on the volume. But maybe I made a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the number of stars per unit volume is constant. So the number of stars per unit volume in 3D space is n.

The volume between plx and plx + dplx is V = 4π (d^2) * dd, with d =1/plx, and dd = (d plx)/(plx^2).

So V = 4π (1/plx^2) * (d plx)/(plx^2) ) = 4π d plx / plx^4.

So number of stars in this volume is n * V = n * (4π d plx) / plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit plx is (n * 4π d plx) / plx^4 ) / (d plx) ) → which becomes n * 4π d / plx^4.

Wait, because d plx is the unit range, so we divide by d plx (which is 1). So the number per unit plx is (n *4π d ) / plx^4 → but d = 1/plx, so it's (n *4π * 1/plx ) ) / plx^4 → which is 4π n / plx^5.

Wait, that can't be right because that's 1/plx^5, but none of the options are like that. Hmm, maybe I messed up somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should think of the number of stars per unit volume as n, the number density. So the number of stars per unit volume is n = N/V, where V is the volume of the universe we're considering.

But wait, the problem is about a range in plx, and how N (number of stars) in that range depends on plx.

So for a shell at distance d, with thickness dd, the volume is 4π d² dd.

The number of stars in this shell is n * 4π d² dd.

But we want the number of stars per unit plx (d plx). So how does d relate to plx?

d = 1/plx → dd = - (d plx)/(plx^2).

So substituting, the number of stars becomes n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx)/(plx^2) ) = n *4π (d plx) / plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit plx (d plx=1) is n *4π / plx^4.

Wait, but that would make the number proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx is ~ 1/plx^4. Which is option A.

But wait, I'm getting a bit conflicting results. Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to the surface area at a distance d multiplied by the thickness in distance (dd) divided by the change in parallax (d plx). Because the number of stars in a shell is n * 4π d² dd. And we can express dd in terms of d plx.

Since d =1/plx → dd = - (d plx)/(plx^2).

So the number of stars in a shell is n *4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -d plx / plx² ) → n *4π (d plx) / plx^4.

So the number per unit plx is (n *4π d plx / plx^4) ) / d plx → n *4π / plx^4.

So the number is proportional to 1/(plx^4).

Wait, but that would mean option A) ~1/plx^4.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I think I've heard that the number of stars per distance (i.e., per parsec) increases with distance because the volume increases. So maybe the number of stars per unit volume is uniform, but the number per distance (like per parsec) is higher as you go further because more stars are in that shell.

But in this case, the question is about number per unit range of plx. So if plx is smaller (distance is larger), the number of stars per unit plx would be higher, as the volume per unit plx is higher.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So when plx is small (distance is large), the number of stars per unit plx is larger. Which makes sense because each unit of plx corresponds to a larger volume, so more stars per unit plx.

So the correct answer is option A) ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely related to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The problem assumes stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning the number of stars depends only on the volume of space.

The volume of a spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is given by:

\[
V = 4\pi d^2 dd
\]

Since \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we can express \( dd \) in terms of \( \text{plx} \). Differentiating \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we find:

\[
dd = -\frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2}
\]

Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = -\frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} \) into the volume formula:

\[
V = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \left(-\frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2}\right) = 4\pi \frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4}
\]

The number of stars in this volume is proportional to the volume, assuming a constant number density \( n \). Thus, the number of stars per unit range of \( \text{plx} \) (i.e., per unit \( d\text{plx} \)) is:

\[
\text{Number of stars per unit plx range} = n \cdot \frac{V}{d\text{plx}} = n \cdot \frac{4\pi \frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4}}{d\text{plx}} = \frac{4\pi n}{\text{plx}^4}
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of \( \text{plx} \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).
