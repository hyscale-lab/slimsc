Okay, so I have this astronomy problem about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift tells us about the planet's mass and orbit.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the stars are identical, and the planets have similar masses. The RV method detected each, but the shifts are different: 5 milliangstrom for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2.

Wait, what's a milliangstrom? Oh right, 1e-3 of an angstrom. But the actual value's probably not needed; it's the ratio that matters.

I think the RV method's measured shift relates to the velocity of the star. The formula I remember is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K = (v) where v is the star's velocity. So, the velocity of the star's orbit around the barycenter is inversely proportional to the planet's mass and the orbital period... wait, no. Actually, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, K. K depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination of the orbit, and the period of the planet. But since both planets are detected, the inclination must be such that the RV is visible (so sin i is close to 1; maybe we can assume i=90 degrees for simplicity, so sin i =1).

Wait, but the mass of the planet is similar to Neptune. So both are same mass. Wait wait, the problem says "masses similar to that of Neptune." So the planetary masses are the same. So that part is the same.

So the RV shift depends on the star's velocity. The amplitude K is given by something like K = ( (2πG) / (c T) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) 

But M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune's mass is tiny compared to the Sun), so 1 + M_p/M_star ≈ 1. So that term can be ignored.

So K ≈ ( (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p) ) / ( c^(1/3) * M_star^(2/3) * T^(1/3) ) ) 

Wait, I'm not entirely confident about the exact formula, but I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) T^(1/3})) ) * something with the period.

Wait, another approach: The star and planet orbit their mutual barycenter. The star's velocity is inversely proportional to the planet's mass, but wait, no, the planet's mass is much smaller, so the star's velocity is (M_p/(M_star + M_p)) * (velocity of the barycenter), but since M_p << M_star, the star's velocity is approximately (M_p / M_star) * the planet's velocity.

But perhaps a better approach is to recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (2π) / P )^(1/3) ) 

But since e=0 (circular orbits), and M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / (M_star^2) )^(1/3) * (2π / P)^(1/3) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star) )^(1/3) )

But again, M_p is negligible, so this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / M_star^2 )^(1/3) * (2π / P)^(1/3 )

Which can be written as:

K ∝ (M_p)^(1/3) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Alternatively, since M_p is same for both planets, and M_star same for both stars, K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3), so P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

Wait, no. Let me think. Let me write the proportionality.

Since K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1/K^3)^(3) ? Wait no, let's rearrange.

If K = constant / P^(1/3), then P = (constant / K)^3.

Wait, let's see. Let me denote the proportionality as K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)), because the other factors (M_p and M_star) are same for both planets. So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Because,

K1/K2 = [ ( P2^(1/3) ) / ( P1^(1/3) ) ) ]^{-1} = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to write the ratio.

K = (constant) * (M_p)^(1/3) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Since M_p and M_star are same for both, K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, no. Let's write it as:

K1 = C * P1^(-1/3)
K2 = C * P2^(-1/3)

So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Which rearranges to (K1/K2)^3 = P2 / P1

So P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3

Wait, no, let's compute it:

Take the ratio K1/K2 = (P2^(1/3)) / (P1^(1/3)) )

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So cube both sides: (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1

So P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3

Wait, that's not correct, because if K1 is smaller than K2, then (K1/K2) is less than 1, so P2 would be less than P1?

Wait, let me think again. If K is larger, that would mean a higher velocity, which implies a shorter period because the star is moving more quickly in its orbit. Because higher velocity for same mass and period? Hmm, maybe I should think of the actual formula.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: The RV method's semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/P)^(1/3)

But since M_p << M_star, the (1 + M_p/M_star) term is ~1, so approximately:

K ≈ (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/P)^(1/3)

So, K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3), which can be rearranged as P proportional to (1/K)^3.

So, if K1 is 5 milliangstrom and K2 is 7 milliangstrom, then the ratio of K1/K2 is 5/7.

So, the ratio of periods P2/P1 would be (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, because P is proportional to (1/K)^3, so P2/P1 = ( K1 / K2 )^3.

Because P ∝ 1/K^3 → P2 = (K1^3)/(K2^3) * P1.

Wait no, let me think carefully. K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So P ∝ 1/K^3.

So, P2 = ( (K1)/(K2) )^3 * P1 ?

Wait, no. Let's get the ratio:

P1 ∝ 1/K1^3

P2 ∝ 1/K2^3

So, P2/P1 = (1/K2^3) / (1/K1^3) ) = (K1^3)/(K2^3) ) = (K1/K2)^3

So, P2 is (K1/K2)^3 times P1.

So, the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So, P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1.

Wait no, wait the question says: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

Wait, the question is P2 / P1 = ?

From the above, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

So K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

So, (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So, P2 is about 0.364 times P1, which means it's shorter. So P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of ~0.364.

Wait, but the options are A) ~0.36, which is what I just calculated.

Wait, but wait, am I mixing up the ratio correctly? Because if K is larger, does that imply a shorter period? Because K is the velocity amplitude. Let me think: If a planet is very close to the star, the star's velocity would be higher, right? Because it's moving more quickly in a tight orbit. So a higher K implies a shorter period.

So in this case, K2 is higher than K1 (7 >5), which implies that P2 is shorter than P1. So the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364, which is option A.

Wait, but the question is, how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's? So if P2 is shorter, the answer would be less than 1.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36, which matches our calculation. So the answer would be A.

But wait, in the first thought, I thought that K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3), so P is proportional to (1/K)^3. So, P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

Which is (5/7)^3 = (5^3)/(7^3) ) = 125/343 ≈ 0.364. So yes, option A.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we use the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). From the radial velocity method, \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), which can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Rearranging, the orbital period \( P \) is proportional to \( (1/K)^3 \). Therefore, the ratio of the periods \( P_2 / P_1 \) is given by:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Here, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

This means that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.364 times that of planet #1, or about 0.36 times longer.

From the options provided:

- **A) ~0.36**: Matches the calculated value.
- **B) ~1.40**: Incorrect, as it does not align with the ratio derived from the RV semi-amplitude.
- **C) ~1.96**: Incorrect, as it is unrelated to the given data.
- **D) ~0.85**: Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated ratio.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
