Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm trying to figure out which molecule has C3H symmetry. Hmm, I remember that C3H is a type of symmetry, which means there's a 120-degree rotation axis. So the structure should look the same after being rotated 120 degrees. Also, C3H symmetry implies that there's a three-fold rotational axis with a horizontal mirror plane passing through it. Or wait, maybe it's a different kind of symmetry. Let me get my notes out.

Wait, no. C3H is actually C3h symmetry. Oh right, C3h is a combination of a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule should have a three-fold rotation axis and a mirror plane that's perpendicular to that axis.

Now, the question is about which of the four given molecules has this symmetry. Let's look at each option.

The options are:
A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

Hmm, I think I need to analyze each molecule's structure to see if it has C3h symmetry.

Let's start with option C: triisopropyl borate. I remember that triisopropyl borate has a structure where boron is attached to three isopropyl groups. So the structure is three identical groups around B. Since isopropyl groups are symmetrical themselves, but the question is about the symmetry of the whole molecule.

A three-fold rotation axis would mean that if you rotate the molecule 120 degrees, it looks the same. If all three substituents are the same, like three isopropyl groups, then yes, rotating 120 degrees would map each group onto the next. So would that give C3 symmetry? But wait, C3h includes a horizontal mirror plane as well. So does triisopropyl borate have that?

Hmm, the molecule is trigonal planar around boron, I think. So it's trigonal planar, which has a C3 axis. Wait, but in that case, the molecule doesn't have a mirror plane, unless the structure is symmetric across a plane. Wait, no, in a trigonal planar structure, the mirror plane would be along each axis, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe triisopropyl borate is more like a flat structure without much height, so perhaps a horizontal mirror plane exists. I'm a bit confused here.

Next, option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine, a norbornane derivative but with a nitrogen. Its structure is a bridge structure, with two rings. I think quinuclidine has C2 symmetry. Because it's symmetric when rotated 180 degrees, but not 120. So maybe it doesn't have C3h symmetry. So D is probably not the right answer.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me try to visualize. It's a trifuran system, meaning it's a tricyclic structure with three furan rings. The benzo part suggests a benzene ring fused to some furans. The numbering is 1,3,4,6,7,9. I'm not exactly sure how the substituents are arranged here. But if I imagine a tricyclic system with three rings, maybe it has multiple symmetry axes. Alternatively, if the molecule is symmetric such that rotating 120 degrees (three-fold) would map onto itself, with a horizontal mirror plane, then it might have C3h. But I'm not certain about this one.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Triphenylene is a tricyclic aromatic compound with three benzene rings. If that's fused to a trifuran system, perhaps the overall structure has higher symmetry. Let me think: Triphenylene itself has D3h symmetry, which includes a C3 axis and multiple mirror planes. If the substituents on the trifuran are arranged symmetrically, this might give the molecule C3h symmetry.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, let me think about each molecule's symmetry.

C3h symmetry requires that when you perform a 120-degree rotation about the C3 axis, the molecule looks the same, and there's a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis.

Triisopropyl borate: It has three identical substituents around B. So the molecule is symmetric upon 120-degree rotation. But does it have a mirror plane? Since all three substituents are the same, any plane that bisects the molecule through the B atom and one substituent would be a mirror plane. So for example, imagine the mirror plane that passes through the boron and one isopropyl group. Rotating 120 degrees would cycle the groups, and the mirror plane would reflect the molecule onto itself. So, yes, triisopropyl borate would have C3h symmetry. Wait, but I thought it was trigonal planar, which typically has a C3 axis but also three mirror planes. So the presence of mirror planes would imply C3v symmetry, not C3h. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the point group for a trigonal planar molecule is D3h. Because it has a C3 axis, three C2 axes, and three mirror planes. Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate has a lower symmetry. Wait, no, because all three substituents are the same. So it should have at least C3 symmetry. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, the mirror plane in this case would be perpendicular to the C3 axis. For example, a plane that cuts through the boron and the midpoint between two substituents. So, if the molecule is flat, then a horizontal plane would be such. So yes, it would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but wait. If the molecule has a C3 axis and a mirror plane perpendicular to it, then the point group would be D3h. Because D3h includes a C3, a C2, and a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, if the molecule has a three-fold axis but no mirror planes, then it's C3. But triisopropyl borate, with three identical substituents, would have both the C3 and three mirror planes. So the point group is D3h, which includes the C3h symmetry.

Wait, but the question is specifically about C3h symmetry, which is a subgroup of D3h. So if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it includes C3h. So perhaps triisopropyl borate has C3h. Alternatively, perhaps the other options have higher symmetry.

Looking back at the options, I need to find which molecule has C3h symmetry. So let's analyze each.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. As above, it's D3h symmetry, which includes C3h. So it's a candidate.

Option D: quinuclidine. It's a bicyclic molecule. I think it has a C2 axis. So C2h symmetry, perhaps. So no C3h.

Option B: benzo[...]trifuran. The structure is a bit hard to imagine, but let's think about the substituents. The benzo group is a benzene ring fused to the trifuran. So perhaps the molecule has a three-fold symmetry if the substituents are arranged in a way that 120-degree rotation works.

Alternatively, maybe the benzo substituents are arranged in a way that the overall structure lacks the necessary symmetry. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically around a central point, then perhaps.

Wait, the name is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran. So the benzene is fused to three different positions of the trifuran? Maybe leading to a structure where the substituents are arranged in a trigonal fashion, but perhaps the symmetry is lower.

Option A: triphenyleno[...]trifuran. Triphenylene is a tricyclic structure, so if it's fused with a trifuran, perhaps the overall structure is symmetric. Triphenylene itself has a higher symmetry, but when fused with another structure, maybe the symmetry is reduced.

Alternatively, considering the options, I think triisopropyl borate (option C) has C3h symmetry because it has a three-fold rotation and a mirror plane. But wait, another thought: the mirror plane in C3h is the horizontal one. For triisopropyl borate, the mirror plane would be perpendicular to the C3 axis, which is along the boron. So yes, that would make it C3h.

Wait, but perhaps I'm mixing up the C3h and D3h. Because D3h has more symmetry elements. So if a molecule has D3h, it does have C3h. So the question is, which of the four options has at least C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps other options have higher symmetry. Let me think about each.

Option A: triphenyleno[...]trifuran. Triphenylene is a tricyclic compound with three benzene rings arranged in a symmetric way. So maybe when fused to a trifuran, it's possible that the molecule has a three-fold symmetry. For example, perhaps the substituents on the trifuran are arranged in a way that a 120-degree rotation would map the structure onto itself, with a mirror plane. So maybe it has C3h.

But then, if the structure is more symmetric, like D3h, then it would have C3h as well. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Hmm, but I'm a bit stuck. Let's think about the other options.

Option B: benzo[...]trifuran. The benzo is fused in a way that could make the molecule have lower symmetry, perhaps only C2 or C1.

Option D: quinuclidine. As I thought earlier, it's a bicyclic structure with bridgehead nitrogen. It has C2 symmetry, so no.

So the possible candidates are option C and option A.

Wait, triisopropyl borate is a relatively simple molecule. It's B with three isopropyl groups. So if it's trigonal and flat, then it would have a C3 axis and three mirror planes. So its point group is D3h. Therefore, it has C3h symmetry.

So then option C would have C3h.

Alternatively, option A: triphenyleno[...]trifuran. Triphenylene is a symmetric structure, but when it's fused with a trifuran, maybe the symmetry is altered. If the substituents in the trifuran are arranged symmetrically, perhaps the molecule has C3h. But without knowing exactly, it's hard to tell.

Wait, the point groups of some common molecules: benzene has D6h. Trifluoromethane has C3v, for example. But triisopropyl borate, with three identical groups, would have D3h.

So if option C is D3h, then it has C3h. So the molecule in option C has C3h symmetry.

But wait, the question is which has C3h symmetry. So if the molecule's point group includes C3h, then it would satisfy the condition.

Therefore, triisopropyl borate (option C) has C3h symmetry.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because sometimes, when a molecule is planar, like in benzene, it has higher symmetry. But for a molecule like triisopropyl borate, the planarity might not hold. Because each isopropyl group is a three-carbon substituent, which is bulky. So maybe the molecule isn't flat. If it's not flat, then it might not have a mirror plane perpendicular to the C3 axis.

Wait, in reality, does triisopropyl borate have a planar structure? Boron is in the center, with three identical isopropyl groups. So the structure is trigonal planar? Or is it more like a trigonal pyramidal?

Wait, boron usually has a valence of three. In triisopropyl borane, the structure is trigonal planar with B at the center. So the molecule is flat, and each substituent is arranged symmetrically around B. So in that case, the molecule would be flat, and the mirror planes would pass through B and each substituent, as well as the midpoints between substituents. So the point group is D3h. So yes, it has C3h symmetry.

Therefore, option C is a candidate.

But wait, the other options: option A is a larger molecule. It's a triphenylene fused to a trifuran. Triphenylene has three benzene rings in a symmetric arrangement, so when fused with the trifuran, perhaps the overall structure has a three-fold symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule in option A is more symmetric than triisopropyl borate.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of another approach.

Wait, the question is asking which has C3h symmetry. So perhaps only one of the options has that.

What about the mirror plane in C3h symmetry? It's a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule should have a plane that slices through it, reflecting the top and bottom.

In triisopropyl borate, since it's planar, the mirror plane would be in the same plane as the molecule, which is a horizontal mirror. Wait, but in 3D terms, the horizontal plane relative to the molecule's plane. So perhaps the molecule's plane is where the mirror plane is.

Wait, perhaps all I need to do is to recall which of these structures are known for C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, I can think about the number of symmetry elements. D3h has more elements than C3h.

Wait, C3h has a C3 axis and one horizontal mirror plane. D3h has a C3, a horizontal mirror, and other mirror planes.

So if a molecule has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, it may belong to C3h or D3h. If it also has vertical mirror planes, it's D3h.

So for triisopropyl borate, which has three identical substituents, it must have D3h symmetry, which includes C3h.

So the molecule in option C has C3h symmetry.

But wait, I'm getting confused again because I'm not sure whether triisopropyl borate is actually planar. Maybe in reality, it's not a flat structure. For example, if the substituents are bulky, like isopropyl groups, the molecule might adopt a non-planar structure, which would lower the symmetry. So in that case, perhaps it only has C3 symmetry without the mirror plane, so no C3h.

If that's the case, then triisopropyl borate would have C3, not C3h. So which option would then have C3h?

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Because the triphenyleno part is symmetric, and the trifuran is arranged in a way that creates a three-fold symmetry with a mirror plane.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the actual structures.

Quinuclidine (option D) is known to be a molecule with a bicyclic structure, and it has a single C2 axis. So it doesn't have C3h.

Triphenyleno[...]trifuran (option A) is a larger molecule. If the substituents around the central part are arranged symmetrically, perhaps it has a three-fold axis and a mirror plane. Let's imagine that the three substituents are arranged such that rotating 120 degrees brings each into the position of another, and a mirror plane exists. So that would make it C3h.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to be certain.

Wait, another approach: I can think about the number of symmetry elements each molecule has.

For C3h, there's a 120-degree rotation and a horizontal mirror. So if any molecule has these, it fits.

Option A: triphenyleno[...]trifuran. Triphenylene is a tricyclic structure with three benzene rings, which are arranged in a symmetric way. If the substituents on the trifuran are symmetric, perhaps the molecule has C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps it's even more symmetric. For example, if the molecule has D3h symmetry, then it certainly has C3h.

So, considering all possibilities, perhaps option A is the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Another point: triphenyleno is a tricyclic system with three benzene rings arranged in a trigonally symmetric way. If the trifuran is attached in a way that the overall structure preserves this symmetry, then yes.

Alternatively, the benzo-fused trifuran (option B) might not have that symmetry.

So, after this lengthy consideration, I think that triisopropyl borate (option C) might have C3h symmetry if it's planar, but if it's not, then perhaps option A.

Wait, but I think that in reality, triisopropyl borate is not planar. Because boron typically forms tetrahedral structures, but in this case, it's a trigonal planar with three substituents.

Wait, no, trigonal planar is a possible geometry for a molecule with three substituents. So triisopropyl borate would have a trigonal planar structure, which is flat. So in that case, it would have a horizontal mirror plane. So the point group would be D3h, which includes C3h.

Thus, option C has C3h symmetry.

Wait, but the options are:

A) triphenyleno...
B) benzo...
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine.

So the answer should be option C.

Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong because the actual structure of triisopropyl borate isn't planar. Let me think again. Boron usually has a valency of three, so in triisopropyl borane, it's trigonal planar. So the molecule is flat, and the three substituents are arranged around it. So the point group is D3h, meaning it has C3h symmetry.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine which molecule has **C3h symmetry**, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry properties. **C3h symmetry** involves a three-fold rotational axis (120° rotation) and a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to this axis. Let us evaluate each option:

---

### **Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
This molecule consists of a triphenylene fused to a trifuran system. Triphenylene itself has a highly symmetric structure with three benzene rings arranged in a trigonal fashion. When fused with the trifuran, the overall structure may retain three-fold symmetry if the substituents are arranged symmetrically. However, the exact structure is complex, and without explicit confirmation, it is challenging to definitively assign **C3h symmetry** to this molecule.

---

### **Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
This molecule is a benzo-fused trifuran system. The benzo group introduces a fused benzene ring, which may disrupt the symmetry of the trifuran core. The arrangement of the substituents likely results in lower symmetry, such as **C2** or **C1**, rather than **C3h symmetry**. Thus, this option is unlikely to have the required symmetry.

---

### **Option C: triisopropyl borate**
Triisopropyl borate has a boron atom at the center, bonded to three identical isopropyl groups. The molecule is **trigonal planar**, with a three-fold rotational axis (C3) and three mirror planes. Additionally, it has a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to the C3 axis, satisfying the requirements for **C3h symmetry**. Therefore, this molecule definitively exhibits **C3h symmetry**.

---

### **Option D: quinuclidine**
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine with a bridgehead nitrogen. Its structure has a **C2 axis** (180° rotation symmetry) but lacks the three-fold rotational axis or horizontal mirror plane required for **C3h symmetry**. Thus, this option does not meet the criteria.

---

### **Conclusion**
After analyzing the options, **triisopropyl borate (Option C)** is the only molecule that clearly exhibits **C3h symmetry**. It has a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane, fulfilling the requirements of the symmetry.

**Answer: C**
