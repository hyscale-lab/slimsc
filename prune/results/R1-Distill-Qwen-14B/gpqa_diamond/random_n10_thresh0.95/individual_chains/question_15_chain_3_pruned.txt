Okay, I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Let's see what the question says.

So, we have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, their orbits are circular.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, how does that happen? Usually, more massive stars are larger, but maybe Planet_2's host is a slightly evolved star, so it might have expanded a bit, but same radius. Hmm, interesting.

So, I need to find which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. But since we're not told about the planet radii, perhaps we can assume they're Earth-like, similar sizes. But maybe that's not needed.

Wait, the transit probability formula is something I remember. The probability P is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by something else, but I'm not exactly sure. Oh wait, another factor is the orbital distance. Because the planet needs to pass directly in front of the star, so the probability is higher if the star is larger relative to the planet's orbital path.

Wait, no. The transit probability depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit. Wait, more accurately, the probability is (R_star / a) * (something?), or perhaps it's (R_star / a) squared? Wait, no, that's not quite right.

I think the probability of a transit is given by (R*/a) * (something about the inclination), but wait, the formula I recall is that the probability is proportional to (R*/a)^2 times the probability of the orbital plane being edge-on, which is 1/(sin i), but I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I should think of it this way: for a given planet, the transit probability is (R_p / R_*)^2 multiplied by (R_* / a) * (something else?).

Wait, no, let me think again. The transit probability for a planet is the probability that, from our line of sight, the planet passes in front of the star. The geometric probability is given by (R_*/a) * (R_p/R_*). Or wait, perhaps it's (R_p + R_*) / a, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, I think the formula is P = (R_p / R_*)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a/(R_*) )) ), but that's not quite right. Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_p / R_*)^2 * (R_* / a), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think of the actual formula. The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the sphere that the planet's orbital plane presents to us. Or maybe it's the ratio of the star's area to some other area. Alternatively, the transit probability is proportional to (R_*/a)^2 multiplied by the probability that the inclination is just right.

Wait, perhaps the more precise formula is P = (2 * R_* )/(c * a) ), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, I think the probability is (R_*/a)^2 * (some factor involving the star's radius and the planet's orbital distance). Hmm. Wait, another approach: for a given system, the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits is (R_* / a) * (R_p / R_*). Wait, that would be (R_p / a) times (R_* / R_* ), which simplifies to R_p/a, but that can't be right because R_p is much smaller than R_*, so R_p/a is small, but the probability shouldn't be that small. Hmm.

Alternatively, the transit probability is (R_p
