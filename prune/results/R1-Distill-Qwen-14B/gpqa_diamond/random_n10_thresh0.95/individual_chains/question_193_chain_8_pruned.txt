Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So the formula is N ∝ 1/plx^5. They're asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula I recall is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So if the distance increases, the parallax decreases. So plx is proportional to 1/r, where r is the distance.

But wait, the number of stars N varies as 1/plx^5. So substituting plx with 1/r, because plx = 1/r. Let's see: 1/( (1/r) )^5 would be r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's think about it.

The number of stars is given as a function of parallax. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/r, substituting, N ∝ r^5. So as r increases, N increases as r^5.

But wait, the question asks how the number changes with distance, per unit range. Oh, wait, that might be about the rate of change. Like, dN/dr, the derivative of N with respect to r.

So N is proportional to r^5. So dN/dr would be proportional to 5 r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance would go as r^4. But wait, the options given are A to D, looking for how the number changes with distance. Or wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So maybe they're asking about the density, like the number per unit volume or something, but perhaps they just want the relationship between N and r, and the options are all about the dependence on r.

Wait, the given proportionality is N ∝ 1 / plx^5. Plx in terms of r is plx = 1/r. So 1/( (1/r)^5 ) is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So if you double the distance, the number of stars increases by a factor of 32, since 2^5 is 32. But the question is about how the number changes with distance, but per unit range.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again.

The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is some constant.

But plx is 1/r, so substituting, N = k * (r)^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So as r increases, N increases as r^5. So looking at the options, option B is r^5.

But wait, the question says "how does
