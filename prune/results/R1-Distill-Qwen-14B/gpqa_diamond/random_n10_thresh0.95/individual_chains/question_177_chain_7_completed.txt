--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember something about black body radiation and the peak wavelength. Oh right, Wien's Law! The peak wavelength λ is inversely proportional to the temperature, λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. That's an important point.

The astronomers also measured their radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, meaning it's not moving towards or away from us, so its Doppler shift is zero. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right! The Doppler effect would shift the wavelengths they emit. But wait, the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So maybe the observed wavelengths are the same, but the actual emitted wavelengths might differ before any Doppler shift is applied. Or perhaps the velocities are causing a shift that adjusts the peak wavelengths to be the same as observed. Hmm, not entirely sure about that part. Maybe I should set that aside for now and focus on the luminosity calculation.

The question asks about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies. So, I remember the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which says L = 4πR²σT⁴. So luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power.

Wait, but I thought the temperatures are the same because their peak wavelengths are the same. But wait, no, because the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength. Oh, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think again.

If Star_2 is moving towards or away from us, its emitted wavelengths are Doppler shifted. Since Star_1's radial velocity is zero, its observed peak wavelength is λ1, and Star_2's observed λ2 is different. But the problem states that both have the same observed wavelengths at brightest. So Star_2's emission must have a peak wavelength that, when shifted due to its radial velocity, equals Star_1's peak wavelength.

Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me clarify: The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ is the same for both. But the actual emission peak might be different because of their velocities.

Alternatively, perhaps the stars' rest wavelengths are the same, and their velocities cause a shift, but in this case, their observed wavelengths are same because the shifts balance. Hmm, I'm not sure, but maybe I can proceed without considering the Doppler shift for the temperature. Let me think: If both stars have the same observed peak wavelength, then their temperatures (as observed) would be the same. But because Star_2 is moving, its actual temperature could be different. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Wait, alternative approach: Let's model the problem. Assume that the observed maximum wavelengths λ1 and λ2 are the same. But the stars' actual temperatures could differ because of their velocities. So, using Doppler shift, we can find their actual temperatures. Then, using their actual temperatures and radii, compute their luminosities.

Wait, but Doppler shift for wavelength is given by λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r)/ (1 - v_r) ) for non-relativistic speeds, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, the Doppler effect formula is often approximated as λ_observed ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity (if v is much less than c). But since v is 700 km/s, which is about 0.23% the speed of light (c is ~3e5 km/s), maybe the approximation is okay.

Wait, but another approach: The observed wavelength is the rest wavelength multiplied by (1 + z), where z is the redshift. For small z, z ≈ v/c. But for the observed wavelength to be the same, the Doppler shifts must cancel out any difference in rest wavelengths.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about whether the problem requires considering the Doppler shift for the temperature.

Wait the problem says that the stars radiate as black bodies, so their luminosity depends on their actual (intrinsic) temperature and radius, not the observed. So maybe the observed maximum wavelength isn't the same as the actual emitted wavelength because of Doppler shift, but the problem says that the observed maximum wavelengths are the same. So we can use that to find the actual temperatures.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants me to ignore the Doppler effect and just proceed with the given data. But the question does mention the radial velocities, so I probably can't ignore it.

Wait, maybe the radial velocities affect the observed temperature, but for calculating luminosity, we use the intrinsic (rest) temperature. Hmm, that makes sense because luminosity is an intrinsic property, not an observed one. So perhaps the observed maximum wavelength is the same, but the actual emitted wavelengths (and hence the temperatures) could be different due to Doppler shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the Doppler effect doesn't affect the conclusion, but I'm not sure. Let me think of the steps.

First, the maximum observed wavelength for each star is the same. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

In terms of their rest wavelengths, λ1_rest and λ2_rest, the Doppler formula would relate them to their velocities.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Wait, no, I think for radial velocity, the approximate formula (for small v) is λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/c), where v is positive for moving away.

Wait, but the problem states that Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, but in which direction? The problem says Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s, but Star_1's is zero. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, the observed wavelength would be blueshifted (shorter λ), and if moving away, redshifted (longer λ).

But the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same, so perhaps the Doppler shifts adjust their actual emitted wavelengths such that the observed is same.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the Doppler effect to find the actual temperatures, but I'm not certain.

Let me outline the steps I think are needed:

1. Find the actual temperatures of the stars, considering their Doppler shifts. Since the observed wavelengths are the same, we can set up an equation.

2. Use the Stefan-Boltzmann law to find the luminosities based on their actual radii and temperatures.

3. Compute the ratio L1/L2.

So let's start with step 1.

Let me denote:

For Star 1:

- R1 = 1.5 R2
- M1 = 1.5 M2
- v1 = 0 km/s
- λ1_obs = λ_obs (same as Star_2's observed wavelength)

For Star 2:

- R2 = R2
- M2 = M2
- v2 = 700 km/s
- λ2_obs = λ_obs

So the observed wavelengths are the same. Now, the actual emitted wavelengths (λ_rest) would be different due to Doppler shifts.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Wait, no, more accurately, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving with velocity v (radial) is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift.

And the redshift z is given by (1 + z) = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) when the source is moving away. If the source is moving towards us, v is negative, and (1 + z) becomes less than 1, which is a blueshift.

But for small velocities, z ≈ v/c.

So, for Star_1, v1=0, so λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 (since no Doppler shift).

For Star_2, v2=700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away (so v is positive). Then, λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + z2) ≈ λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c).

But according to the problem, λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So:

λ_rest1 = λ_obs1 (since v1=0)

λ_rest2 = λ_obs2 / (1 + v2/c) ≈ λ_obs1 / (1 + v2/c)

But wait, I'm not sure about the direction of the velocity. If Star_2 is moving towards us, v would be negative, so (1 + v/c) would be less than 1, leading to a blueshift. But since the observed λ is the same as Star_1, which has no shift, we can figure out if Star_2 is moving towards or away.

Wait, let's think. Suppose Star_2 is moving towards us. Then, λ_obs2 would be less than λ_rest2. But since Star_1 has λ_obs1 = λ_rest1, if Star_2's λ_obs is the same as Star_1's, that would imply λ_rest2 is longer than λ_obs2. So, λ_rest2 = λ_obs2 / (1 - v2/c), since it's approaching. Let me think of the Doppler formula again.

Wait, the correct Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer is:

λ_obs = λ_rest / (1 + v/c)

Because when the source is moving towards you, the observed wavelength is shorter (blueshifted).

Alternatively, when moving away, λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c).

Wait, perhaps using the relativistic Doppler effect formula, but for small velocities, we can approximate.

So, for Star_2:

If Star_2 is moving towards us, then its observed wavelength is λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 / (1 + v2/c)

If moving away, λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c)

But the problem says that λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

Star_1 has λ_rest1 = λ_obs1 (since v1=0)

So, for Star_2, if it's moving away:

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c) = λ_obs1

So λ_rest2 = λ_obs1 / (1 + v2/c)

But if moving towards:

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 / (1 + v2/c) = λ_obs1

So λ_rest2 = λ_obs1 * (1 + v2/c)

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the direction of the velocity, just that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. I think radial velocity is positive when moving away, but maybe it depends on convention.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem states that Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, but we don't know direction. Hmm, but in any case, the observed wavelength depends on whether it's moving towards or away, so I think I need to figure out the sign.

Wait, but in the given problem, the observed wavelengths are the same. So Star_2's rest wavelength must be different from Star_1's. Let me think: if Star_2 is moving away, then λ_rest2 = λ_obs1 / (1 + v2/c). If Star_2 is moving towards, λ_rest2 = λ_obs1 * (1 + v2/c). Since v is 700 km/s, which is positive if moving away, negative otherwise.

But the problem says Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s. So I think that implies it's moving away, so v2 is positive. So we'll take v2 as positive and moving away.

So, Star_2's rest wavelength λ_rest2 = λ_obs1 / (1 + v2/c)

But since for Star_1, λ_rest1 = λ_obs1, the problem states that their observed wavelengths are the same, so λ_rest1 and λ_rest2 are different.

But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. I think that refers to the observed wavelengths, which are the same. So, the actual emitted wavelengths (rest) are different, but after Doppler shift, they appear the same.

Now, since both stars are black bodies, their rest temperatures are related to their rest wavelengths via Wien's law. So for each star,

λ_rest = b / T_rest

Where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898e-3 m·K).

So, T_rest1 = b / λ_rest1 = b / λ_obs1

T_rest2 = b / λ_rest2 = b / (λ_obs1 / (1 + v2/c)) ) ) = (b * (1 + v2/c)) ) / λ_obs1

Wait, substituting λ_rest2:

λ_rest2 = λ_obs1 / (1 + v2/c )

So, T_rest2 = (b) / λ_rest2 = (b) * (1 + v2/c) / λ_obs1 

But T_rest1 = b / λ_obs1

So T_rest2 = (1 + v2/c ) * T_rest1

Since v2 is positive (moving away), (1 + v2/c) is larger than 1, so T_rest2 > T_rest1.

But wait, let me think again. If Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted. So the observed wavelength is longer than the rest wavelength. But in our case, the observed wavelength is the same as Star_1's. So Star_2's rest wavelength must be shorter (since it's moving away and λ_obs is same as Star_1's λ_rest.

Wait, let me double-check with numbers.

Suppose Star_1 has λ_rest = 500 nm, and Star_2 is moving away with v=700 km/s. Then, λ_obs for Star_2 would be 500 nm * (1 + 700e3 / (3e5) ) ≈ 500 * (1 + 0.002333) ≈ 501.1665 nm. So the observed would be longer, but the problem says the observed λ is same as Star_1, which is 500 nm. So for Star_2, λ_obs = 500 nm. So λ_rest2 = 500 / (1 + 0.002333) ≈ 498.784 nm.

So Star_2's rest wavelength is shorter than Star_1's, which makes sense because it's moving away, so the rest wavelength must be shorter to have the same observed wavelength.

So, with that in mind, the temperatures would be:

T_rest1 = b / λ_rest1 = b / 500e-9 m.

T_rest2 = b / (498.784e-9 m) ≈ (500e-9 / 498.784e-9) ) * T_rest1 ≈ 1.00246 * T_rest1.

So T_rest2 is a bit higher than T_rest1.

Wait, but in this case, the rest temperature of Star_2 is higher than that of Star_1. So when we compute luminosity, which depends on radius and temperature^4, we can find the ratio.

Now, using the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

The ratio L1/L2 is (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4 )

Given R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5.

So R1²/R2² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

Now, T1 and T2 are T_rest1 and T_rest2.

From earlier, T_rest2 = T_rest1 * (1 + v2/c )

But wait, the earlier calculation showed T_rest2 = (1 + v2/c ) * T_rest1 ?

Wait no, let me re-express the temperature relation.

From the Doppler shift, λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c )

So, λ_rest = λ_obs / (1 + v/c )

Since T_rest = b / λ_rest = b (1 + v/c ) / λ_obs

But for Star_1, T_rest1 = b / λ_obs.

So T_rest2 = (1 + v/c ) * T_rest1.

Hmm, that's correct.

So, substituting into L1/L2:

L1/L2 = ( (R1² / R2²) ) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= ( (1.5)^2 ) * ( T1^4 / ( (1.5 T1 )^4 ) )

Wait, wait, no. Earlier calculation said T_rest2 = (1 + v/c ) * T_rest1.

Wait, v2 is 700 km/s, so v = 700,000 m/s.

c is 3e5 km/s, or 3e8 m/s. So v/c = 700000 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.002333.

So (1 + v/c ) ≈ 1.002333.

Therefore, T_rest2 = 1.002333 * T_rest1.

So T_rest2 / T_rest1 = 1.002333.

So T_rest2 = 1.002333 T_rest1.

So, putting it all into the luminosity ratio:

L1/L2 = ( (1.5)^2 ) * ( T1^4 / (T_rest2^4) )

Wait, no. Let's see:

L1 = 4pi R1^2 sigma T_rest1^4

L2 = 4pi R2^2 sigma T_rest2^4

So, L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T_rest1^4 / T_rest2^4 )

= ( (1.5)^2 ) * ( (T_rest1) / (T_rest2) )^4

= 2.25 * ( 1 / (1.002333)^4 )

Hmm, wait, so because T_rest2 is higher than T_rest1, that term would be less than 1, which would mean L1 is less than L2. But the problem says that the computed luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2's by a factor, meaning the ratio L1/L2 is greater than 1.

Wait, that's conflicting. Did I make a mistake in the temperature calculation?

Wait, no. Because if Star_2 is moving away, its rest wavelength is shorter, leading to higher temperature. So T_rest2 > T_rest1.

Hence, in the luminosity ratio, L1/L2 = (2.25) * (T_rest1 / T_rest2)^4.

Since T_rest1 < T_rest2, the term (T_rest1 / T_rest2) is less than 1, which would make L1/L2 less than 2.25. But the problem states that Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Wait, perhaps I have an error in the direction of the Doppler shift? Let me think again.

If Star_2 is moving towards us, then its observed wavelength is shorter than its rest wavelength. So λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 - v/c ). So in that case, if the observed λ is same as Star_1, which is λ_obs = λ_rest1 = λ_rest_star1.

So, λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 - v/c )

Since λ_obs2 = λ_rest1,

λ_rest2 = λ_rest1 / (1 - v/c )

So, T_rest2 = b / λ_rest2 = b (1 - v/c ) / λ_rest1 = (1 - v/c ) * (b / λ_rest1 ) = (1 - v/c ) * T_rest1.

So, T_rest2 = (1 - v/c ) * T_rest1.

Now, since v is positive (700 km/s), (1 - v/c ) is (1 - 0.002333) = 0.997667.

So, T_rest2 = 0.997667 * T_rest1.

So in this case, T_rest2 is lower than T_rest1.

Now, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 becomes:

(1.5^2) * ( T_rest1^4 / T_rest2^4 )

= 2.25 * ( 1 / (0.997667)^4 )

Compute (0.997667)^4.

Approximating, since x is small, (1 - x)^n ≈ 1 - nx. But let's compute it accurately.

0.997667 is approximately 1 - 0.002333.

So, let's compute (0.997667)^4.

Let me compute it step by step.

First, compute 0.997667^2:

0.997667 * 0.997667 = ?

Well,

= (1 - 0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 - 2 * 0.002333 + (0.002333)^2

≈ 1 - 0.004666 + 0.0000054

≈ 0.995339.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

0.997667 * 0.997667:

= (approx) 0.997667 * 0.997667.

Let me compute 0.997667 * 0.997667:

= (1 - 0.002333)^2 = 1 - 2*(0.002333) + (0.002333)^2.

= 1 - 0.004666 + 0.0000054

= 0.99534 approx.

So, 0.997667^2 ≈ 0.99534.

Then, 0.99534^2 would be (0.99534)^2.

Again, (1 - 0.00466)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00466 + (0.00466)^2.

= 1 - 0.00932 + 0.0000217.

≈ 0.99069.

So, 0.997667^4 ≈ 0.99069.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approximation, but I'm proceeding as if I don't have one.

So, 0.997667^4 ≈ ~0.9907.

So, 1 / (0.997667^4 ) ≈ 1 / 0.9907 ≈ 1.0094.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.0094 ≈ 2.25 * 1.0094 ≈ 2.270.

Looking at the options, option B is ~2.32, C is ~2.35, D is ~2.23.

Hmm, 2.27 is close to option D (2.23), but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps my approximation is a bit off.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate ( (1 - v/c ) )^4 more accurately.

v = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

v/c = 700,000 / 3e8 = 7 / 300 ≈ 0.023333.

Wait, wait, no. 700,000 / 3e8 = 0.00233333...

So, 1 - v/c = 0.997666666...

So, (0.9976667)^4.

Let me compute this more precisely.

0.9976667^1 = 0.9976667

^2 = 0.9976667 * 0.9976667.

= (approx) 0.995339.

Then,

(0.995339)^2 = ?

0.995339 * 0.995339.

Compute:

= (1 - 0.004661)^2 

= 1 - 2*0.004661 + (0.004661)^2

= 1 - 0.009322 + 0.0000217

= 0.9906987.

So, 0.9976667^4 ≈ 0.9906987.

Thus, 1/(0.9906987) = approx 1.00943.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00943 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00943.

Compute 2.25 * 1.00943.

2.25 * 1 = 2.25.

2.25 * 0.00943 ≈ 0.0212775.

So total is about 2.2712775.

Looking at the options, option B is ~2.32, option D is ~2.23.

Hmm, 2.27 is between B and D. Hmm.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of the velocity. If Star_2 is moving towards us, then (1 - v/c) is (1 - 0.002333) = 0.997667.

But let me think about the temperature again. If Star_2 is moving towards us, its rest wavelength is longer than the observed wavelength. Because when moving towards, the emitted light is blueshifted, so observed λ is shorter. So, λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 - v/c ), which is smaller than λ_rest.

Wait, but if Star_2's observed wavelength is the same as Star_1's, which is its rest wavelength.

So, λ_obs = λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 - v/c )

=> λ_rest2 = λ_rest1 / (1 - v/c )

So, λ_rest2 > λ_rest1 → since (1 - v/c ) < 1.

Thus, T_rest2 = b / λ_rest2 < b / λ_rest1 = T_rest1.

So, T_rest2 < T_rest1.

So, the ratio L1/L2 = ( (R1/R2)^2 ) * ( T1 / T2 )^4.

= (1.5^2) * ( T1 / T2 )^4.

= 2.25 * (1/(0.997667))^4.

Which we calculated as 2.25 * 1.0094 ≈ 2.271.

But the options don't have this exact value. The closest option is B) ~2.32 and D) ~2.23.

Wait, perhaps my approximation of (0.997667)^4 is too rough. Let me compute it more accurately.

We can compute (0.997667)^4.

Let me compute it step by step:

0.997667^2 = ?

Let me compute 0.997667 * 0.997667.

= (1 - 0.002333) * (1 - 0.002333)

= 1 - 2 * 0.002333 + (0.002333)^2

= 1 - 0.004666 + 0.0000054

= 0.9953394.

Now, 0.9953394^2 = ?

Again,

(0.9953394)^2 = (1 - 0.0046606)^2

= 1 - 2*0.0046606 + (0.0046606)^2

= 1 - 0.0093212 + (0.0000217)

= 0.9906985.

So, (0.997667)^4 ≈ 0.9906985.

So, 1/(0.9906985) ≈ 1.00943.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00943 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00943 = ?

Let me compute this precisely.

2.25 * 1.00943:

= 2.25 * (1 + 0.00943 )

= 2.25 + 2.25 * 0.00943

= 2.25 + (0.0212625 )

= 2.2712625.

So approximately 2.271.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which is a bit lower, and option B is ~2.32, which is higher.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps the actual calculation requires more precise computation of (1 - v/c )^4.

Let me compute (1 - v/c ) more accurately.

v/c = 700,000 / 3e5,000 = 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.002333333.

So, (1 - v/c ) = 0.997666667.

So, (0.997666667)^4.

Let me compute it using more precise steps.

Compute x = 0.997666667.

x^2 = 0.997666667 * 0.997666667.

Compute:

0.997666667 * 0.997666667 = ?

Let me compute it as (1 - 0.002333333)^2.

= 1 - 2 * 0.002333333 + (0.002333333)^2.

= 1 - 0.004666666 + (0.000005444).

= 0.995333334 + 0.000005444.

= 0.995338778.

Then, x^4 = (x^2)^2 = (0.995338778)^2.

Again, compute (0.995338778)^2.

= (1 - 0.004661222)^2.

= 1 - 2 * 0.004661222 + (0.004661222)^2.

= 1 - 0.009322444 + (0.000021733).

= 0.990677556 + 0.000021733.

= 0.990699289.

So, x^4 ≈ 0.990699289.

Therefore, 1/x^4 = 1/0.990699289 ≈ 1.00943.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00943 ≈ 2.271.

But none of the options exactly match this. The available options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the velocity affects the observed luminosity due to Doppler beaming or something else. Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require considering the Doppler shift, but that can't be right because the problem states that the radial velocities are given.

Alternatively, perhaps I should ignore the Doppler shift for the temperature and only consider the radius. But that would give L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, which is option A. But the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same, implying that the Doppler shift affects the temperatures, so I can't ignore it.

Wait, but perhaps I have a calculation mistake. Let me recompute:

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

But T2 = T1 * (1 - v/c )

Wait, no, earlier I thought that when Star_2 is moving towards us, T_rest2 = T_rest1 * (1 - v/c ), but wait no. Wait, let me correct that.

Wait, the Doppler shift equation for wavelength relates λ_obs and λ_rest.

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) for non-relativistic speeds, but perhaps using the approximation λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v/c ) when the source is moving away.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider the relativistic Doppler shift formula.

The formula is: λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r / c ) / (1 - v_r / c ) )

Where v_r is the radial velocity.

Assuming v_r is positive when moving away.

So, for Star_2, λ_obs = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c ) / (1 - v2/c ) )

But λ_obs = λ_rest1.

So,

λ_rest2 = λ_rest1 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c ) / (1 + v2/c ) )

Because λ_obs = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c )/(1 - v2/c ) ) = λ_rest1.

So,

λ_rest2 = λ_rest1 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c ) / (1 + v2/c ) )

Thus,

T_rest2 = b / λ_rest2 = b / ( λ_rest1 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c )/(1 + v2/c) ) ) )

= (b / λ_rest1 ) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c ) / (1 - v2/c ) )

= T_rest1 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c ) / (1 - v2/c ) )

Hmm, that's a bit more complicated. So, T_rest2 = T_rest1 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c ) )

Which can be rewritten as:

T_rest2 = T_rest1 * sqrt( (1 + x ) / (1 - x ) ), where x = v2/c = 700e3 / 3e5 = 700,000 / 300,000 = 7/3 = 2.333...e-3.

Wait, no, 700,000 is 7e5, and 3e5 is 300,000. So 7e5 / 3e5 = 7/3 ≈ 2.3333. So x = 0.0023333.

So,

(1 + x ) ≈ 1.0023333.

(1 - x ) ≈ 0.9976667.

So,

(1 + x ) / (1 - x ) ≈ 1.0023333 / 0.9976667 ≈ 1.004667.

So, sqrt(1.004667 ) ≈ 1.00233.

So,

T_rest2 ≈ T_rest1 * 1.00233.

So,

T_rest2 / T_rest1 ≈ 1.00233.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1 / T2 )^4.

= (1.5)^2 * (1 / 1.00233 )^4.

= 2.25 * ( (1 / 1.00233 ) )^4.

Compute (1 / 1.00233 )^4.

Approximate:

1/1.00233 ≈ 0.99767.

(0.99767 )^2 = approx 0.99534.

Then, (0.99534 )^2 ≈ 0.99069.

So,

(1/1.00233 )^4 ≈ 0.99069.

Thus,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99069 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99069 ≈ 2.2275.

Which is approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

So the answer should be D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(L\) is luminosity, \(R\) is radius, \(T\) is temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
The problem states that \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\). Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The stars are blackbodies, and their peak wavelengths are related to their temperatures via Wien's law:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

where \(b\) is Wien's displacement constant. The problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same (\(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\)). However, due to the Doppler effect, the rest wavelengths of the stars differ. The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]

For Star_2, which has a radial velocity \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\), the rest wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,2}} = \lambda_{\text{obs}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}}
\]

Substituting \(v/c = 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 0.002333\), we find:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,2}} = \lambda_{\text{obs}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - 0.002333}{1 + 0.002333}} = \lambda_{\text{obs}} \sqrt{0.997667 / 1.002333} \approx \lambda_{\text{obs}} \cdot 0.997667
\]

Thus, the rest wavelength of Star_2 is slightly shorter than that of Star_1. Using Wien's law, the temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{rest,1}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest,2}}} = \frac{1}{0.997667} \approx 1.00233
\]

### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
Substituting into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = 2.25 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{1.00233}\right)^4
\]

First, compute \((1 / 1.00233)^4\). Approximating:

\[
\frac{1}{1.00233} \approx 0.99767, \quad (0.99767)^2 \approx 0.99534, \quad (0.99534)^2 \approx 0.9907
\]

Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{1.00233}\right)^4 \approx 0.9907
\]

Now:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.2275
\]

### Step 4: Final Answer
The computed ratio \(L_1 / L_2 \approx 2.23\), which matches option D.
