Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants (also called formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the value, the more the complex will form.

The question is asking about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ions attached, right? So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^n+ or something like that. But wait, the problem gives me four stability constants: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I think βn represents the formation constant for the nth complex. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^(?), and so on up to β4 for maybe [Co(SCN)_4]^something.

Wait, the stability constants are cumulative, right? Like, each βn is the constant for the nth step of complex formation. Or maybe it's the overall constant for the complex with n ligands. I need to clarify that.

Wait, stability constants are usually given for the overall formation of the complex. So for [Co(SCN)]^+, β1 would be 9. For [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+?), β2 is 40, and so on. Or wait, maybe each β is for the stepwise addition. No, wait, no, I think for the overall complex. So the first complex is [CoSCN]^+, with β1=9. The second is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ with β2=40. Wait, no, that can't be because β3 is higher than β2. Wait, the question says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." Hmm, so maybe the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^-2, [Co(SCN)_4]^-3? Because Co^2+ would have charges compensated by the added SCN-.

Wait, cobalt(II) is Co²+. Each SCN- is -1. So the complexes would have varying charges based on the number of SCN- attached.

Wait, the first complex [Co(SCN)]^+ would be Co²+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+, so the overall charge is +1. The second complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0 because 2 SCN- (each -1) plus Co²+ gives 0 charge. The third would be [Co(SCN)_3]^-2: Co²+ plus 3 SCN- gives 3*(-1) + 2+ = 3*(-1) + 2 = -1? Wait, no: 2+ plus 3*(-1) = 2 -3 = -1. So [Co(SCN)_3]^-. The fourth would be [Co(SCN)_4]^-3: 2+ plus 4*(-1) = 2-4 = -2. So [Co(SCN)_4]^-2. Wait, but the β4 is 16. Hmmm.

Wait, but I might be getting the charges wrong. Maybe the first complex is [CoSCN]^+ (charge +1), second [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (charge 0), third [Co(SCN)_3]^- (charge -1), and fourth [Co(SCN)_4]^-2 (charge -2). So the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, but the problem says "dithiocyanato" which is two SCN- ions. So that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex, which has β2=40. The question is about the percentage of this complex among all cobalt species.

The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. We need to calculate the distribution of Co²+ among all possible complexes, and find what percentage is in the dithiocyanato form.

So, the species present are:

1. Free Co²+.
2. [CoSCN]^+ (monodentate, β1=9)
3. [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (dithiocyanato, β2=40)
4. [Co(SCN)_3]^- (β3=63)
5. [Co(SCN)_4]^-2 (β4=16)

Wait, but wait, the stability constants are for each complex. So the overall formation constants would be:

For [CoSCN]^+ → K1 = β1 = 9.

For [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → K2 = β2 =40.

Wait, no, wait, the way stability constants work is that each step is a stepwise addition. So K1 is for Co²+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+ (β1=9).

K2 is [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (β2=40).

K3 is [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_3]^- (β3=63).

K4 is [Co(SCN)_3]^- + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_4]^-2 (β4=16).

Wait, but that's the stepwise formation constants. So the overall β (formation constant) for [Co(SCN)_n] is the product of K1*K2*...*Kn.

Wait, no, no. Wait, in the problem statement, the β's are given as the stability constants for each complex. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^-2. So each βn is the overall formation constant for the nth complex, not stepwise.

So, the formation constants are:

β1 = [ [CoSCN]^+ ] / ( [Co²+][SCN^-] ) =9.

β2 = [ [Co(SCN)_2]^0 ] / ( [Co²+][SCN^-]^2 )=40.

β3= [ [Co(SCN)_3]^- ] / ( [Co²+][SCN^-]^3 )=63.

β4= [ [Co(SCN)_4]^-2 ] / ( [Co²+][SCN^-]^4 )=16.

Wait, but [Co(SCN)_4]^-2 would have a charge of -2, so in solution, it would require counterions, but for the purpose of calculating concentrations, we can ignore them.

So, the idea is to find the fraction of Co²+ that is in each complex, given the concentrations of Co²+ and SCN^-.

But wait, what does the problem say about the total Co concentration? It says c(Co) = 1e-2 M. So the sum of all Co species is 1e-2 M.

Wait, but SCN^- is 0.1 M.

So, to find the fraction in the dithiocyanato form (the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex), let's denote the concentrations.

Let me denote the free Co²+ as [Co²+] = x.

Then, the concentration of each complex is as follows:

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 * [Co²+][SCN^-] = 9 * x * (0.1) = 0.9 x.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 * [Co²+][SCN^-]^2 = 40 * x * (0.1)^2 = 40 x (0.01) = 0.4 x.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 * [Co²+][SCN^-]^3 =63 x (0.1)^3 =63 x * 0.001 = 0.063 x.

[Co(SCN)_4]^-2= β4 * [Co²+][SCN^-]^4 =16 x (0.1)^4 =16 x * 0.0001= 0.0016 x.

Also, there's the possibility of other species, but I think that's all for n=1,2,3,4.

The total Co species are [Co²+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^-2 = x + 0.9x + 0.4x +0.063x +0.0016x.

Wait, summing them:

x + 0.9x =1.9x

+0.4x → 2.3x

+.063x → 2.363x

+.0016x→ 2.3646 x.

So total is 2.3646 x = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

So x = (1e-2) / 2.3646 ≈ 1e-2 / ~2.3646 ≈ approximately 4.226e-3 M.

Wait, let me compute 2.3646 exactly.

Wait 2.3646 is approximately 2.3646.

So x = 1e-2 / 2.3646.

Let me compute that.

So 1e-2 = 0.01.

0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004226 M.

So [Co²+] = x ≈ 0.004226 M.

Now, the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0 = 0.4 x = 0.4 * 0.004226 ≈ 0.0016904 M.

The total cobalt species is 0.01 M, so the fraction is (0.0016904) / 0.01 = 0.16904, which is ~16.904%.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, which would seem to fit.

But wait, let me double-check the approach.

Wait, the setup assumes that each βn is the overall formation constant for the nth complex.

Wait, but another possibility is that βn represents the stepwise formation constant, so the overall formation constant for the nth complex is the product of β1*β2*...*βn.

But in the problem statement, it says the stability constants of the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. That suggests each βn is the overall constant for that specific complex. So for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β2=40, which is the overall formation constant, not stepwise.

So the approach I took is correct.

So the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is 0.4 x, which when x is 0.004226 M, becomes ~0.00169 M.

Percentage: (0.00169 / 0.01) *100% = 16.9%.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, which is the answer. But wait, another thought: what if the complexes are treated with stepwise formation constants? Because sometimes, in some textbooks, βn is the stepwise constant.

Wait, that's where I could have gone wrong. Let me think again.

If β1 is the stepwise constant: Co²+ + SCN^- ⇌ [CoSCN]^+; K1=β1=9.

β2 is the stepwise constant for [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_2]^0; K2=40.

Then, the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 would be K1*K2=9*40=360.

Similarly, the overall for [Co(SCN)_3]^- is K1*K2*K3=9*40*63=2520.

And for [Co(SCN)_4]^-2, K1*K2*K3*K4=9*40*63*16=362880.

Wait, that's a huge β, which would make the [Co(SCN)_4] species dominant.

But in the problem statement, the given β's are for each complex, not stepwise. So if the given β's are stepwise, I need to approach it differently.

But wait, the problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." Hmm. So each βn is for each complex. So β1 is the stability constant for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc.

Wait, but that would imply that the stability constants are for each complex, so [CoSCN]^+ has β1=9, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 has β2=40, etc.

So my initial approach is correct.

So the calculation gives about 16.9%, which is option D.

But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So option D) 16.9% would be the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing: do all the complexes sum to a total of 1e-2 M?

In my calculations, I computed x as (sum of all species) =1e-2.

So the sum is [Co²+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^-2 = x + 0.9x +0.4x +0.063x +0.0016x = 2.3646x.

Set equal to 0.01 M.

So x=0.01 /2.3646 ≈0.004226.

Thus, the concentration of dithiocyanato is 0.4 x =0.4 *0.004226≈0.0016904.

So fraction is 0.0016904 /0.01 =0.16904 →16.904%, which is approximately 16.9%, option D.

So the correct answer would be D) 16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]^0) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species based on the given stability constants (β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16), total cobalt concentration ([Co²+]) = 10⁻² M, and thiocyanate concentration ([SCN⁻]) = 0.1 M.

### Key Steps:
1. **Stability Constants and Complex Formation**:
   - The stability constants (β) represent the overall formation constants for the complexes:
     - β1 = 9 for [CoSCN]^+.
     - β2 = 40 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0.
     - β3 = 63 for [Co(SCN)_3]^-.
     - β4 = 16 for [Co(SCN)_4]^-2.

2. **Concentration of Each Complex**:
   Using the general formula for complex formation:
   \[
   [\text{Complex}] = \beta \cdot [\text{Co}^{2+}] \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^n
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of SCN⁻ ions in the complex, the concentrations of the complexes are:
   - \([CoSCN]^+\): \( 9 \cdot x \cdot 0.1 = 0.9x\),
   - \([Co(SCN)_2]^0\): \( 40 \cdot x \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4x\),
   - \([Co(SCN)_3]^\-\): \( 63 \cdot x \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063x\),
   - \([Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}\): \( 16 \cdot x \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016x\).

3. **Total Cobalt Concentration**:
   The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{CoSCN}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0] + [\text{Co(SCN)_3}^-] + [\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}] = x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = 2.3646x
   \]
   Given that the total cobalt concentration is \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \), we solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 0.004226 \, \text{M}.
   \]

4. **Concentration of Dithiocyanato Complex**:
   The concentration of the dithiocyanato complex \([Co(SCN)_2]^0\) is:
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0] = 0.4x = 0.4 \cdot 0.004226 \approx 0.0016904 \, \text{M}.
   \]

5. **Percentage of Dithiocyanato Complex**:
   The percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0]}{c(\text{Co})} \cdot 100 = \frac{0.0016904}{0.01} \cdot 100 \approx 16.9\%.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.
