Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I need to think through this. Let me start by recalling what I know about metrics and pseudospheres.

The given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a 2-dimensional metric. I remember that in general relativity, the metric describes the geometry of spacetime, and when the line element is given, you can compute various properties like area or volume.

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But wait, in 2D, a pseudosphere is often represented by something like the Poincaré disk model, which is conformally flat. The metric given here might be similar.

Let me write down the metric again. ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So this is in 2D (x and y coordinates). The function multiplying dx² and dy² is 32/(4 - x² - y²). That denominator looks like 4 - (x² + y²), so the domain of x and y must be such that 4 - (x² + y²) is positive, otherwise the metric would be imaginary. So the region is where x² + y² < 4. That makes sense because the radius r here is 2, since r² is 4.

Wait, wait. The radius of the pseudosphere is given as r=2. In the Poincaré disk model, the radius R of the disk is related to the curvature. The metric for the Poincaré disk is usually written as ds² = [4/(R² - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So in our case, the denominator is 4, which is R². So R is 2, matching the radius given. So this metric is indeed the Poincaré disk model of a pseudosphere with radius 2.

Now, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere. Wait, the Poincaré disk is a model for hyperbolic geometry, which is a pseudosphere. But wait, the area in hyperbolic geometry is different from the Euclidean case. I need to find the area of the pseudosphere, which in this case is the entire hyperbolic plane represented by this metric.

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. When it says the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2, does it refer to the entire surface or just a specific part? Or perhaps the area of the entire hyperbolic plane with this metric?

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about the metric as given. The area can be computed by integrating the area element over the entire space. The area element in 2D is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor.

Wait, the metric is diagonal here. The ds² is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So the metric tensor components are g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and g_xy = 0. So the determinant is (32/(4 - r²))^2, where r² is x² + y². But wait, the area element in 2D is just the determinant. Wait no, the determinant of the metric tensor is (32/(4 - r²))^2, but the area element is sqrt(det g) times dx dy, but since det g is already a square, sqrt(det g) would be 32/(4 - r²). Wait, no, wait, wait. For a diagonal metric, the determinant is the product of the diagonal terms. So det(g) = (32/(4 - r²)) * (32/(4 - r²)) )= (32)^2 / (4 - r²)^2. So sqrt(det g) is 32/(4 - r²) because sqrt( (32^2)/(4-r²)^2 ) is 32/(4 - r²) as long as 4 - r² is positive.

Wait, but wait, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, which is (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy. So to find the total area, I would integrate this over all x and y where x² + y² <4, which is the domain of the metric.

So the area A is the integral over x and y, where x² + y² <4, of [32/(4 - (x² + y²)) ] dx dy.

Wait, I can switch to polar coordinates because the integrand is symmetric. Let me set x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so dx dy becomes r dr dθ.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Hmm, so the area A = ∫0^{2π} dθ ∫0^2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

First compute the radial integral I = ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me make a substitution: Let u =4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → - (du)/2 = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So I = ∫ (r=0→2) [32 r/(u)] dr → 32 ∫ (u=4→0) [1/u] (-du/2)

Which is 32 * (1/2) ∫ (u=4→0) [1/u] (-du) → 32*(1/2) ∫ u=0 to4 1/u du.

Wait, flipping the limits changes the sign.

So I = 16 ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du = 16 [ ln u ] from 0 to4.

But ln u evaluated at 0 is negative infinity. Wait, so this integral diverges? That can't be right because the area of a pseudosphere in hyperbolic geometry is infinite. Because the hyperbolic plane has infinite area, right? So the area would be infinite.

Wait, but wait, the pseudosphere is a finite surface in some models? Or is it an infinite surface? Because the Poincaré disk model represents the entire hyperbolic plane, which is infinitely large. So the area should be infinite.

But let me check the integral. The integral I is 16 [ ln(4) - ln(0) ). But ln(0) is -infinity, so this suggests that the integral diverges to infinity. So the area is infinite.

Looking at the options, option D is +infty. So the answer would be D.

But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Maybe I'm confusing the entire hyperbolic plane with the pseudosphere. Wait, what's a pseudosphere in this context?

Ah, wait, I think I might have mixed up terms. A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, but in some finite volume. Wait, no, the standard pseudosphere is an infinite surface. Or perhaps the question is using a different definition.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the question is considering the metric as representing a sphere in some space, but no, the term pseudosphere usually refers to a surface with constant negative curvature, similar to a saddle shape, which has infinite area.

So integrating the area element gives an infinite area.

Looking back at the options, option D is +infty, which would be the correct answer.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D space with coordinates \(x\) and \(y\). The domain of this metric is restricted to \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), ensuring the denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) remains positive. This metric is conformally flat and resembles the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic geometry, where the radius of the disk is \(R = 2\), consistent with the given pseudosphere radius \(r = 2\).

To compute the area of the pseudosphere, we calculate the total area by integrating the area element over the entire domain. The area element in this metric is derived from the determinant of the metric tensor, which is diagonal with components \(g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\). Thus, the determinant of the metric tensor is:

\[
\det(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2,
\]

and the area element is:

\[
\sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\)), the area element becomes:

\[
\frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area \(A\) is then:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, compute the radial integral:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{32}{u} \cdot \frac{-du}{2} = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \(\int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du\) diverges because \(\ln(u)\) evaluated at \(u = 0\) is \(-\infty\). This divergence indicates that the area of the pseudosphere is infinite. Since the Poincaré disk model represents the entire hyperbolic plane, which has infinite extent, the area of the pseudosphere is indeed infinite.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
