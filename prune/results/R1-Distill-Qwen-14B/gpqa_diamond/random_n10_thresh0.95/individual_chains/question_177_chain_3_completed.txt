Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question says.

So, we've got two stars: Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger, but wait, mass might not affect luminosity directly here. Hmm.

The key points are about their luminosities. The problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh right, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. Also, their radial velocities are given, but I'm not sure how that plays into it yet. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so maybe it's at rest relative to us, while Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But wait, does radial velocity affect the luminosity? Or maybe it affects the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift, but the problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says that the astronomers found the wavelengths where the stars appeared brightest are the same. So that's the peak emission wavelength for each star. Blackbody radiation peak wavelength is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K) and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

So if the λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So if λ_1 = λ_2, then T_1 = T_2.

Wait, but wait. No, that can't be right. Because Star_1 is moving with a radial velocity of 0, so no Doppler shift, but Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. So the observed wavelength would be shifted for Star_2. Because when a star moves towards us, the light is blueshifted (shorter wavelength), and if moving away, it's redshifted (longer wavelength). So in this case, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. But which direction? The problem says 0 and 700; I guess Star_1 is stationary, Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So the observed wavelengths are the same.

Hmm, so for Star_2, its emitted peak wavelength would be different, but due to Doppler shift, the observed wavelength is the same as Star_1's. So that would mean that the intrinsic temperatures are different. Because Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength.

Wait, perhaps I should model this using the relativistic Doppler effect. So the Doppler shift formula is λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ) or something like that. But wait, the formula depends on whether the motion is towards or away. If the source is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. So if Star_2 is moving away, then its observed λ_max would be longer than its actual emitted λ_max.

Wait, but the problem says that the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So let's denote:

λ1_observed = λ2_observed.

But λ1_observed is the same as λ1_rest, since Star_1's radial velocity is 0. So λ1_rest = λ2_observed.

But λ2_observed depends on λ2_rest and the Doppler shift. So:

λ2_observed = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) )

Wait, the formula can be a bit tricky. Let me get the Doppler shift right. The relativistic Doppler shift for wavelength is:

λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But wait, if the source is moving away, v is positive. So for Star_2, if its radial velocity is 700 km/s away from us, then v is positive, and λ_observed would be longer than λ_rest.

But the problem says that the observed λ for both stars is the same. So λ1_rest = λ2_observed.

So λ2_observed = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But since λ1_rest = λ2_observed,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So λ1_rest = b / T1, λ2_rest = b / T2.

Substituting:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Simplify:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So, T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Hmm, so T1 is less than T2 if Star_2 is moving away (v positive). Alternatively, if Star_2 is moving towards us, then v is negative, and the sqrt would be greater than 1, making T1 larger than T2.

But the problem says that Star_1's radial velocity is 0, Star_2's is 700 km/s. Wait, but the sign of the radial velocity depends on the direction. If Star_2's radial velocity is +700, that means moving away from us. So v = +700 km/s.

So plugging in v = 700 km/s.

Wait, but 700 km/s is much less than the speed of light (which is about 3e5 km/s). So maybe we can use the non-relativistic approximation for Doppler shift, which is λ_observed ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/c). So for small v, sqrt((1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c)) ≈ (1 + v/c) + (1 - v/c) ?

Wait, no. Let me think. The non-relativistic Doppler shift for wavelength is approximately 1 + v/c when the source is moving away. Because when v << c, the formula sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ) can be approximated using a Taylor expansion.

Wait, let me calculate the exact expression first. Let me denote z as the redshift. Then, for a source moving away with velocity v, the redshift z is approximately v/c for small v.

Wait, but in any case, for v = 700 km/s, which is 0.00233c (since c is ~3e5 km/s), so maybe the non-relativistic approximation is sufficient.

So using the non-relativistic Doppler formula: λ_observed ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/c) for receding sources. Alternatively, if the source is moving towards us, it's (1 - v/c).

Wait, but in this case, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. The question doesn't specify direction, but in astronomy, radial velocity is often given as positive when moving away. So let's assume v is positive, moving away.

So for Star_2, λ2_observed = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c)

But λ1_rest = λ2_observed, since both stars' observed λ_max are the same.

So λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c)

But λ1_rest and λ2_rest relate to their temperatures via Wien's Law:

λ_max = b / T

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c)

Simplify,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v/c)

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c)

Wait, because T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ), but in the non-relativistic case, when v is small, sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ≈ (1 - (v^2)/(c^2)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation for small v, (1 + v/c) ≈ sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ?

Wait, I might be getting confused. Let's go back.

If the source is moving away at speed v, then the observed wavelength λ' is longer than λ. So for small v, λ' ≈ λ (1 + v/c).

So, in our case, the observed λ_max for Star_2 is λ2_observed = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c)

But the observed λ_max for Star_1 is λ1_rest, since its radial velocity is zero.

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c)

But, via Wien's Law, λ1_rest = b / T1 and λ2_rest = b / T2.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v/c )

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c )

So T1 is lower than T2 because (1 + v/c) is greater than 1.

Wait, that's a key point. So Star_1 is cooler than Star_2.

Now, moving on to the luminosity.

The luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

L = 4π R² σ T⁴

Where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So for each star,

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴

We can take the ratio L1/L2:

L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴ )

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5)^2 ) * ( T1^4 / T2^4 )

We have T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c )

So T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v/c )

Hence,

(T1 / T2)^4 = (1/(1 + v/c ))^4

Putting it together,

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * [1/(1 + v/c )]^4

Now, let's compute each part.

First, calculate (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

Now, v is 700 km/s, and c is approximately 3e5 km/s.

So v/c = 700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300000 = 0.002333...

So 1 + v/c ≈ 1.002333333.

So [1/(1 + v/c)]^4 is approximately (0.99766666)^4.

Wait, let's compute 1/(1.002333333) ≈ 0.997666666.

So (0.997666666)^4.

Alternatively, since v is small, we can expand using a binomial approximation.

(1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + nx + n(n-1)x²/2 + ... for small x.

Here, x = v/c = 0.002333, which is small.

So 1/(1 + x) ≈ 1 - x + x² - x³ + ..., so for our purposes, using up to x^2:

1/(1.002333) ≈ 0.997667 - let's just take it as approximately 0.997667.

But when raised to the 4th power:

(0.997667)^4 ≈ ?

Let me compute it step by step.

Compute 0.997667^2 first.

0.997667 * 0.997667.

Let me compute:

0.997667 * 0.997667 ≈ (1 - 0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2

= 1 - 0.004666 + 0.00000544 ≈ 0.99533944.

Then, square that result to get to the 4th power.

So 0.99533944 * 0.99533944.

Again, approximating:

(1 - 0.00466056)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00466056 + (0.00466056)^2

= 1 - 0.00932112 + 0.00002172 ≈ 0.9906986.

Wait, but that's an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to compute 0.997667^4 numerically.

Wait, 0.997667^4:

Let me calculate:

0.997667^1 = 0.997667

^2 = 0.997667 * 0.997667.

Let me compute 0.997667 * 0.997667:

= (1 - 0.002333)^2 = 1 - 2*(0.002333) + (0.002333)^2

= 1 - 0.004666 + 0.00000544

= 0.99533944.

Now, 0.99533944^2 is:

= (1 - 0.00466056)^2

= 1 - 2*(0.00466056) + (0.00466056)^2

= 1 - 0.00932112 + 0.00002172

= 0.9906986.

So approximately 0.9907.

Alternatively, using a calculator, 0.997667^4 is approximately?

Wait, maybe it's better to compute it exactly.

Let me compute 0.997667^4 using a step-by-step approach.

First, 0.997667 * 0.997667 = ?

Well, 0.997667 * 0.997667:

= (997667e-6) * (997667e-6) → but that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that (1 - x)^n ≈ e^{-nx} for small x. So perhaps n=4, x=0.002333. So (1 - x)^n ≈ e^{-n x}.

So, (1 - 0.002333)^4 ≈ e^{-4 * 0.002333} = e^{-0.009332}.

e^{-0.009332} ≈ 1 - 0.009332 + (0.009332)^2/2 - ... ≈ approximately 0.99075.

Which is about 0.99075. So that's close to the earlier calculation.

So, [1/(1 + v/c)]^4 ≈ 0.99075.

So, putting it back into L1/L2:

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99075 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99075.

Compute 2.25 * 0.99075:

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275

But 0.99075 is 0.99 + 0.00075.

So, 2.25 * 0.00075 = 0.0016875.

So total is 2.2275 + 0.0016875 ≈ 2.2291875.

So approximately 2.229.

Looking at the options:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Hmm, the calculation gives approximately 2.229, which is very close to option D (~2.23). Option A is 2.25, which would be the case if the Doppler effect was ignored (i.e., assuming T1 = T2). But since we have to account for the Doppler shift, the actual factor is slightly less than 2.25, about 2.23.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I get the Doppler effect correct? Let me think again.

Because Star_2 is moving, the observed wavelength for its maximum is longer (if moving away) or shorter (if moving towards). Wait, but according to the problem, the observed wavelengths are the same. So in our earlier analysis, we found that T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c ), which makes T1 lower than T2.

But another way to think about it: the observed λ_max for Star_2 is the same as that of Star_1. So the observed λ for Star_2 is λ_1_rest. So for Star_2, its emitted λ is shorter (if moving away), which would imply a higher temperature. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature.

Wait, wait, maybe I got the Doppler effect the other way around. Let's double-check.

If Star_2 is moving away at velocity v, then the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted wavelength. So for Star_2:

λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + v/c) (approximate for small v).

But in our case, the observed λ for Star_2 is same as Star_1's rest λ.

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_observed = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c)

So,

λ2_rest = λ1_rest / (1 + v/c )

But since λ is inversely proportional to temperature,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c )

So, T2 is higher than T1.

Wait, wait a minute! Did I get the relation backwards earlier? Because if λ2_observed = λ1_rest, and λ2_observed = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c ), then λ2_rest = λ1_rest / (1 + v/c )

Which, because λ is inversely proportional to T,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c )

So, T2 is larger than T1 by a factor of (1 + v/c )

Which changes everything!

So, earlier I said that T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c ), but that was a mistake. The correct relation is T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c )

Wait, let me rederive it.

We have:

λ1_rest = λ2_observed.

λ2_observed = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c ) (since Star_2 is moving away, so v is positive).

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c )

But,

λ1_rest = b / T1

λ2_rest = b / T2

Substituting,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v/c )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1 + v/c ) / T2

Rearranged:

T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c )

Ah, so T2 is higher than T1. So I had the earlier step wrong, which changes the result.

So, now, the luminosity ratio.

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4

So,

L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4 )

We have R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5 → (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

T2 = T1 (1 + v/c )

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c )

Thus,

T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v/c )

So,

(T1 / T2)^4 = [1/(1 + v/c )]^4.

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25) * [1/(1 + v/c )]^4

Wait, but earlier I thought the other way around, but no, because T2 is bigger.

Wait, so let me re-calculate with the correct T ratio.

v = 700 km/s, c = 3e5 km/s → v/c = 0.002333.

So,

1 + v/c ≈ 1.002333.

Thus,

[1/(1.002333)]^4 ≈ ?

As before, 1.002333 ≈ 1 + 0.002333.

So, [1/(1.002333)]^4 ≈ (0.997667)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229.

Which is approximately 2.23. So the answer is D.

But let me think again. Wait, earlier I thought that T2 is higher than T1, so when substituting into (T1/T2)^4, it's (1/(1 + v/c ))^4. So the calculation is the same as before, leading to 2.23.

Wait, but the initial mistake was in determining the T1 and T2 relation. But after correcting, the same calculation applies.

So the factor is 2.229, which rounds to approximately 2.23, which is option D.

So the answer is D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, we analyze the given data and apply the relevant physics principles.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius of Star_1: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \)
   - Mass of Star_1: \( M_1 = 1.5 M_2 \) (not directly relevant to luminosity)
   - Radial velocity of Star_1: \( v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Radial velocity of Star_2: \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)

2. **Observed Wavelengths**:
   - The observed wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same (\( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \)).

3. **Luminosity**:
   - Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: 
     \[
     L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
     \]
     where \( R \) is the radius, \( T \) is the temperature, and \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

### Step 1: Relating Temperatures Using Wien's Law
The peak wavelength of blackbody radiation is inversely proportional to temperature:
\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]
where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant. Since the observed wavelengths are the same (\( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \)), we must account for the Doppler effect for Star_2.

#### Doppler Effect:
For Star_2, moving away with velocity \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), the observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by:
\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]
For small \( v_2/c \), this simplifies to:
\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \approx \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
\]

Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \), we equate:
\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
\]

Using \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T \), we find:
\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{rest,2}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest,1}}} = \frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}
\]
Thus:
\[
T_1 = T_2 \cdot \frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}
\]

### Step 2: Luminosity Ratio
The luminosity ratio is:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]
Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_1 = T_2 \cdot \frac{1}{1 + v_2/c} \), we get:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\right)^4
\]

### Step 3: Substituting Values
- \( v_2/c = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333 \)
- \( 1 + v_2/c \approx 1.002333 \)
- \( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \)
- \( \left(\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\right)^4 \approx (0.997667)^4 \)

Using the binomial approximation for small \( v_2/c \):
\[
(0.997667)^4 \approx 0.9907
\]

Thus:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.229
\]

### Step 4: Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately \( 2.23 \) times greater than that of Star_2. The closest option is:

**Answer: D**
