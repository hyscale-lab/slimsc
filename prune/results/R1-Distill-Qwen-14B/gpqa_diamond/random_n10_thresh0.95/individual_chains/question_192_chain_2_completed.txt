Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to picture the setup. There's a spherical conductor, right? It's uncharged initially, which means it has no net charge. Inside this conductor, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity isn't at the center of the conductor; its center is shifted by a distance 's' from the conductor's center. The radius of the cavity is 'r', and since r is less than R (the radius of the conductor), the cavity is entirely inside the conductor.

Now, they placed a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Wait, but the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Oh, and l and L are both greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. Also, there's an angle theta between l and s. I think s is the vector pointing from the conductor's center to the cavity's center, so theta is the angle between that and the vector from the cavity's center to P.

I remember that conductors have some properties when it comes to charges. Since the conductor is uncharged, any charge inside would induce charges on the surfaces. When a charge is inside a cavity of a conductor, it induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor. But wait, the conductor itself was uncharged, so the inner surface would have a charge of -q, and to balance that (since the conductor as a whole is neutral), the outer surface must have +q. But wait, no, wait. The initial conductor is uncharged, so the total charge must remain zero. So when +q is placed in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q. No, wait, actually, the conductor's total charge is zero. So the inner surface must have -q because the charge inside the cavity is +q, and the outer surface must have +q because the inner is -q, so the conductor's net is (-q) + (+q) = 0.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. So, the conductor is neutral. When you put a charge inside the cavity, it's like the conductor acts as if it has a charge on the inner and outer surfaces. The inner surface would have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface would have +q because the conductor's net charge is zero. So the conductor itself, as a whole, would have a net charge of +q on the outside because the inner is -q. Wait, no, because the conductor was initially neutral. So if the cavity has +q, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q, and then to keep the conductor neutral, the outer surface must have +q. Because (-q) + (+q) = 0 for the conductor.

But wait, how does this affect the electric field outside the conductor? I remember that the electric field outside a conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within. So for a point outside, the electric field would be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So in this case, the outer surface has +q. So the electric field outside would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_enclosed)/r². Wait, but in this case, the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, but the charge is on the outer surface which is spherical.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface is a sphere with radius R, right? So any point outside (like point P) would have the electric field as if the charge is at the center. So E would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², because the outer surface has +q.

But wait, the problem is more complicated because the charge inside the cavity is not at the center of the conductor. It's shifted by a distance s. So the induced charges might not be symmetric. Hmm, but wait, I think when the charge is placed inside a cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the one facing the cavity) will have an induced charge distribution. The conductor is a conductor, so the charges can move freely. So the inner surface will have a charge of -q, but the arrangement might not be uniform because the cavity's center is offset by s.

Wait, but for the induced charges, the inner surface's charge distribution would be such that the field inside the conductor (but outside the cavity) is zero. Because in electrostatics, the electric field inside a conductor must be zero. So the charges on the inner surface would arrange themselves to cancel the field due to the +q inside the cavity. So the inner surface would have a charge distribution that creates a field that cancels the +q's field inside the conductor.

But the question is about the electric field outside the conductor at point P. So, what determines the field there? The total charge on the outer surfaces of the conductor. Because once you're outside, the field depends on the total enclosed charge, regardless of where the charges are placed inside the conductor, as long as they are within.

Wait, the conductor is neutral. The inner surface has -q, the outer has +q. So the conductor's net charge is zero? No, wait no. The conductor was initially neutral. Then, the cavity has +q. The inner surface of the conductor must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. The outer surface must then have +q, so that the total conductor's charge is (-q) + (+q) = 0, so net charge is zero.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the conductor was initially neutral, the total charge after is zero. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer must have +q so that total conductor charge is (-q) + (+q) = 0.

So the outer surface has +q. So when we're outside the conductor, the electric field should be the same as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor. That would make the field at point P as (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to P.

Wait, but the options don't all have L squared. Let me look again.

Option B is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Option D is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / l², where l is the distance from the cavity's center to point P.

Wait, but if the conductor's outer surface has +q and is a sphere of radius R, then the field outside (at any point) depends only on the distance from the conductor's center. So at point P, which is at distance L from the conductor's center, the field is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So that would be option B.

But wait, why are the other options considering l and s and cos(theta)? Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

The charge +q is inside the cavity, which is not at the center of the conductor. So the conductor's inner surface would have a charge distribution that's not uniform. But the outer surface would still have a uniform distribution because it's a conductor. Wait, no, the outer surface would be a sphere, so any excess charge would distribute uniformly. So regardless of where the cavity's charge is placed inside, the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed.

Wait, but wait, is the outer surface's charge distribution affected by the inner charge's position? Or does it remain uniform?

I think the outer surface's charge distribution would be uniform because the conductor's material allows charges to move freely. The inner surface's charges are induced in such a way to cancel the field inside the conductor, but the outer surface is just a shell with charge +q, so it would distribute uniformly. Thus, the field outside should be as if all the charge is at the center.

So at point P, which is outside, the electric field should be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², which is option B.

Wait, but what if the charge distribution on the outer surface isn't uniform? Hmm, no, because for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the charges on the outer surface would distribute themselves in a way that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. So the outer surface would have a uniform distribution because it's a sphere, leading to a symmetric field outside.

So the answer should be option B.


The problem involves a spherical conductor of radius \( R \), initially uncharged, with a small spherical cavity of radius \( r \) inside. The center of the cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance \( s \). A small positive charge \( +q \) is placed inside the cavity. The goal is to determine the electric field \( \vec{E} \) at a point \( P \) outside the conductor, which is at a distance \( L \) from the center of the conductor and \( l \) from the center of the cavity. The angle between \( l \) and \( s \) is \( \theta \).

Key points to consider:

1. **Induced Charges**: When \( +q \) is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge \( -q \) on the inner surface of the conductor. To maintain the conductor's neutrality, the outer surface must have a charge \( +q \).

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For points outside the conductor, the electric field depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor. In this case, the outer surface of the conductor has a uniform charge distribution of \( +q \), as the conductor is a sphere and charges distribute symmetrically in electrostatic equilibrium.

3. **Field at Point \( P \)**: Since the outer surface has a uniform charge distribution, the electric field at point \( P \) (outside the conductor) will behave as if the charge \( +q \) is concentrated at the center of the conductor. The magnitude of the electric field is therefore given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2},
   \]
   where \( L \) is the distance from the center of the conductor to point \( P \).

4. **Rejection of Other Options**:
   - Options \( A \) and \( C \) involve \( l \) and \( s \cos\theta \), which are related to the cavity's center and the offset \( s \). However, these do not affect the electric field outside the conductor, as the field depends only on the total charge on the outer surface.
   - Option \( D \) uses \( l^2 \), which is the distance from the cavity's center to \( P \). However, the electric field outside the conductor depends on the distance \( L \) from the conductor's center, not the cavity's center.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
