Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields around conductors with cavities. Let me think through it step by step.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity isn't at the center; its center is a distance s away from the conductor's center. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is smaller than R. Now, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. I need to find the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor.

Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm. So the conductor is uncharged, but it has a cavity with a charge inside. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, I remember that charges in conductors redistribute themselves. But wait, the conductor is a conductor, so the charges would move freely. But wait, the conductor is neutral, so any induced charges must balance out.

Wait, when you have a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface must have an induced charge equal and opposite. But wait, since the conductor was uncharged, and the cavity has charge +q, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q. But then the outer surface would have +q to balance, because the total conductor is neutral. Wait no, wait, the conductor was initially neutral. Let me think again.

Wait, the conductor is uncharged, so the total charge on it is zero. When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge of -q. Because the charge inside the cavity attracts opposite charges to the inner surface. Then, since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Because the inner surface is -q, the outer must be +q. But wait, that's for a cavity with charge. But wait, in this case, the cavity isn't at the center. So the inner induced charge isn't symmetrically distributed.

Wait, but the conductor is a sphere, right? So the conductor is a sphere, the cavity is inside it but not at the center. So the inner surface of the conductor would have an induced charge distribution, but because the conductor is a sphere, perhaps the electric field outside the conductor depends
