Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, I need to figure out how much longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. Let's think this through step by step.

Alright, the setup: two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. So, the stars are identical, and the planets are same mass, but their RV shifts are different. 

The RV method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The star moves towards or away from us due to the planet's gravity. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's velocity. The formula I remember for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3) )) ) ) ) / ( ( (P/(2π)) )^(1/3) ) ) ). Wait, maybe that's a bit too complicated. Alternatively, I think the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / sqrt(a)), where a is the orbital semi-major axis. Oh wait, wait, I might be mixing things up.

Wait, another approach. The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) relates to the planet's orbital parameters. The formula I remember is K = [ (2π G) / (c P ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ). Since M_p is much less than M_star (sun-like stars and Neptune mass), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K ≈ [ (2π G) / (c P) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p) / M_star^(2/3) ). 

But wait, since both planets are around identical stars and have the same mass, M_p and M_star are the same for both. So K is inversely proportional to (P)^(1/3). Because all other terms are the same for both planets, K1 and K2 would relate to P1 and P2 as K proportional to 1/P^(1/3). 

But wait, in the problem, it's the wavelength shift that's given. Wait, the RV method measures the velocity of the star, which causes a shift in the spectral lines. The velocity is usually measured in m/s. But in this problem, the shift is given in milliangstroms. Oh right, 1 milliangstrom is 1e-3 angstrom. But how does that relate to velocity?

The Doppler shift formula relates the velocity of the star (v) to the wavelength shift (Δλ). The formula is v = (Δλ / λ) * c, where c is the speed of light. But wait, I think another way is using the relation that for small shifts, v ≈ (λ0 Δλ) / c, where λ0 is the original wavelength. Alternatively, sometimes people use v ≈ (Δλ / λ0) * c, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, let's get precise. The Doppler shift formula is (Δλ / λ) = v / c, where v is the radial velocity (the star moving towards us gives a blueshift, away gives redshift). So v = c * (Δλ / λ). But in practice, the observed shift is often given in terms of the velocity directly.

Wait, but in the problem, they're giving the shift as 5 milliangstrom and 7 milliangstrom. But without knowing the original wavelength, how can we find the velocity? Hmm, but wait, perhaps it's a relative comparison between the two planets. Because both shifts are measured in the same spectral line, which implies the same λ0 for both. So, if the same spectral line is used, the original wavelength λ0 is the same for both. So the velocity is proportional to the shift in wavelength, because v = c * (Δλ / λ0), and λ0 is the same for both measurements.

So, if planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstrom, and planet #2 has 7, then the velocities (v1 and v2) would be proportional to 5 and 7. So v2 = (7/5) v1.

Wait no, wait. The RV semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star. So K is proportional to v. So K2 = (7/5) K1.

But earlier, I thought K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/(P)^(1/3). So if K2 = (7/5) K1, then 1/(P2)^(1/3) ) = (7/5) * [1/(P1)^(1/3)] ). Wait, that can't be right, because K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), so if K2 = (7/5) K1, then (1/(P2^(1/3))) ) = (7/5) (1/(P1^(1/3)) ) ), which would imply P2^(1/3) = (5/7) P1^(1/3). Therefore, P2 = (5/7)^3 P1. Wait, but that would make P2 shorter than P1, but the question says K2 is larger than K1, so P2 would be smaller. Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer P2 is than P1. So if P2 is smaller, the ratio would be less than 1.

Wait, but let me re-examine the relation between K and P. The formula I should probably use is the RV semi-amplitude equation. The correct formula is K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2π))^(1/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(a)) )

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the formula that relates K, the orbital period, and the semi-major axis. The formula is:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(P) )^(1/3) )

Assuming M_p << M_star, which it is (Neptune's mass is ~17 Earth masses, and the star is like the Sun, which is much more massive), so M_p/M_star is negligible. So we can simplify the formula:

K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

Since M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, the only variables left are K and P. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). 

In this problem, K is the velocity semi-amplitude. The problem says that the shift for planet #1 is 5 milliangstrom, and for planet #2 it's 7. But as discussed, for the same spectral line, the velocity is proportional to the shift. So K2 = (7/5) K1.

So from K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), we have:

K1 / K2 = (P2^(1/3)) / (P1^(1/3)) )

Because K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), K1 = (1/P1^(1/3)) * C, K2 = (1/P2^(1/3)) * C, where C is a constant. So K1/K2 = P2^(1/3)/P1^(1/3)

Given that K2 = 7/5 K1,

K1/K2 = 5/7 = P2^(1/3)/P1^(1/3)

So,

(5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Cubing both sides,

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

So P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3

(5/7)^3 is (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. Therefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That would be P2 / P1. But according to this, P2 is shorter than P1. So P2/P1 is 0.364, which is option A: ~0.36.

Wait, but let me check again. Wait, K2 is larger than K1 because 7>5. So K2 is bigger. And since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), that means that a larger K implies a smaller P. So P2 is smaller than P1. So P2 is about 0.36 times P1. Therefore, the ratio P2 / P1 is 0.36, so the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So it's 0.36 times as long, meaning it's shorter. So the answer should be approximately 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the answer should be A.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), i.e.,

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}.
\]

The problem states that the wavelength shifts for the two planets are 5 milliangstroms and 7 milliangstroms, respectively. Since the stars are identical and the spectral lines used are the same, the velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) is proportional to the wavelength shift. Thus, \( K_2 = \frac{7}{5} K_1 \).

Using the proportionality \( K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), we can write:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{P_2^{1/3}}{P_1^{1/3}}.
\]

Substituting \( K_2 = \frac{7}{5} K_1 \), we get:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}.
\]

This implies:

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \frac{P_2^{1/3}}{P_1^{1/3}}.
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}.
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \):

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, \( P_2 \approx 0.364 P_1 \), meaning the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Therefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is **shorter** than that of planet #1, and the ratio \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \) is approximately 0.36.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
