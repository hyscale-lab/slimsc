Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about stars and their luminosities. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me read the question again.

Alright, the problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. The wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same, which probably means something about their temperatures. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law, which relates wavelength to temperature inversely. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same too. That makes sense.

Then, the radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight, right? But how does that affect the observed luminosity? Oh wait, since luminosity depends on intrinsic properties, maybe the radial velocity is a distraction here. Or is it about Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelength but not the actual emitted luminosity? Or perhaps it's about something else, like the star's motion affecting how we perceive their brightness. Hmm, but since the question says they computed the luminosity using black body radiation, maybe the radial velocity isn't directly used in calculating luminosity, but perhaps it relates to temperature via Doppler broadening or something else? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's see.

The question is about the ratio of luminosities. Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Oh wait, since they're black bodies, that's the formula we should use.

We know that R1 = 1.5 R2. And since the peak wavelengths are the same, Wien's law λ_max * T = constant. So T1 = T2. So T is the same for both stars.

So the luminosity ratio L1/L2 would be (R1² T1⁴)/(R2² T2⁴). Since T1 = T2, this simplifies to (R1/R2)^2. Because R1 is 1.5 R2, (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 should be 2.25 times L2. So the factor is 2.25, which is option A.

Wait, but wait—could the radial velocities affect the calculation somehow? Because the problem mentions radial velocities. Hmm. Let me think. Radial velocity could affect the observed luminosity due to Doppler shifting, but in this case, since both stars are being observed, and their peak wavelengths are the same as measured, that might already take into account any Doppler shifts. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength would shift, but the problem states that the peak wavelengths are the same. So, perhaps their rest wavelengths are the same, meaning their temperatures are the same regardless of velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocities are redshift or blueshift, but since they're same in terms of peak wavelengths, their temperatures are same. So I think the radial velocities don't affect the calculation here. So the ratio is simply based on radius squared times temperature to the fourth. But since temps are same, it's radius squared.

So (1.5)^2 is 2.25, so L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the factor is 2.25, which is option A.

Wait wait, but wait, the options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, etc. Did I do something wrong?

Wait a second, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed temperature? Because when a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength is shifted. But in this question, the observed wavelengths are the same. So if Star_2 is moving away (velocity 700 km/s), that would cause a redshift. But Star_1 has velocity 0, so no shift. So their observed wavelengths are same because Star_2 is redshifted to match Star_1's emission? That would mean that their actual temperatures are different. Because the observed wavelength would be λ0*(1 + v/c) for Star_2, and Star_1's λ is λ0. But in the question, the observed λ_max are same. So maybe we have to correct for the Doppler shift.

Hmm, that's a more complex scenario. Let me think again.

If Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, then according to Doppler shift, the observed wavelength would be λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c). But the problem states that the observed wavelengths are same. So for Star_1, λ1 = λ_emitted1. For Star_2, λ2_observed = λ_emitted2 * (1 + v2/c). But since λ1 = λ2_observed, we have λ_emitted2 = λ1 / (1 + v2/c). 

But according to Wien's law, λ_emitted = b / T, so T = b / λ_emitted.

So T1 = b / λ1, and T2_emit = b / λ2_emit. But λ2_emit is λ2_observed / (1 + v2/c) = λ1 / (1 + v2/c).

So T2_emit = b / (λ1 / (1 + v2/c)) ) = (b (1 + v2/c)) ) / λ1.

But T1 = b / λ1.

So T2_emit = T1 * (1 + v2/c). But if the star is moving away, v is positive, so T2_emit is higher than T1. Wait, no, because if a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), so the emitted wavelength must be shorter (hotter). So T2_emit must be higher than T1. Hmm, but wait—if the observed wavelengths are the same, but Star_2 is moving away, that implies that Star_2's actual (emitted) wavelength is shorter than Star_1's, meaning it's hotter.

Wait, that complicates things. Because originally, I thought T1 = T2, but maybe that's only if their velocities are same. But in reality, considering Doppler shift, their emitted temperatures could be different.

So let me recast the problem. Let me denote:

For Star_1: observed λ1 = λ_emit1 * (1 + v1/c). But v1 is 0, so λ1 = λ_emit1.

For Star_2: observed λ2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c). But in the problem, λ1 = λ2, so λ_emit2 = λ_emit1 / (1 + v2/c).

Now, using Wien's law, T = b / λ_emit. So:

T1 = b / λ_emit1.

T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_emit1 / (1 + v2/c)) ) = b (1 + v2/c) / λ_emit1 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away, v2 is positive. So T2 is higher than T1. Hmm, but in the initial approach, I thought T1 = T2. So which is correct?

The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So that's the observed wavelength. So their emitted wavelengths are different, but due to Doppler shift, the observed ones are same. So the emitted wavelengths are different, thus the actual temperatures are different.

So now, in this case, T2 is higher.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again. The observed peak wavelength (λ_max) is the same for both stars. So for Star_2, which is moving away, its emitted λ_max is actually shorter than what it's observed as. Because when a star moves away, the wavelengths are stretched (redshifted), so to have the same observed λ, the emitted must be shorter.

Shorter λ_max implies higher temperature (since Wien's law λ_max ~ 1/T). So Star_2's actual temperature is higher than Star_1's.

Wait, but Star_1 has v=0, so its emitted λ_max is same as observed. So T1 = b / λ1.

Star_2's observed λ is λ1, but its emitted λ is λ_emit2 = λ1 / (1 + v2/c).

So T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b (1 + v2/c) / λ1 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

Since v2 is positive (moving away, 700 km/s), 1 + v2/c is greater than 1, so T2 is higher than T1.

So the temperatures are not the same. So my initial assumption was wrong. So now, the luminosity ratio will involve both the radius and the temperature.

So L = 4π R^2 σ T^4.

So L1 = 4π R1^2 σ T1^4,

L2 = 4π R2^2 σ T2^4.

The ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

We know R1 = 1.5 R2,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

So T1/T2 = 1 / [ (1 + v2/c) ].

So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * [1/(1 + v2/c)]^4.

Wait, v2 is 700 km/s. Let's compute (1 + v2/c).

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700 km/s is much smaller than c. So (1 + 700/3e5) is approximately 1 + 0.002333..., so approximately 1.002333.

So (1 + v2/c) ≈ 1.002333.

So [1/(1.002333)]^4 ≈ 1/(1.002333)^4.

Wait, but 1.002333 is approximately 1.00233. Let me calculate (1.00233)^4.

Let me compute that. Since (1+x)^n ≈ 1 + nx + (n(n-1)/2)x² for small x.

x here is 0.00233. n=4.

So (1.00233)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*0.00233 + (4*3/2)*0.00233².

Calculate each term:

4*0.00233 = 0.00932.

(6)* (0.00233)^2 = 6 * (0.0000054289) = approx 0.000032573.

So adding them: 1 + 0.00932 + 0.000032573 ≈ 1.009352573.

So the reciprocal is approximately 1 / 1.009352573 ≈ 0.9907.

Wait, but wait, let me think. Alternatively, I could compute (1.00233)^4 more accurately.

But for a more precise calculation, perhaps using a calculator approach. But since I don't have a calculator, I can consider that 700 km/s is about 0.23% the speed of light. So the fractional change is small.

So (1 + v/c) ≈ 1.002333.

(1.002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(0.002333) + 6*(0.002333)^2 + 4*(0.002333)^3 + (0.002333)^4.

Compute each term:

4 * 0.002333 = 0.009332.

6 * (0.002333)^2 = 6*(0.00000544) ≈ 0.00003264.

4 * (0.002333)^3 ≈ 4*(0.00000001266) ≈ 0.00000005064.

(0.002333)^4 ≈ 2.92e-11.

Adding all terms: 0.009332 + 0.00003264 = 0.00936464. Then + 0.00000005064 is negligible, and the last term is negligible.

So total ≈ 0.00936464. So (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.00936464.

So [1/(1.002333)]^4 ≈ 1/(1.00936464) ≈ 0.9907.

Wait, no. Wait, I think I messed something up. Because (1.002333)^4 is approx 1.009364, so 1/(1.002333)^4 is about 0.9907. Wait no, wait. Because 1.002333^4 is about 1.009364. So 1 over that is 0.9907.

Wait, no, sorry, 1.009364 is the denominator, so 1 divided by that is approximately 0.9907. Because 1.009364 ≈ 1 + 0.009364. So 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x when x is small. So 1/1.009364 ≈ 0.9907.

Wait, but wait. For x positive, 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x + x² - x³ + ... for small x. So 1/(1.009364) ≈ 1 - 0.009364 + (0.009364)^2 - (0.009364)^3 + ... which is approximately 0.9907.

So the ratio L1/L2 is (1.5)^2 * (0.9907)^4.

Wait, no, wait. Because L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. And T1 = T1, T2 = T1*(1 + v2/c). So (T1/T2) = 1/(1 + v2/c) = approx 0.99767.

Wait, wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let's correct the earlier mistake. So, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

From earlier:

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c). So T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v2/c).

So (T1/T2)^4 = [1/(1 + v2/c)]^4.

So putting it all together, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * [1/(1.002333)]^4.

Wait, but 1.5 squared is 2.25.

So 2.25 * [1/(1.002333)^4].

As computed earlier, 1/(1.002333)^4 is approx 0.9907.

So 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907. Let's compute this:

2 * 0.9907 = 1.9814,

0.25 * 0.9907 = 0.247675.

Adding together: 1.9814 + 0.247675 = 2.229075.

So approximately 2.229, which is about 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2.25, but after considering Doppler shift, it's about 2.23. So the correct answer would be D.

Hmm, but why did the initial approach not consider Doppler shift? Because in that approach, I assumed that the temperatures were same, but that's incorrect when considering radial velocities. So the problem must take into account the effect of velocity on the observed wavelength and thus the actual temperature.

So to recap: because Star_2 is moving away, its emitted wavelength is shorter, implying higher temperature. So when calculating luminosity, we have to use the actual temperatures, which are different.

So the correct calculation includes the Doppler shift, leading to a slightly lower luminosity ratio than 2.25.

So the factor is approximately 2.23, which is option D.


To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for blackbody radiation:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(R\) is the radius, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
The problem states that \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\). Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The problem also states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (\(\lambda_{\text{max, obs}}\)) are the same for both stars. Using Wien's law, \(\lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T\), the relationship between the observed and emitted wavelengths is modified by the Doppler shift due to radial velocity. For Star_2, which has a radial velocity \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) away from the observer, the observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max, obs}} = \lambda_{\text{max, emit}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
\]

Since the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars, we equate their emitted wavelengths:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max, emit, 1}} = \lambda_{\text{max, emit, 2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
\]

Using \(\lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T\), the temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{max, emit, 2}}}{\lambda_{\text{max, emit, 1}}} = \frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}
\]

The speed of light \(c \approx 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\), so:

\[
1 + \frac{v_2}{c} = 1 + \frac{700}{3 \times 10^5} \approx 1.002333
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.002333} \approx 0.99767
\]

### Step 3: Temperature Ratio to the Fourth Power
The temperature ratio raised to the fourth power is:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (0.99767)^4
\]

Using the approximation \((1 - x)^n \approx 1 - nx\) for small \(x\), where \(x = 1 - 0.99767 = 0.00233\):

\[
(0.99767)^4 \approx 1 - 4 \cdot 0.00233 = 0.99068
\]

### Step 4: Combine Results
Substituting into the luminosity ratio:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.99068 \approx 2.23
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times that of Star_2.
