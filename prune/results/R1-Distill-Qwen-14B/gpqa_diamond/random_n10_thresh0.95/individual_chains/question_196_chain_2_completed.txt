Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in non-relativistic mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But since this is relativistic, things are a bit different. Oh right, because when speeds get close to the speed of light, relativistic effects become significant.

The problem says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed v_max.

In the non-relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², which equals the kinetic energy at maximum speed. So (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA², leading to v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But wait, that's option C. But wait, this is a relativistic problem, so option C can't be the right answer. So I probably need to consider relativistic energy equations.

Relativistic energy includes both kinetic and rest mass energy. The total energy E of the oscillator would be the sum of the rest energy (mc²) and the kinetic energy. But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the potential energy (which is maximum at amplitude A) plus the kinetic. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore.

Wait, the relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy E is the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy.

Wait, the potential energy in a relativistic harmonic oscillator? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. In the non-relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)k x². But relativistically, I think the potential energy might still be (1/2)k x² because Hooke's law is F = -kx, and potential energy is the integral of F dx. So the potential energy U would be (1/2)k x² as before.

So at maximum displacement A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A². At that point, the kinetic energy is zero because the mass is at rest (momentarily) there. But wait, no, wait. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, wait, in a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is maximum at the amplitude, which is when the speed is zero, right? So the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, no, in the non-relativistic case, yes, but in the relativistic case, the situation might be more complicated.

Wait, but wait a second. In a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when the mass passes through the equilibrium point (x=0), where the kinetic energy is maximum and the potential energy is zero. So perhaps in the relativistic case, the maximum speed is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, but considering relativistic effects.

Wait, no, because in the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is conserved. However, in relativistic mechanics, the total energy is conserved but includes the rest mass energy. So, if the oscillator is doing its thing, then at the point of maximum displacement, all the energy is potential, and at the equilibrium point, all is kinetic.

So, the total energy E would be equal to the potential energy at maximum displacement plus the kinetic energy at that point. Wait no, wait. At maximum displacement A, the particle is at rest in the non-relativistic case, so kinetic energy is zero, and potential energy is (1/2)k A². So the total energy E is (1/2)k A². But in relativistic case, perhaps the kinetic energy isn't zero there.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again.

In a classical harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential, and it's conserved. At maximum displacement x=A, the speed is zero, so all the energy is potential. At x=0, the speed is maximum, so all energy is kinetic.

So, the maximum speed occurs when the kinetic energy is maximum, which is when the potential energy is zero. So in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_max², and the potential energy is zero. So E = (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA². So v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But since the problem is relativistic, we can't use that.

Wait, but wait, the problem says "relativistic harmonic oscillator". So relativistic effects must be considered. So the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. Instead, the total energy is gamma*mc², which is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy.

Wait, but how is the potential energy accounted for in the relativistic case? Because in non-relativistic, U = (1/2)kx², but relativistically, I'm not sure if that's the same. I think the potential is still (1/2)k x² because F = -kx is given, and the potential is the integral of F dx. So that part is probably the same.

So, total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. At equilibrium, x=0, so potential energy U is zero, and kinetic is maximum. So E is (gamma - 1) mc² + 0 (potential) = (gamma) mc², because kinetic is (gamma - 1) mc².

Wait, no, wait. The total energy E is rest energy plus kinetic. So E = gamma * mc². At maximum displacement, x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and kinetic energy is zero (non-relativistically), but in reality, when you're considering the relativistic scenario, the speed might not be zero.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about energy conservation in this relativistic oscillator.

At the maximum displacement A, the speed is v, but that's when the kinetic energy plus potential energy equals the total energy. Wait, no, wait. The problem says it's a harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law. So the potential is still (1/2)k x². So, the total energy E is (1/2)k A² (when x=A, v=0 non-relativistically), but in reality, perhaps the speed isn't zero here because of relativistic considerations. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, maybe the problem is assuming that at x=A, the speed is zero. But in reality, for a relativistic oscillator, is that the case? Because even if x=A, the velocity could be non-zero due to the nature of relativistic dynamics.

Wait, perhaps not. Maybe the maximum displacement A is reached when the velocity is zero, just like in the non-relativistic case. So the total energy E is (1/2)k A², same as before. But now, when the oscillator is at x=0, the speed is maximum, and all the energy is kinetic.

But wait, in the relativistic case, when x=0, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy (relativistic) is E - mc².

Wait, no. Because the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic. So, E = mc² + K, where K is kinetic energy.

Wait, but if the oscillator's total mechanical energy (including potential) is E = (1/2)kA², then when it's at x=A, its speed is zero, so kinetic energy is zero. But that's non-relativistic. But in reality, when you have relativistic speeds, even if the speed at x=A is zero, the total energy is E = rest energy + kinetic. So E = mc² + 0 = mc². But that can't be right because in the non-relativistic case, E is (1/2)kA², which would be equal to mc² when the speed is zero. That would imply that (1/2)kA² is equal to mc², but that's only if the amplitude is such that (1/2)kA² = mc².

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

In the non-relativistic case, E = (1/2) k A². But in the relativistic case, the total energy (including rest mass) is E = (1/2)k A². So when the particle is at x=A, its speed is zero, so kinetic energy is zero, and the total energy is E = mc² (since that's the rest energy). So that would mean that mc² = (1/2)k A². Hmm, but in the problem, it's given that the oscillator has maximum amplitude A, so perhaps the (1/2)k A² is equal to the total energy, which is E = mc² + K, where K is the kinetic energy at x=0.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think this through again.

At x=A, the speed v=0 (assuming that), so kinetic energy is zero. Potential energy is (1/2)k A². So the total energy E is (1/2)k A². But E is also the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So E = mc² + K. But at x=A, K=0, so E = mc². Thus, mc² = (1/2)k A². So (1/2)k A² = mc². That's an important relation.

But wait, this would only hold when the amplitude is such that (1/2)k A² equals mc². Otherwise, the total energy would be different.

Wait, but in our problem, the maximum amplitude is A, so the potential energy is (1/2)k A². So the total energy E is (1/2)k A².

But in the relativistic case, when the oscillator is at x=0, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is E - mc². So, K = E - mc² = (1/2)k A² - mc².

But wait, that would only make sense if (1/2)k A² > mc². Because if (1/2)k A² is less than mc², then K would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps in this problem, it's assumed that (1/2)k A² is much larger than mc², but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to approach this using the energy conservation equation.

At x=0, the potential energy U is zero, so all the energy is kinetic. So,

E = K + mc²,

where K is the relativistic kinetic energy.

But E is also the potential energy at maximum displacement, which is (1/2)k A². So,

(1/2)k A² = K + mc².

But K is (gamma - 1) mc², because K = (gamma mc²) - mc².

So,

(1/2)k A² = ((gamma - 1) mc² ) + mc² = gamma mc².

So,

gamma = (1/2)k A² / (mc²).

But gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = (1/2)k A² / (mc²).

Let me compute the right-hand side.

Let me write (1/2)k A² as U_max.

So,

gamma = (U_max) / (mc²).

So,

gamma = [ (1/2)k A² ] / (mc² )

Then,

gamma = (k A²) / (2 mc² )

Wait, but if (k A²)/(2 mc²) is greater than 1, then gamma would be greater than 1, which is possible. But if it's less than 1, then gamma would be less than 1, but that can't be because gamma is always >=1.

Hmm, perhaps the setup is such that (1/2)k A² is greater than mc², making gamma greater than 1.

So,

gamma = (k A²) / (2 mc² )

Wait, but that would imply that if (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) is, say, 2, then gamma is 2, which is acceptable.

So, from gamma, we can find v.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = (k A² )/(2 m c² )

So, rearranging,

1 - v²/c² = 1 / gamma².

So,

v²/c² = 1 - (2 m c²)/(k A² )

Wait, but if (k A²) is much larger than 2 m c², then v approaches c.

But if (k A²) is close to 2 m c², then v^2/c^2 becomes 1 - (2 m c^2)/(k A^2 ), which could be positive or negative.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the substitution. Let's check.

We have gamma = (1/2)k A^2 / (m c^2 )

So,

gamma = (k A^2 )/( 2 m c^2 )

Then,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = (2 m c²)/(k A^2 )

Then,

1 - v²/c² = (4 m^2 c^4)/(k² A^4 )

Wait, no, wait. Let me square both sides.

1/(gamma^2) = (1 - v²/c^2 )

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(gamma^2 )

= (2 m c^2 / k A^2 )^2

So,

v²/c^2 = 1 - [ (2 m c^2) / (k A^2) ]^2

Wait, that would require that [ (2 m c² )/(k A²) ]^2 < 1.

So,

(2 m c^2 )/(k A^2 ) < 1

Which implies,

k A^2 > 2 m c^2.

So, for this to hold, the potential energy (1/2)k A^2 must be greater than m c^2.

Because (1/2)k A^2 = (k A^2)/2. So if k A^2 > 2 m c^2, then (1/2)k A^2 > m c^2.

But then,

v²/c^2 = 1 - [ (2 m c² )/(k A^2) ]^2

But wait, that would make v^2/c^2 = 1 - (something squared), but that 'something' could be larger than 1, leading to v^2/c^2 negative, which isn't possible.

Wait, that suggests that perhaps my earlier approach is wrong. Maybe I should start by considering the relationship between the maximum speed and the parameters.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy E is (1/2)k A², which includes both the rest energy and the kinetic energy.

Wait, but E is the total energy, which is gamma mc^2. So,

gamma mc^2 = (1/2)k A^2.

So,

gamma = (k A^2) / (2 m c^2 )

So,

gamma = (k A^2) / (2 m c^2 )

But gamma must be >=1.

So,

(k A^2) / (2 m c^2 ) >= 1

Which implies,

k A^2 >= 2 m c^2.

Then, from gamma,

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = (2 m c^2 )/(k A^2 )

Squaring both sides,

1 - v^2/c^2 = (4 m^2 c^4 )/(k^2 A^4 )

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - (4 m^2 c^4 )/(k^2 A^4 )

Hmm, but wait, if k A^2 = 2 m c^2,

Then,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - (4 m^2 c^4 )/( (4 m^2 c^4 ) )

= 1 - 1 = 0 → v=0.

Which makes sense because when (1/2)k A^2 = mc^2, then E = mc^2, so gamma would be 1, and speed v=0.

Wait, but that's the case when maximum speed is zero, which can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to equate the total energy (including rest mass) E = gamma mc² to the sum of kinetic and potential energies.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when the potential energy is zero (x=0), so all energy is kinetic. So E = (1/2)k A² = (gamma - 1) mc² + (1/2) m v^2.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

At x=0, the potential energy U is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum.

In relativistic terms, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc².

So,

E = (gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2)k A².

So,

gamma = 1 + (1/2 k A²)/(mc² )

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

Wait, that's a different approach. So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Then,

gamma = [ (k A²) + 2 m c^2 ] / (2 m c^2 )

Wait, no, wait:

gamma = 1 + ( (1/2)k A² ) / (mc² )

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

gamma = (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 )

Wait, that's better.

Then,

gamma = (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 )

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Now, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

So,

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c^2 ) = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Let me denote (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) as a parameter, say, beta.

So,

beta = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Then,

gamma = 1 + beta

So,

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c^2 ) = 1 + beta

But beta is a positive quantity since all terms are positive.

So,

sqrt(1 - v²/c^2 ) = 1/(1 + beta )

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c^2 = 1/( (1 + beta )^2 )

v²/c^2 = 1 - [ 1/(1 + beta )^2 ]

= [ (1 + beta )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + beta )^2

Expand numerator:

(1 + 2 beta + beta² - 1 ) = 2 beta + beta²

So,

v²/c^2 = [ 2 beta + beta² ] / (1 + beta )^2

Factor numerator:

beta (2 + beta ) / (1 + beta )^2

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ beta (2 + beta ) ] / (1 + beta )^2 )

= c * sqrt( beta (2 + beta ) ) / (1 + beta )

But beta is (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Hmm, but none of the options seem to match this form. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: c * sqrt( 1 + 1/( (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m) )^2 ) )

Option B: c * sqrt( 1 + 1/( (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c²) ) ) )

Option C: sqrt( k A² / m )

Option D: c * sqrt( 1 - 1/( (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) )^2 ) )

Wait, maybe I can manipulate the expression I have to match one of the options.

We have v² = c² [ beta (2 + beta ) ] / (1 + beta )^2

Let me compute beta = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

beta (2 + beta ) = (k A^2)/(2 m c² ) * [ 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² ) ]

= [ 2 (k A^2)/(2 m c² ) ) + (k A^2)^2/(4 m² c^4 ) ]

= [ (k A^2)/(m c² ) ) + (k² A^4 )/(4 m² c^4 ) ]

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute the v² expression.

v² = c² [ beta (2 + beta ) ] / (1 + beta )^2

= c² [ ( (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) ( 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) ] / ( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )^2

Let me write this as:

= c² [ ( (k A^2) / (2 m c² ) ) * ( 2 (2 m c² ) + k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 ) ) ] / [ ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 ) )^2 ]

Wait, that's getting complicated. Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) * [ 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]

= (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) * [ (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]

= (k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2 )) / (4 m² c^4 )

Denominator: ( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )^2

= [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) ]^2

= (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 / (4 m² c^4 )

So,

v² = c² * [ (k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2 )) / (4 m² c^4 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 / (4 m² c^4 ) ]

The denominators are 4 m² c^4 in both numerator and denominator, so they cancel.

So,

v² = c² * [ k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2

Hmm, but I'm not seeing any of the options matching this, so perhaps I should re-examine my approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy setup. Let me try an alternative approach.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is v_max = sqrt( (k A^2)/m )

But in the relativistic case, the speed can't exceed c. So perhaps the maximum speed is given by a gamma term.

Wait, another approach is to use the relativistic equation for the harmonic oscillator. I remember that in a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the angular frequency changes due to relativistic effects.

But I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the virial theorem, which in the relativistic case states that the average kinetic energy is related to the average potential energy.

But wait, the virial theorem in relativity states that for a harmonic oscillator, the average kinetic energy is (1/2) mc² gamma, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relation between the total energy, kinetic, and potential in the relativistic scenario.

Wait, another thought: in the relativistic case, the potential energy is still (1/2)k x². The total mechanical energy E is (1/2)k A² as before. At x=0, all E is kinetic, which is (gamma -1 ) mc².

So,

(1/2)k A^2 = (gamma -1 ) mc^2.

Which gives,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

And gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 )

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Let me call (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) as beta again.

So,

gamma = 1 + beta

Then,

1 - v²/c^2 = 1/(1 + beta )²

So,

v²/c^2 = 1 - [1/(1+beta )^2 ]

= [ (1+beta )^2 -1 ] / (1 + beta )^2

Expanding numerator,

(1 + 2 beta + beta² -1 ) = 2 beta + beta²

So,

v²/c^2 = (2 beta + beta² ) / (1+beta )^2

Which can be written as,

v = c * sqrt( (2 beta + beta²) ) / (1 + beta )

But beta is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Hmm, perhaps we can factor this expression.

Let me factor numerator and denominator:

(2 beta + beta² ) = beta (2 + beta )

Denominator: (1 + beta )²

So,

sqrt( beta (2 + beta ) ) / (1 + beta )

Wait, but none of the options seem to directly match this.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: c * sqrt( 1 + 1/( (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m) )^2 ) )

Hmm, denominator inside the square root is (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m ))^2.

But in our expression, we have (1 + beta ), where beta is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So perhaps if (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) is small, then this can be approximated, but not sure.

Option B: c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Hmm, let me compute 1 + 1/(1 - beta ), where beta = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1 + 1/(1 - beta ) = [ (1 - beta ) +1 ] / (1 - beta ) = (2 - beta )/(1 - beta )

So,

sqrt( (2 - beta )/(1 - beta ) )

But in our expression, we have sqrt( (beta (2 + beta )) / (1 + beta )^2 ) )

Hmm, not matching.

Option D: c * sqrt(1 - 1/( (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) )

Which is,

sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + beta )^2 ] )

Which is,

sqrt( [ (1 + beta )^2 -1 ] / (1 + beta )^2 )

Which is,

sqrt( (1 + 2 beta + beta^2 -1 ) / (1 + beta )^2 )

= sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2 ) / (1 + beta )^2 )

Which is the same as our expression for v.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2 ) ) / (1 + beta )

Which is,

v = c * sqrt( (beta (2 + beta )) ) / (1 + beta )

But wait, option D is:

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + beta )^2 )

Which is,

sqrt( [ (1 + beta )^2 -1 ] / (1 + beta )^2 )

= sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2 ) / (1 + beta )^2 )

Which is the same as our expression.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2 beta + beta²) ) / (1 + beta )

Which is the same as option D's expression.

So, option D is the correct one.

Wait, but let me recheck the option D:

Option D says: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [ 1/( (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) )^2 ) ] )

Which is,

v = c * sqrt( [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 -1 ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

= c * sqrt( [ (1 + 2 beta + beta^2 ) -1 ] / (1 + beta )^2 )

= c * sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2 ) / (1 + beta )^2 )

Which matches our expression.

So, the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but let me check option B again. Option B has 1 + 1/(1 - beta ), which would be different.

So, the correct answer is option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we consider the relativistic energy conservation. The total energy \( E \) of the system is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy. At the equilibrium position (\( x = 0 \)), all the energy is kinetic, while at the maximum displacement (\( x = A \)), all the energy is potential.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy \( E \) is given by:  
   \[
   E = \gamma m c^2 = \frac{1}{2} k A^2
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, and \( \frac{1}{2} k A^2 \) is the potential energy at maximum displacement.

2. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v \)**:  
   From the above equation,  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}
   \]  
   Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}
   \]  
   Let \( \beta = \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \), so:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \beta
   \]  
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{(1 + \beta)^2}
   \]  
   Rearranging:  
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \beta)^2}
   \]  
   Substituting \( \beta = \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \):  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \) with the given options, we find that it matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option D**, as it accurately represents the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.
