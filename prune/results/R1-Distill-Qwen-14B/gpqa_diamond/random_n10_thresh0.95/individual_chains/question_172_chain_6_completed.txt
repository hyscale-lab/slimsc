Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the visible outer layer of a star, right? And it's related to the star's spectrum and energy output.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, so the excitation here refers to the energy levels of the atoms. I think this has to do with the thermal distribution of atomic energy levels. Oh, right, it's probably connected to the Boltzmann distribution.

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38 x 10^-23 J. Wait a second, that number looks familiar. Oh yeah, Boltzmann's constant is k = 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K. So the energy difference ΔE is k multiplied by the temperature? Or wait, no, the energy levels are given by ΔE = k*T, but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, the Boltzmann factor describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: (n2)/(n1) = exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) ), where n2 and n1 are the number of particles in the two states, ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, star_1 has twice as many excited atoms in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Let me clarify. Oh wait, the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. Wait, but we're looking at a specific energy level. So perhaps the number of atoms in a higher energy level (excited state) compared to the lower one.

Wait, I need to be precise. The problem states that in star_1, the number of iron atoms in a specific energy level is twice as excited as in star_2. Wait, so for the same transition, the ratio of excited to ground state is higher in star_1.

Wait, maybe the question is that the number of atoms in a higher energy level (n2) compared to the ground state (n1) is different for each star. So for star_1, n2/n1 is twice that of star_2. Or wait, the actual problem says that the excitation is twice as high in star_1. Hmm, maybe it's the ratio of the excited state to the ground state.

Wait, the problem states: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So I think this means that the excitation level is higher in star_1. So perhaps the ratio of atoms in the excited state to the ground state is higher in star_1 than in star_2.

But wait, the question is about the effective temperatures of the stars. And we're assuming LTE, so Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium holds, which means the Boltzmann distribution applies.

So Boltzmann equation: n2/n1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

In this case, n2 is the number in the excited state, n1 in the lower. So for star_1, the ratio (n2/n1)_1 is twice that of star_2's ratio, (n2/n1)_2.

Wait, no, the question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So maybe (n2/n1) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, but actually, the problem states that the excitation is twice as high, not the ratio. Or does 'excited' refer to the ratio?

Alternatively, perhaps the number of atoms in the specific energy level (excited) is twice as much. So n_1 = 2 * n_2, where n_1 is star_1's excited state population and n_2 is star_2's.

Wait, no, because each star's n would depend on its own temperature. So perhaps the ratio of the populations is given by the Boltzmann factor for each star.

Let me rephrase: For star 1, the ratio n2_1 /n1_1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star 2, n2_2 /n1_2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the question says that the excited level in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. Wait, maybe the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So:

(n2_1/n1_1) = 2 * (n2_2/n1_2 )

Which would give:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + [ -ΔE/(k T2) ]

Rearranging:

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Wait, let's do the algebra step by step.

Equation after taking log:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Multiply both sides by -1:

ΔE/(k T1) = - ln(2) + ΔE/(k T2)

Rearrange terms:

ΔE/(k T1) - ΔE/(k T2) = - ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/T1 - 1/T2 ] = - ln(2 )

Multiply both sides by -1:

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] = ln(2 )

But ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is equal to k (since k is 1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k.

So substituting ΔE = k:

(k)/(k) [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] = ln(2 )

Simplify k/k to 1:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2 )

Which can be rewritten as:

( T1 - T2 ) / (T1 T2 ) = ln(2 )

Because,

1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2 )

Wait, but the options presented are various expressions involving ln(2) equals something with T1 and T2.

Looking at the options:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which matches what I derived.

Wait, but let me make sure. The equation I have is:

(1/T2 -1/T1 ) = ln(2 )

Which is same as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) = ln(2 )

So option D says ln(2) equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ), which is correct.

Wait, but the question is about the effective temperatures. So the correct option is D.

Wait, but let me check other options. Option A is ln(2)= T2/T1, which would be the case if, say, T1 were twice T2, but that's not the scenario here.

Options B and C: their forms don't match what I derived. So the correct equation is option D.


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation levels of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann distribution is applied, as the stellar photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann equation for the ratio of populations in two energy levels is:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(n_2\) and \(n_1\) are the populations of the excited and ground states, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant (\(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\)), and \(T\) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the excitation levels are related such that the ratio of excited to ground state atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. This gives:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} \bigg|_{\text{star}_1} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_2}{n_1} \bigg|_{\text{star}_2}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann equation for each star:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Since \(\Delta E = k\) (as given in the problem), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting in terms of \(T_1\) and \(T_2\):

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the form of option D. The other options do not align with the derived relationship. For example:

- Option A (\(\ln(2) = \frac{T_2}{T_1}\)) would imply a direct proportionality between \(T_2\) and \(T_1\), which is inconsistent with the derived equation.
- Options B and C involve more complex forms that do not match the derived relationship.

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
