Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let's see what I know about these instruments. 

From the question, I remember that ESPRESSO at Paranal can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. And HIRES at Keck can see stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, the stars must have apparent V magnitudes less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. Wait, no, because the question says "brighter than" so actually, if a star is brighter than 17 mag, ESPRESSO can detect it. Similarly, for HIRES, stars brighter than 16 mag can be observed. So to be detected by both, the star's apparent V magnitude must be brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 for HIRES. Wait, wait, that can't be right because 17 is higher than 16. Oh wait, higher magnitude numbers are fainter. So if a star is brighter, its V magnitude is lower. So, for ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitude ≤17 can be observed, because they're brighter than 17. Similarly, HIRES can observe V mag ≤16. So the star must have V mag ≤16 to be detected by both. Because if it's brighter than 17 (so V mag ≤17), but to be detected by HIRES, it must be ≤16. So the star's apparent V magnitude has to be ≤16. So any star with apparent V mag of 17 or higher would not be detected by HIRES. So the star must have apparent V mag ≤16.

Wait wait, no, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." Brighter stars have lower magnitude. So if the V magnitude is less than 17, then it's brighter than 17. So ESPRESSO can detect stars with V mag <17. HIRES can detect stars with V mag <16. So the star must have V mag <16 to be detected by both.

Wait, but wait. Let me read again. It says, with ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than
