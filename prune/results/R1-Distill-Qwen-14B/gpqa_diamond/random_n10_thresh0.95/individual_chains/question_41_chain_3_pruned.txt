Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says a light beam is moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. They're asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember that when a medium is moving, it affects the observed speed of light in that medium. But wait, the speed of light in a medium is generally c/n, right? Because in vacuum it's c, and when it's in a medium with refractive index n, it's reduced to c/n. But when the medium itself is moving, like in this case, how does that come into play?

Oh right, I think this is related to the Doppler effect for light, but wait, Doppler effect usually deals with the change in frequency or wavelength when the source or observer is moving. But here, the medium is moving. Hmm, maybe I should think about it in terms of relative velocities.

Wait, no, maybe I should consider the frame of reference. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. So, in the lab frame, what's the speed of the light beam?

Wait, but light's speed in a medium is c/n, but that's in the rest frame of the medium. If the medium is moving, we have to find the speed as observed in the lab frame.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. In the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So, in the lab frame, the speed of the light would be the vector sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity in the glass's frame.

But wait, is it just a simple addition? Because when velocities are small compared to c, we can use the Galilean addition (v = u + w), but when velocities are significant, we have to use relativistic addition.

Wait, but the problem says to take c=1, so maybe it's using relativistic considerations. Or maybe not? Let's see.

Wait, the problem states that the glass is moving at velocity v, same direction as the beam and towards the observer. So the observer is in the lab, and the glass is moving towards them. So the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

Wait, no, the light is propagating through the glass and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. Wait, but the beam is moving through the glass, which is itself moving in the same direction. So in the lab frame, the light's speed is what we're trying to find.

Hmm, another approach: consider the lab frame and the glass's frame. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed c/n towards the observer. But the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer (in the lab frame). So, how does this affect the observed speed?

Wait, I think that when the medium is moving, the speed of light in the medium as observed in the lab is (v_light + v_glass) / (1 + (v_light * v_glass)/c²). But wait, that's for when the medium is moving and the light's speed in the medium is v_light. But wait, in the medium's frame, the light speed is c/n.

Wait, let me think in terms of the Doppler shift formula. Oh wait, no, Doppler shift is about frequency and wavelength changes when the source or observer is moving relative to the medium. Or wait, maybe it's about the medium's motion affecting the observed speed.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to use a coordinate transformation. Let's think about the glass's rest frame, S', which is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame S.

In S', the speed of light is c/n, because that's the speed in the medium. But wait, no, the speed of light in the medium at rest is c/n. So in S', the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's movement. So in S', the speed is c/n.

Wait no, in S', the medium is at rest, so the light's speed is c/n in that frame. But the frame S is moving at velocity -v relative to S' (since S' is moving at v relative to S). So, to find the speed as observed in S, we can apply the Lorentz transformation for velocities.

Wait, but wait! Wait a second. The velocity addition formula in relativity is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²), where u is the velocity in S and u' in S'.

Wait, no, the correct formula is when you have a velocity u in frame S, and frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S. Then the velocity u' in S' is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²).

So in this case, in S' (glass frame), the light is moving at u' = c/n. But wait, since the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, and the glass is moving towards the observer (so from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light), so in S', the light's velocity is u' = c/n.

We need to find u, the velocity of the light in the lab frame S.

So, applying the velocity transformation:

u = [u' * c^2 + v (c^2 - u'^2)] / [c^2 - u' v]

Wait, no, another way. Let me get the exact formula. The standard formula for velocity addition from S' to S is u = [u' + v] / [1 + (u' v)/c²]

Wait, no, that's when S' is moving at speed v relative to S, and u' is the velocity in S'.

Wait, let me double-check. If two frames S and S' are moving at velocity v relative to each other, and an object has velocity u in S, then in S' it's u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²).

So, to get u from u', we rearrange:

u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²)

Multiply both sides by denominator:

u' [1 - (u v)/c²] = u - v

u' - (u' u v)/c² = u - v

Bring all terms to one side:

u' - u + v - (u' u v)/c² = 0

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe an alternative approach.

Let me think again. In S', the light's velocity is u' = c/n towards the same direction as the glass's movement. So the lab frame S is moving at velocity v relative to S' (since S' is moving at v towards S). Wait, no—wait, S' is the glass frame, moving at velocity v in the lab frame S. So from S to S', the velocity is +v.

So to find u (velocity in S) given u' (velocity in S'), use:

u = [u' + v] / [1 + (u' v)/(c²)]

Because when the object is moving in the same direction as the frame's motion, that's how the velocity addition works.

So substituting u' = c/n and v = v (same direction):

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) )

But wait, c=1, so let's substitute that in.

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (1 + n v)/n

Denominator: (n + v)/n

So u = [ (1 + n v)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ] = (1 + n v)/(n + v)

Wait, that's what option A is: (1 +n v)/(n +v)

But wait, wait. Let me check the direction of the velocity. The glass is moving towards the observer, so in the lab frame, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light. So when the light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving, the light's speed in the lab frame is the sum of the two velocities, but adjusted for
