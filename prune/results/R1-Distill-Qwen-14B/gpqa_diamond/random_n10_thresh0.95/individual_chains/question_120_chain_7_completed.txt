Okay, so I've got this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to how far away a star is. The bigger the parallax, the closer the star is, right? Or wait, no, wait. Wait, no, parallax is actually inversely proportional to distance. So a larger parallax means the star is closer because parallax is measured in arcseconds and the formula is distance in parsecs equals 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. Yeah, so d = 1/plx, where plx is the parallax.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So how does the number of stars change with parallax? Let's see. The stars are uniformly distributed, so the same number per volume? Or maybe per some other measure.

Wait, the problem says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, wait, uniform distribution in the sky—so, perhaps uniform in terms of solid angle. But how does that translate into the number of stars per unit parallax range?

Hmm. Oh, wait, another approach. Let's think about distances. Parallax plx is related to distance d by d = 1/plx. So a unit increase in plx (like from plx to plx + dplx) corresponds to what in distance?

If plx increases by dplx, then d = 1/(plx + dplx) ≈ (1/plx) - (dplx)/(plx²) when dplx is small. So the change in distance is about -dplx/(plx²). But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right direction. Let me think: when plx increases, distance decreases. So if you have a range of plx from plx to plx + dplx, the distance range would be from 1/plx to 1/(plx + dplx). So the difference in distance would be roughly d(1/plx) = -dplx/(plx²). But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d. The volume of a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr is 4π d² dr. So for stars uniformly distributed in space (number density n), the number of stars in this shell would be n * 4π d² dr.

But since we're looking at a range in parallax, let's express everything in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, then dr = derivative of (1/plx) with respect to plx. So plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. But wait, d is a function of plx, so when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by (1/plx²) dplx. But I'm not sure how that connects.

Wait, perhaps better to express the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with parallax plx. The number of stars in a thin shell of thickness dr at distance d would be proportional to the volume of the shell, which is 4π d² dr. So the number per unit volume (number density) is n, so the count is n * 4π d² dr.

But dr is the thickness in distance. Since we're interested in the number per unit parallax, we need to express this in terms of dplx. So, dr = derivative of d with respect to plx multiplied by dplx. Since d = 1/plx, dr/ddx = -1/plx². So dr = (-1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, but in the shell, as plx increases, d decreases. So the thin shell's dr is negative? Hmm, perhaps the absolute value is what matters. So substituting dr into the expression:

Number of stars in the shell = n * 4π d² dr = n *4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/plx² ) dplx )

Wait, but the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But for the number of stars, we just take the magnitude. So the number is proportional to (1/plx²) * (1/plx^2) ) dplx → 1/plx^4 dplx. So the number of stars per unit parallax (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, that would make the number of stars per unit plx (like plx to plx + dplx) being ~ 1/plx^4. So as plx increases, the number of stars in a unit step of plx decreases with 1/plx^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because if you have a higher parallax, the stars are closer, so in a given small range of plx, you have more stars, right? Because the volume near the Earth is larger? Or wait, no, the volume depends on d^3, but maybe the shell's area is proportional to d^2.

Let me think again. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is proportional to the surface area of the shell, which is 4π d², multiplied by the thickness dr in distance. So N = n * 4π d² dr. But when we convert dr to dplx, since d = 1/plx, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. So N = n *4π (1/plx^2) * ( - 1/plx² ) dplx ). So the magnitude is n *4π (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number per unit plx is (n 4π) / plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx is ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but that would suggest that the count per unit plx is inversely proportional to plx^4, so option A is 1/plx^4. So the answer should be A.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought that the number of stars increases as you look closer (lower plx, wait no, lower plx is larger distance. Wait, no, wait. Higher plx means closer. So, for a given change in plx (say from plx to plx + dplx), as plx increases (i.e., closer stars), the number of stars in that range would be higher. Because the density is uniform, so stars are more numerous in a unit plx step when plx is higher.

But according to the math, the number per unit plx is 1/plx^4. So for higher plx (smaller distance), 1/plx^4 is larger, which would mean more stars per unit plx. That makes sense because you're looking at a closer region where more stars might be present.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about the actual distribution. Stars are uniformly distributed in space, so the number density is the same everywhere. The number of stars in a volume dV is n dV. For a thin shell, dV is approximately 4π d² dr. So the number of stars in a thin shell is proportional to d² dr.

Since dr is related to dplx, because d = 1/plx, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx.

Putting it all together: N = n *4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx ) → 4π n (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/(plx)^4. So the number per unit plx increases as plx decreases. Wait, no, as plx increases, 1/plx^4 decreases, so the number per unit plx would decrease. That seems contradictory to intuition. Wait, no: let's think in terms of integrating. For example, if N is the number between plx and plx + dplx, we find N is proportional to (1/plx^4) dplx. So as plx increases, each dplx step contributes fewer stars. So the number of stars in higher plx ranges (closer stars) would be higher, but the number per unit plx is higher when plx is smaller.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think with numbers. Suppose plx is 1 arcsecond. The number per unit plx would be proportional to 1/1^4 =1. If plx is 2, then 1/16. So in a range from 2 to 3 parallax, the number per unit plx is lower than from 1 to 2. That makes sense because in the closer range (higher plx), each unit of plx corresponds to a smaller distance step, but the density of stars is uniform. So maybe the count per unit plx is higher when plx is smaller.

Wait, but wait, no. Because when plx is small (like 0.001), 1/plx^4 is 1e12, which is huge, implying lots of stars per unit plx there. But in reality, stars can't have parallax less than some value because they would be beyond the galaxy. So perhaps the distribution is only valid up to a certain plx.

But according to the math, the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) is 1/plx^4. So the answer would be option A: ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, \( 4\pi d^2 dr \), assuming a uniform distribution of stars in space.

Since \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), the thickness \( dr \) in distance corresponds to a change in parallax \( d\text{plx} \) as \( dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \) into the expression for the number of stars in the shell, we find:

\[
N \propto 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right).
\]

Taking the magnitude (since the negative sign indicates direction), the number of stars per unit range of parallax becomes:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This result shows that the number of stars per unit parallax decreases as \( \text{plx}^4 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
