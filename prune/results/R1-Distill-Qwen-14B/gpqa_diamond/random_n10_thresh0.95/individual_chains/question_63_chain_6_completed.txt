--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled by the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that, when absorbed, will switch the molecule to the next lowest energy state. The given data includes the masses of the two atoms, the bond length, and the angular frequency of vibration. The options are four different momentum values.

Hmm, okay. I think this has to do with the energy levels of a rotating and vibrating molecule. So, in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the molecule's energy depends on both rotational and vibrational states. Wait, but the question specifically mentions the fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so I think that refers to the ground state of both rotation and vibration.

But wait, in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the rotational quantum number. However, the non-rigid rotor model, also called the rotation-vibration model, includes both rotational and vibrational energy contributions. Oh right, because in the rigid rotor, the bond length is fixed, but the non-rigid considers bond stretching as well.

So the molecule's energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. The fundamental state would be the lowest energy state, which would be the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So, that would be the rotational ground state (J=0) and vibrational ground state (n=0).

Now, the question is about a photon being absorbed. When a photon is absorbed, it provides energy to the molecule, causing it to transition to a higher energy state. But the problem says to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Wait, that might mean the next higher energy state, which is the first excited state.

Wait, but the molecule's energy has two parts: rotation and vibration. So, the next state could be either a higher rotational state or a higher vibrational state. Which transition would require the least energy? Because the photon needs to have just enough energy to cause the transition.

I think that the vibrational energy levels have a larger spacing than rotational ones. Because in vibration, the energy levels are quantized as (n + 1/2)ħω, so each step is ħω. For rotation, the energy is (J (J+1) ) * (ħ²/(2I)), where I is the moment of inertia. The spacing between adjacent J levels increases as J increases, but the first transition from J=0 to J=1 for a diatomic might be small compared to the vibrational energy.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The vibrational energy levels are spaced by ħω, which could be quite large. For example, if ω is 4e14 rad/s, then the energy is ħω. Let's compute that. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, so ħ is about 1.055e-34 J·s. Multiply by ω: 1.055e-34 *4e14 ≈ 4.22e-20 J. Hmm, that's the energy difference for a vibrational transition.

In rotation, the ground state is J=0. The next state is J=1. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rotational = [ħ²/(2I)] * J*(J+1). So the energy difference when J increases by 1 (from 0 to 1) would be E_J=1 - E_J=0 = ( (1)(2) - 0 ) * (ħ²/(2I)) ) = 2 * (ħ²/(2I)) ) = ħ²/(I).

So the energy required for the rotational transition is ħ²/(I). Let's compute that.

Wait, but the question is which transition requires less energy: the first rotational or the first vibrational. Because the photon can cause either, but we need the one that requires the smallest possible photon energy, which would correspond to the lowest momentum.

Wait, no. The problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state (so J=0, n=0). When it absorbs a photon, it can transition to either a higher vibrational state (n=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). The question is to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Ah, wait: the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one that requires the least energy. So the photon should have the energy corresponding to the lower of the two possible transitions.

So, if the energy required for the rotational transition (J=0→1) is less than the vibrational transition (n=0→1), then the photon energy should be that of the rotational transition. Otherwise, it's the vibrational one.

So I need to compute both ΔE_vibrational and ΔE_rotational and see which is smaller.

Let me compute each.

First, compute ΔE_vibrational: that's the energy difference between n=0 and n=1. The vibrational energy is (n + 1/2) ħω. So the difference between n=1 and n=0 is ħω.

So ΔE_v = ħω.

Now, ΔE_rot: The rotational energy levels are E_rot = (J (J+1)) * (ħ²)/(2I) ), where I is the moment of inertia.

For J=0, E_rot = 0. For J=1, E_rot = (1*2) * ħ²/(2I) ) = 2 ħ²/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

So ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I).

So which is smaller, ΔE_v or ΔE_rot?

Well, let's compute both.

First, I need to find I, the moment of inertia. I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

Given Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. So μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) amu.

Calculating μ: (20*2)/(20+2) =40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert amu to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's compute that. 1.818 * 1.6605 is about 3.017. So 3.017e-27 kg.

r is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r=2e-10 m.

So I = μ r² = 3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

Compute that: (2e-10)^2 is 4e-20 m². So I = 3.017e-27 *4e-20 = 12.068e-47 kg m². Which is approximately 1.2068e-46 kg m² (since 12.068e-47 is 1.2068e-46).

Wait, no: 3.017e-27 * 4e-20 = (3.017 *4) * 1e-47 = 12.068e-47. So yes, I=1.2068e-46 kg m².

Now, compute ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I).

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ let's approximate it as (1.05e-34)^2 ≈ 1.1e-68 J² s². But let me calculate more accurately.

1.0545718e-34 squared: (1.0545718)^2 = approx 1.112. So 1.112e-68 J² s².

ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I) = (1.112e-68 J² s²) / (1.2068e-46 kg m²) )

Wait, but J is kg m²/s². Hmm, let me think about the units. Let me compute dimensionally.

ħ has units of J·s. So ħ² has units (J² s²).

I is kg m².

So ħ² / I has units (J² s²)/(kg m²). Let me see. But J is kg m²/s². So J² is kg² m^4 / s^4. So denominator kg m².

So overall units: (kg² m^4 / s^4) * s² ) / (kg m²) ) = (kg² m^4 s^-2 ) / (kg m^2 )) = kg m² s^-2.

Which is kg m²/s², which is J. So units are correct.

So compute numerically:

ΔE_rot = (1.112e-68) / (1.2068e-46) ) J.

That's approximately (1.112 /1.2068) * 1e-22 J.

1.112 /1.2068 ≈ 0.921.

So ΔE_rot ≈ 0.921e-22 J ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

Now, compute ΔE_v = ħω.

ω is given as 4e14 rad/s. ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ΔE_v = 1.0545718e-34 *4e14 ≈ 4.218e-20 J.

So compare ΔE_rot (9.21e-23 J) and ΔE_v (4.218e-20 J).

ΔE_rot is smaller, so the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon should have energy corresponding to the rotational transition. Therefore, the photon's energy is E_photon = ΔE_rot = 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, but wait a minute. When a photon is absorbed, it can cause a transition in either vibration or rotation. But in the molecular energy levels, the vibrational and rotational transitions are often considered separately. But in the non-rigid rotor model, perhaps the energy states are a combination of both.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing the rigid rotor and non-rigid (vibrating) models. In the rigid rotor, the bond length is fixed, so only rotational transitions are considered. In the non-rigid rotor model, the bond can stretch, so vibration is included. But for a diatomic, the fundamental state is the state of least energy, which is J=0 and n=0. The next possible state (lowest energy) would be the one with the smallest energy increment—so either J=1 or n=1.

So if the rotational transition requires less energy, the photon will cause that transition. But wait, the question says that the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, so perhaps the transitions are possible in either. But in this case, the minimal energy needed is the rotational one.

Wait, but wait again. The problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest possible energy state. So the next state with the lowest energy would be the one with the smallest possible energy increment. So we need to find the energy difference between the fundamental state and the next possible state.

So the fundamental state is n=0, J=0. The next states could be J=1, n=0 or n=1, J=0. The energy of each is higher than the fundamental state.

Wait, but perhaps the next state is n=0, J=1, because that has lower energy than n=1, J=0.

Wait, let me think about the energies.

E_total = E_rot + E_vib.

E_rot(J=0, n=0) = 0 + (0 + ½) ħω = ½ ħω.

Wait no, wait. The vibrational energy is (n + ½) ħω, and the rotational is (J (J+1)) * (ħ²/(2I)).

So the fundamental state is n=0, J=0: E = ½ ħω + 0 = ½ ħω.

The next possible states are:

1. J=1, n=0: E_rot = (1)(2) (ħ²/(2I)) = 2 ħ²/(2I) )= ħ²/(I) = ΔE_rot as before. And E_vib is still ½ ħω. So E = (½ ħω ) + ΔE_rot.

2. J=0, n=1: E_rot is 0, E_vib is (1 + ½) ħω = 3/2 ħω. So E = 3/2 ħω.

3. J=1, n=1: that's higher than both, so higher energy.

Which of states 1 and 2 has lower energy? Let's compute E for each.

State 1: E = (½ ħω) + (ΔE_rot = 9.21e-23 J). Let me compute E_rot in terms of J: 9.21e-23 J.

ΔE_rot =9.21e-23 J.

½ ħω is (0.5)*(1.0545718e-34 J·s)*(4e14 rad/s) )= 0.5 * 4.218e-20 J = 2.109e-20 J.

So E_state1 = 2.109e-20 J +9.21e-23 J ≈ approx 2.12e-20 J.

E_state2 = (3/2) ħω = 3/2 * 4.218e-20 J ≈ 6.327e-20 J.

So E_state1 (2.1e-20 J) is lower than E_state2 (6.3e-20 J). Therefore, the first possible next state is J=1, n=0 with E ≈2.1e-20 J.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the energy difference for the rotational transition was 9.2e-23 J, which when added to the fundamental state's energy (2.1e-20 J) gives E_state1 as 2.1e-20 +9.2e-23 = 2.19e-20 J. But when comparing the state to the fundamental state, the energy difference is just the ΔE_rot, because the fundamental state is E_fund=2.1e-20 J, and state1 is E_fund + ΔE_rot. So the photon's energy needs to match the ΔE_rot.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the photon's energy has to be the difference between the final state and the initial state. So the initial state is E_fund = ½ ħω = 2.1e-20 J.

The final state is E_final = E_fund + ΔE_rot = 2.1e-20 +9.2e-23 ≈ 2.19e-20 J. So the energy of the photon must be E_photon = E_final - E_fund = 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but another possibility is that the next state is n=0, J=1, which is E_final = E_fund + ΔE_rot. The photon's energy is the difference, which is ΔE_rot.

Alternatively, the next state could be n=1, J=0, which has E_final = (3/2) ħω =6.3e-20 J. The photon's energy would be E_photon = (3/2) ħω - E_fund = (6.3e-20 - 2.1e-20 )=4.2e-20 J.

But since the next state with the lowest energy is the J=1, n=0 state, which requires a photon of 9.2e-23 J. So that would be the photon energy needed.

Wait, but wait. Wait, that can't be right. Because 9.2e-23 J is much less than 4.2e-20 J. So the first transition is the rotational one.

So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J. But the question asks for the momentum of the photon.

Photon momentum p is related to its energy E by E = pc, where c is the speed of light. So p = E/c.

Wait, no, wait. The energy of a photon is E = hν = pc, so p = E/c.

But wait, E = h ν = pc → p = E / c.

So given E_photon =9.21e-23 J, then p = 9.21e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) )= approx 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but none of the options are that small. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C)1.1e-27 Ns

D)1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, 3e-31 kg·m/s is 3e-31 N·s, since 1 Ns =1 kg·m/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is D) 1.4e-28 Ns, which is larger than my calculation.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculations?

Hmm. Let me double-check the steps.

First, the energy difference for the rotational transition (J=0→1):

ΔE_rot = (ħ²)/(I)

I is the moment of inertia, I = μ r².

μ is the reduced mass. Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 *2) / (20 +2) =40/22 ≈1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg → μ=1.818 *1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

r=2 angstroms =2e-10 m.

I= μ r² =3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2=4e-20 m².

So I=3.016e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg·m².

Then, ħ=1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approximately 1.112e-68 J²·s².

ΔE_rot = ħ² / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.2064e-46 = about (1.112 /1.2064) e-22 = approx 0.921e-22 J =9.21e-23 J. That seems correct.

Now, E_photon =9.21e-23 J.

Momentum p = E_photon / c = (9.21e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s ) = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. Because 1 J =1 kg·m²/s², so E in kg·m²/s². Divided by m/s gives kg·m/s, which is N·s.

So p ≈3.07e-31 Ns.

Looking at the options, the closest isn't even close. So maybe I messed up somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the next state is J=1, n=0. Wait, perhaps the model allows for transitions that change both J and n. But the problem states that the photon causes the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one with the next available energy level.

Wait, perhaps the rotational and vibrational transitions are considered separately, and the next state is either J=1 or n=1, whichever requires less energy.

From earlier calculations, the energy required to transition to J=1 is 9.2e-23 J, and to n=1 is 4.2e-20 J. Since 9.2e-23 J is much smaller, the photon should have that energy.

But the options don't include anything near 3e-31 Ns. The smallest option is D) 1.4e-28 Ns.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me double-check the calculation of I.

Wait, r is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

r squared is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

μ is 1.818 amu; 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So 1.818 *1.6605e-27 = approx 3.016e-27 kg.

So I=3.016e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =1.2064e-46 kg·m².

Wait, that seems correct.

Wait, the energy for the rotational transition is ħ²/(2I) for each J step? Or is it (J+1... )? No, I think I calculated correctly. The energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is (2 ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I). So that's correct.

So why don't the options match?

Alternatively, perhaps the question isn't about the first transition, but the first allowed transition in the model.

Wait, another thought: in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are a combination of both rotation and vibration. But perhaps the model also includes the vibrational energy in the rotational levels. So when a photon is absorbed, it can cause a transition in the vibration, which would require more energy than rotation.

Wait, maybe I should compute the vibrational transition's required momentum and see which option matches.

E_photon_vibrational = ħω → p = E/c = ħω/(c).

Let me compute that.

Given ω=4e14 rad/s.

So E_photon_vibr = ħω =1.0545718e-34 *4e14 ≈4.218e-20 J.

p = E/c =4.218e-20 J/(3e8 m/s) = 1.406e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is 1.406e-28 N·s, since 1 Ns=1 kg·m/s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns. So that would be the momentum if the photon causes a vibrational transition.

But wait, earlier calculation suggested that the rotational transition requires less energy. So why is the option for the vibrational transition present, and not the rotational?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me recheck that.

Wait, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are E_J = (J (J+1) ħ² )/(2I).

The energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is E_1 - E_0 = [ (2)(ħ²)/(2I) ) ] - 0 = ħ²/(I).

Wait, correct. But perhaps I made a mistake in calculating ħ²/(I).

Wait, ħ =1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 J² s².

I =1.2064e-46 kg m².

So ΔE_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.2064e-46 = approx 9.21e-23 J.

So that seems correct.

But then the photon's momentum would be 9.21e-23 J /3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg m/s. So that's 3.07e-31 Ns.

Looking at the options, none match that.

Wait, the options are A) 1.9e-28, B) 2.3e-27, C)1.1e-27, D)1.4e-28.

Hmm, perhaps the question is considering the energy difference for the vibrational transition, which is the same as the vibrational quantum. That's option D.

But why would the rotational transition require less energy but not be an option?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the model. Another thought: in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized, but the non-rigid model accounts for the vibration as well. So perhaps the model's energy levels are such that the rotational transitions require more energy than the vibrational ones, or perhaps the question is about the fundamental state and the first allowed transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (n=0), but in the rotational state J=0. The next state could be J=1, but perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational transitions are not allowed (if it's a homonuclear diatomic?), but wait, the question says elements X and Y, so different atoms, so it's a heteronuclear diatomic, which can have a permanent dipole moment, allowing rotational transitions.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck because the calculation for the rotational transition's momentum (3e-31 Ns) isn't among the options. So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the vibrational transition's momentum, which is option D: 1.4e-28 Ns.

But I thought the rotational transition requires less energy. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state, which could be a combination of rotation and vibration. But that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the model and the next state is the first vibrational state, which requires more energy but the photon's momentum is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the rotational-vibrational coupling, so the next state is the first excited rotational state, but only when vibration is in the ground state.

Wait, perhaps I should compute both possibilities and see which option matches.

Wait, the vibrational transition's momentum is 1.4e-28 Ns (option D), which is present. The rotational is 3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option.

So maybe the correct approach is to compute the vibrational transition's momentum, which would be option D.

But why? Because perhaps the rotational transition is not allowed under certain conditions or perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the energy difference between J=1 and n=1, but that's higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the fundamental state, and the next state is the first vibrational state, not the rotational one.

Wait, perhaps the model expects only the vibrational transition to be considered, but I'm not quite sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the Raman transition, which involves simultaneous changes in both rotational and vibrational states, but that might be overcomplicating it.

Another angle: perhaps the question is about the energy of the photon that causes a transition from the ground state to the next state, which could be n=1, J=0, requiring a photon of energy ħω, leading to momentum p = ħω/(c) ≈1.4e-28 Ns (option D).

So, given that, perhaps the correct answer is D.

But why was the rotational transition's energy much lower?

Wait, perhaps because in the non-rigid model, the rotational energy is part of the same energy spectrum as vibration, but the transitions are only allowed when certain selection rules are met. For example, vibrational transitions can accompany rotational transitions. So the photon's energy might be such that it causes a change in both J and n. But that's getting more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simplifying and expects to consider the vibrational transition as the next state, which would match option D.

Looking back, the problem states that it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. So perhaps the model combines both, and the energy levels are such that the next state's energy is the sum of the first rotational and first vibrational steps. But that would result in a higher energy than either alone, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the next energy level beyond the fundamental state, regardless of whether it's rotational or vibrational. So the next energy level might be the first vibrational state, because in some cases, the vibrational states are higher than rotational.

Wait, but earlier calculations showed that the first rotational transition requires less energy than the first vibrational. So the next state would be the rotational one.

But since the options don't include the rotational's momentum, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I did the calculation of ΔE_rot incorrectly.

Wait, the energy difference for the rotational transition is (E_J=1 - E_J=0) = ((2 * ħ²)/(2I)) ) - 0 = ħ²/(I).

Wait, but perhaps it's ( (2 ħ²)/(2I) ) - 0 = ħ²/(I) → correct.

Wait, but let me recompute I.

μ = (20 *2 )/(20+2 )=40/22 =20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

1 amu =1.6605e-27 kg → μ =1.818 *1.6605e-27 ≈3.016e-27 kg.

r=2e-10 m.

I=μ r² → 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 → 3.016e-27 *4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg m².

So, ΔE_rot = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.206e-46) ) = (1.112e-68 )/(1.206e-46 ) → ≈9.22e-23 J.

So p=9.22e-23 /3e8 → 3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition.

Then, E_photon_vibrational = ħω =1.05457e-34 *4e14 =4.218e-20 J.

p =4.218e-20/3e8 →1.406e-28 Ns.

Which matches option D.

But why is the rotational transition's required momentum not among the options? Maybe because the question is considering the fundamental state as the ground state, and the next state is the first vibrational state, which requires a higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is being treated as a rigid rotor, so vibration is ignored, and the model is only considering rotation. But the question says it's the non-rigid rotor model, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy transition. Let me double-check.

Wait, another way to compute the rotational energy difference:

E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = [ (1)(2) (ħ²)/(2I) ) ] - 0 = (2 ħ² )/(2I )= ħ²/I.

Which is what I had before.

So I think the calculation was correct.

But since the options don't include the rotational's momentum, perhaps the intended answer is the vibrational transition's momentum, option D.

But why would the rotational transition's energy be so much lower, yet not be an option? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is actually about the vibrational transition, and the rotational part is a distractor.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the fundamental state (n=0, J=0) to the next state which is n=1, J=0, which would require the full vibrational energy.

So that would be E_photon = (3/2 ħω - 1/2 ħω )= ħω.

Which is 4.218e-20 J, and p=1.4e-28 Ns.

So the answer would be option D.

But why then is the rotational transition's energy so much lower? Because if it's possible, that photon would allow a transition to a lower energy state, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, because the photon's energy is being absorbed, which increases the molecule's energy. So the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the initial and final states.

If the molecule is in the fundamental state (E=½ ħω), and the photon has energy E_photon = ħω, then the final state would have E= ½ ħω + ħω = 3/2 ħω.

Which is the n=1, J=0 state.

Alternatively, if the photon's energy is E_photon =9.2e-23 J, then the final state would have E= ½ ħω +9.2e-23 J. But ½ ħω is 2.1e-20 J, which is much larger than 9.2e-23 J, so E_final would be about 2.1e-20 J, which is still lower than the n=1 state's energy of 3.0e-20 J.

So the molecule could have multiple states with E between 2.1e-20 and 3.0e-20 J, but they would correspond to different J and n values.

But perhaps the question simply refers to the next state as the first vibrational state, which would require a photon of momentum 1.4e-28 Ns.

So, given that, perhaps the correct answer is option D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences for both rotational and vibrational transitions.

### Key Information:
- **Masses**: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}, \, M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
- **Bond length**: \( r = 2 \, \text{\AA} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
- **Angular frequency**: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)
- **Reduced mass**: \( \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} = 1.818 \, \text{amu} \)
- \( 1 \, \text{amu} = 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \), so \( \mu = 3.016 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)
- **Moment of inertia**: \( I = \mu r^2 = (3.016 \times 10^{-27}) \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2064 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2 \)
- **Planck's constant**: \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)
- **Speed of light**: \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)

### Energy Differences:
1. **Rotational Transition (J=0 → J=1)**:
   - Rotational energy levels: \( E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} J(J+1) \)
   - Energy difference: \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = E_{\text{rot}}(J=1) - E_{\text{rot}}(J=0) = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} \)
   - Substituting values:  
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.2064 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]

2. **Vibrational Transition (n=0 → n=1)**:
   - Vibrational energy levels: \( E_{\text{vib}} = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right) \hbar \omega \)
   - Energy difference: \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = E_{\text{vib}}(n=1) - E_{\text{vib}}(n=0) = \hbar \omega \)
   - Substituting values:  
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) \times (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
     \]

### Comparison:
- The rotational transition requires less energy (\( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \)) than the vibrational transition (\( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \)). However, none of the provided options match the momentum corresponding to the rotational transition.

### Photon Momentum:
- The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \).
- For the vibrational transition:  
  \[
  p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}
  \]
- This matches **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
While the rotational transition requires less energy, the provided options do not include the corresponding momentum. Therefore, the problem likely assumes the next state refers to the first vibrational state, requiring a photon with momentum \( p = 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \).
