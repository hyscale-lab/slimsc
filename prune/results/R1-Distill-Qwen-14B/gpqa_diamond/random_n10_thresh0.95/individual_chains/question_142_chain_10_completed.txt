Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubits space. The options are four points in 3D space, which is a bit confusing because I thought qubits are in a 2D space. Hmm, maybe it's referring to the Bloch sphere representation.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. I remember that the density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or in a superposition. For pure states, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, but this seems different.

Wait, let me compute this. Let me expand this. The |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix with 1 at (1,1) and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 at (2,2). So adding them together, the matrix would have 1s on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere. Then multiplying by 1/2 gives a matrix where the diagonal elements are 1/2 and the off-diagonal are 0. So ρ = [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. 

I think this is the maximally mixed state for a qubit. Wait, the maximally mixed state is the completely depolarized state, which has equal probability for both |0⟩ and |1⟩. Yeah, that's exactly what this is. So ρ represents a completely mixed state, which in the Bloch sphere is the center, the origin. Because the Bloch sphere has pure states on the surface and mixed states inside. The completely mixed state would be at (0,0,0) in the Bloch representation.

So the question is asking for the geometrical position in qubits space, which is the Bloch sphere. So the point should be at the origin, which corresponds to option C, (0,0,0).

Wait, but why is it the origin? Because when you write the density matrix of a mixed state, it's (I/2) for a qubit. Because for a qubit, the density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. For a completely mixed state, the vector r should be zero, because you don't have any direction in which the state is polarized. So the density matrix becomes I/2, which matches the given ρ.

So the vector r would be (0,0,0), which is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

Expanding this, the matrix representation is:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\
0 & \frac{1}{2}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is the maximally mixed state for a qubit, where the system has equal probability of being in the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, mixed states are located inside the sphere, with the origin corresponding to the completely mixed state. For a qubit, the density matrix can generally be written as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(\mathbf{r}\) is a vector in 3D space, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. For the given density matrix, the vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is zero because there is no polarization in any direction. Thus, the state corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere, \((0,0,0)\).

From the options provided:

- **A) \(r=(1,1,0)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.
- **B) \(r=(0,0,1):** Incorrect, as this represents a different state.
- **C) \(r=(0,0,0):** Correct, as this is the origin in the Bloch sphere for the given maximally mixed state.
- **D) \(r=(1,1,1):** Incorrect, as this does not match the given density matrix.

Thus, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubits space is \((0,0,0)\).

Answer: C
