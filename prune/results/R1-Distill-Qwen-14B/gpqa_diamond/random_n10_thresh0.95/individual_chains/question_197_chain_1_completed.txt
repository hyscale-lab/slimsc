--- Full Content ---
Okay, let's try to figure out this organic chemistry problem. So, the question is about identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of certain organic groups, maybe like an ester or a nitrile? Wait, no, wait. Oh, right! I think when you have a nitrile group, reacting it with red phosphorus and HI converts it into an amine. Or maybe it's for removing a protective group. Wait, no, maybe it's about eliminating a group to form an acid.

Looking at the IR and NMR data for Compound X. Let's start by analyzing the IR. The IR peaks can tell us about the functional groups present. The broad peak between 3400–2500 cm-1 suggests possible O-H or N-H stretching. But wait, in the range of 2500-3000 cm-1, a peak might indicate an alkyne, but the given range is 3400-2500, which is a bit broad. Alternatively, maybe it's an O-H from a carboxylic acid. But wait, another peak is at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong peak, typical for a carbonyl group like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Wait, but if the compound has a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be a broad peak around 2500-3300. The 1720 cm-1 might be an ester or ketone.

Wait, but the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a very downfield shift. That's characteristic of an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton because they are also around 10-12 ppm. So maybe the compound has a carboxylic acid group. But wait, looking at the IR, 1720 is more in line with an ester or maybe a ketone. Wait, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an acid. So if it's a carboxylic acid, the IR would show a broad O-H peak, but in the given IR, the 3400–2500 is a broad peak. Hmm, but 3400-2500 is a pretty wide range. Maybe it's an alcohol's O-H or an amine N-H, but I don't see any other peaks in the IR that might suggest that.

Wait, another peak is at 1610 cm-1, which is around where aromatic C=C stretching occurs. The 1450 cm-1 is another aromatic region, possibly indicating substituents on a benzene ring.

Now looking at the 1H NMR. The first peak is at 10.5 ppm, broad singlet, 1H. That's a strong clue. Could be a carboxylic acid proton. But wait, a carboxylic acid in the NMR would normally be a broad peak, which this is. So maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). This looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. For example, in para-substituted benzene, you get two doublets each integrating to 2H. So the substituent is in the para position.

So the aromatic ring has a substituent at para. What's the substituent? Let's look at the rest of the NMR. At 2.9 ppm, a multiplet integrating to 1H. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

Let me try to piece this together. The substituent on the benzene is connected to a chain. Looking at the NMR:

- The 10.5 ppm is a -COOH group, perhaps? Or maybe an aldehyde. But the IR has a peak at 1720, which could be a carbonyl. Let's think about the structure.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 is a strong absorption. So if it's a carbonyl, and the NMR shows a peak around 10.5, which is a proton adjacent to a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe it's an ester group? No, wait, the 10.5 ppm is more likely a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a ketone or an ester. Let me think. If the substituent is an acyl group, like an acyl attached to the benzene, the NMR would have a carbonyl signal. But our 10.5 ppm is a proton, not a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's not a carboxylic acid. Let me consider another possibility. The 10.5 ppm could be a formyl group (RCHO), but that's usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acidic proton, like from a phenol. But phenol protons are around 5 ppm, so that's not matching. Hmm, maybe it's an -OH group from something else.

Wait, the NMR shows a multiplet at 2.9 ppm, which is around where a CH adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group might be, like next to a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for two H, perhaps part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Then, 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which is typically a CH3 group attached to something, maybe a CH2. The 0.9 ppm triplet is likely a CH2CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent on benzene is a chain like CH2-C(O)-something. Wait, but the 10.5 ppm is a proton, not a carbonyl, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a longer chain ending in a carboxylic acid. For example, perhaps it's a phenylpropanoic acid. Let me think about that.

Looking at the substituent:

The 1H NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm (1H, broad singlet) → likely a carboxylic acid proton (COOH).
- 8.0 ppm (d, J= some value, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) → likely a para-substituted benzene.
- The signals from 2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d,3H), and 0.9 (t,3H) suggest a chain attached to the benzene.

Let me try to draw this out. So, benzene ring with a substituent in the para position. The substituent is a group that has a CH2-CH2-CH3 chain attached. Wait, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which is a CH3 group attached to a CH2, which is then attached to another CH. The 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H, possibly a CH group that's connected to a carbonyl.

So perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group attached to the benzene. Wait, but if it's a propionyl group (CH2CH2CO), then the NMR would show a CH2 connected to a carbonyl. But the proton at 10.5 would be from where? Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH2CH2COOH group.

Wait, but if the substituent is -CH2CH2COOH, then the structure would be something like benzene with a CH2CH2COOH group in the para position. Let me see:

The substituent would be CH2-CH2-COOH. So the chain is -CH2-CH2-COOH attached to the benzene.

In that case, the protons in the NMR would be:

The COOH proton at ~10 ppm (broad, 1H).

The CH2 groups: the one adjacent to COOH would have protons that are deshielded. But wait, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H. Hmm, perhaps the chain is longer.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl chain leading to a carbonyl. For example, maybe it's a benzene ring with a propyl chain that ends with a ketone or ester.

Wait, but the IR has 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So the substituent would have a carbonyl. So maybe it's a benzoyl group, but that's more like a ketone attached directly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester group. For example, if the substituent is an ester, like OAc (acetyl), but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propionyl group (CH2CH2CO-) attached to the benzene. That would give a ketone. Then the IR would have 1720 cm-1 for the C=O. The NMR would have the aromatic protons, and the CH2 groups next to the carbonyl.

Wait, but the aromatic protons would be in the 7.2-8.0 ppm range. The substituent is in the para position, so two doublets with 2H each.

Then, the protons on the chain: the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would be around 2.5-3 ppm. But in the given NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet, maybe for a CH group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH2CH2COOH group. Let me think: benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH. But that would be a longer chain. The NMR would show:

- The COOH proton at ~10.5 ppm.
- The CH2 groups: The CH2 next to COOH would be around 2.5-3 ppm. The CH2 further away would be at lower ppm. But in our case, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H. Hmm, maybe that's a CH group, not a CH2.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3)COOH group. No, that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH2CH2CH3)COOH group. That would give a branching. So, the structure would be benzene-(CH(CH2CH2CH3))COOH.

Wait, but let's break down the NMR:

The 10.5 ppm is a single proton, which is likely the COOH.

The aromatic protons: 8.0 (d,2H), 7.2 (d,2H) → para substitution.

Then, the rest of the signals:

2.9 ppm (m,1H) → maybe a CH group connected to something.

1.7 ppm (m,2H) → perhaps two protons on a CH2.

1.4 ppm (d,3H) → a CH3 group connected to a CH2.

0.9 ppm (t,3H) → a terminal CH2CH2CH3.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-COOH group. Let me visualize this:

Benzene ring with a substituent at para position. The substituent is a CH2 connected to a CH group, which is connected to a CH2CH2CH3. So the structure would be benzene-(CH2)CH(CH2CH2CH3)COOH.

Wait, but then the substituent would be something like CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-COOH. But that might not fit the NMR.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a propyl chain attached to the ring with a COOH group at the end. So, benzene-(CH2)3COOH. But that would mean four carbons in the substituent, and the NMR might show more peaks.

Wait, let's count the protons in the NMR:

1H at 10.5 ppm (COOH)
2H + 2H (aromatic)
1H (2.9)
2H (1.7)
3H (1.4)
3H (0.9)

Total: 1+2+2+1+2+3+3? Wait, no, the integration is:

10.5 (1H)
8.0 (2H)
7.2 (2H)
2.9 (1H)
1.7 (2H)
1.4 (3H)
0.9 (3H)

Total H: 1+2+2+1+2+3+3 = 14 H. That's a lot, but depends on the structure.

Wait, but the substituent on benzene would have several Hs. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group attached to benzene, and then another chain. For example, benzene-CH2-CH2-COOH. The substituent is a propiono group attached to benzene, but that would give the chain as CH2-CH2-COOH.

Wait, but the NMR has a 1H at 2.9 ppm. If the structure is benzene-(CH2)2COOH, the chain would be CH2-CH2-COOH, but that would have two CH2 groups. The protons on the CH2 adjacent to COOH would be around 2.5 ppm (maybe 2.3-2.6), but our NMR shows 2.9 ppm, which is a bit higher. Maybe that's because it's next to an electronegative group.

Wait, but in this case, the substituent would be -(CH2)2COOH. The two CH2 groups would show up around 2.5 and maybe 1.6 ppm. But the given NMR has 2.9 (1H), 1.7 (2H), 1.4 (3H), 0.9 (3H).

Hmm, that doesn't quite fit. Maybe there's branching.

Wait, looking at the NMR, there's a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is likely a CH2CH2CH3 group. So, a butyl group perhaps.

The 1.4 ppm is a doublet of 3H. That suggests a CH3 attached to a CH2. So, maybe it's a CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3) group.

Wait, putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-COOH group. So the substituent on benzene is CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-COOH. That would make the substituent a pentanoic acid derivative.

But wait, the NMR shows 1.7 ppm (m, 2H). If the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-COOH, the CH2 next to the CH(CH2CH2CH3) would have two protons, and the CH(CH2CH2CH3) would have one proton. So, the signals would be:

The CH(CH2CH2CH3) would be a CH group, which is split into a multiplet around 2.9 ppm.

The CH2 adjacent to it would be two protons, perhaps around 1.7 ppm. The CH3 on the CH2CH2CH3 group would be at 1.4 (d), and the terminal CH2CH2CH3 would have triplet at 0.9 ppm.

Wait, but the structure would be benzene-(CH2)CH(CH2CH2CH3)-COOH. That's a four-carbon substituent: benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-COOH. So the substituent is a propyl group (CH2CH2CH3) connected via a CH group and a CH2 to the COOH.

Wait, but then the substituent would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-COOH.

So, the NMR would have:

Ph protons: 8.0 (d, 2H), 7.2 (d,2H).

COOH: 10.5 ppm (1H, broad).

The CH2 next to COOH (maybe that's the CH2 in CH2-CH(...)): but wait, in this structure, the CH2 is between Ph and the CH group.

So the CH2 would have protons that are probably around 2.5-3 ppm.

Wait, but the NMR has 2.9 ppm (1H, m). Hmm, that's a single proton. So maybe the CH2 is split into a quartet or something, but the integration is 1H. Wait, no, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet of 1H, which suggests a CH group, not CH2.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CO-O-R, but then the substituent would be an ester. But the IR at 1720 could be from the ester.

But then, what about the NMR? Let's think again. Maybe the substituent is a benzoyl group with some chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzyl ester. For example, Ph-CH2-COO-R. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH2CH2COO- group, but that doesn't fit with the NMR.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached to a ketone. But then the carbonyl would be in the IR, and the NMR would show protons around the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a -COCH2CH2CH2CH3 group. But that would be a pentyl group attached via a carbonyl.

But let's think about the IR. 1720 would be a carbonyl, so that fits a ketone or ester. If it's a ketone, the structure would be Ph-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group.

The NMR would show:

Ph protons as two doublets.

The ketone is at 1720, but no proton attached. Then, the R group would have protons.

But the NMR shows a 10.5 ppm, which would not be from a ketone. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong about that.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a benzoyl group attached to a longer chain. For example, Ph-CO-O-R, but then the 10.5 would be from an acid if it's a COOH group.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid derivative, like 4-ethylbenzoic acid. Let's see.

If it's 4-ethylbenzoic acid, the structure would be:

Benzoic acid with an ethyl group in the para position.

The NMR would have:

Carboxylic acid proton: around 10.5 (broad, 1H). That fits.

Aromatic protons: two doublets (each 2H) at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. That matches.

Now, the substituent is an ethyl group (CH2CH3) attached to the benzene. But wait, the NMR also has signals at 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm.

The ethyl group would have a triplet at around 1.2 ppm (for CH2CH3) and a quartet at around 2.6 ppm (for the CH2 attached to the benzene). But in our NMR, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H, and 0.9 is a triplet of 3H.

Wait, that doesn't match. Because in this case, the ethyl substituent would give a quartet at ~2.6 ppm (2H) and a triplet at ~1.2 ppm (3H). So the NMR signals don't align with that.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is longer, like a butyl group. Let's consider if the substituent is a propyl group attached to a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a isobutyl group attached to the benzene, but that doesn't account for the COOH.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the reaction.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that when a nitrile is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it is converted to an amine. Wait, no, wait: nitrile + H2SO4/HI gives an amine, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction. Another reaction I recall is that when a nitrile is treated with H3O+ and H2O, it hydrolyzes to a carboxylic acid. But red phosphorus and HI are usually used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines. Alternatively, it's used for the removal of the trityl group in some cases.

Wait, perhaps the starting material, Compound X, is a nitrile. So if the substituent is a nitrile, after reaction with HI and red phosphorus, it becomes an amine. But looking at the options, I don't see any amines. The options are all either acids, benzene derivatives, etc.

Wait, the options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Hmm, all options except B and D are either benzoic acids or propanoic acids. B and D are substituted toluenes, perhaps.

So maybe Compound X is an ester or a nitrile. If the reaction is hydrolysis leading to a carboxylic acid, then the product would be a carboxylic acid.

Wait, let's think again about the IR and NMR of X.

IR:

- 3400-2500: broad, maybe O-H or N-H. But no, 3400-2500 is a broad range. Another possibility is an alkyne C-H stretch, but that's usually around 3300-2200. The 1720 is a strong C=O.

If X is an ester, the IR would have a peak around 1720. The O-H in the ester would not be in the 3400 region because esters don't have O-H. So maybe X is a nitrile. Then the IR would have a C≡N peak around 2250 cm-1. But the given IR doesn't show a peak that high, so perhaps X is not a nitrile.

Wait, the IR data provided are 3400–2500, 1720, 1610, 1450. Hmm, 1610 and 1450 are in the aromatic region. 1610 is where aromatic C=C stretches are, and 1450 is for substituents on benzene.

So, X has a benzene ring with substituents and a carbonyl group.

If X is a benzoyl chloride, then the IR would have a strong peak around 1800 cm-1. But here it's 1720, which is lower, so maybe an ester or a ketone.

Wait, if X is benzophenone (Ph-CO-Ph), the IR would have a strong peak around 1680-1720, which fits. But the NMR doesn't show any peaks around 7.8 ppm for another aromatic ring, so maybe not.

Alternatively, X could be a methyl benzoate. IR would have 1720 for the ester. The NMR would show a singlet for the OMe group around 3.8 ppm, but the given NMR doesn't show that. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, back to the NMR. The 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which is likely a carboxylic acid proton. So, perhaps X is a benzoic acid derivative. So, when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, but if X is a nitrile, then the product would be an amine. But the options don't include amines. Alternatively, maybe X is an ester, and the reaction converts it into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if X is an ester, then the reaction with HI and red phosphorus might not hydrolyze it. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the reaction conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a protection/deprotection step. For example, converting a nitrile to an amine.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus in HI is used for the elimination reaction, perhaps of a vicinal dihalide to form an alkyne. Or maybe it's something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, but that usually requires more vigorous conditions. Or maybe it's a Clemmensen reduction, but that uses HCl and Zn(Hg).

Wait, another possibility: when a nitrile is treated with H2O and HgSO4, it hydrolyzes to a carboxylic acid. But red phosphorus and HI are not typically used for that. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrolysis of a nitrile to an amide, then to a carboxylic acid.

But without knowing exactly what reaction is happening, perhaps I should look at the options and see which one could be the product.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid → structure is PhCH2COOH with ethyl in para.

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene → isobutyl group in position 1 (ortho?), which may not make sense.

Wait, benzene is symmetric, so positions are relative. 1-isobutyl-4-methyl would mean the substituents are at the para positions.

Wait, 1 and 4 are para on a benzene ring. So 1-isobutyl and 4-methyl would mean the substituents are at opposite positions. So the structure is para-substituted with isobutyl and methyl.

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid → benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para position.

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene → again, para-substituted with sec-butyl and methyl groups.

Wait, but looking at the NMR of X, which is the starting material, perhaps X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Let me check.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the structure would be:

Ph-(COOH) with a sec-butyl group in para.

The NMR would have:

- COOH proton at 10.5 ppm (1H, broad).
- Aromatic protons as two doublets (2H each) at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm (due to the para substituents).
- The sec-butyl group: a CH(CH2CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene.

The CH group of the sec-butyl would have protons around 2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H).
The adjacent CH2 would be at ~1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H).
The methyl group attached to the CH would be at ~1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H), and the terminal CH2CH2CH3 would have triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H).

So in this structure, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene, and the benzene has a COOH group in the para position.

So the NMR would match this structure.

Then, when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens? Wait, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and if the reaction is a hydrolysis, but X is already a carboxylic acid. So why would it react?

Wait, perhaps X isn't a carboxylic acid but a nitrile. Let me rethink. If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would hydrolyze the nitrile to an amine. But the product options don't have amines, so that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester. If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate ester, then reaction with HI and red phosphorus might hydrolyze it to the acid.

Wait, let's think about the reaction. If X is a nitrile, like 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile, reaction with HI and red phosphorus would form 4-(sec-butyl)benzylamine. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, if X is an ester, like 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid methyl ester, then reaction with HI (acidic conditions) would hydrolyze it to the carboxylic acid. So the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

But wait, in the initial problem, X is the starting material. So if X is the ester, the product after hydrolysis would be the acid. So the correct option is C.

Alternatively, if X is the acid, it wouldn't react with HI and red phosphorus. So perhaps X is a nitrile or ester.

Wait, looking back at the IR of X: 1720 cm-1. For an ester, that's a typical carbonyl. For a nitrile, the carbonyl isn't present. So if X has a carbonyl at 1720, it's more likely an ester or ketone.

Wait, if X is an ester, like Ph-CO-O-R, then the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze the ester to a carboxylic acid. So the product would be Ph-COOH plus whatever R is.

But looking at the NMR of X, the substituent would be R-O-CO-Ph. But the given NMR shows a chain leading to a COOH group, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzyl ester, like Ph-CH2-CO-O-R. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a protected carboxylic acid, and the reaction removes the protection.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of certain protective groups, like the trityl group. Alternatively, if X is a benzotriazole derivative, but that's probably beyond the scope.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the options again. The options for the product are A to D. If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the reaction is some kind of elimination, perhaps, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Another possibility is that X is a benzoyl chloride, and the reaction is hydrolysis to the benzoic acid. But benzoyl chloride's IR would show a strong peak around 1800, not 1720. So maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a methyl benzoate, and the reaction converts it into benzoic acid. But the given NMR doesn't show the OMe group.

Wait, in the NMR, there's a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is likely a CH2CH2CH3 group. So if X is an ester like Ph-CO-O-(CH2)3CH3, but that would give a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group on the benzene, and then a COOH group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)3CH3 group attached to the benzene, and a COOH group as another substituent. But the substituents are in the para position, so perhaps it's a benzene ring with a COOH group and a butyl group in para.

Wait, but the NMR of X shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H, broad), which is the COOH proton. Then, the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

So, X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Then, when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the reaction. Let me think again about the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the dehydrohalogenation of vicinal dihalides to form alkenes. Or perhaps for the dehalogenation of aryl halides. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: if X is a nitrile, then reaction with HI and red phosphorus would convert it into an amine. But the product options don't include any amines.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzene ring with a cyano group and a substituent. But the IR doesn't show a peak at 2250, which is typical for C≡N.

Wait, the IR shows 1720, which is a carbonyl, so more likely an ester or ketone.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzophenone derivative. For example, Ph-CO-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-something. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a cinnamic acid derivative. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the options. The options that involve benzoic acid are C and A. Let me see.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, assuming X is the starting material, and the reaction leads to this, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, maybe X is 4-sec-butylbenzoyl chloride, and the reaction hydrolyzes it to the acid. But again, the IR of X would have a higher carbonyl peak.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to outline the structure again.

NMR of X:

- 10.5 ppm: COOH (1H, broad)
- 8.0 (d, 2H), 7.2 (d,2H): para-substituted benzene
- 2.9 (m,1H): likely a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl or in a branch
- 1.7 (m,2H): perhaps a CH2 group
- 1.4 (d,3H): a CH3 attached to a CH2
- 0.9 (t,3H): ethyl group

So the substituent on the benzene is likely a CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-COOH group. So the structure is:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-COOH

Wait, but that's a four-carbon substituent. The substituent would be at the para position, so the benzene has a COOH group in another position?

Wait, no, the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-COOH group attached to the benzene in the para position. So the structure is:

Ph-(CH2)CH(CH2CH2CH3)-COOH

Which would be 4-(2-(sec-butyl)ethyl)benzoic acid. But I'm not sure if that's one of the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-COOH.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Structure is Ph-(sec-butyl)COOH.

Hmm, perhaps X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. But then, why would it react with red phosphorus and HI? Unless there's another functional group.

Wait, perhaps X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid chloride. Then, the reaction with HI would hydrolyze it to the acid. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile group attached to the benzene with a substituent, and the reaction converts it to an acid.

Wait, perhaps X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile, and the reaction converts it to 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. But that would require hydrolysis of the nitrile, which typically uses different conditions, like acidic or basic conditions with heat.

But red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, not acids. So the product would be an amine, which isn't among the options.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the reaction again. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydroxyamination of nitriles, producing a hydroxamic acid, which can then be further treated. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reduction.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a hydrolysis of a nitrile to an amine, which then is oxidized to an amide or acid. But without more details, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehalogenation. If X is an aryl bromide with a substituent, red phosphorus and HI could perform a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the product structure. The options are A to D. If the reaction is converting a nitrile to an acid, the product would be a benzoic acid.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So if X is the nitrile, and the reaction converts it to the acid, the product would be option C.

But wait, the starting material's NMR doesn't show any nitrile signals. Oh, right, the NMR would have signals for the substituent and the carboxylic acid, but not for a nitrile.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile with a substituent. For example, 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile.

But then, the NMR would not show a COOH proton but would have a nitrile proton? Wait, nitriles don't have protons attached. So the 10.5 ppm would be a different group.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should proceed with the assumption that X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might not change it, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps X isn't a carboxylic acid but an ester, and the reaction hydrolyzes it.

Wait, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to the acid, then the product is option C.

But the IR of X shows 1720, which would fit an ester. The NMR of X would show the ester oxygen's adjacent CH3 as a singlet around 3.8 ppm, but in the given NMR, there's no such peak. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps X is a ketone. The NMR doesn't show a peak for a carbonyl proton.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a reduction. For example, if X is a nitrile, and the reaction reduces it to an amine. But again, the product options don't include amines.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of HX from a vicinal dihalide, forming an alkyne. But X's NMR doesn't suggest a dihalide.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, converting a halogenated benzene to another group. But I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, another approach: the product options. Let's look at each option and see which one matches the data.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

IR of product: carboxylic acid would have a broad O-H around 2500-3300 and a carbonyl around 1700. The NMR would have:

- COOH proton at ~10.5 ppm (1H, broad)
- Aromatic protons as two doublets (2H each) at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm.
- The substituent, a sec-butyl group: the CH would be around 2.9 ppm (m,1H), the adjacent CH2 around 1.7 ppm (m,2H), the CH3 attached to CH at 1.4 ppm (d,3H), and the terminal CH2CH2CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

Wait, that matches exactly with the NMR data provided for Compound X. So that suggests that Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. But then, what reaction would X undergo with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a protection step. For example, converting the acid into an ester or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not changing the benzoic acid part but modifying another group. But then, the initial NMR would have to include that group.

Wait, perhaps X is a nitrile with a substituent, and the reaction converts it into the acid. So the product would be option C.

But I'm getting stuck. Another approach: the reaction of a nitrile (R-C≡N) with H2O and acid gives R-COOH. But the presence of red phosphorus and HI is confusing.

Wait, I found that red phosphorus and HI can be used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines. The reaction is: RCN → RCH2NH2 with H2O, P, HI.

But then, the product would be a secondary amine. However, none of the options are amines.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrocyanation or something else. I'm not getting anywhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, converting a leaving group into something else.

Wait, perhaps X is a bromide attached to the benzene ring, and the reaction substitutes it with another group.

But I'm not seeing the connection.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, like a Friedel-Crafts, but without more info, it's hard to say.

Hmm, maybe I should go back to the initial data.

X's IR: 3400–2500 (broad), 1720 (strong), 1610, 1450.

Which suggests a benzene ring with substituents and a carbonyl group, possibly ester or ketone.

The NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5, which is likely a COOH.

So X is probably a benzoic acid derivative, and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might not change it, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another possibility: X is a nitrile with a substituent, and the reaction converts it into an acid. So the product is option C.

But without the nitrile peak in the IR, it's hard to confirm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid.

For example, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate ester, the reaction with HI (acidic conditions) would hydrolyze it to the acid, which is option C.

In that case, the IR would have 1720 (ester C=O), which matches, and the NMR would show the ester OMe group, but in our case, there's no such peak. So unless the ester is a different type, like OCH2CH2CH2CH3, but that would show up around 1.4 ppm as a quartet, which isn't present.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Given the NMR and IR data, the starting material X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If the reaction doesn't change it, the product would be the same as X, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Wait, another possibility: X is an ester, and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI converts it into an acid. So the product is option C.

Given the data, I think the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.


The question involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins by examining the IR and NMR data of Compound X to deduce its structure.

### IR Analysis:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: A broad peak, likely indicating an O-H or N-H stretch, but the absence of other peaks in this range suggests it is not an alcohol or amine.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: A strong peak, characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), likely from an ester, ketone, or carboxylic acid.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Peaks in the aromatic region, indicating a substituted benzene ring.

### NMR Analysis:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet for 1H, likely a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl or part of a branched chain.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet for 2H, likely a CH₂ group.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet for 3H, likely a CH₃ group attached to a CH₂.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet for 3H, likely a terminal CH₂CH₂CH₃ group.

### Structural Interpretation:
The NMR data suggests a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a sec-butyl substituent. The substituent structure is consistent with a CH₂-CH(CH₂CH₂CH₃) group attached to the benzene ring. Thus, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Reaction Analysis:
The reaction involves red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for hydrolysis reactions, particularly converting nitriles to carboxylic acids. However, since Compound X is already a carboxylic acid, the reaction likely does not alter the carboxylic acid group. The product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Option Analysis:
- **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: This structure does not match the NMR data, as it would have a different substituent pattern and chain length.
- **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: This is not a carboxylic acid and does not match the IR or NMR data.
- **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: Matches the IR (carbonyl at 1720 cm⁻¹) and NMR data (broad peak at 10.5 ppm, aromatic protons, and sec-butyl substituent).
- **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: This is not a carboxylic acid and does not match the IR or NMR data.

### Conclusion:
The final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, which corresponds to option C.
