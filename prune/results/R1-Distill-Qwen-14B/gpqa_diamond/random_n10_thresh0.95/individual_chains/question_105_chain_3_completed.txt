Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about stars with spots and how they mimic the light curve of an exoplanet. Hmm, I've studied a bit about exoplanets and stars, but I'm not super confident about this. Let me think it through.

The question says that a star, similar in radius to the Sun, has one hemisphere covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, and the star's effective temperature is 6000K. The spots are 1000K cooler. The setup is that when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations that could look like an exoplanet transiting the star.

Wait, the question is asking what the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation as these spots. So, in other words, if the star didn't have spots, what exoplanet size would cause the same dip in brightness when it transits.

I remember that the change in brightness (the signal) is calculated based on the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula I think is delta F = (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area is proportional to the square of the radius. But wait, how does that apply here with the spots?

Oh, right, because the spots are cooler, when they face us, the star's total brightness decreases. The amount of decrease depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

So, the star's normal brightness without spots is based on its entire surface, but when spots are on the visible hemisphere, they reduce the observed flux. The flux from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = sigma * Teff^4. But since some areas are cooler, those spots contribute less.

The filling factor is 20%, so 20% of the visible hemisphere is covered by spots. Wait, but since it's one hemisphere, the total area covered by spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere. The area of a hemisphere is (4πR²)/2 = 2πR². So the spot area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Wait, no, wait. The filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. Oh, wait, no, the star is fully observed in one hemisphere at a time. So the spots are covering 20% of the surface that's facing us. So each spot on the hemisphere is 20% of that hemisphere's area.

Wait, maybe the filling factor is the fraction of the entire star's surface covered in spots. So, if the filling factor is 20%, then 20% of the entire star's surface is spots. But since the star's rotation shows only one hemisphere at a time, when a spot is in view, it's part of that 20%.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The filling factor (f) is the fraction of the visible hemisphere covered by spots. So f=0.2 means 20% of the hemisphere we see is spots. So the area of the spots is f * (π R²), since a hemisphere's area is 2π R², no wait, no. Wait, the area of a full sphere is 4π R². So a hemisphere is 2π R². So if the visible hemisphere is 2π R², and 20% of that is spots, the area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

Each spot has a temperature of Teff - 1000K = 5000K. So the total flux from the star without spots is F0 = sigma * T^4 * (4π R²) / 2, since we're seeing a hemisphere. Wait, actually, the star's total flux when we see a hemisphere is (sigma T^4) * (2π R²). But when spots are present, the flux is F0 minus the flux from the spots.

The flux without spots on the hemisphere: F0 = sigma T^4 * (2π R²) * (1 - f), no, wait. Oh no, F0 is the total flux with all the spots. Let me correct that.

Wait, the star's total flux when there are spots is sum of the spot flux and the unspotted area. The normal (unspotted) part is (1-f) * (2π R²), and the spots contribute f * (2π R²) * sigma T_spot^4 / sigma T_star^4? Wait, no. Each part emits according to its own temperature.

So the total flux when spots are present is F = (1 - f) * sigma T_star^4 * (2π R²) + f * sigma T_spot^4 * (2π R²) ?

Wait, actually, the flux is the sum over the visible surface. So each small area dA emits sigma T^4 dA. So for the unspotted part, it's (1-f) * 2π R² * sigma T^4. The spotted part is f * 2π R² * sigma (T_spot)^4.

So the total flux is F = sigma T^4 * 2π R² [ (1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T)^4 ].

Wait, that makes sense because if T_spot = T, then the flux is sigma T^4 * 2π R², which is the same as the unspotted case.

So in this problem, T = 6000 K, T_spot = 5000 K, f = 0.2.

So F = sigma (6000)^4 * 2π R² [ (0.8) + 0.2 * (5000/6000)^4 ]

Let me compute (5000/6000)^4. 5/6 is approximately 0.8333. 0.8333^4 is about (0.8333^2)^2. 0.8333^2 is about 0.6944, squared again is about 0.4823.

So F = sigma (6000)^4 * 2π R² [ 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.4823 ] = sigma (6000)^4 * 2π R² [0.8 + 0.09646] = sigma (6000)^4 * 2π R² * 0.89646.

Now, without any spots, the flux would be F0 = sigma (6000)^4 * 2π R². So the relative change in flux when the spots are visible is (F - F0)/F0.

Wait, but when the star is rotating, the spots come into view. Wait, the question is that the observed brightness variation is due to the spots, and this variation could be mistaken for a planet transit. So the amplitude of the variation is the same as that caused by a planet.

Wait, but the scenario is that the star's brightness variation is due to spots, and to produce the same amplitude as an exoplanet's transit, what would the planet's radius be?

So, the maximum dip in brightness due to the spots should be equal to the dip caused by the planet.

Wait, no. The spot is causing a dip in brightness when it's on the visible side. But the effect on the light curve is periodic as the star rotates.

But for an exoplanet transit, the dip is maximum when the planet blocks the center of the star, which is the brightest part. However, in the spot scenario, the dip is due to the spots being cooler. So perhaps the maximum dip is when the spot is at the center of the visible hemisphere. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

Wait, the question says that the situation can "closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet." So the variation in brightness would be similar when the star is spotty (as it rotates) compared to when a planet transits.

But for the purposes of calculating the amplitude, perhaps we can model the maximum dip caused by the spots and set that equal to the dip caused by a planet.

So the dip in brightness (delta F) when a spot is in view is (F0 - F) / F0, where F is the flux when the spot is present.

Wait, F is the flux when the spots are visible. So the dip would be (F0 - F)/F0. Let me compute that.

(F0 - F) = F0 [1 - (0.8 + 0.2*(5/6)^4)].

Which is F0 [1 - 0.89646] = F0 * 0.10354.

So the relative change is (0.10354) F0 / F0 = 0.10354, or about 10.35% dip.

Wait, no, wait. Wait when the spots are on the hemisphere, the total flux is F = F0 * 0.89646. So the dip is F0 - F = F0 (1 - 0.89646) = F0 * 0.10354. So relative to F0, the dip is about 10.35% of F0.

But wait, wait, that's the dip when the spots are on the visible hemisphere. So when the spot is moving in and out of view, the dip in brightness would be this 10% or so.

But in the case of the exoplanet, when the planet transits, the dip is (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is the area of the planet. So the flux dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

But wait, the star's flux is based on the entire surface, not just the hemisphere. Hmm, no. The star emits as a sphere, but when we observe it, we see a hemisphere. So the flux from the star is F = sigma Teff^4 * (2 pi Rstar^2).

So when a planet transits, the area blocked is pi (Rplanet)^2. The flux dip is delta F = (pi Rplanet^2) / (2 pi Rstar^2) ) * sigma Teff^4.

Which simplifies to (Rplanet^2) / (2 Rstar^2) ) * sigma Teff^4.

Wait, but the dip is (Rp / Rstar)^2 multiplied by some factor. Wait, no, let me correct that. The flux drop is (area blocked) / (area of the star's surface we see) times the flux per unit area.

The planet's area is pi R_p^2. The area of the star we see is 2 pi Rstar^2.

So the dip is (pi R_p^2) / (2 pi Rstar^2) ) = (R_p^2)/(2 Rstar^2) ). So the dip is (R_p/(sqrt(2) Rstar))^2.

Wait, but wait, that's the area blocked divided by the area of the hemisphere. So the fractional dip in flux is (R_p/(sqrt(2) Rstar))^2.

Hmm, but I'm not certain. Another approach is that the flux from the star is F = sigma T^4 * A, where A is the area (2 pi Rstar^2). When a planet with area A_p blocks part of it, the flux drops by A_p * sigma T^4. So the fractional dip is (A_p * sigma T^4) / (F) = A_p / (2 pi Rstar^2).

A_p is pi R_p^2. So dip is (pi R_p^2) / (2 pi Rstar^2) )= (R_p^2)/(2 Rstar^2) = (R_p/(sqrt(2) Rstar))^2.

So the dip is approximately (Rp/(1.414 Rstar))^2.

Wait, but wait, when the planet transits, it's blocking part of the star. So the maximum dip would be when the planet is in front of the center of the star, which is the brightest point.

Alternatively, perhaps the dip is simply (Rp / Rstar)^2 because the star's flux is F = sigma T^4 * (pi Rstar^2) * (2), since the entire star emits as a sphere, but we see a hemisphere. Wait, maybe I'm complicating it.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the dip in brightness for both cases and set them equal.

So, the dip due to spots is about 10.35% of the star's flux.

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-calculate the dip. The flux without spots (F0) is sigma T^4 * 2 pi Rstar^2.

The flux with spots (F) is sigma T^4 * 2 pi Rstar^2 * [0.8 + 0.2*(5000/6000)^4 ]

So, substituting the numbers:

5000 /6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333

(5/6)^4 = (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So,

F = F0 * [0.8 + 0.2 * 0.48225] = F0 * [0.8 + 0.09645] = F0 * 0.89645.

So F = 0.89645 F0.

The dip is F0 - F = F0 (1 - 0.89645) = F0 * 0.10355.

So the dip is about 10.355% of F0.

For the planet transit, the dip is (R_p / Rstar)^2 times the star's flux. Because the planet blocks an area of pi R_p^2 from the star's disk, which is 2 pi Rstar^2 in area.

So the dip for the planet is (pi R_p^2) / (2 pi Rstar^2) ) = (R_p^2) / (2 Rstar^2) ) = (R_p/(sqrt(2) Rstar))^2.

Wait, but that would imply the dip is (Rp/(1.414 Rstar))², which is about 0.5 (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Wait, but in the case of the planet, when it transits, the maximum dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 because you're blocking (Rp^2)/(Rstar^2) of the area. But wait, if the star is a sphere, the area we see is a hemisphere, 2 pi R^2. So the maximum dip is (Rp^2)/(Rstar^2) * (pi)/(2 pi) )= (Rp^2)/(2 Rstar^2).

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think of it this way: the fractional change in brightness when a planet transits is (A_planet / A_visible_star), where A_visible_star is the area of the star's surface we see (the hemisphere). So,

A_visible = 2 pi Rstar^2.

A_planet = pi R_p^2.

So delta F = A_planet / A_visible = (pi R_p^2) / (2 pi Rstar^2) ) = (R_p^2)/(2 Rstar^2).

So delta F is (R_p/(sqrt(2) Rstar))^2.

So, if the dip due to the spots is about 10.355% of F, and the dip due to the planet is (R_p/(sqrt(2) Rstar))^2, then we set them equal.

Wait, but wait. The dip due to the spots is 10.355% of F0, which is the flux without spots. But the planet dip is (R_p^2/(2 Rstar^2)) times F0.

Wait, no. The planet dip is (R_p^2/(2 Rstar^2)) * sigma T^4 * (2 pi Rstar^2) ) = (R_p^2/(2 Rstar^2)) * F0.

Wait, no, the dip is the same as the planet blocks part of the flux. So the dip is (R_p^2/(2 Rstar^2)) * F0.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me represent the dip from the planet as D_planet = (Rp^2)/(2 Rstar^2) ) * F0.

The dip from the spots is D_spots = 0.10355 F0.

We need D_planet = D_spots.

So,

(Rp^2)/(2 Rstar^2) ) * F0 = 0.10355 F0.

F0 cancels out.

So,

Rp^2 / (2 Rstar^2) = 0.10355.

Thus,

Rp^2 = 0.10355 * 2 Rstar^2.

Rp^2 = 0.2071 Rstar^2.

Taking square root,

Rp = sqrt(0.2071) Rstar ≈ 0.455 Rstar.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star, so Rp / Rstar ≈ 0.455.

But looking at the options, the choices are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, none of these are close to 0.45. So I must have made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I messed up with the dip calculations. Let me try another approach.

The dip due to the spots is 10.355% of F0. So delta F = 0.10355 F0.

The dip due to the planet is (Rp^2)/(Rstar^2) * (F0 / 2). Wait, no, earlier calculation had it as (Rp^2)/(2 Rstar^2) * F0.

Wait, but wait, another way: the maximum dip is when the planet blocks the center of the star, which is the brightest part. So the dip is (Rp^2)/(Rstar^2) * (intensity per unit area), but the intensity per unit area is the same everywhere because it's a blackbody.

So if the entire star emits as a blackbody, the flux per unit area is sigma T^4.

When the planet blocks an area of pi Rp^2, the dip in flux is pi Rp^2 * sigma T^4.

The total flux from the star is 2 pi Rstar^2 * sigma T^4.

So delta F = (pi Rp^2 / 2 pi Rstar^2) ) * sigma T^4 = (Rp^2)/(2 Rstar^2) sigma T^4.

So delta F / F0 = (Rp^2)/(2 Rstar^2) ).

So the relative dip is (Rp^2)/(2 Rstar^2) ) = 0.10355.

So,

Rp^2 = 0.10355 * 2 Rstar^2 = 0.2071 Rstar^2.

Rp = sqrt(0.2071) Rstar ≈ 0.455 Rstar.

Hmm, same result as before. But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the spot's effect is different. Maybe the dip isn't the maximum dip, but the average variation as the star rotates?

Wait, no, the question says that the brightness variation due to the spots is periodic and has the same amplitude as the exoplanet. So the maximum dip is what's important.

Wait, unless I messed up the calculation of the spot's effect.

Let me re-calculate the spot's effect.

Flux without spots (the star's full flux when no spots are visible) is F0 = sigma T^4 * 2 pi Rstar^2.

Flux when spots are visible is F = sigma T^4 [ (1 - f) * 2 pi Rstar^2 + f * 2 pi Rstar^2 (T_spot / T)^4 ]

= sigma T^4 * 2 pi Rstar^2 [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot / T)^4 ]

So,

F = F0 * [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot / T)^4 ]

Then, the dip is F0 - F = F0 - F0 [ (1-f) + f (T_spot^4 / T^4) ]

= F0 [ 1 - (1 -f) - f (T_spot^4 / T^4) ]

= F0 [ f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T^4) ) ]

So,

delta F = F0 * f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T^4) )

Ah! I think that's a better way to write it.

So,

delta F = F0 * f (1 - (T_spot / T)^4 )

In this case, f = 0.2, T =6000 K, T_spot =5000 K.

So,

delta F = F0 * 0.2 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

Compute (5000/6000) = 5/6 ≈0.8333.

(5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4≈0.48225.

So,

delta F = F0 * 0.2 * (1 - 0.48225) = F0 * 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ F0 * 0.10355.

Which matches the earlier calculation.

So, the dip is approximately 10.355% of F0.

So, setting the planet's dip equal to this: (Rp^2)/(2 Rstar^2) ) = 0.10355.

So,

Rp^2 = 0.10355 * 2 Rstar^2 = 0.2071 Rstar^2.

Rp = sqrt(0.2071) Rstar ≈ 0.455 Rstar.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option A) ~0.39, D) ~0.32.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation. Let me check the math again.

Wait, 0.2071 is 0.2071. The square root of that is 0.455.

Hmm, but maybe I should consider the filling factor differently. Because the star has a filling factor of 20%, but it's only on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, only part of the spots are visible. Oh wait, the question says that "only one hemisphere is spotty." So when the star is viewed from Earth, the spots are on one side but as the star rotates, the spots come into view.

Wait, but the way the brightness variation works: when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is lower. When the other hemisphere (with no spots) is facing us, the flux is higher? No, because the other hemisphere isn't spotty. Wait, no. Wait, the star has spots covering 20% of one hemisphere, but the other hemisphere is spot-free.

So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and go out of view. So the maximum brightness occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum when the spotty one is.

Wait, I think I messed up earlier. The star's total flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is F. When the other hemisphere is visible (with no spots), the flux is F0, which is higher than F.

Wait, that's right. Because when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is higher.

So the dip is the difference between F0 (unspotted) and F (spotted), but the dip occurs when the spotted side is visible.

Wait, no, the variation is when the star rotates, the brightness goes from F0 (when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us) to F (spotted hemisphere facing us). So the dip is F0 - F = 0.10355 F0.

But wait, the problem is that when the planet transits, the dip is when the planet blocks part of the star. So the dip is (R_p^2/ (2 Rstar^2)) * F0.

So setting (R_p^2)/(2 Rstar^2) ) = 0.10355.

Which gives Rp ≈ 0.455 Rstar. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the brightness variation due to the spots is a periodic dimming and brightening as the star rotates. So the amplitude of the variation is (F_max - F_min)/2, perhaps.

Wait, when the star shows the spotty side, the flux is F = F0 * 0.89645. When the other side is shown, the flux is higher, F0 (since no spots are visible on that side). So the amplitude would be (F_max - F_min)/2 = (F0 - F)/2.

Wait, no, if we're measuring the variation in brightness, the amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness.

Wait, when the star is viewed as the unspotted side, flux is F0. When the spotty side is viewed, flux is F, which is F0 * 0.89645. So the maximum flux is F0, the minimum is F.

So the amplitude is (F0 - F) = 0.10355 F0.

But for the planet, the amplitude is the dip, which is (R_p^2)/(2 Rstar^2) F0.

So setting:

(R_p^2)/(2 Rstar^2) F0 = 0.10355 F0.

Which again gives Rp ≈ 0.455 Rstar. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the dip for the planet. Let's think differently.

The dip when a planet transits is (Rp^2)/(Rstar^2) times the flux from the star's surface. Wait, perhaps the star's brightness is calculated as a full sphere, not a hemisphere.

Wait, the star emits as a full sphere, but we observe a hemisphere. So the total flux from the star is F0 = sigma Teff^4 * (4 pi Rstar^2) * 0.5, because we see half the sphere.

Wait, no. The star emits as a full sphere, so the total flux is sigma Teff^4 * 4 pi Rstar^2. But when observed from Earth, we see a hemisphere, so the observed flux is F_obs = sigma Teff^4 * 2 pi Rstar^2.

So when a planet transits, it blocks part of the star's disk. The area blocked is pi Rp^2, which is a fraction (pi Rp^2)/(2 pi Rstar^2) ) = Rp^2/(2 Rstar^2) of the observed area.

So the dip in flux is delta F = (Rp^2)/(2 Rstar^2) * F_obs.

Wait, F_obs is 2 pi Rstar^2 sigma T^4. So delta F = (Rp^2/(2 Rstar^2)) * 2 pi Rstar^2 sigma T^4 = pi Rp^2 sigma T^4.

But the dip relative to F_obs is (pi Rp^2 sigma T^4) / (2 pi Rstar^2 sigma T^4) ) = Rp^2/(2 Rstar^2) ≈ 0.10355.

So, same as before.

Hmm, but the answer option is not matching. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the spot's effect.

Wait, another approach: maybe the effective area of the spots is not simply 20% of the hemisphere but 20% of the entire star? Because the filling factor could be the fraction of the entire star's surface covered by spots.

The star's total surface area is 4 pi Rstar^2. If the filling factor is 20%, then the spots cover 0.2 * 4 pi Rstar^2 = 0.8 pi Rstar^2.

But since we're viewing only a hemisphere (2 pi Rstar^2), the number of spots visible depends on the rotation. When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover 0.2* the hemisphere, which is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused again. Let me clarify:

Filling factor (f) is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So if f=0.2, 20% of the star's surface is spots.

The star's surface area is 4 pi R^2. So spots occupy 0.2 * 4 pi R^2 = 0.8 pi R^2.

But when we observe the star, we see a hemisphere of 2 pi R^2. So the area of spots visible depends on if they are on the hemisphere or not.

If the spots are distributed such that they cover 20% of the entire star, then when the star rotates, the visible hemisphere could have varying amounts of spots. But the question says that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots. So perhaps the entire hemisphere is covered by spots, but with a filling factor of 20%—no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the star's one hemisphere is 20% covered by spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2 pi R^2) = 0.4 pi R^2.

In that case, when the star rotates and the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots contribute less flux. The calculation would then be similar to before.

So, when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

F = (1 - f) * 2 pi R^2 sigma T^4 + f * 2 pi R^2 sigma T_spot^4.

Wait, but f is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots, so f=0.2.

So,

F = 2 pi R^2 sigma T^4 (0.8 + 0.2*(T_spot/T)^4 )

But T_spot is 5000 K.

So,

F = 2 pi R^2 sigma (6000)^4 [ 0.8 + 0.2*(5000/6000)^4 ]

Which is the same as before. So delta F = F0 - F = F0 * 0.10355.

So same dip as before.

Thus, the dip is 10.355% of F0.

So, back to the planet.

We set (Rp^2)/(2 Rstar^2) = 0.10355.

Rp^2 = 0.2071 Rstar^2.

Rp = 0.455 Rstar.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculate the dip. Maybe the dip is not the same as the planet, but the amplitude of brightness variation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the star's brightness variation is not just a dip when the spots are visible, but also a brightening when the spots are not visible. So the amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness.

Wait, when the star is viewed with the spotty hemisphere, F = F0 * 0.89645.

When the other hemisphere is viewed (unspotted), F = F0 * (1 - f) * (1) + 0.2 * (T_spot/T)^4. No, wait, when viewing the unspotted hemisphere, the entire 2 pi R^2 is unspotted. So, in that case, the flux is F_unspotted_hemisphere = sigma T^4 * 2 pi R^2.

So when that hemisphere is visible, F = F0.

When the other hemisphere is visible, F = F0 * 0.89645.

So the maximum brightness is F0, the minimum is 0.89645 F0.

The amplitude of the variation is (F0 - 0.89645 F0)/2 = 0.051775 F0.

Wait, no, the amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/2, right? Because the light curve goes up and down around an average. So the average would be (F0 + 0.89645 F0)/2 = 0.948225 F0.

The amplitude is the difference from the average to the maximum or minimum. So the amplitude is (F0 - 0.948225 F0) = 0.051775 F0.

Alternatively, the peak-to-peak variation is F0 - 0.89645 F0 = 0.10355 F0, which is the same as the dip. So the amplitude could be considered as 0.10355 / 2 = 0.051775 F0.

But for the planet transit, the dip is 0.10355 F0 (since it blocks, so the amplitude would be the dip).

Wait, maybe this is where I went wrong. The amplitude of the brightness variation is the peak-to-peak change divided by 2.

Wait, let me clarify:

When the star shows the spotty hemisphere, the flux is F = 0.89645 F0.

When it shows the unspotted, F = F0.

So the brightness varies between F0 and 0.89645 F0.

The amplitude of this variation is (F0 - 0.89645 F0) = 0.10355 F0.

Which is a 10.355% variation.

In the case of the planet, the transit causes a dip of 0.10355 F0.

So the dip is 0.10355 F0, which is the same as the spot-induced dip.

So, for the planet, the dip is (Rp^2)/(2 Rstar^2) F0 = 0.10355 F0.

Which again gives Rp = sqrt(0.2071) Rstar ≈ 0.455 Rstar.

But this leads to the same problem, as the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the dip as a fraction of the entire star's flux, not the observed hemisphere's.

Wait, the star's total flux is F_total = sigma T^4 * 4 pi Rstar^2.

When the star is viewed from Earth, we see a hemisphere, so F_obs = F_total / 2 = 2 pi Rstar^2 sigma T^4.

When the spotty hemisphere is visible, F_obs = 2 pi Rstar^2 [ sigma T^4 * (0.8) + sigma T_spot^4 * 0.2 ].

So,

F_obs = 2 pi Rstar^2 sigma T^4 * (0.8 + 0.2 (T_spot/T)^4 )

= F_total / 2 * (0.8 + 0.2 (T_spot/T)^4 )

= (F_total / 2) * 0.89645.

So F_obs = 0.89645 * F_total / 2 = 0.89645 * F_obs.

Wait, that's the same as before. So the dip is 10.355% of F_obs.

So the dip is same as when we calculated before.

So the planet dip must be 10.355% of F_obs.

Thus,

(Rp^2)/(2 Rstar^2) ) = 0.10355.

So Rp is 0.455 Rstar. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the star's total flux, not the observed hemisphere.

If the star's total flux is F_total = sigma T^4 * 4 pi R^2.

When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux received is F_obs = (2 pi R^2) * [ (1 - f) sigma T^4 + f sigma T_spot^4 ].

The F_total would be 4 pi R^2 sigma T^4.

So, the observed flux when spots are visible is F_obs_spots = [ (1-f) sigma T^4 + f sigma T_spot^4 ] * 2 pi R^2.

The F_total is 4 pi R^2 sigma T^4.

So, the ratio F_obs_spots / F_total = [ (1-f) + f (T_spot^4 / T^4) ] * (2 pi R^2 sigma T^4) / (4 pi R^2 sigma T^4) ) 

= [ (1-f) + f (T_spot^4 / T^4) ] * (2 pi / 4 pi )

= [ (1-f) + f (T_spot^4 / T^4) ] * 0.5.

In our case, [0.8 + 0.2*(0.48225) ] * 0.5 = [0.8 + 0.09645] * 0.5 = 0.89645 * 0.5 = 0.448225.

So F_obs_spots = 0.448225 * F_total.

When the unspotted hemisphere is visible,

F_obs_unspots = 2 pi R^2 sigma T^4 = (2 pi R^2 sigma T^4) / (4 pi R^2 sigma T^4) ) * F_total = 0.5 F_total.

So, the brightness varies between 0.5 F_total and 0.448225 F_total.

The dip is 0.5 F_total - 0.448225 F_total = 0.051775 F_total.

The amplitude of the variation is 0.051775 F_total.

Wait, but when the planet transits, the dip is (Rp^2)/(Rstar^2) * (F_obs / F_total) ?

Wait, perhaps I need to express the dip in terms of the total flux.

Wait, I'm getting too confused. Another approach: perhaps I should calculate the ratio of the brightness variation caused by the spots to that caused by the planet.

Wait, the dip due to the spots is (F_obs_unspots - F_obs_spots) = 0.5 F_total - 0.448225 F_total = 0.051775 F_total.

The dip due to the planet is (pi Rp^2) / (4 pi Rstar^2) ) * F_total = (Rp^2)/(4 Rstar^2) F_total.

Wait, because when the planet transits, the area blocked is pi Rp^2. The total area of the star is 4 pi Rstar^2. So the dip is (pi Rp^2)/(4 pi Rstar^2) ) F_total.

So,

(Rp^2)/(4 Rstar^2) F_total = 0.051775 F_total.

So,

Rp^2/(4 Rstar^2) = 0.051775.

Rp^2 = 0.2071 Rstar^2.

Rp = sqrt(0.2071) Rstar ≈ 0.455 Rstar.

Same result again.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the spot-induced brightness variation correctly and then find the planet radius that would cause the same dip.

Another possibility: perhaps the star's radius is the same as the Sun's. So Rstar = R_sun.

But wait, the question doesn't mention the Sun's radius, but the exoplanet radius is relative to the star's radius. So perhaps the units are not important.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I confused the dip as the fraction of the observed flux, but in reality, the planet blocks a part of the star's disk, which may have a different effect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the brightness variation when the spots rotate into and out of view and model it as an amplitude, and then set that equal to the planet's dip.

Wait, the brightness variation amplitude is the difference between when the star is at maximum brightness (unspotted hemisphere) and minimum (spotted hemisphere), so the amplitude is 0.10355 F_obs.

Wait, but for the planet, the amplitude is when the planet blocks part of the star, so the dip is (Rp^2)/(2 Rstar^2) F_obs.

Setting 0.10355 F_obs = (Rp^2)/(2 Rstar^2) F_obs.

So,

Rp = sqrt(0.2071) Rstar ≈ 0.455 Rstar.

But no option matches. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial spot calculation.

Wait, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, not the hemisphere.

So, when the star's entire surface has 20% spots, the area of the spots is 0.2 * 4 pi R^2 = 0.8 pi R^2.

But when we see a hemisphere (2 pi R^2), the number of spots visible depends on the rotation. So when the star rotates, sometimes we see more spots, sometimes fewer.

Wait, but the question states that one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the entire hemisphere is covered by spots, but each spot only covers 20% of the hemisphere.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. The filling factor is the fraction of the surface that is covered. So if the entire hemisphere is covered by spots, the filling factor for that hemisphere would be 100%. But in this case, the filling factor is 20%, so the hemisphere has 20% spots.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the effect of the spots on the star's brightness when they are on the same side as the observer. The star's brightness when the spots are facing us is F = F0 * [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / T^4) ].

That gives a dip of F0 - F = F0 * f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T^4) ) = 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) F0.

Which is 0.2 * (1 - 0.48225) ≈ 0.2 * 0.51775 = 0.10355 F0.

So the dip is 10.355% of F0.

So, to get the same dip, the planet's radius must satisfy (Rp^2)/(2 Rstar^2) = 0.10355.

Rp = sqrt(0.2071) Rstar ≈ 0.455 Rstar.

But again, options don't match. So perhaps the question is using a different approach.

Another thought: perhaps the spot's effect on the light curve is similar to the planet's transit. The total variation in brightness (i.e., the peak-to-peak) is twice the dip. So the amplitude is the dip. Or perhaps the amplitude is the dip.

Wait, perhaps for the planet, the amplitude is the dip, and for the star, the amplitude is the dip. So comparing the dips.

So, dip for star: 10.355% of F0.

Dip for planet: (Rp^2)/(2 Rstar^2) F0.

Set equal, get Rp ≈ 0.455 Rstar. No matching option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the dip due to the spots. Let me recompute.

Compute (5000/6000)^4:

(5/6)^4 = (625/1296) ≈ 0.48225.

So, 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Multiply by f=0.2: 0.2 * 0.51775 = 0.10355.

So the dip is 10.355% of F0.

So, for the planet, dip = (Rp^2)/(2 Rstar^2) = 0.10355.

So, Rp = sqrt(2 * 0.10355) * Rstar.

sqrt(0.2071) ≈ 0.455. So Rp ≈ 0.455 Rstar.

But no option matches. So perhaps the correct approach is to find the radius where the planet's transit causes a dip of 0.10355.

Wait, but perhaps the star's radius is larger than the Sun's? No, the question says the star's radius is equal to the Sun's.

Hmm. Maybe the question reversed the dip and amplitude. So the amplitude is twice the dip.

Wait, the star's brightness varies between F0 and F, so the peak-to-peak is 0.10355 F0, and the amplitude is half that, 0.051775 F0.

So for the planet, the amplitude is the dip, which is (Rp^2)/(2 Rstar^2) F0 = 0.051775 F0.

So,

(Rp^2)/(2 Rstar^2) = 0.051775.

Rp^2 = 0.10355 Rstar^2.

Rp = sqrt(0.10355) Rstar ≈ 0.3218 Rstar.

Ah! Now that's about 0.32 Rstar. Which matches option D) ~0.32.

So, why did I think the amplitude was the dip before?

Because the planet transit dip is the maximum dip, which is the amplitude.

But when the star's brightness varies, the amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation divided by two.

So in this case, the peak-to-peak is 0.10355 F0. So the amplitude is half that, 0.051775 F0.

So, setting the planet's dip (which is the amplitude) to 0.051775 F0.

Thus,

(Rp^2)/(2 Rstar^2) ) = 0.051775.

So sqrt(0.10355) Rstar is approximately 0.322 Rstar.

Which is option D) ~0.32.

Ah, that makes sense now. So the mistake was in considering the amplitude as the peak-to-peak variation, not the dip. So the correct calculation is that the amplitude is half the dip, leading to a planet radius of ~0.32 Rstar.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star with dark spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor \( f = 0.2 \).
   - Spots are cooler, with \( T_{\text{spot}} = T_{\text{eff}} - 1000 \, \text{K} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's flux without spots is \( F_0 = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \cdot 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is reduced:
     \[
     F = F_0 \cdot \left[ (1 - f) + f \cdot \left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}}\right)^4 \right].
     \]
   - Substituting \( f = 0.2 \), \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \):
     \[
     \left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 \approx 0.48225.
     \]
     \[
     F = F_0 \cdot \left[ 0.8 + 0.2 \cdot 0.48225 \right] = F_0 \cdot 0.89645.
     \]
   - The dip in flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is:
     \[
     \Delta F = F_0 - F = F_0 \cdot (1 - 0.89645) = F_0 \cdot 0.10355.
     \]

3. **Exoplanet Brightness Variation**:
   - The dip in brightness caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star:
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{planet}} = \frac{\pi R_{\text{planet}}^2}{2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2} \cdot F_0 = \frac{R_{\text{planet}}^2}{2 R_{\text{star}}^2} \cdot F_0.
     \]
   - To match the dip caused by the spots, we set:
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}^2}{2 R_{\text{star}}^2} = 0.10355.
     \]
   - Solving for \( R_{\text{planet}} \):
     \[
     R_{\text{planet}}^2 = 0.2071 \cdot R_{\text{star}}^2, \quad R_{\text{planet}} = \sqrt{0.2071} \cdot R_{\text{star}} \approx 0.455 \cdot R_{\text{star}}.
     \]

4. **Amplitude Consideration**:
   - The star's brightness variation amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation divided by 2. The peak-to-peak variation is \( 0.10355 \cdot F_0 \), so the amplitude is:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \frac{0.10355 \cdot F_0}{2} = 0.051775 \cdot F_0.
     \]
   - For the exoplanet, the amplitude is the same as the dip:
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}^2}{2 R_{\text{star}}^2} = 0.051775.
     \]
   - Solving for \( R_{\text{planet}} \):
     \[
     R_{\text{planet}}^2 = 0.10355 \cdot R_{\text{star}}^2, \quad R_{\text{planet}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \cdot R_{\text{star}} \approx 0.322 \cdot R_{\text{star}}.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.32 \cdot R_{\text{star}} \). This matches **Option D**.
