--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's take it step by step.

First, the question gives me some information about an unknown compound that's been analyzed using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. My goal is to match the data with one of the four options provided.

Let me look at each piece of data one by one and see what information I can extract.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The very broad absorption peak at around 3000 cm⁻¹ probably indicates an -OH group. Broad peaks around that region are typical for alcohols or maybe even carboxylic acids, but the presence of other peaks might help differentiate. Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, I remember that carbonyl groups (C=O) show up around 1700. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or something else. Wait, maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation? Or perhaps an ester or ketone? Alternatively, maybe an amide? But wait, the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not an amide. Could it be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds? Because aromatic rings (like in benzene) have C=C stretching around 1600-1680 cm⁻¹. So maybe the 1650 is from that.

Wait, but the first peak is at 1700. That's a strong carbonyl, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. But a conjugated carbonyl would absorb at a slightly lower wavenumber, maybe around 1680. So maybe the 1700 is an ester or ketone, and 1650 is an aromatic ring. Alternatively, maybe 1650 is an amide, but again, no N in the formula.

So, possible functional groups: likely an alcohol (from the broad peak), a carbonyl (1700), and maybe an aromatic ring (1650).

Next, the ¹H NMR spectrum has peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has an alkene group. That would fit with the aromatic ring perhaps, but not necessarily. Wait, but if the compound has an aromatic ring, that's a conjugated system with double bonds. So maybe the vinyl H's are from an alkene elsewhere, or part of a ring.

Moving on to the Mass Spectrometry data: a fragment peak at m/z =45. What could that correspond to? The most common fragment at 45 is usually the CH3CO+ ion, which has a mass of 45 (12*2 + 1*3 +16*2=45). Wait, no, 12+1+ (12+16*2) = no, wait, CH3CO is C2H3O2? Wait, no. Let me think: CH3CO+ would be (CH3CO)+ which is (12*2 + 1*3 + 16*2) =24 +3 +32=59. Wait, that's 59. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another possibility is the tropylium ion, which is C7H7+ but that's 91. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the m/z 45 is the ethylene glycol fragment? No, that would be different. Wait, perhaps it's the methyl group attached to something else. Alternatively, maybe it's the (CH2O) group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The molecular formula is one of C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2. Let's see the molecular weights.

C6H12O: 6*12 +12 +16 =72+12+16=100.

C6H10O:72+10+16=98.

C6H10O2:72+10+32=114.

C6H12O2:72+12+32=116.

In mass spec, the molecular ion would correspond to the molecular weight. So the molecular ion would be at 100, 98, 114, or 116. But the question mentions a fragment at 45. So maybe the molecule breaks into a fragment with a mass of 45. Let's think about what could give that.

Looking for a fragment of 45. Let's compute possible combinations:

45 = 12a +1b +16c. Let's see:

Possible combinations:

- CH3O: 12 + 16 +1? No, CH3O is 12+16+3=31.

Wait, wait, 45 is 45. So, maybe C3H3O: 3*12=36, 3 H=3, 16 O=16. 36+3+16=55. That's too high.

Alternatively, maybe it's just methyl group plus something else. Wait, another approach—common fragments. For example, the (CH2)2O fragment. Wait, that's 46. Close but not quite. Hmm.

Wait, another idea. Maybe the fragment is the ketene ion, O=C=CH2? No, that's more complicated. Alternatively, a fragment like CH3CO (which would be 59), but that's higher than 45.

Wait, maybe it's a CH3 group attached to an oxygen somewhere else. Alternatively, perhaps a CH3-O- group plus another part. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another possible fragment is a (CH3)2CO+ ion, but that's 58 (46 for (CH3)2CO would be 46? Wait, (CH3)2CO is (30 (CH3)2) + 12 (C) + 16 (O))=58. No, that's higher than 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is CH3-O-CH2, but that would be 15 (CH3O) plus 14 (CH2), but that doesn't add up to 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is an acetate group. Acetate is CH3COO-, which has a molecular weight of 60. Hmm, but that's higher than 45.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the options and see which one can produce a fragment of 45.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular formula is C6H12O2. So possible fragments? Let's see, a possible fragment could be C3H6O2. Wait, that's 3*12=36 +6=42 +32=78? No, no. Alternatively, maybe a smaller fragment.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the compound is one of these, and the mass spec shows a fragment at 45. So perhaps the molecular formula when broken down includes a 45 fragment.

Wait, let me think about each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Formula is C6H12O2. Molecular weight is 116. If the fragment is 45, perhaps the molecule breaks into two parts: 45 and 71 (since 116-45=71). Not sure if 71 is a common fragment.

Option B: C6H10O. Formula is C6H10O. MW is 98. So if it breaks into 45 and 53, perhaps. 53 is a possible CH2CH2O? Not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. Formula is C6H10O2, MW=114. 114-45=69. Hmm, 69 is possible as C4H9O? Not sure.

Option D: C6H12O. Formula is C6H12O, MW=100. 100-45=55. Hmm, 55 could be C3H7O2? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the 45 fragment is a common group. Let me think: 45 is 12*3 + 1*3 + 16*1=36+3+16=55. Wait, that's not 45. Wait, maybe 45 is 12*2 + 1*3 + 16*2 =24+3+32=59, nope. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible functional groups. The FTIR shows a broad peak, which suggests an -OH group. The absorption at 1700 and 1650 suggests a carbonyl and maybe conjugated double bonds or an aromatic ring.

So, maybe the compound is an aromatic ester or something similar. Because esters have both carbonyl groups (about 1700-1750) and an -O- group.

Wait, for example, an aromatic ester like phenyl acetate would have a carbonyl (ester) at ~1700 and the aromatic ring's C=C at around 1650. The broad peak at 3000 would be the -OH from the ester.

So, if it's an ester, the formula would need to have an O in the ester group. Esters have the formula R-O-CO-R’.

So, let's see the options. The options with O2 are A and C.

Option A: C6H12O2. If it's an ester, then the formula would be (R-O-CO-R'), where R and R' are alkyl or aryl groups. The molecular formula for an ester is typically R-O-CO-R' → which would be (CnH2n+1O) (COOR'). So, let's see. For example, methyl propionate is C3H6O2.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula for an ester would be Cn+1H2(n+1)O2, but that's maybe getting too detailed.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Looking at the options, which of them fit with an ester? Let's see.

If the compound is an ester, it's likely to have the formula C6H12O2 (option A) or C6H10O2 (option C).

Now, looking at the NMR: it has vinyl hydrogens. So, the compound must have a double bond. In an ester, the carbonyl is double bonded. But the vinyl hydrogens could be part of an alkene elsewhere in the molecule.

Wait, if the compound has both an ester group and an alkene, that could explain the FTIR and NMR.

So, maybe the compound is something like methyl vinyl benzoate or similar. Wait, but the molecular formula would need to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an aromatic ester with a double bond.

But wait, if the ester is something like phenyl propionate, it would have a benzene ring (so the 1650 cm-1 peak), the ester carbonyl at 1700, and the -OH from the ester (broad peak). Also, if there's an alkene in the ester, like in vinyl ester, the NMR would have vinyl H's.

Wait, let me think about the molecular formula. Suppose the compound is an ester with a vinyl group.

For example, methyl vinyl benzoate would be: benzoate (C6H5COO-) ester with vinyl group. The structure would be C6H5COOCH2CH2CH2CH2? Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So methyl vinyl benzoate would be C6H5COOCH2CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, methyl would be CH3-O-CO- etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the structure might be something like methyl acrylate, which is CH2=CHCOOCH3. That's a vinyl ester. Its formula is C4H6O2.

But in our case, the formula is C6H something O2. So maybe the compound is a larger ester with a vinyl group.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula includes O2, which points to either an ester, a ketone plus an alcohol, or another combination.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a diester. Or maybe a beta-keto ester.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester, but that seems less likely.

Let me think about the mass spec again. If the fragment is at 45, which is 45 g/mol. Let's compute what that could be. 45 is 12*3 + 1*3 + 16*0 =39? No, that's not 45. Alternatively, C3H1O: 3*12=36, 1 H=1, O=16: 36+1+16=53. Hmm, not 45.

Wait, another approach: 45 is 45/12 = 3.75 carbons. Maybe a fragment with 3 carbons. Let's see: 3 carbons can be CH3COO- (which is 59), but that's larger than 45.

Wait, maybe a CH2CH2O group? No, that would be 48.

Wait, maybe it's a (CH3)2CO group? That's (CH3)2CO which is 58. No.

Wait, perhaps it's a CH2O group. That's 30. Not 45.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the fragment is from a different part of the molecule. Let's think about the molecular formulas again.

Option A: C6H12O2. Let's calculate the possible degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N.

C=6, H=12, O=2.

So, (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. That could be a ring or a double bond.

But the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. So with one degree, it's either a ring and a double bond (but that would be two degrees), which doesn't fit. Wait, no, the formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for option A: 2*6 +2=14. 14 -12=2. 2/2=1. So one degree, which could be a ring or a double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl H's, so a double bond. So perhaps one double bond and the rest single bonds, but that would require that the molecular formula has one double bond.

Wait, but if the compound has a benzene ring, which has three double bonds, that would require three degrees, which would not fit with option A, which only has one degree.

Wait, that's a problem. If the compound has an aromatic ring, which has three degrees, then the formula would need to have higher degrees. So, let's compute for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2: degrees =1. So only one double bond or ring.

But if it's an aromatic compound, like benzene, that's 4 degrees (3 from benzene and 1 from something else). Wait, benzene is 3 degrees because it has three double bonds. So, a benzene ring would contribute 3 degrees. Then, an ester group would add more.

Wait, maybe it's not an aromatic compound. Maybe it's a cyclohexene ring (one ring, one double bond). So that's two degrees (the ring and the double bond). But option A only has one degree. So that's not possible.

Hmmm, this is getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps the compound isn't aromatic. Let's think about the FTIR. The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ could be a conjugated carbonyl, maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. That would explain the 1650 peak. So, maybe the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Such as something like CH2=CHCOO-R.

Wait, let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation for option C: C6H10O2.

Degrees: 2*6+2=14. 14-10=4. 4/2=2 degrees.

So two degrees: could be a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, etc.

If the compound has a double bond (from the vinyl H's) and another double bond in the ester, that would fit. Alternatively, an aromatic ring and a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, but if the compound has an aromatic ring (which is three degrees), that would require more than two degrees. So maybe it's not aromatic. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene and an ester group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like methyl vinyl benzoate, but that would have a benzene ring (3 degrees) and the ester and the double bond, which would be more than two degrees. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe the structure isn't aromatic. Let's think about an ester with an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group. Like CH2=CHCOOR.

For example, methyl acrylate: CH2=CHCOOCH3. Its formula is C4H6O2. That's 4 carbons, 6 hydrogens, which doesn't match any of our options except maybe option C, which is C6H10O2. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the molecular formula. The options are for six carbons.

So, perhaps the compound is an ester with a vinyl group, like vinyl benzoate, but more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted acrylate. For example, CH2=CHCOO-C3H6- something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is C6H10O2. Let's see, degrees of unsaturation is 2, so likely a double bond and a ring (but wait, a ring would be a degree of unsaturation). Wait, degrees of unsaturation is 2, so two rings or two double bonds, or one ring and one double bond.

But if the structure has a double bond (from vinyl H's) and another double bond in the ester (like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester), that would account for two degrees. So, the structure would have a conjugated double bond in the ester group and another double bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester with a double bond.

But I'm not making much progress here. Let me think about the Mass Spec fragment again. 45 is a small number. Maybe it's a methylene group attached to something. For example, a CH2-O-CH2 group? No, that's 44, which is close. Hmm.

Another approach: The molecular formula of the compound is one of the four. Let's compute the possible molecular weight and see if any of them could have a fragment of 45.

Option A: C6H12O2 → MW=116. If the molecule breaks into 45 and 71, but 71 is not a common fragment.

Option B: C6H10O → MW=98. If it breaks into 45 and 53, which could be (CH3)2CH-OH but unsure.

Option C: C6H10O2 → MW=114. If it breaks into 45 and 69, which could be something like C4H9O2, but not sure.

Option D: C6H12O → 100. Breaks into 45 and 55. 55 could be C3H7O2? I'm not sure.

Hmm, maybe the fragment is not part of the main molecule but something else. Alternatively, perhaps the 45 is part of a functional group.

Wait, another possibility is that the fragment is from a ketone. The mass of a ketone group is O=C-R. For example, if R is CH3, the fragment would be (CH3CO)+, which is 58. But we have a fragment at 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is (CH2O), which is formaldehyde, but that's 30. No.

Wait, another idea: the 45 could be the benzene ring's tropylium ion, but that's 91, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a smaller fragment, like a CH3CH2O group. Wait, that's 46 (12 + 2*1 + 16 + 2*1? No, CH2CH2O is 46). Close to 45 but not exactly.

Wait, maybe it's a CH2CH2 group with an O, but that would be 46.

Hmm, not making progress with the mass spec. Let me go back to the other data.

The FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, which is likely -OH. The 1700 cm⁻¹ is a carbonyl, so ester, ketone, aldehyde, etc. The 1650 is maybe an aromatic ring or another carbonyl.

But in an ester, the carbonyl is usually around 1700. If there's an aromatic ring, which has C=C, that would be around 1600-1650 cm⁻¹. So, that explains the 1650 peak.

So, the compound is likely an aromatic ester, meaning it has a benzene ring (so the 1650 peak) and an ester group (carbonyl at 1700 and -OH at 3000).

So, the formula must be C6H10O2 (option C) or C6H12O2 (option A), because those are the only options with two oxygen atoms.

Wait, let me compute the degrees of unsaturation for each.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2 degrees. So two rings or double bonds.

If the compound has a benzene ring (3 degrees) and an ester (which has one double bond), that's four degrees, which doesn't fit. So that can't be.

Ah, wait, but aromatic rings have 4 degrees of unsaturation (three from the ring and one from the double bonds, but wait, no. Benzene has three double bonds, which is three degrees. So, the benzene ring contributes three degrees. The ester group (R-O-CO-R') has one double bond (the carbonyl), which is another degree. So, total degrees would be four.

But option C allows for only two degrees. So that's a contradiction. Thus, the compound can't be an aromatic ester, because that would require four degrees, but option C only allows two.

Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe it's not aromatic, but another structure.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a cyclic ester, which is a lactone. A lactone has the ester group within a ring. For example, a six-membered ring lactone would have a ring (one degree) and a carbonyl (another degree). So that's two degrees, which fits option C's degrees.

So, a lactone would have the ester group as part of the ring. Then, the FTIR would show the carbonyl at 1700, and the -OH from the lactone. Also, if the ring is unsaturated (like a cyclic ester with a double bond), that would add another degree, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, but lactones are usually saturated. So, let's see. If it's a lactone, then the structure would have a ring and a carbonyl. So, degrees of unsaturation would be two (one ring, one double bond). That fits option C.

But where does the vinyl hydrogen come into play? The NMR shows peaks for vinyl H's, meaning a double bond. So the lactone would need to have a double bond elsewhere.

Hmm, perhaps the lactone has an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester group. That would mean the ester's carbonyl is conjugated with a double bond. So, the structure would be something like O=C-O-R with a double bond adjacent.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about the molecular formulas again.

Option C: C6H10O2. Formula would allow for a structure that's a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond somewhere else.

But I'm not sure. Let me think of another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diester. For instance, if it's an ester with two ester groups. But that would require more oxygen atoms, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps the compound has a ketone group and an alcohol. So, ketone's carbonyl at 1700, the broad peak is an -OH, and the 1650 peak could be a conjugated carbonyl or another group. But that would give the formula as C6H12O2 if it's a ketone and an ester or something. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the 1650 peak is from an amide, but there's no N in the formula.

Wait, another thought: the 1650 peak could be from a conjugated carbonyl group, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So, the structure has a C=O and a C=C adjacent. That's a possibility.

In that case, the FTIR would show the carbonyl at 1700 (lower than a regular ester because of conjugation) and the C=C at around 1650. The broad peak is from an -OH group.

So, the structure could be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, something like CH2=CHCO-O-R.

So, let's see. For option C: C6H10O2. If the structure is CH2=CHCO-O-C3H5, but I'm not sure about the exact arrangement.

Wait, maybe it's a six-membered ring with a conjugated double bond. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an ester with a vinyl group. The presence of vinyl H's in the NMR suggests this.

So, let's think about the molecular formula again. If the compound is, say, methyl vinyl benzoate, the formula would be C8H8O2. But that's not an option. So perhaps it's a smaller ester.

Wait, another idea: let's think of the possible esters with six carbons.

Suppose the ester is formed from a three-carbon acid and a three-carbon alcohol. Then, the ester would have six carbons. For example, if the acid is propanoic acid (CH2CH2COOH) and the alcohol is something else.

Wait, but maybe the ester has a vinyl group. For example, if the acid is acrylic acid (CH2=CHCOOH) and the alcohol is something like propanol, then the ester would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, which is methyl acrylate if it's propanol? No, methyl would be CH3-O-CO-CH2CH2CH2... Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, that's seven carbons. Not matching.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach: using the mass spec and the molecular formula.

The mass spec has a fragment at 45. Let's compute which of the options' molecular formulas could have a fragment with that mass.

Option A: C6H12O2 (116 g/mol). If the molecule breaks into a 45 fragment and another of 71, but 71 isn't a common fragment.

Option C: C6H10O2 (114 g/mol). If it breaks into 45 and 69, but 69 is not a common fragment.

Wait, another thought: the 45 fragment could be the (COO-) group. Wait, the COO- group is 12 + 16*2 =44. Close to 45 but not quite.

Alternatively, the fragment could be the (CH3COO-) group, which is 59. No.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a (CH2O) group. That's 30. No.

Alternatively, maybe the 45 is from a methyl group attached to an oxygen. CH3-O- would be 32. No.

Hmm, not getting anywhere. Let me think about the possible structures again.

If the compound has both an ester and a vinyl group, maybe it's a methyl vinyl ester with the formula C5H8O2. Wait, that's five carbons. But our options are for six.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like methyl 3-pentenoate. That would be CH2CHCOOCH3. The formula would be C5H8O2. Not matching any options.

Alternatively, maybe it's a six-carbon ester with a vinyl group. Let's say the ester is formed from a four-carbon acid and a two-carbon alcohol. For example, the acid is CH2CH2COOH (propanoic acid) and the alcohol is CH2CH3OH (ethanol). The ester would be CH2CH2COOCH2CH3. But that's five carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, the acid is CH2=CHCOOH (acrylic acid) and the alcohol is CH2CH2OH (propanol). The ester would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Formula is C6H10O2. Which is option C. Oh! That's possible.

So, the ester would have six carbons, ten hydrogens, and two oxygens. So formula is C6H10O2, which is option C.

Now, let's see if the spectroscopic data fits:

- FTIR: broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ (the -OH from the ester). Peaks at 1700 (carbonyl) and 1650 (the vinyl C=C from the acrylic acid part).

- ¹H NMR: has vinyl hydrogens, which are the CH2=CHCOO- part.

- Mass spec: fragment at 45. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, but the ester would have the structure CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Let's count the hydrogens: CH2=CHCOO has 3 carbons, with CH2=CH- (2 H), COO has 2 O's. The ester part is OCH2CH2CH3 (3 carbons), so total H:

CH2=CH: 2 H (each CH2 has 2 H). Wait, no, CH2=CH- would have two H's on the CH2 and one on the CH. Wait, no. The structure is CH2=CHCOO-O-R. So, the vinyl group has two H's on the CH2 and one on the CH, but wait, no. The structure is CH2=CHCOO..., which is CH2-CH2-COO, but with a double bond. So, the CH2=CH- group would have two H's on the CH2 and one H on the CH (but since it's a double bond, the CH would have one H). So, the vinyl H's would be the two H's on the CH2 and the one on the CH.

But the NMR would show peaks for the vinyl H's, which is consistent.

Now, the mass spec: the molecular ion would be 114 (C6H10O2). The fragment at 45 could be a part of the molecule. Let's think: the ester group is O-CO-O. If the molecule breaks after the ester oxygen, perhaps the fragment would be CH2=CHCOO- (which would have a mass of 72 (C3H4O2) → 3*12=36, 4 H=4, 32 O=32. 36+4+32=72. Not 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from the ethyl group. The ethyl group is OCH2CH2CH3. Its mass is 73 (C3H7O). But that's 73, not 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment comes from the vinyl part. The vinyl part is CH2=CHCOO. The fragment could lose the ethyl group. So, the CH2=CHCOO- would have a mass of 72. Still not 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule breaks into the acetate part. For example, the CH3COO- group would be 60 (12*2 + 1*3 + 16*2 = 24 +3 +32=59). No, that's 59.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think of the possible fragments. Another approach: 45 is 12 * 3 + (1 *3) + (16 *0) = 36+3=39. Not 45. Alternatively, 12*2 +1*1 +16*1=24+1+16=41. No. 12*1 +1*3 +16*1=12+3+16=31. No.

Wait, 45 could be C3H9O. Let me compute: 3*12=36, 9 H=9, O=16. 36+9+16=61. No. Hmm.

Wait, I'm stuck on this. Let me think about the other options.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6+2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or double bond.

But the FTIR has a broad peak (probably -OH), a carbonyl, and another peak. So, perhaps it's a cyclic ether with a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a secondary alcohol with a ketone. But then the formula would be C6H12O, which has one degree. If it's a ring and a ketone, that's two degrees, but option D only allows one. So that can't be.

So perhaps option D isn't the right choice.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation: (14-10)/2=2. So two rings or double bonds. If the compound has an ester (which would require O), but option B has only one O, so can't be an ester. So maybe a cyclic ether with a carbonyl group. But again, I'm not sure.

But the FTIR shows a carbonyl (1700), which would suggest an ester, ketone, or aldehyde. But option B has only one O, so ester is out. So maybe a ketone and an alcohol.

So, the structure could be a cyclohexanone with an alcohol group. But then, the FTIR would show the ketone at 1700, the -OH at 3000, and maybe another peak. But where would the 1650 come from? Maybe conjugated double bonds, but that doesn't fit with a cyclohexanone.

Hmm, perhaps the 1650 peak is from a conjugated carbonyl group, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, if the compound has a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, that could explain the 1700 and 1650 peaks. So, the structure would have a conjugated double bond and a ketone. But that would require two degrees of unsaturation, which matches option B's two degrees.

But then, the -OH (from FTIR) would have to be from an alcohol group. So, the structure would have a conjugated ketone and an alcohol. But the formula would be C6H10O, which is option B.

But then, the NMR shows vinyl H's, so a double bond is present. That would fit with the conjugated ketone.

But I'm not sure about the mass spec. If the fragment is 45, maybe that's from the aldehyde part, but I'm not certain.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to tie everything together.

The FTIR indicates a broad -OH (probably from an ester or alcohol), a strong carbonyl, and another peak (possibly aromatic or conjugated). The NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. The mass spec has a fragment at 45.

The two oxygen options are A (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2). Between these, option C has two degrees of unsaturation, which could be a conjugated ester with a double bond.

So, considering all, the most likely formula is C6H10O2, which is option C.


The problem involves identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### FTIR Analysis:
- A broad absorption peak at **3000 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of an -OH group, likely from an alcohol or ester.
- A strong absorption at **1700 cm⁻¹** indicates a carbonyl group (C=O), consistent with an ester, ketone, or aldehyde.
- A peak at **1650 cm⁻¹** could correspond to a conjugated carbonyl group or an aromatic ring.

### ¹H NMR Analysis:
- Peaks corresponding to **vinyl hydrogens** (H's on a double bond) indicate the presence of an alkene group.

### Mass Spectrometry:
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** is observed. This could correspond to a small fragment such as a methyl group or a related fragment.

### Molecular Formula Options:
The possible formulas are:
1. **C₆H₁₂O**  
2. **C₆H₁₀O**  
3. **C₆H₁₀O₂**  
4. **C₆H₁₂O₂**

#### Degrees of Unsaturation:
- **C₆H₁₂O**: Degrees of unsaturation = 1 (one double bond or ring).  
- **C₆H₁₀O**: Degrees of unsaturation = 2 (two double bonds or rings).  
- **C₆H₁₀O₂**: Degrees of unsaturation = 2 (two double bonds or rings).  
- **C₆H₁₂O₂**: Degrees of unsaturation = 1 (one double bond or ring).

### Analysis of Options:
1. **C₆H₁₂O**: This formula has only one degree of unsaturation, which is insufficient to account for the vinyl hydrogens (a double bond) and the carbonyl group. Additionally, it lacks the second oxygen required for an ester group. This option is unlikely.

2. **C₆H₁₀O**: This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which could account for the vinyl hydrogens and the carbonyl group. However, it has only one oxygen atom, which is insufficient for an ester group. This option is also unlikely.

3. **C₆H₁₀O₂**: This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which could correspond to a conjugated carbonyl group (C=O) and a double bond (C=C). The two oxygen atoms suggest the presence of an ester group, consistent with the FTIR data. The vinyl hydrogens in the NMR are also explained by the presence of the double bond. This option fits the data well.

4. **C₆H₁₂O₂**: This formula has only one degree of unsaturation, which is insufficient to account for the vinyl hydrogens. While it has two oxygen atoms, the lack of a second degree of unsaturation makes it inconsistent with the NMR data. This option is unlikely.

### Conclusion:
The most consistent formula with the given data is **C₆H₁₀O₂**, as it accounts for the broad -OH peak, the carbonyl group, the vinyl hydrogens, and the two oxygen atoms required for an ester group.

**Answer: C**
