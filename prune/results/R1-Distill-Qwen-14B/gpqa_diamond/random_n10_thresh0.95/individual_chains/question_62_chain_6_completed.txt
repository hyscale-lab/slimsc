--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize this compound: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I need to understand the target molecule. The name is a bit complicated, but let's parse it. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main cyclohexane ring has a substituent at position 1, which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group, and also a carbaldehyde group. Wait, no, the main chain is the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part. So, the cyclohexane ring has a carbaldehyde group (CHO) at position 1, and another substituent which is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group.

Wait, alternatively, the structure is: a cyclohexane ring with two substituents on carbon 1. One substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH), and the other is a formyl group (CHO). So, the molecule has a cyclohexane ring where one carbon (position 1) has two substituents: a cyclohexylmethyl group (but wait, no, it's cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl, which is -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl?), or wait, maybe it's -CH2- with a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. Hmm, perhaps structure-wise, it's -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)- attached to the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw it out mentally. So, the main ring is cyclohexane. At position 1, there's a methyl group attached. This methyl group has two substituents: one is a hydroxyl (OH), and the other is a cyclohexyl group. So, the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl), but wait, no, it's (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, which would be -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). So, the structure is cyclohexane with a substituent at C-1: that substituent is a CH group attached to OH and cyclohexyl. Also, the same position has a formyl group? No, wait, the main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexane has a carbaldehyde group (CHO) at position 1, and another substituent which is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl) at position 1? Or perhaps the substituent is a methyl group that's attached to both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group, along with the CHO group?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the parent chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, with substituents at position 1. The substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, the substituent is a methyl group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the substituent is -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). So, the molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group at position 1, and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group also at position 1.

Wait, but position 1 can't have two substituents if the main group is the CHO. Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think: IUPAC nomenclature can sometimes be tricky. The name might imply that the main chain is the cyclohexane ring with the substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the main part is the cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde group, and another substituent which is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group at the same position.

So, the molecule has two substituents on the same carbon of the cyclohexane ring: one is a formyl group (CHO), and the other is a CH(OH) connected to a cyclohexyl group. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring, with a carbon at position 1 that has both a CHO group and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached. That would make it a geminal di-substituted carbon (two substituents on the same carbon).

But wait, that would mean the same carbon has three substituents: two from the cyclohexane ring and two substituent groups. Wait, each carbon in cyclohexane is bonded to two other carbons in the ring, so a carbon in the ring can have two substituents in addition. So, the same carbon (C1) in the cyclohexane would have two substituents: CHO and CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). That makes sense.

So, the target is a cyclohexane ring with a C1 that has a CHO group and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

Now, starting from ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with an ethynyl (triple bond) group attached. So, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-ethyl, but with a triple bond between the two carbons connected to the ring. So, the structure is cyclohexane-C≡CH.

We need to convert this into the target molecule. Let's think about the possible reactions.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let me think about the steps needed to get to the target.

First, perhaps we can perform a hydration of the triple bond. Triple bonds can be hydrogenated in various ways. For example, using H2 with a catalyst like Lindlar's (which gives cis addition) or with a poisoned catalyst (like Na/NH3) which gives trans. Or, perhaps a different approach: maybe using Oxymercuration or some other hydration method.

Wait, but looking at the target molecule, there's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group. So, perhaps the ethynyl group needs to be converted into a CH(OH) group connected to a cyclohexane.

Wait, let's outline the possible steps.

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → something → introduces the cyclohexyl group and the hydroxyl group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using a Grignard reaction. Or maybe a Birch reduction. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond can be converted into a ketone or an aldehyde via some process.

Wait, let me think about each step. The target molecule has a formyl (CHO) group and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group on the same cyclohexane ring.

So, perhaps the starting ethynylcyclohexane can be converted into a di-substituted cyclohexane via two substitution reactions.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to deprotonate and introduce a methyl group or something else.

Looking at the options, the first reagents in the options are either NaNH2 with methyl chloride, ethyl chloride, methanol, etc.

NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. In the context of alkyne chemistry, perhaps it's used to generate a strong base for elimination or substitution.

Wait, for example, treating an alkyne with NaNH2 and an alkyl halide could lead to a substitution. Because, in such conditions, the triple bond's terminal hydrogen can be deprotonated, making it a good nucleophile. So, ethynylcyclohexane treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride would substitute the terminal CH with a methyl group. So, the triple bond would become a CH2 group.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is HC≡C-cyclohexane. So, when treated with a strong base like NaNH2, the terminal hydrogen (sp-hybridized) would be deprotonated to form a cyclohexyl-ethynide ion. Then, adding methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would result in an alkylation, giving CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane. Because the base deprotonates the alkyne, the CH3+ from CH3Cl would attack, leading to substitution.

So, step 1: using NaNH2 and methyl chloride would give CH3C≡C-cyclohexane.

But wait, in option C, the first reagent is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So that's what step 1 would do.

Then, what's next? Looking at the options, step 2 in option C is H2 with Pd-calcium carbonate, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So, hydrogenating the triple bond would convert it into a single bond, giving CH2CH2-cyclohexane? Wait, no. Wait, hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and catalyst (like Pd/BaSO4 or Lindlar) would normally add H2 across the triple bond.

Wait, but if the triple bond is CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane, hydrogenation would add two H's: H2 in presence of a catalyst (like Pd) would make it CH2-CH2-cyclohexane, but that's just a single bond, so CH2CH2 connected to cyclohexane. Wait, but that would give CH2CH2-cyclohexane, but actually, that would be 1,2-dihydrocyclohexane or something else. Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to think that hydrogenation of the alkyne would give an alkane, so CH2CH2, which is ethane. But that can't be right because the cyclohexane is connected.

Wait, wait. The structure after step 1 is CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane. When hydrogenated, it would become CH2CH2-cyclohexane, but that's not possible because it's a cyclohexane ring connected to a CH2CH2 group. So, that would be cyclohexane with an ethyl group attached. Wait, that's ethylcyclohexane. So, step 2 in option C would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, giving ethylcyclohexane.

But our target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to the CH(OH) group. So, perhaps we need to form a ring expansion or a ring-opening. Alternatively, maybe we should form a cyclohexyl group via some other method.

Wait, perhaps after the alkyne is hydrogenated, we can do some kind of oxidation or addition.

Wait, but looking at the target molecule, perhaps the ethyl group after hydrogenation needs to be oxidized. But ethyl groups usually oxidize to ketones if possible.

Wait, but the target has a formyl group (CHO) and a hydroxyl group attached. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a ketone.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the triple bond is converted into a ketone via oxymercuration or some hydration. Wait, but in the options, I don't see O3 or other oxidizing agents in the first steps.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option C: steps 1-4 are 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2.

Hmm, step 3 is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of what? If step 2 converts the alkyne into an alkene, then ozonolysis would break the double bond.

Wait, let's re-examine. Starting from ethynylcyclohexane:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane.

Step 2: H2/Pd → CH2CH2-cyclohexane (which is ethylcyclohexane). So, now we have ethylcyclohexane.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → Ozonolysis of ethylcyclohexane? Wait, ethylcyclohexane is a single bond, so ozonolysis isn't applicable. Ozonolysis is for alkenes or alkynes. So, if the hydrogenation is done in such a way that the triple bond becomes a double bond?

Wait, wait, perhaps the hydrogenation isn't complete. Like, perhaps using a different catalyst. Wait, if step 2 is H2 with Pd, that's probably a full hydrogenation, making the triple bond into a single bond.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps after step 1, we have a di-substituted alkyne. Then, hydrogenation would yield a di-substituted alkene. So, perhaps step 2 doesn't hydrogenate all the way.

Wait, no, the first step is alkylation, adding a methyl group to the alkyne. The structure becomes CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane. Then, hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would add H2 across the triple bond, making CH2-CH2-cyclohexane, which is ethylcyclohexane, as before.

But then, ozonolysis would not apply. So, perhaps option C is not on the right track.

Looking at the options, maybe I should consider each step in each option.

Option D: 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Methanol is a methylating agent, but under basic conditions. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. Reacting ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2 and MeOH would perhaps deprotonate the alkyne and then methylate. So, CH3-O-...? Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a Birch reduction condition, but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation, but with methanol as the methyl source. Wait, but methanol is a poor methylating agent unless activated.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Grignard-like reaction, but NaNH2 is a base, not a metal-based reagent. So, perhaps in step 1, the ethynyl group is deprotonated to form a cyclohexyl-ethynide, which then reacts with methanol. But methanol would act as an electrophile, so the ethynide would attack the methyl group, leading to CH2O-cyclohexane? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a coupling reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a deprotonation to form a strong base, which could then undergo elimination or substitution.

Wait, but let's think about the target molecule again. It has a formyl group (CHO) and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the cyclohexane. So, perhaps the formyl group is introduced via oxidation, and the other group via some addition.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group. For that, maybe an oxidation.

Oxidizing a triple bond can give a ketone or carboxylic acid, depending on the conditions. For example, using O3 followed by reductive work-up (like Zn/H2O) would give ketones. Alternatively, using O3 and then oxidative work-up would give carboxylic acids.

Wait, but looking at the options, some of them involve O3. For example, option C has O3/(CH3)2S, which is a reductive work-up (since (CH3)2S is a reductant, it would lead to breaking the ozonide into aldehydes or ketones without further oxidation).

So, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group via ozonolysis.

But wait, let's think about the overall structure. The target has a formyl group (CHO), which is an aldehyde. So, perhaps the triple bond is cleaved to form an aldehyde.

If the starting material is CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane, and ozonolysis is done, perhaps it would break the triple bond into two carbonyl groups. But wait, ozonolysis of a triple bond would give two carbonyl groups. For CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane, ozonolysis would break between the two carbons, giving two aldehydes. So, the product would be two CH3CHO groups on either side, but that doesn't fit our target.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation step comes before ozonolysis. Let me think about each option in turn.

Option C:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → CH2CH2-cyclohexane (ethylcyclohexane).

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → Ozonolysis of ethylcyclohexane? But ethylcyclohexane is a single bond, so ozonolysis isn't applicable. So, this sequence might not work.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding step 2. Maybe using a different catalyst would lead to partial hydrogenation, like hydrogenating the triple bond to a double bond, not all the way. Because Pd usually fully hydrogenates triple bonds to single bonds. So, perhaps using a different catalyst like Lindlar's would give cis double bonds. But the options don't specify that.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is not hydrogenation but some other process. Wait, another possibility: perhaps step 2 is a reduction of the alkyne to a trans-alkene. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is a catalytic hydrogenation that converts the alkyne into a cis-alkene, not a single bond. Then, step 3 would be ozonolysis of the double bond.

Wait, let's try that. So, step 2 would be H2 with a catalyst that gives cis addition. For example, using H2 and Lindlar's catalyst would give cis-dihydro product. So, ethynylcyclohexane → cis-ethylcyclohexene.

Then, step 3: ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a cis-alkene would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. So, in the case of cis-ethylcyclohexene, ozonolysis would break the double bond into two aldehyde groups. So, the molecule would become two aldehyde groups connected where the double bond was.

Wait, but the original structure was ethynylcyclohexane, which after step 1 becomes CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane. Then, partial hydrogenation to CH2-CH2-cyclohexane? No, that can't be right. Alternatively, if the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two aldehyde groups.

Wait, but the starting structure is CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane after step 1. So, the triple bond is between the cyclohexane and a CH3 group. If we hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis-alkene, it would become CH2-CH2-cyclohexane? No, wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond to a double bond would make CH2-C≡C-Cyclohexane → CH2-CH2-cyclohexane? No, that's not correct. Wait, wait: The structure after step 1 is CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane. So, the triple bond is between the cyclohexane and the CH3 group. So, hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond, making CH2-CH2-cyclohexane. But that's a single bond, so the molecule becomes CH2CH2-cyclohexane.

Wait, but that's ethylcyclohexane, which is a single bond. So, ozonolysis wouldn't apply here. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Alternative approach: perhaps the target molecule is synthesized via a Grignard reaction. Let's think about that.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the main ring. So, perhaps a Grignard reagent is added to a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Perhaps, first, the triple bond is converted into a ketone, then reacted with Grignard.

Wait, how to convert ethynylcyclohexane into a ketone.

One way to oxidize an alkyne to a ketone is via the oxymercuration or via ozonolysis with reductive work-up. Alternatively, using strong oxidizing agents.

Wait, another thought: the hydroboration-oxidation of alkynes can give ketones. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a vinyl bromide, which is then oxidized. But that seems more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond can be functionalized via a hydration reaction to form a carbonyl group. For example, using HgSO4, H2SO4, H2O under acidic conditions would hydrate the triple bond to form a ketone. Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, using Oxymercuration would give a ketone if the alkyne is treated with Hg(OAc)2 and then water.

Wait, but for ethynylcyclohexane, if we perform a hydration, what would we get? The triple bond is between the cyclohexane and a hydrogen. So, hydration would form a carbonyl group. So, the triple bond would become a ketone, which would be cyclohexanone. But wait, no, because the triple bond is CH2-C≡C-H? No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-C≡CH.

Hydration of that would form a ketone. Wait, no, the triple bond is at the end. So, hydration would form a carbonyl group. So, cyclohexane-C(O)H, which is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Wait, that's exactly the CHO group we have in the target molecule. So, perhaps the first step is to hydrate the triple bond to form the aldehyde.

So, how to do that? Using a hydration reagent like HgSO4 and H2SO4 in H2O, perhaps under acidic conditions. Or using Oxymercuration.

Let me check the options. Looking for a step involving HgSO4 and H2SO4 in H2O. Looking at the options:

Option A: Step 3 is Ba(OH)2, step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. Wait, but order is important.

Wait, let's see. If the first step is to hydrate the triple bond to form the aldehyde, then we would have cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. But the target also has another substituent: the (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group.

So, perhaps after forming the aldehyde, we need to add another group, which is the (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group.

Hmm, but how to introduce the cyclohexyl group. Maybe via some kind of alkylation or Grignard addition.

Another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a bromide, then a Grignard reagent is added.

Wait, but let me think again. The target has a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the main cyclohexane ring. So, perhaps this is formed via a substitution where a leaving group is replaced by a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps the starting alkyne is converted into a bromide, then a hydroxyl group is added via some nucleophilic substitution.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which then undergoes a nucleophilic addition.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the triple bond is converted into a ketone, then the ketone is subjected to a Robinson annulation or some aldol reaction to form a ring. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group, then a Grignard reagent adds to it, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.

Wait, but in this case, the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to the CH(OH) group, so perhaps the Grignard reagent is cyclohexyl magnesium bromide.

Wait, but how would that fit into the sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is first functionalized to a ketone, then a Grignard reaction is performed to add a cyclohexyl group, followed by oxidation to form the hydroxyl group.

So, let's outline this:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → Hydrate triple bond to form cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.
2. Convert the aldehyde to a ketone? Or perhaps perform a Grignard addition.
Wait, but aldehydes are reactive towards Grignard reagents.

Hmm. So, after step 1, we have cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Then, step 2: treat with a Grignard reagent, say, cyclohexyl magnesium bromide. The Grignard would add to the aldehyde, forming a secondary alcohol. Wait, but that would add a cyclohexyl group to the aldehyde carbon, giving a secondary alcohol. But our target has a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the Grignard adds to the aldehyde to form a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps let's think about the reagents in the options.

Option A: Steps 1 and 2 are NaNH2, methyl chloride, then H2/Pd.

So, step 1: ethynylcyclohexane + NaNH2 and methyl chloride → CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane.

Step 2: H2/Pd → CH2CH2-cyclohexane (ethylcyclohexane).

Then, step 3: Ba(OH)2. Not sure what that does. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps used for elimination or saponification, but not sure.

Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That sounds like a hydration condition. HgSO4 and H2SO4 in H2O are used for the hydration of alkynes to ketones. But in this step, the compound after step 3 would have to be an alkyne again, which it's not. So, perhaps this option isn't correct.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/liq. NH3; then O3 and H2O; then NH4OH.

Step 1: ethynylcyclohexane + NaNH2, ethyl chloride → gives Et-C≡C-cyclohexane.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base, sometimes used for eliminations or reductions. For example, in the Birch reduction or for deprotonating to form strong bases.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane becomes ethyl group via step 1, then step 2 might reduce something. But I'm not seeing the connection.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a lithium aluminum hydride reduction, but Li in NH3 is more about Birch reductions, which are for aromatic rings, not alkenes or alkynes.

Option D: Steps 1: NaNH2 and methanol; 2: Li/liq. NH3; 3: O3/(CH3)2S; 4: NH4OH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. As before, perhaps forms a methyl ether or something else.

But maybe not. Let's think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps the target's CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group is formed via a substitution of a bromide. So, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a bromide, then a hydroxyl group is introduced via substitution.

Wait, for example, if the alkyne is converted into a bromide (like via a mercury-based substitution), then treated with a strong base to form a Grignard reagent, which can then add a cyclohexyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is formed via a double addition. For instance, the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which undergoes a conjugate addition of a cyclohexyl group, followed by hydrolysis.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group (like an aldehyde), then the aldehyde is subjected to a Grignard reaction to add a cyclohexyl group, followed by oxidation to form the hydroxyl group.

Wait, but the target has a CH(OH) group. So, perhaps the Grignard adds to the aldehyde to form a secondary alcohol, which then is oxidized to a ketone. But that doesn't align with the target structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is converted into a ketone via oxidation, then Grignard adds to form a secondary alcohol, which is then not oxidized. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Convert the ethynyl group into a carbonyl group (CHO), giving cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

2. Perform a Grignard reaction to add a cyclohexyl group to the aldehyde, forming a secondary alcohol.

3. Oxidize the secondary alcohol to a ketone? No, because the target has a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but the target has a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So, perhaps the Grignard adds to the aldehyde, giving a primary alcohol, and then somehow a cyclohexyl group is added.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to think of each option's steps.

Looking at option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane.

2. H2/Pd → CH2CH2-cyclohexane (ethylcyclohexane).

3. O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis. But ethylcyclohexane is a single bond, so ozonolysis won't work.

So, option C's step 3 is not feasible.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → perhaps deprotonates the alkyne, then reacts with methanol to form CH3-O-... no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation with methanol, but I'm not certain.

Option B:

Step 1: NaNH2, ethyl chloride → CH2CH2-C≡C-cyclohexane? No, wait, ethyl chloride as the alkylating agent would add an ethyl group.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane (HC≡C-cyclohexane) treated with NaNH2 and ethyl chloride would deprotonate the alkyne to form a cyclohexyl-ethynide, which would then react with ethyl chloride to give CH2CH2-C≡C-cyclohexane? Wait, no, ethyl chloride is CH3CH2Cl. So, the alkyne would be substituted with an ethyl group, giving CH2CH2-C≡C-cyclohexane? No, I think the product would be CH2Cl-C≡C-cyclohexane, but that doesn't make sense because NaNH2 is a base, and the alkyne deprotonates to form a strong base, which then attacks the ethyl chloride, leading to CH2CH2- as the substituent. Wait, no, that's not correct. The ethynide would attack the ethyl chloride, leading to substitution of the hydrogen with an ethyl group.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the correct reagents to form the target.

The target has a formyl group and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So, perhaps the triple bond is first converted into a carbonyl group (CHO) via hydration, then a Grignard reagent adds a cyclohexyl group to the aldehyde, forming a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone. But wait, no, the target has a hydroxyl group, not a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a ketone, then a Grignard adds to form a secondary alcohol, which is then further functionalized.

Wait, but the target's CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group is more like a vicinal diol arrangement, but not quite.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is first hydrogenated to a cis-alkene (using H2 and Lindlar's catalyst), then subjected to dihydroxylation (like with OsO4) to form a diol, which could then be oxidized or further reacted.

But I don't see OsO4 in any of the options. So, perhaps that's not the approach.

Wait, back to the options. Let's look again.

Option C's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane.

2. H2/Pd → CH2CH2-cyclohexane.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → but step 2 product is ethylcyclohexane, which is a single bond; ozonolysis doesn't work.

So, perhaps that's not the right option.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2, methanol → possibly deprotonate, then maybe formate ester? Not sure.

Step 2: Li, liquid NH3 → perhaps a Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings.

Alternatively, Li in NH3 is a strong base, perhaps used for elimination reactions. But I'm not sure how that would help here.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → again, ozonolysis.

Step 4: NH4OH → aqueous work-up.

Not sure about this sequence.

Option B:

Step 1: NaNH2, ethyl chloride → CH2CH2-C≡C-cyclohexane? Or CH2Cl-C≡C-cyclohexane.

But I'm not certain.

Step 2: Li/liq. NH3 → perhaps a reduction. For example, the alkyne could be reduced to an alkane, but that would give ethylcyclohexane again.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent, which then undergoes some addition.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the target molecule is formed by a two-step addition to the alkyne.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone, then subjected to a nucleophilic addition with a cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne is converted into a bromide (using Hg(OAc)2 and H2O).

2. Then, treated with a strong base to perform an elimination, forming a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone, then a Grignard adds to it, forming a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone again. But that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the target molecule is formed by adding a cyclohexyl group to the aldehyde, which then leads to the formation of the CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

Wait, but without knowing the exact steps, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the oxidation states involved. The target has a formyl group (CHO), which is a higher oxidation state than an alkyne. So, perhaps the alkyne is oxidized to the aldehyde.

Then, perhaps the aldehyde is converted into a Grignard, which adds a cyclohexyl group, forming a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized. But again, not sure.

Wait, another thought: the target has both the aldehyde and the hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a ketone, which is then subjected to a Robinson annulation or some similar reaction to form a new ring with the hydroxyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group (CHO), then a Grignard reagent adds to form a secondary alcohol, which is then treated to form the cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Wait, considering the options:

Option C's steps after step 3 (ozonolysis) are unclear because step 2's product isn't an alkyne or alkene.

Option B: Steps 3 and 4 involve ozonolysis and then NH4OH. Ozonolysis usually breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups. But if step 2 produces a trans-alkene, ozonolysis would cleave it.

Wait, let me think: Ethynylcyclohexane → step 1: NaNH2, ethyl chloride → CH2CH2-C≡C-cyclohexane? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 adds an ethyl group to the alkyne, making CH2CH2-C≡C-cyclohexane.

Then, step 2: Li in NH3 → possibly a Birch reduction, but for cyclohexane, that's not possible.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a dehydrohalogenation, but I don't know.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C, but I'm missing the connection.

Wait, let's outline the entire process again:

We start with ethynylcyclohexane (HC≡C-Cyclohexane).

We need to get to 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

So, the target has two groups on the same carbon: CHO and CH(OH)(cyclohexyl).

Thus, perhaps:

1. Convert the alkyne into a carbonyl group (CHO), giving cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

2. Perform a Grignard reaction where a cyclohexyl group is added to the aldehyde, forming a secondary alcohol (CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)).

Wait, but how would that work? The aldehyde (CHO) would react with a Grignard reagent (like cyclohexyl MgBr) to form CH(OH)(cyclohexyl), but that would require adding two R groups to the aldehyde. Wait, no, Grignard reagents add once to aldehydes, forming secondary alcohols.

Wait, but the target has a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the main ring. So, perhaps the aldehyde is part of the main ring, and the Grignard adds a cyclohexyl group to the same carbon.

So, in that case, the aldehyde would become a secondary alcohol with the cyclohexyl group attached.

Wait, but then, how to get the formyl group and the hydroxyl group on the same carbon.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone (using O3 and Zn/H2O), then the ketone is subjected to a Grignard reaction, which adds a cyclohexyl group, forming a secondary alcohol. Then, the secondary alcohol is somehow oxidized to a ketone again, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol via hydration, then the diol is oxidized to a carbonyl group.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone (via ozonolysis and reductive work-up), then the ketone is subjected to a nucleophilic attack, adding a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → treated with HgSO4, H2SO4, H2O to form cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

2. Then, perform a Grignard reaction with cyclohexyl MgBr, forming the secondary alcohol.

But how to introduce the hydroxyl group.

Wait, perhaps the Grignard adds to the aldehyde to form a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone, but that doesn't fit the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is protected as a methyl group, then the Grignard adds, and then it's deprotected. But again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is B or D, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, considering the target's structure, perhaps the correct reagents involve a Birch reduction followed by some addition.

Wait, perhaps step 1 in option D: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe this is a deprotonation followed by alkylation, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let me think.

Option C steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane.

2. H2/Pd → CH2CH2-cyclohexane (ethylcyclohexane).

3. O3/(CH3)2S → Ozonolysis. Wait, ethylcyclohexane is a single bond, so ozonolysis won’t work.

So, this sequence can't be right.

Option D steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → possibly forms a methyl ether or other group.

2. Li in NH3 → perhaps a Birch reduction, but not sure.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH → work-up.

I'm stuck. Let me think about each step in each option again, perhaps I can find which option logically leads to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

a) Alkyne is converted into a bromide.

b) Bromide is treated with a strong base to form a Grignard reagent.

c) Grignard adds to a carbonyl group (from the aldehyde), forming a new carbon.

Wait, but I'm not seeing the exact steps in any option.

Wait, perhaps the target has a formyl group and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group, which suggests that the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group (CHO), then a Grignard adds a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

But I'm not finding the exact steps in any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C. Wait, let's see:

Option C steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane.

2. H2/Pd → CH2CH2-cyclohexane.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → but CH2CH2 is single bond, so ozonolysis doesn't apply.

So, this option can't be correct.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the target requires forming a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that has both the CHO and CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) groups. So, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a bromide, then a substitution occurs, introducing the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups.

Wait, but the options don't seem to include such steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D:

Steps:

1. NaNH2 and methanol → perhaps deprotonates the alkyne to form a strong base, which then reacts with methanol to form a methyl group substitution. So, ethynylcyclohexane → CH3-O-cyclohexane? Not sure.

2. Li in liquid NH3 → perhaps a Birch reduction, which would open the ring, but cyclohexane isn't aromatic, so that might not work.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the obvious. Let me think about each step in the correct order.

The target has a formyl group and a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group on the same carbon. So, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group (CHO), via hydration. Then, the carbonyl is subjected to a Grignard reaction with cyclohexyl magnesium bromide, adding a cyclohexyl group and forming a secondary alcohol. Then, perhaps the secondary alcohol is treated with a strong oxidizing agent to form a ketone, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the secondary alcohol is protected, but I'm not seeing how.

Wait, but the target has a hydroxyl group, not a ketone. So, perhaps the Grignard adds to the aldehyde, forming a secondary alcohol, which is then not oxidized.

So, the steps would be:

1. Hydrate the alkyne to form an aldehyde (CHO).

2. React the aldehyde with cyclohexyl Grignard reagent to form a secondary alcohol (CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)).

But looking at the options, which option includes hydration followed by a Grignard reaction?

Option A:

Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That's a hydration condition. So, if step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which would deprotonate something.

But the steps in option A are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane.

2. H2/Pd → CH2CH2-cyclohexane.

3. Ba(OH)2 → ?

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → hydration.

But if step 4 is hydration, but the compound is ethylcyclohexane, which is a single bond, so it wouldn't hydrate into a carbonyl group. So, this sequence isn't correct.

Looking at option B:

Steps:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → CH2CH2-C≡C-cyclohexane.

2. Li, NH3 → perhaps reduction of the alkyne to an alkane.

3. O3, H2O → ozonolysis of a single bond? No.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane.

2. H2/Pd → CH2CH2-cyclohexane.

But then step 3 is ozonolysis which isn't applicable. So, no.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps forms a methyl ether.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's time to pick the most plausible option. Based on the initial steps, option C's step 1 and 2 seem to lead to ethylcyclohexane, but then step 3 is ozonolysis which isn't applicable. So, option C can't be correct.

Looking at option B:

Step 1: NaNH2, ethyl chloride → adds ethyl group to alkyne, making CH2CH2-C≡C-cyclohexane.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → perhaps reduction. Wait, Li in NH3 is used for Birch reductions, which require aromatic rings. So, perhaps it's not applicable here.

Hmm.

Wait, the target has a formyl group and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So, perhaps the correct reagents are:

1. Hydrate the alkyne to form the aldehyde (CHO).

2. Then, perform a Grignard reaction to add a cyclohexyl group, forming the CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

But looking at the options, none include a Grignard reagent. So, perhaps the correct answer isn't obvious.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the target's structure can be achieved via a double addition to the alkyne.

The alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group (CHO), then a Grignard adds to form a secondary alcohol, which then undergoes some reaction to form the cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C, despite my confusion earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, as the steps would be:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to become CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane.

2. Hydrogenated to CH2CH2-cyclohexane.

3. Ozonolysis doesn't make sense here, but perhaps the step after is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, possibly for elimination.

But I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, we have ethylcyclohexane. Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which isn't applicable, so perhaps this option isn't correct.

Hmm.

After going through all the options, I think the correct sequence is option C. Here's why:

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkyne becomes CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenates the triple bond to CH2CH2-cyclohexane (ethylcyclohexane).

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis. Wait, but ethylcyclohexane is a single bond, so ozonolysis can't act. So, this step is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe step 2 is not full hydrogenation, but partial. If step 2 uses a different catalyst, perhaps hydrogenation stops at the double bond. But the options don't specify, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C because step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base to induce elimination.

But no, step 4 in option C isn't present. Oh, wait, option C has four steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate.

3. O3/(CH3)2S.

4. Ba(OH)2.

Wait, so after ozonolysis, Ba(OH)2 is used. But after ozonolysis, if the product isn't something that can undergo elimination, perhaps this isn't the right path.

Hmm.

Another thought: the target has both an aldehyde and a secondary alcohol group on the same carbon. Maybe the alkyne is first converted into a ketone, then subjected to a conjugate addition of a Grignard reagent, which would add a cyclohexyl group to form a secondary alcohol.

But I don't see a step for that in any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diene, which is then subjected to some addition, but that's not in the options.

I'm starting to think that the correct option is option C, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon as the hydroxyl group and the aldehyde. So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent, which then adds to itself, forming a cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Alright, perhaps I should make a guess based on the steps that could form the target.

The target requires adding a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group to the same carbon as the aldehyde. So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde, then a Grignard adds a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

But since Grignard reagents add organometallic groups, not hydroxyls, perhaps another step is needed.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → NaNH2 and ethyl chloride → CH2CH2-C≡C-cyclohexane.

2. H2/Pd → ethylcyclohexane.

3. Ozonolysis → breaks into two carbonyls.

But that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, given that it's the only option with ozonolysis which would form carbonyl groups, but I'm not certain.

After much thought, I'll go with option C as the answer.


To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group at the same carbon. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Ethynylcyclohexane is alkylated to form CH₃-C≡C-cyclohexane.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to form CH₂CH₂-cyclohexane (ethylcyclohexane).
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, but its role here is unclear as ethylcyclohexane does not readily undergo elimination or substitution to form the desired product.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Hydration conditions, but this step comes after the triple bond has already been hydrogenated, making it ineffective for forming the aldehyde group.

**Conclusion**: This sequence does not lead to the target molecule.

---

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Ethynylcyclohexane is alkylated to form CH₂CH₂-C≡C-cyclohexane.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely a Birch reduction or elimination, but this is not applicable to alkenes or alkynes in this context.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis is used to cleave double or triple bonds, but the product after step 2 is a single bond (ethylcyclohexane), making this step ineffective.
4. **NH₄OH**: Work-up, but the previous steps do not set up the molecule for this reaction.

**Conclusion**: This sequence does not lead to the target molecule.

---

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Ethynylcyclohexane is alkylated to form CH₃-C≡C-cyclohexane.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to form CH₂CH₂-cyclohexane (ethylcyclohexane).
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis is listed, but ozonolysis requires a double or triple bond. Since the product after step 2 is a single bond, this step is not applicable.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, but its role here is unclear as it does not align with forming the target molecule.

**Conclusion**: This sequence does not lead to the target molecule.

---

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH₂ and methanol. This step is unclear, as methanol is not a strong alkylating agent, and its role here is ambiguous.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely a Birch reduction or elimination, but this is not applicable to alkenes or alkynes in this context.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis is listed, but the product after step 2 is a single bond (ethylcyclohexane), making this step ineffective.
4. **NH₄OH**: Work-up, but the previous steps do not set up the molecule for this reaction.

**Conclusion**: This sequence does not lead to the target molecule.

---

### Final Answer:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly lead to the target molecule. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** is selected as the most plausible, despite the ambiguity in step 3, as it contains reagents that could potentially align with parts of the synthesis pathway.

**Answer: C**
