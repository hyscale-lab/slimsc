Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember all the details about titrations, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: We're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, with various pH values.

Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when you titrate them, they react in a neutralization reaction. The equivalence point is where the moles of acid equal the moles of base.

Wait, so the first step is to figure out the initial concentrations after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the volumes. Let me calculate that.

The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) and concentration is 0.05 M. So moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) are 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

Then, we add 20.00 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³, or 0.04 L. The concentration of the diluted acetic acid would be moles / total volume. So 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about 25% titration and the equivalence point.

Wait, what does 25% titration mean? Oh right, it means we've added 25% of the NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point. So I need to find out how much NaOH is needed to reach the equivalence point first.

The reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

The moles of acetic acid initially are 0.001 mol. Since it's a 1:1 reaction, the moles of NaOH needed to reach equivalence are also 0.001 mol.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume needed for equivalence is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So 25% titration means adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. Because 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³.

At 25% titration, the amount of NaOH added is 0.25 times the equivalence volume.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of moles. So 0.25 times the equivalence point moles of NaOH is 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of NaOH added.

So, when 0.00025 mol of NaOH is added, it will react with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid to form the same amount of acetate ions (CH3COO^-).

So, let's model the solution. The initial solution after dilution has:

- [CH3COOH] = 0.025 M, volume 40 cm³ (0.04 L).

Then, adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

This will neutralize 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, producing 0.00025 mol of acetate.

So, the remaining acetic acid is initial moles (0.001) minus 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

And acetate formed is 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total volume now is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH at this point.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa is -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa ≈ 4.73 (since log(1.85) ≈ 0.267, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733, roughly 4.73).

So pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647 )

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is approximately -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253.

Wait, that's about 4.25. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Option B is 3.17 and 6.73.

So the pH at 25% would be around 4.25, which is close to option A's first value, 4.26.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me recalculate the ratio.

0.00025 / 0.00075 is 1/3, so in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, that's 1/3. Then log(1/3) is indeed about -0.477.

So pH is 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253. So 4.25, which matches option A's first part, 4.26. But let me think if there's another approach.

Alternatively, maybe the initial diluted acetic acid's concentration is correct. Wait, initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid: 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Diluted to 40 cm³, so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is 0.00025 mol. So, that's correct.

So at 25% titration, the pH is around 4.25, which is close to option A's 4.26.

Now, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate ions. The solution will be a solution of sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution should be basic.

The moles of NaOH at equivalence are 0.001 mol, as calculated earlier. The total volume is initial 40 cm³ plus 10 cm³ of NaOH, so 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

So the concentration of acetate ions is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Using the approximation for weak bases, since Kb is small.

The hydrolysis equation can be represented as:

[CH3COO^-] - x = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02

x^2 / (0.02 - x) ≈ Kb → x^2 ≈ Kb * 0.02

x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) → sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.49.

pH = 14 - 5.49 ≈ 8.51.

Looking at the options, option A says 8.52, which is very close to this.

Wait, but let's make sure. Wait, I approximated using the 5% rule. Let's see, x is about 3.29e-6, and initial [CH3COO^-] is 0.02, which is 2e-2. The 5% rule would require x/(0.02) < 5%, which is about 3.29e-6 / 2e-2 = ~0.0165%, which is way less than 5%. So the approximation is valid. So pH is about 8.51, which rounds to 8.51, which is close to option A's 8.52.

So according to this, the pH at 25% is approximately 4.26, and at equivalence it's 8.52. Looking at the options, option A matches: 4.26; 8.52.

But wait, another thought: when I calculated the equivalence point, I considered the total volume as 50 cm³. But if the initial volume is 40 cm³ and we add 10 cm³ of NaOH, the total is 50 cm³. So the concentration of acetate is indeed 0.02 M.

Wait, another possible mistake: sometimes, when you mix strong base with weak acid, the solution at equivalence is buffer region, but in this case, all the acid is neutralized, so the solution is a solution of the conjugate base, which is correct.

So the pH at equivalence is around 8.51, which is approximately 8.52. So option A seems correct.

Wait, but looking at the other options:

Option D's equivalence pH is 6.92, which is acidic. That can't be right because equivalence point with a weak acid and strong base should be in the basic region.

So, the correct answer should be option A: 4.26 and 8.52.

But wait, when I did the 25% titration, I calculated the pH as approximately 4.25. So option A's first value is 4.26, which is spot on.

So the answer is option A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution. The initial moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we determine the equivalence point. The moles of NaOH required to neutralize 0.001 mol of acetic acid are also 0.001 mol (1:1 reaction). The volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume (10 cm³) is added, which is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH added} = 0.25 \times 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with an equal amount of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Remaining moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ions (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume after adding 2.50 cm³ of NaOH is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right),
\]

where \(\text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log\left(\frac{0.00588}{0.01765}\right) \approx 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately \(4.26\).

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized, forming 0.001 mol of acetate ions. The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \(K_b\) for acetate is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation for weak bases:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x} \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \(x\) (the \([\text{OH}^-]\)):

\[
x^2 = K_b \times 0.02 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \times 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}, \quad x \approx \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.49.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.49 = 8.51.
\]

Thus, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately \(8.52\).

The correct answer is **A) 4.26; 8.52**.
