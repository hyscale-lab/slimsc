Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully and try to figure out what I need to do.

The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. Hmm. So, let me jot down the given data.

We have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration, c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN^-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, I should probably make sure I'm interpreting the stability constants correctly. Stability constants are for the formation of complexes, right? So each β represents the formation constant for a complex with a certain number of SCN^- ligands.

Wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN ligands, right? So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^{n+}.

But wait, I remember that the color of the complex can vary based on the number of ligands. I think the blue one is the one with two SCN^- ions, so that's the Co(SCN)_2^{2+} complex, which is β2 maybe? Or maybe I should check the numbering.

Wait, the stability constants are given in order β1, β2, β3, β4. So I think βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN^- ligands. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 is [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and β4 is [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

Wait, but wait, the charge on the complexes: Co^2+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN^- is -1. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge}:

Charge = 2+ - n*(1-) → 2 - n.

So [Co(SCN)_1]^1+ → n=1, charge +1. β1=9.

[Co(SCN)_2] → charge 0. β2=40.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- → charge -1. β3=63.

[Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} → charge -2. β4=16.

Hmm, but the problem is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. So that's the n=2 complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2] with β2=40.

But wait, I've heard that the [Co(SCN)_2] complex is blue. So the question is, what is the percentage of this complex among all Co species.

So the approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex in solution and find the fraction for the n=2 complex.

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the possible Co species: [Co^2+], [CoSCN^+], [Co(SCN)_2], [Co(SCN)_3^-], [Co(SCN)_4^{2-}].

But calculating each concentration might be complicated because the formation of complexes depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of SCN^-.

Wait, the problem gives us the total cobalt concentration (c(Co) = 1e-2 M) and the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. So I think I can use the stability constants to find the distribution of each complex.

Alternatively, since all the Co is distributed among the different complexes, perhaps it's better to model the fraction of each complex.

Wait, I think the general approach is to model the log of the fraction of each complex relative to the free ion. But considering that the metal can form complexes with multiple ligands, the distribution depends on the concentrations and the stability constants.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formation of each complex step by step. But with four possible complexes, this might get a bit involved. Alternatively, maybe we can write the fraction of each complex in terms of β and the ligand concentration.

Hmm, I remember that in such cases, the fraction of each complex can be calculated using the formula:

f_n = (β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n ) / ( [Co^2+] + sum_{k=1 to 4} β_k [SCN^-]^k )

Wait, no. Wait, the total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all the species:

c_total = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^{2-}]

But [Co^n+] = β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n / K, where K is a normalization constant.

Wait, maybe another approach. The fraction f_n of each complex is given by f_n = (β_n [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + sum_{k=1 to 4} β_k [SCN^-]^k )

Wait, because the total concentration is [Co^2+] + sum (β_k [Co^2+][SCN^-]^k ) = [Co^2+] (1 + sum β_k [SCN^-]^k )

So [Co^2+] = c_total / (1 + sum β_k [SCN^-]^k )

Then, the fraction of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n] / c_total.

Which is [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

So, substituting:

f_n = (β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n ) / c_total

But [Co^2+] = c_total / (1 + sum_{k=1 to 4} β_k [SCN^-]^k )

So f_n = (β_n [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + sum_{k=1 to 4} β_k [SCN^-]^k )

Wait, because [Co^2+] = c_total / denominator, where denominator is 1 + sum β_k [SCN^-]^k.

So, f_n = (β_n [SCN^-]^n) / denominator.

Wait, because [Co^2+] is c_total divided by denominator, and when you multiply by β_n [SCN^-]^n, you get [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n = β_n * (c_total / denominator) * [SCN^-]^n.

So the fraction f_n is [Co(SCN)_n]/c_total = (β_n [SCN^-]^n) / denominator.

Yes, that makes sense. So the denominator is 1 + sum_{k=1 to 4} β_k [SCN^-]^k.

So, the denominator is 1 + β1 [SCN]^1 + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

Wait, but wait. Let's plug in the numbers.

Given c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

But in the denominator, it's 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

Wait, no. Because the denominator is 1 + sum_{k=1 to 4} β_k [SCN^-]^k. So let's calculate each term.

But wait, wait, the formula is:

denominator = 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

But [SCN] is 0.1 M. Let me compute each term.

Compute each βk [SCN]^k:

β1 [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

β2 (SCN)^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4.

β3 (SCN)^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063.

β4 (SCN)^4=16 * (0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

So sum these terms:

0.9 + 0.4 =1.3. + 0.063=1.363; + 0.0016=1.3646.

So denominator = 1 + 1.3646 = 2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646.

So the fraction f_n for each complex is (β_n (0.1)^n) / 2.3646.

We're interested in the n=2 complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2], so β2=40, [SCN]^2=0.01.

So f_2 = (40 * 0.01) / 2.3646 = (0.4) / 2.3646 ≈ 0.4 / 2.3646.

Let me compute that. 0.4 divided by 2.3646. Let's see:

2.3646 is approximately 2.365.

0.4 / 2.365 ≈ 0.169.

So f_2 is about 16.9%, which would correspond to option D, 16.9%.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. So that's the n=2 complex, which is f_2 = ~16.9%. So option D.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, let me recalculate the denominator:

β1 [SCN] =9 * 0.1=0.9.

β2 [SCN]^2=40*(0.1)^2=0.4.

β3 [SCN]^3=63*(0.001)=0.063.

β4 [SCN]^4=16*(0.0001)=0.0016.

Sum of all βk [SCN]^k: 0.9+0.4=1.3; +0.063=1.363; +0.0016=1.3646.

Denominator =1 +1.3646=2.3646.

Yes.

Then, f_2 = (40 *0.01)/2.3646= (0.4)/2.3646≈0.169, so 16.9%.

Looking at the options: D is 16.9%, so that's the answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because I thought the blue color is the n=2 complex, but sometimes the color can change depending on the metal and ligand. But the question states that it's the blue dithiocyanato complex, so n=2.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check it again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the formula for each complex and then computing their fractions.

The fraction is (βn [SCN]^n) / (denominator).

So for n=2, (40 * (0.1)^2) =40 *0.01=0.4.

Denominator is 2.3646 as above.

So 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, so 16.9% as before.

So the correct answer should be D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]) in the solution, we use the stability constants and the given concentrations. The total cobalt concentration is \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \), and the thiocyanate concentration is \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \). The stability constants are \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), and \( \beta_4 = 16 \).

The fraction of each cobalt complex is calculated using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{1 + \sum_{k=1}^4 \beta_k [\text{SCN}^-]^k}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the denominator
The denominator is \( 1 + \sum_{k=1}^4 \beta_k [\text{SCN}^-]^k \). Substituting the values:
\[
\begin{align*}
\beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 &= 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9, \\
\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 &= 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4, \\
\beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 &= 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063, \\
\beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 &= 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016.
\end{align*}
\]
Summing these terms:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^4 \beta_k [\text{SCN}^-]^k = 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 1.3646.
\]
Adding 1:
\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + 1.3646 = 2.3646.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (\( n = 2 \))
For \( n = 2 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \) and \( [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = (0.1)^2 = 0.01 \). Substituting into the formula:
\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{40 \cdot 0.01}{2.3646} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646}.
\]
Performing the division:
\[
f_2 \approx 0.169.
\]

### Step 3: Convert to percentage
The fraction \( f_2 \) corresponds to the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex:
\[
f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%.
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.
