Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, the question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The problem states that the photospheres are in LTE, so I guess I can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, the Boltzmann factor equation comes into play when dealing with the distribution of particles in energy states. The formula is something like the ratio of populations in two energy levels is equal to the Boltzmann factor. So the ratio n_upper/n_lower is proportional to (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, for star_1, the number of excited atoms is twice that of star_2. Let me denote the populations. Let's say for star_1, the population is n1, and for star_2 it's n2. The problem says n1 = 2 n2. So the ratio n1/n2 is 2.

But wait, the Boltzmann equation for the ratio of two states is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) / exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ). Assuming that the statistical weights (g) are the same for both stars, which I think they are because they're both iron atoms. So g1/g2 is 1, so we can ignore that.

So n1/n2 = exp( (ΔE/(k T2) ) - (ΔE/(k T1)) )? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The general form is n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Since E_i is the energy of state i. So if the excited state is higher, E_i is higher than E_j.

Wait, but in the problem, the energy difference is given as ΔE = E_upper - E_lower = 1.38e-23 J. So, considering the ratio of atoms in the excited state (upper) to the lower state, but the problem says that in star_1, the excited atoms are twice as much as in star_2. So maybe n_upper_1 = 2 n_upper_2? Or per the same lower state? Hmm.

Wait, the exact wording is: iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to those in star_2. So perhaps n1_upper = 2 n2_upper. So the ratio n1_upper / n2_upper = 2.

But according to the Boltzmann distribution, n_upper/n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). If we're comparing the same two stars, then for each star, the ratio of their upper to lower is determined by their T.

Wait, but if we have two stars, each with their own T (T1 and T2), then for each star, the ratio of upper to lower is (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Assuming g_upper and g_lower are the same for both stars (same atom), then the ratio for each star is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ).

So for star_1: n1_upper / n1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: n2_upper / n2_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the problem states that n1_upper = 2 n2_upper. Wait, no, the problem says the excited atoms are twice as much. Does that mean that n1_upper is twice n2_upper? Or is it that the ratio n1_upper / n1_lower is twice that of n2_upper / n2_lower? Hmm, I need to clarify.

Wait, maybe the way to think about it is that for the same energy level, the population of that level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So for the same level, n1 = 2 n2. But the question is about the ratio of the populations in two energy levels for each star.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio n_upper/n_lower is higher in star_1 than in star_2. Because if the atoms are more excited, the higher energy levels are more populated. So the ratio (n_upper/n_lower) would be higher in star_1.

Wait, but the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. Hmm, maybe "twice as excited" refers to the ratio of excited to non-excited atoms.

Wait, perhaps the problem is saying that the number of iron atoms in the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So n1_upper = 2 * n2_upper.

But I think a better approach is to model the ratio between the two stars for the same energy level. So for each star, the number of atoms in the same energy level depends on the star's temperature.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the Boltzmann factor for the excited state in each star. Let me consider the ratio of the population of the excited state in star 1 to that in star 2.

But wait, the problem says that in star_1, the excited atoms are twice as much as in star_2. So n1_upper = 2 n2_upper.

But each star's population is determined by their own temperature. So:

n_upper = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) * n_lower

But if we're comparing the same energy level in each star, perhaps the n_lower is the same? Or maybe not; I think it's better to model the ratio of the excited states between the two stars.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to consider the ratio of the populations in each star's upper level compared to their own lower level. So for star 1, the ratio is n1_upper/n1_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star 2, n2_upper/n2_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

The problem says that the excited level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But wait, wait. How? Are we comparing n1_upper to n2_upper, or n1_upper to n1_lower?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the ratio of the excited state to the ground state in star_1 is twice that in star_2.

So, (n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower )

But from the Boltzmann equation, each of these ratios is exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

So:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Hmm, taking the natural logarithm on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2))

Rearranging:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE /k:

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Wait, wait, let me double-check. So, let's write the equation:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Divide both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k T2)):

exp(ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1)) ) = 2

Take ln of both sides:

ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ) = ln(2)

Alternatively, factor out 1/(k):

(ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

But let's think about the options given. The options are all expressions involving ln(2) equal to some ratio involving T1 and T2.

Hmm, our equation is:

(ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this is the right approach. Maybe I should consider the ratio of the two excitation ratios.

Wait, another approach: The number of atoms in the excited state is proportional to the Boltzmann factor. So for each star, the number of excited atoms is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

So, for star 1, the number is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

For star 2, it's proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Given that the excited atoms in star_1 are twice that of star_2, we have:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Which is the same equation as before. So, let's rearrange:

exp( [ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ] ) = 2

Taking natural log:

ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = ln(2)

So,

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, but that's the equation, but the options don't have this form. Let's see the options again.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But wait, our equation has (ΔE/k) multiplied by (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) equals ln(2). So unless ΔE/k is 1, which it's not, then perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, but in the given options, the equation is ln(2) equals some expression. So perhaps we can rearrange our equation to match one of the options.

Our equation:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But the given options don't have the ΔE/k term. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the excitation relative to the ground state, but maybe each star's own ground state is at a different temperature, but that's probably not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the ratio involves the same ground state population, but that might complicate things.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the ratio of the excitation for each star. Let me consider the ratio (n_upper/n_lower) for each star.

For star 1: (n1_upper / n1_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star 2: (n2_upper / n2_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The problem says that in star_1, the excited atoms are twice as much as in star_2. But wait, do they mean that n1_upper is twice n2_upper? Or that (n1_upper / n1_lower) is twice (n2_upper / n2_lower)?

Ah, the wording says: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2."

Hmm, perhaps it's the ratio of the excited state to the ground state that is different. So (n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2 (n2_upper / n2_lower )

Wait, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But that's problematic because the total number of atoms in each star's photosphere would vary, which complicates things. So perhaps the correct approach is to compare the excitation ratios.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach this differently.

The problem gives the energy difference ΔE and says that in LTE, so the Boltzmann factor applies. The ratio of the number of atoms in the upper state to the lower state is given by:

n_upper / n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So for star 1, this ratio is R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star 2, R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The problem states that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But wait, that could be written as n1_upper = 2 n2_upper.

But n_upper = (n_upper / n_lower) * n_lower.

So,

n1_upper = R1 * n1_lower

n2_upper = R2 * n2_lower

But the problem says n1_upper = 2 n2_upper.

So,

R1 * n1_lower = 2 R2 * n2_lower

Hmm, but without knowing the relation between n1_lower and n2_lower, I can't proceed. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the ratio of the excitation in star_1 to that in star_2 is 2. So R1 / R2 = 2.

So,

R1/R2 = [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = 2

Then, taking ln:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Which is the same as earlier.

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But again, none of the options account for the ΔE/k term. So I must have made a wrong assumption.

Wait, the options are all about ln(2) being equal to a certain ratio of T1 and T2, without any ΔE. So perhaps the problem is assuming that ΔE/(k) is 1, which is not the case. Let me check the value.

Wait, ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh! So ΔE equals k. Let me compute ΔE/k:

ΔE/k = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K ) ) = 1 K.

Ah, that's a key insight! So ΔE/(k) is 1 K. So our equation becomes:

1 K * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)/ (1 K )

But since K is the unit, and the left side is in 1/K, perhaps we can ignore the units for the sake of the equation.

Wait, but the equation is:

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which can be rearranged as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So that's the correct equation. So the correct answer is option D.


The problem involves two stars in LTE, where the excitation of iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 is twice that of star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and Boltzmann's constant is \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations in two energy levels is:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right)
\]

For star_1 and star_2, the ratios are:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)
\]
\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)
\]

The problem states that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2, meaning:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}}
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann ratios:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2)
\]

Factoring out \( \Delta E / k \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2)
\]

Since \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \) (given \( \Delta E = k \)):

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2)
\]

This matches the form of option D:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

Thus, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

**Answer: D**
