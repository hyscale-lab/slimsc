Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then, the second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the options provided.

Alright, let's break it down. Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, a ketone. Reacting it with NaCN—sodium cyanide. I remember that in the presence of a strong acid, ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. The cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile here.

Wait, so the first reaction is probably a nucleophilic addition of CN- to the carbonyl group of butan-2-one. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about the structure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would add to the carbonyl carbon. The mechanism is that the carbonyl oxygen becomes protonated, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks, leading to the formation of an addition product.

Wait, but after addition, what happens next? Oh right, after the nucleophilic attack, we have to get rid of the leaving group. In this case, the protonated oxygen becomes an oxonium ion, and when the CN- adds, the oxygen becomes -OH. But wait, in the product, it's a hydroxyl group attached to the same carbon as the nitrile. So maybe it's a secondary alcohol now.

So the general reaction for a ketone plus HCN (or NaCN in acidic conditions) would give a cyanohydrin. Right, a cyanohydrin is formed when a ketone reacts with HCN, giving an addition product where the oxygen is replaced by OH and CN groups attached to the same carbon.

So the first step uses NaCN and an acid catalyst, probably. Because the reaction of ketones with HCN (or NaCN) usually requires acid catalysis. So reagent A is probably H3O+ (acid) to protonate the carbonyl.

Wait, let me think. NaCN is a source of CN-, but for the addition, we need the carbonyl to be protonated. So A is the acid. So in the options, looking for A as H3O+.

Now, looking at the options, let's check the options for A:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl → possible.

Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH → possible.

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl → A is different.

Option D: A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH → A is NaHSO3.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: could the first reaction be using a sulfite like NaHSO3? Because I recall that sulfites can also be used in such additions. For example, in the Oppenauer oxidation or other ketone reductions... Wait, no, maybe the reactions are different.

Wait, no, the Oppenauer is for ketone reductions to secondary alcohols, but that's a different scenario. Alternatively, in some cases, sulfites can act as nucleophiles in addition reactions. Let me think, but I think the more common reagent for cyanohydrin formation is an acid catalyst, like H3O+.

So in the first reaction, A is H3O+.

So looking at options A and B for A.

Then, the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the structure is a nitrile group attached to a carbon that also has a hydroxyl group and another substituent. The reaction is with reagent B (H2O), leading to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, that product has a carboxylic acid group. So the nitrile (-CN) has been converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

How do you convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? One common method is hydrolysis. Under acidic or basic conditions, nitriles can hydrolyze to produce amides, acids, or other products depending on the conditions.

In acidic hydrolysis, a nitrile (R-CN) is treated with a strong acid like HCl and water. The conditions are typically refluxed for several hours. The reaction mechanism involves the addition of water across the triple bond. The nitrile becomes an amide first, which then is further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, under basic conditions, it might form a sodium salt of the acid, but since the product is a carboxylic acid, it suggests that the solution is acidic enough to protonate the final product.

Wait, but the second reaction is written as 2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (H2O) to form the acid. So reagent B is H2O plus something else? Wait, looking back, the question says reagent B is H2O. Wait, no, the way the question is phrased: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → product.

Wait, perhaps B is the catalyst. So the reaction uses H2O as the solvent, but also maybe an acid or base catalyst.

Wait, the reaction is nitrile to acid. So let's think about the conditions. For nitrile to acid hydrolysis, you typically use a strong acid, like HCl in H2O, and heat. Or in some cases, a base like NaOH followed by acid work-up.

In the second reaction, they're using reagent B, which is H2O, but perhaps with another reagent. Wait, the question says the reagent is B and H2O. Wait, maybe I misread it. Let me check the question again. The second reaction is with reagent B, which is H2O. Or is B a separate reagent, and H2O is part of it?

Wait, the question says: + B (H2O) →. Hmm, perhaps that's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction uses a hydrolysis condition in water with an acid or base.

Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid. So the hydrolysis must have been under acidic conditions.

So to convert nitrile to carboxylic acid, the typical reagents are H2O, HCl, heat. Or maybe using a strong acid as catalyst.

Looking at the options, the second reagent B is either HCl, CH3COOH, etc.

Option A: B is HCl.

Option B: B is CH3COOH.

So which is correct? Typically, nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid requires strong acidic conditions. HCl is a strong acid, while CH3COOH is a weak acid. So which is more likely?

Wait, but wait, in some cases, using a weak acid might suffice, but for more efficient hydrolysis, especially for less reactive nitriles, a strong acid is used. But in the presence of H2O, perhaps even a weak acid is sufficient if it's heated. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is under basic conditions, but then the product would be the carboxylate, which would need acid work-up. But in the product, it's a carboxylic acid, so perhaps the reaction is done in acidic conditions.

So if reagent B is HCl, then the reaction is done under acidic conditions. So option A would have B as HCl, which makes sense.

Wait, but how about the first reaction? Let me recheck. The first reaction is NaCN, plus A (which is H3O+ in options A and B) causing the formation of the cyanohydrin.

So in the first step, the reagents are NaCN and H3O+. So the conditions are acidic, which is correct for cyanohydrin formation.

Now, the second reaction: the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So when you hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, you're adding two oxygen atoms, turning CN into COOH.

So the reagents would be H2O (as a solvent) and an acid catalyst, probably HCl. So reagent B is HCl.

Looking at the options, option A has B as HCl. So that would fit.

Wait, but let me think if any of the other options could work. The second reaction could also use a base, but then you'd get the carboxylate, which would need to be acidified. So perhaps if B is a base, then you'd need an acid work-up. But the question seems to present B as the only reagent, so if B is HCl, it's correct.

So putting it all together: first reaction uses H3O+ (A is H3O+), second reaction uses HCl (B is HCl). So looking at the options, option A is A = H3O+, B = HCl.

But wait, let me check the other options.

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl.

Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium hydrogen sulfate. It's a strong acid, but I'm not sure about its role here. If A were NaHSO3, then the first reaction would be under basic conditions? Because NaHSO3 is a source of HSO3- which is a weak acid. Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe it's used in some other reaction, but for the first step, an acid is needed. So I think A should be H3O+.

So option A and B are the candidates.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the first reaction uses NaHSO3 as the acid. Because sometimes, for certain reactions, like the addition of HCN, the acid is H2SO3 or H2SO4, but I think H3O+ is a more general acid catalyst.

So, if the first reaction uses H3O+, which is in options A and B.

Then, the second reaction uses HCl as the acid (option A) or CH3COOH (option B).

So, which is better for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids?

I think in lab conditions, HCl in H2O with heat is common. So option A would be correct.

Wait, but let's think about the product. The product is a carboxylic acid, which is a strong acid, so maybe the reaction is done under strongly acidic conditions. So HCl is a stronger acid than acetic acid, which is weak. So to get the nitrile to fully hydrolyze, especially under mild conditions, perhaps a strong acid is needed.

Alternatively, if the nitrile is activated in some way, a weaker acid might work. But in this case, the starting material is a hydroxy nitrile. Wait, no, the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Wait, no, no, the starting material in the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So it's a nitrile adjacent to a hydroxyl group. Hmm, perhaps that affects the reactivity.

Wait, maybe the nitrile is in a position where it's more susceptible to hydrolysis. Or perhaps the presence of the hydroxyl group affects the reaction conditions.

Wait, but I'm not too sure about that. So going back, for nitrile to acid hydrolysis, strong acid conditions are typical. So option A's B is HCl, which is a strong acid.

Therefore, I think the correct option is A: A = H3O+, B = HCl.

But wait, another angle: what about the role of the hydroxyl group in the second reaction?

Wait, the starting material is 2-hydroxy-2-nitrile. When converting CN to COOH, the hydroxyl group is on the same carbon. So during hydrolysis, the nitrile group (R-C≡N) becomes R-COOH. So the presence of the hydroxyl group might influence the acidity.

Wait, but that's probably not relevant here. The main point is the hydrolysis condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the second reaction uses a different approach. Wait, another way to make a carboxylic acid from a nitrile is via the Stephen reduction, but that's for making aldehydes. Or the hydrolysis as I thought before.

So, I think the second reaction uses HCl as the catalyst for hydrolysis.

Putting it all together, the correct reagents are A = H3O+ and B = HCl, which is option A.


The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile using NaCN and reagent A. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. For this reaction to proceed efficiently, an acid catalyst is required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (option A) is the most suitable acid catalyst for this reaction.

The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid using reagent B in the presence of H₂O. This is a hydrolysis reaction where the nitrile group (-CN) is converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). For this transformation, acidic conditions are typically required. HCl (option A) is a strong acid and commonly used as a catalyst for such reactions, making it the most appropriate choice for reagent B.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first reaction, CH₃COOH is a weak acid and less effective for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not a typical acid catalyst for cyanohydrin formation, making this option unsuitable.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Both A and B are unsuitable for their respective reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
