Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters. 

Wait, I remember that the decay length depends on the lifetime of the particle. Oh right, the mean decay distance is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So the formula should involve the lifetime multiplied by the velocity of the particle.

The formula for decay length is L = γ * β * c * τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, β is v/c, c is speed of light, and τ is the proper lifetime. Right.

First, I need to find the lifetime τ. I think the width Γ is related to the lifetime via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy ΔE is Γ, and Δt is τ. So Γ ≈ ħ / τ. Therefore, τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but units can be tricky. Let me get the constants straight. Planck's constant ħ is about 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So Γ is given in MeV, I'll need to convert it to GeV. Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV. Calculating that: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. Hmm, that seems very small, but lifetimes of particles are often tiny.

Next, I need to find the velocity of the meson. For that, I'll compute the Lorentz factor γ. The energy E is given as 8 GeV, which is the total energy. So E = γ m c². But since we're working in units where c=1, E = γ m. So γ = E / m_X. 

m_X is 1.2 GeV, so γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. 

Then β can be found using γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). Solving for β: β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ)²). Let me compute that. 

(1/γ)^2 is (1/(6.6667)^2) ≈ (1/44.444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So β ≈ 0.9887. 

So now, the decay length L = γ * β * c * τ. Let's plug in the numbers.

c is speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s. So putting it all together:

L = (6.6667) * (0.9887) * (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s)

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute γ * β: 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887. Let's see, 6.6667 * 0.9 is 6, 6.6667 * 0.08 is 0.533, so approximately 6 + 0.533 = 6.533. But more accurately, 6.6667 * 0.9887 is approximately 6.6667*(1 - 0.0113) = 6.6667 - 6.6667*0.0113. 6.6667 * 0.01 is 0.066667, so 0.0113 is about 0.0754. So 6.6667 - 0.0754 ≈ 6.5913. So around 6.5913.

Wait, maybe a more precise calculation would be better. Let me do 6.6666667 multiplied by 0.9887.

Let me compute 6.6666667 * 0.9887:

0.9887 = 1 - 0.0113.

6.6666667 * 1 = 6.6666667.

6.6666667 * 0.0113 = 0.07555555.

So 6.6666667 - 0.07555555 ≈ 6.591111.

So about 6.5911.

Now, multiply by c: 6.5911 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 1.9773e9 m/s.

Wait, but wait, that's not right. Because L is (gamma * beta) * (c * tau). Let me compute each term step by step.

Wait, let me do it more accurately.

First, calculate gamma * beta * c:

gamma is ~6.6667, beta is ~0.9887. So gamma * beta = approx 6.5911.

Multiply that by c: 6.5911 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 1.9773e9 m/s.

Then multiply by tau: 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 1.9773e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, that's not correct. Because, the units: (m/s) * s = m. So yes, the product would be meters.

So 1.9773e9 * 2.056875e-24 = let's calculate that.

Multiply the numbers: 1.9773 * 2.056875 ≈ approx 4.0655.

Exponents: 1e9 * 1e-24 = 1e-15.

So L ≈ 4.0655e-15 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made an approximation in beta. Let me check the exact value of beta.

gamma is 8/1.2 = 20/3 ≈ 6.6666667.

The relationship between gamma and beta is gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).

So gamma squared is (400/9), so 1 - beta^2 = 1/(gamma^2) = 9/400 = 0.0225.

Thus, beta^2 = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.98868.

So beta is approximately 0.98868.

So gamma * beta is (20/3) * 0.98868.

20/3 is about 6.6666667.

6.6666667 * 0.98868 ≈ calculate this precisely.

Let me compute 6.6666667 * 0.98868.

Let me write 0.98868 as 1 - 0.01132.

So 6.6666667 * 1 = 6.6666667.

6.6666667 * 0.01132 ≈ 6.6666667 * 0.01 = 0.066666667, 6.6666667 * 0.00132 ≈ 0.008799. So total is 0.066666667 + 0.008799 ≈ 0.075465667.

So 6.6666667 - 0.075465667 ≈ 6.591201.

So gamma * beta is about 6.5912.

So gamma * beta * c = 6.5912 * 3e8 m/s = 1.97736e9 m/s.

Multiply by tau: 2.056875e-24 s.

1.97736e9 * 2.056875e-24 = Let's compute the numbers:

1.97736 * 2.056875 ≈ 4.0655? Let me compute that.

1.97736 * 2 = 3.95472.

1.97736 * 0.056875 ≈ 0.1118.

So 3.95472 + 0.1118 ≈ 4.0665.

So approximately 4.0665e-15 meters.

Wait, but the calculation is 1.97736e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.97736 * 2.056875) * 1e(9-24) )= 4.0655e-15.

Which is option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

Looking back at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which matches.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps I should compute the decay length using the formula L = (c * τ) * (E/mc²) * sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)).

Because, since E = gamma m c², and beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2 c^4)) ) = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)).

So L = gamma * beta * c * tau = (E/(m c²)) * sqrt(1 - m²/E²) * c tau.

Wait, but with the given units, perhaps it's better to use natural units where c=1.

But perhaps I should check the formula again.

Alternatively, since the width is Gamma, the mean lifetime is tau_0 = hbar / Gamma, and the lab frame lifetime is gamma tau_0.

Beta gamma c tau_0 is the decay length L.

Yes, that's correct.

So L = beta gamma c tau_0 = beta gamma c (hbar / Gamma).

Wait, hbar is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So putting it all together:

L = (beta gamma) * c * (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (Gamma in GeV).

Wait, let me plug in the numbers.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

Beta gamma we have as approximately 6.5912.

So beta gamma = 6.5912.

So L = 6.5912 * c * (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV).

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

First, calculate 6.582e-25 / 0.32:

6.582 / 0.32 ≈ 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25.

Then multiply by 6.5912:

6.5912 * 20.56875 ≈ let me compute that.

20 * 6.5912 = 131.824.

0.56875 *6.5912 ≈ approx 3.75.

So total is about 135.574, so 135.574e-25.

Then multiply by c: 3e8 m/s.

So 135.574e-25 * 3e8 = 406.722e-17 m. Which is 4.06722e-15 m.

Wait, that's about the same as before, around 4.067e-15 m. So option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the decay length:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta \) is the velocity of the particle in units of the speed of light (\( v/c \)),
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
The width \( \Gamma \) is related to the proper lifetime \( \tau \) via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

\[
\Gamma \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau} \quad \implies \quad \tau \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given:
- \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \),
- \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \),

we calculate:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m_X}
\]

where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

The velocity \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} \quad \implies \quad \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the decay length \( L \)
The decay length is:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau.
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( \gamma \beta \approx 6.6667 \times 0.9887 \approx 6.5912 \),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \),

we calculate:

\[
L = (6.5912) \times (3 \times 10^8) \times (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}).
\]

First, compute \( 6.5912 \times 3 \times 10^8 \):

\[
6.5912 \times 3 \times 10^8 \approx 1.97736 \times 10^9 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

Next, multiply by \( 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \):

\[
L = (1.97736 \times 10^9) \times (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **option B**.

Answer: B
