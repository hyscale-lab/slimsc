Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that there's an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, first, I think I should normalize this state because the question says it's proportional, not necessarily normalized.

Then, the question asks about calculating the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and zero otherwise. Wait, I'm a bit confused about how the matrix is structured. So, for a 2x2 matrix (since we're dealing with spin up and down), the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2.

Oh wait, that can't be right. Because if i and j are different, but in a 2x2 matrix, the indices go from 1 to 2 (or maybe 0 to 1, depending on notation). So the matrix would look like:
[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[hbar/2, 0 ]

Wait, no. Because if i is different from j, both A_12 and A_21 are hbar/2. But wait, matrices are typically set with A_ij as rows i and columns j. So for a 2x2 matrix, it's:

A_11 = 0 (since same i and j),
A_12 = hbar/2,
A_21 = hbar/2,
A_22 = 0.

So the matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

Wait, but that matrix is for the operator. But then the problem is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. So the eigenstates of this operator are not the same as |up> and |down> because the operator isn't the z-projection spin operator. So I'll need to find the eigenstates of matrix A.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator is the one with this matrix, so the eigenstates are the basis in which this operator is diagonal. So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates and then compute the probabilities.

Wait, or maybe the operator is given by matrix A, and the eigenstates are the states in which measuring the operator yields its eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues would be the possible measurement outcomes, and the eigenstates are the states we can measure into.

So first, I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A.

Let me think about the matrix A. It's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 on the off-diagonal.

The eigenvalues of a matrix can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0.

So the matrix (A - λI) is:

[ -λ, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, -λ ]

The determinant is (λ^2) - (hbar/2)^2 = 0. So λ^2 = (hbar^2)/4. So λ = ± hbar/2.

Wait, no. Wait, the determinant is (−λ)(−λ) − (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = λ² − (hbar²/4). Setting to zero: λ² = hbar²/4 → λ = ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are ± hbar/2. So the possible measurement results are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Now, the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.

For λ = hbar/2:

(A - λ I) is:
[-hbar/2, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, -hbar/2]

The equations from (A - λ I)|v> = 0 are:

(-hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to (1, 1). Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2, the equations would be:

(hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = -v1.

So the eigenvectors are (1, -1) and (1,1), but normalized.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me recheck.

Wait, when λ is hbar/2, the matrix becomes:

[ -λ, hbar/2 ] → [ -hbar/2, hbar/2 ]

[ hbar/2, -λ ] → [ hbar/2, -hbar/2 ]

So the equations are:

(-hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → multiply both sides by 2/hbar → -v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = v1.

So any vector where v2 = v1 is an eigenvector. So one such vector is (1,1). To normalize it, the length is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), so the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).

Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2:

Equation:

(hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = -v1.

So the vector is (1, -1), normalized as (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)).

So the eigenstates of operator A are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), assuming |up> and |down> are orthonormal.

Wait, but wait: actually, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of Sz, the z-component of spin. So they form an orthonormal basis. So any vector can be expressed in terms of them.

So |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>.

Wait, but the state is proportional. Let's compute the normalization factor. The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, but not necessarily normalized. So the squared magnitude is |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2.

Calculating each modulus squared:

|1 + i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2.

|2 - i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.

So the total is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the actual state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the eigenstates of the operator A are |+> and |->, as we found earlier, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

But wait, to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate when you measure the operator A, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A.

So, let's write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+> and |->.

Let me denote |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

We can express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->.

So, let me write |alpha> = a |+> + b |->.

Substituting the expressions for |+> and |->, we get:

|alpha> = a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

We can group the terms:

= [ a/sqrt(2) + b/sqrt(2) ) ] |up> + [ a/sqrt(2) - b/sqrt(2) ) ] |down>.

We already know that |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So, equate the coefficients:

Coefficient of |up>:
( a + b ) / sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7).

Coefficient of |down>:
( a - b ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

So now we have two equations:

1. (a + b)/sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
2. (a - b)/sqrt(2) = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

Let me write these equations as:

a + b = (1 + i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
a - b = (2 - i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

We can solve for a and b.

Adding the two equations:

2a = [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) 

Simplify numerator:

1 + i + 2 -i = 3.

So, 2a = 3 * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) → a = (3 sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(7)).

Wait, but sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) is sqrt(14)/7. Hmm, not sure if that's needed yet.

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

2b = [ (1 + i) - (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Simplify numerator:

1 + i -2 + i = (-1 + 2i).

So, 2b = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) → b = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ]/(2 sqrt(7)).

But wait, perhaps I should hold off on computing the exact values of a and b. Because the probabilities would be |a|^2 and |b|^2, right?

So, let's compute |a|^2 and |b|^2.

First, compute a:

a = [ (1 + i) + (2 -i) ] * (1/sqrt(2)) ) / sqrt(7) ?

Wait, no, I think earlier step was:

a = [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me redo this part.

Wait, from the two equations:

Equation 1: a + b = (1+i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
Equation 2: a - b = (2-i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Adding:

2a = (3) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) → a = (3 sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(7)).

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

2b = [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
→ 2b = [ (1+i -2 +i) ] * ... → 2b = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
→ b = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)).

Now, for |a|^2:

a = [3 sqrt(2)] / [2 sqrt(7)] → |a|^2 = (9 * 2) / (4 *7) ) = 18/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, which is about 0.64. Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36, which sums to 1. So that's a possible candidate.

Then |b|^2 is | (-1 + 2i) |^2 multiplied by [ ( sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) )^2 ].

The modulus squared of (-1+2i) is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) = 1 +4=5.

So |b|^2 = (5) * ( (2)/(4 *7) ) → because [sqrt(2)^2=2, denominator is (2 sqrt(7))^2=4*7=28. So (sqrt(2)/ (2 sqrt(7)) )^2 = 2/(4*7) )= 1/(14).

Wait, let me compute it step by step:

The coefficient for b is ( (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ) / (2 sqrt(7)).

So the modulus is sqrt( ( (-1)^2 + 2^2 ) ) * sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)).

So |b| = sqrt(5) * sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)) → |b|^2 is (5 * 2)/(4 *7) )= 10/(28) = 5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, but wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is close to 0.36 as in option A. So the probabilities would be 9/14 ≈ 0.64 and 5/14 ≈ 0.36.

Wait, but wait: wait a second, how does that add up? 9/14 is about 0.642857..., and 5/14 is about 0.357142... Adding together gives 14/14=1, so that's correct.

So the probabilities for measuring the eigenstates |+> and |-> are 9/14≈0.64 and 5/14≈0.36, respectively.

Now, the next part of the question is to find the average value of the operator A.

The operator A has eigenvalues λ_+ = hbar/2 and λ_- = -hbar/2, with probabilities |a|^2 and |b|^2 respectively.

So the average value <A> is λ_+ * |a|^2 + λ_- * |b|^2.

Substituting the values:

= (hbar/2) * (9/14) + ( - hbar/2 ) * (5/14 )

= (9 hbar)/(28) ) - (5 hbar)/(28 )

= (4 hbar) / 28 → Simplify: 4/28 = 1/7. So <A> = (hbar/7) * 4? Wait, wait wait.

Wait, 9 -5 is 4, so:

(9 -5) =4 → 4/(28) = 1/7. So (hbar/2) * (9/14 -5/14) ) → wait no, I think I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me recompute:

(9/14)* (hbar/2) + (5/14)* (-hbar/2) → 

= (9 hbar)/(28) + (-5 hbar)/(28) → 

= (4 hbar)/28 → 

= hbar/(7) → because 4/28 is 1/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Now, looking back at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7 → which matches exactly with what I calculated.

But wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.

Yes, that's correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.64 and 5/14≈0.36, and the average is hbar/7.

So the correct answer would be option A.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by calculating the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:

\[
|1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 5.
\]

The total squared magnitude is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \), so the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Next, we consider the operator whose matrix representation is \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. This corresponds to the matrix:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \), which gives:

\[
\lambda^2 - \left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)^2 = 0 \implies \lambda = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

The corresponding eigenvectors are:

\[
|+\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of these eigenstates. Substituting \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \) into \( |\alpha\rangle \), we solve for the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) such that:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = a|+\rangle + b|-\rangle.
\]

Equating coefficients, we find:

\[
a = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}, \quad b = \frac{(-1 + 2i)\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}.
\]

The probabilities are \( |a|^2 \) and \( |b|^2 \), which are:

\[
|a|^2 = \frac{9}{14}, \quad |b|^2 = \frac{5}{14}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities of measuring \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively.

Finally, the average value of the operator \( A \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \lambda_+ |a|^2 + \lambda_- |b|^2 = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{9}{14} + \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) \cdot \frac{5}{14}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9\hbar}{28} - \frac{5\hbar}{28} = \frac{4\hbar}{28} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) 0.64, 0.36, and \( \hbar / 7 \).**
