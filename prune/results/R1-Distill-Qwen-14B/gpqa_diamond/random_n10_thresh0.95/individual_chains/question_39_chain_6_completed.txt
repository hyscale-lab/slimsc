Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the value of 'a' given the wave function. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.

The setup is that there are ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (the x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that's interesting because complex wave functions usually have a real and imaginary part. But the key point is that when they measured the particles' positions, they were only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region, right?

Wait, no, the wave function itself isn't necessarily zero outside, but the probability of finding the particle there must be zero. Because the measurements didn't find any particles outside x=1 and x=3. So that means the wave function must be zero outside this interval.

Wait, no, the wave function could be non-zero, but the probability density (which is the square of the absolute value of the wave function) must be zero outside. So the wave function could have regions where it's non-zero, but the probability of finding the particle there is zero.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the wave function is a complex number. Let me compute the absolute square to find the probability density.

The absolute square is |ψ|^2 = (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2, because the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So |ψ|^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But since the probability of finding the particle in x<1 or x>3 is zero, the wave function must be zero in those regions. So in the regions x <1 and x>3, |ψ|^2 must be zero. But wait, |ψ|^2 is (a²/(1+x) ) + 0.25. For that to be zero, each part must be zero because a² and x are real numbers.

Wait, but a² is a real positive number, and (1 +x) is positive for x> -1. So when x approaches infinity, a²/(1+x) approaches zero, but 0.25 is 1/4. So adding them, when x<1, 1+x is less than 2. For example, at x=0, 1+x=1, so a²/1 is a². Then |ψ|^2 = a² + 0.25. But for the probability to be zero in x<1 and x>3, the wave function's square must be zero in those regions, so:

For x<1, |ψ|^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 = 0. But since a² and (1+x) are positive (assuming x >=-1), this sum can't be zero. Hmm, that's a problem. So that suggests that my initial assumption might be wrong.

Wait, maybe the wave function is zero outside x=1 and x=3, but the given expression is only valid in between. Because the problem states that the wave function is described as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i in the part of space where it can exist, which is between x=1 and x=3. So outside this region, the wave function is zero.

Ah, that makes more sense. So the given wave function is only applicable between x=1 and x=3. So to find 'a', I need to ensure that the wave function is normalized, because the total probability must be 1.

So the normalization condition is the integral of |ψ|^2 dx from x=1 to x=3 equals 1.

So let's write ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i. Then |ψ|^2 is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2, as I thought before.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me compute that integral.

First, split it into two parts:

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 + Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3.

The first integral: a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to3. So a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ) ] = a² ln(2).

Because ln(4) is 2 ln(2), so 2 ln(2) - ln(2) = ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options: option B is 0.85, which is close. So the answer is B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is the absolute square of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the wave function is zero outside this region. To ensure the wave function is normalized, the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \) must equal 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral splits into two parts:

1. **First term**: \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \)

   Using \( \int \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(1+x) \), we find:

   \[
   a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_1^3 = a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second term**: \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx \)

   This evaluates to:

   \[
   0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Combining both terms, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

The closest option to \( a \approx 0.849 \) is **B) 0.85**.

Answer: B
