--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and I think I'll need to break it down step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

Alright, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of like a cage structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane probably has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the structure. 

The first reaction is heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C. I think KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. Since we're dealing with a dibromide, especially vicinal (1,3) dibromide, the likely reaction is an elimination. Wait, but since it's 1,3, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but the positions might allow for a different pathway. Alternatively, with two bromines, maybe it's a double elimination, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, when vicinal dihalides react with a strong base like KOH, they typically undergo elimination to form alkenes. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide because vicinal would be 1,2. So maybe the bromines are on adjacent positions in a way that allows elimination. Oh wait, adamantane's structure is such that each carbon is connected to three others, so maybe the 1 and 3 positions are actually adjacent in a way that elimination is possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, another possibility is that each bromine leaves, and with KOH, it could form a cyclo elimination, maybe leading to an allene or a ring formation. But maybe it's more likely that each Br is replaced by an -OH, but wait, KOH is a base, not a typical nucleophile in substitution for such a structure.

Wait, no. When a dihalide is treated with a strong base like KOH, especially in a situation where elimination is possible, it can form an alkene. So if 1,3-dibromoadamantane eliminates two HBr molecules, it would form an aromatic structure. Wait, but adamantane is already a fused ring structure. Wait, no, adamantane is a diamondoid with four cyclohexane rings fused. So if the bromines are on adjacent carbons, eliminating HBr from each would form a double bond, but in the adamantane structure, that might not be feasible because of the ring strain. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, and the Br leaves, leading to a carbocation which then eliminates another Br. Hmm.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. The IR shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O). So the product after KOH heating is probably an alcohol or maybe a ketone. Wait, but if it's an elimination, why would we get a ketone? Oh, wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but rather a substitution, but that would require a better leaving group and a good nucleophile.

Wait, another thought: maybe the base is deprotonating a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of an epoxide. No, that doesn't fit the IR. Alternatively, maybe the base is causing a ring-opening or some kind of rearrangement.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 could be an epoxide? No, epoxides don't have a carbonyl. Wait, maybe it's a ketone. So if 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes some kind of elimination, perhaps forming an ketone via a neighboring group effect. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where two OH groups are added, but that wouldn't give a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: the product of a dihalide with KOH often gives an ether if it's an SN2 reaction, but for adamantane derivatives, which are typically not very reactive in SN2 because of their structure, that's unlikely. So elimination is more plausible. So if two HBr molecules are eliminated, maybe the structure forms a double bond, but where?

Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing a ring-opening to form a ketone. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but in the NMR of product 1, the shifts are as follows: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is probably an -OH group, but wait, no, because -OH protons typically appear broader, around 1-5 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether or an alcohol. Hmm, but the IR suggests a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide? But no, epoxide protons are usually more deshielded, around 3-4 ppm, and their coupling can be more complex. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. So perhaps the starting material loses both bromides and forms a ketone. But how?

Wait, another thought: 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH, could undergo a double elimination to form an allene. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the bromides undergo dehydrohalogenation to form a cyclohexenyl structure, but within the adamantane framework.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure of adamantane. It's a polycyclic structure with four six-membered rings, each connected in a diamond-like shape. So, each carbon is connected to three others, and the structure is very rigid.

If the bromines are on adjacent carbons in this structure, perhaps eliminating two HBr would form a double bond. But in adamantane, maybe this leads to a bridge or a ring contraction. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a ketone. Wait, how would that happen?

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution where each Br is replaced by an -OH group. But then product 1 would be 1,3-diol. But the IR doesn't show a broad peak for -OH, which it typically would. Alternatively, perhaps some dehydration occurs to form a ketone.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is a double elimination, producing a ketone. Let's think: if two bromides are on adjacent carbons, when each loses a bromide and a hydrogen, perhaps a double bond forms, but in a way that produces a cyclopropane or another structure. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, but in a way that forms a ketone. Oh, wait, maybe the bromides are on bridgehead positions, and eliminating HBr leads to a ring contraction, forming a ketone. That sounds plausible.

For example, if two adjacent bridgehead carbons each lose a bromide and a hydrogen, the two bridgehead carbons would form a double bond, but that might not be possible due to Bredt's rule, which states that double bonds aren't stable on bridgehead positions in bicyclic compounds. So perhaps the structure rearranges to form a ketone.

Let me visualize: 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Upon elimination, perhaps each bromine is on a bridgehead. Eliminating two HBr would create a situation where the two bridgeheads form a carbonyl group. For example, perhaps each Br is removed, and the two carbons become connected via a double bond, but in a way that forms a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: the elimination leads to the formation of a carbonyl group. Maybe the two Br's are anti to each other, so when they leave, the adjacent C's form a double bond, but due to the structure constraints, it becomes a carbonyl.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps product 1 is an adamantanone, which has a ketone group in the adamantane structure. That would explain the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. So, the product is 1,3-adamantanone? Or perhaps it's a different position, but regardless, the key point is that product 1 has a ketone group.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 4.79 ppm (2H) might not fit a ketone. Because a ketone doesn't have protons attached. So that peak could be from something else, like an -OH group or perhaps a methylene adjacent to the ketone.

Wait, looking at the NMR data for product 1:

- 4.79 (2H): This is a singlet, probably two equivalent protons. Maybe an -OCH₂- group, but in a ketone structure, perhaps adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, but I'm not seeing an obvious linkage. Alternatively, 4.79 could be from a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ether or an alcohol. But then, why is the IR showing a carbonyl?

Let me think again: if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH is used, perhaps it's a substitution reaction where each Br is replaced by an OH. Then product 1 would be 1,3-adamantanol diol. But then, the NMR would show two sets of protons, but in the data given, there are three signals. So perhaps not.

Alternatively, if it's an elimination, but forms a carbonyl, perhaps it's an enol ether. Wait, but enol ethers have conjugated double bonds and their protons appear around 5-6 ppm, which is close to 4.79. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, but again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide. So when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, elimination occurs, forming an epoxide. But epoxides typically have two protons that are deshielded and split into a triplet or something. But the IR peak at 1720 would indicate a carbonyl, so that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone with an adjacent methylene group. For example, if the structure is such that there's a carbonyl and a CH2 group next to it, the CH2 would be split into a quartet or something else.

Wait, perhaps the product is bicyclic with a ketone group. Let me think: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules, it forms a double bond, but due to the structure, it might form a ketone. Or perhaps the elimination leads to a ring contraction, creating a smaller ring with a carbonyl.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me move to the next step and see if that helps. Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide to form product 3.

The question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen.

Wait, after ozonolysis, the double bonds break, and depending on the structure, new carbonyl groups are formed. Ozonolysis of an alkene typically cleaves it into two carbonyl compounds. But wait, the starting material for ozonolysis is product 2, which is formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide.

Hmm, aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst. So when product 1 (which I'm assuming is a ketone or an epoxide) is heated with Al(OR)3, perhaps some kind of ring-opening or rearrangement occurs. Alternatively, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation, but I'm not sure since product 1 is a solid. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and Al isopropoxide is used to open it, forming a diol. But if product 1 is a ketone, then perhaps Al isopropoxide does something else.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes some kind of enol ether formation or some rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol, which is then dehydrated to form an alkene in product 2.

Wait, if product 1 is a diol (from substitution), then heating with a Lewis acid might cause elimination to form an alkene. So if product 1 is 1,3-diol, then product 2 would be 1,3-alkene. Then, ozonolysis of that alkene would break it into two carbonyl groups.

But let's think: the NMR of product 3 is from the ozonolysis, which breaks any double bonds into carbonyl groups. So perhaps product 2 is an alkene, and product 3 is the ozonolysis product.

So putting it together: The initial reaction forms product 1, which has a carbonyl (from IR). Then, product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide, leading to product 2, which is an alkene. Then, ozonolysis cleaves the alkene, and when worked up with dimethylsulfide (which is a reductive workup, I think), it forms carbonyl compounds.

Wait, but wait. Ozonolysis typically forms carbonyl groups from each end of the double bond. If the alkene is symmetric, then the ozonolysis product would be two identical carbonyl compounds.

But let me get back to product 1. If product 1 has a carbonyl, how does it form product 2, which is an alkene? Maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enone (a conjugated enone), which would have a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl. That would make sense. So, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enone.

Wait, then product 3 would be from ozonolysis of the enone. Ozonolysis of an enone would cleave the double bond, giving two carbonyl groups. But in that case, the most deshielded proton in product 3 would be on a carbonyl group, which is not possible because carbonyl protons are usually in the enol form if any, but in ketones, there are no protons. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me retrace.

Original molecule: 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

Heated with KOH: forms product 1, which has a carbonyl (IR 1720).

Then, product 1 treated with excess Al isopropoxide to form product 2.

Product 2 is then ozonolyzed to form product 3.

So, product 1 is a ketone. Then, treating it with Al isopropoxide (a strong Lewis acid) could lead to some kind of cyclization or elimination. Wait, maybe product 1 is a diol, and the Al isopropoxide dehydrates it to form an alkene. So, product 1 is 1,3-adamantanol diol, product 2 is 1,3-adamantylene (an alkene), and product 3 is the ozonolysis product.

But then, product 1's NMR would need to fit that. The NMR given is 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). If product 1 is a diol, the 4.79 could be the diol protons, but diols typically have broad signals, not sharp. Alternatively, if it's an epoxide, the protons would be around 3-4 ppm and split into a quartet or something else.

Wait, perhaps product 1 isn't a diol but an ether. Or maybe an alcohol. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. Since KOH is a strong base, maybe it's an E2 elimination, forming a double bond. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules to form an alkene. But wait, in the NMR of product 1, there's a peak at 4.79 (2H), which might correspond to a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, maybe in an epoxide. But that doesn't align with the IR.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the IR peak again. 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 is a carbonyl compound. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with Al isopropoxide, which is a catalyst for certain reactions like Friedel-Crafts, but maybe it's used for dehydration.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a secondary alcohol, and heating with Al isopropoxide (a Lewis acid) would cause dehydration to form an alkene. But how does that fit with the IR?

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a cyclic ketone. Then, product 2 could be a conjugated enone, and product 3 would be the ozonolysis product, which would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. But then, in product 3, what would the most deshielded proton be?

Alternatively, if product 3 is a diketone, the most deshielded protons would be on the carbonyl groups, but those don't have protons. So perhaps the most deshielded protons are on adjacent carbons, maybe as part of an aldehyde group. Wait, ozonolysis tends to cleave alkenes into carbonyl groups. So if product 2's alkene is between two CH2 groups, ozonolysis would give two aldehydes.

Wait, but let me think about the structure. Suppose product 2 has a double bond between two CH2 groups. Then, ozonolysis would break it into two aldehyde groups. So product 3 would be two aldehyde groups connected via a chain. But more accurately, ozonolysis would break the double bond, inserting O's.

Alternatively, if the alkene in product 2 is part of a ring, ozonolysis would open it into a diacid or two carbonyl compounds.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a cyclic diene. Ozonolysis would break all double bonds, but in this case, product 2 has only one double bond, I think.

Wait, perhaps the initial product 1 is an epoxide. Then, when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes acid-catalyzed ring-opening. But I'm not sure how that would form product 2.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or an enone.

But this is getting too vague. Let me try to think about the ozonolysis step. Product 3 is the result of ozonolysis of product 2. So product 2 must have a double bond. Ozonolysis breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups.

So if product 2 is an enone (a conjugated enone), ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls. But perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, but the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. So let's imagine that product 3 has a structure where a hydrogen is next to two other sets of protons, leading to a complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogen is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, which is split by neighboring groups.

Wait, but let me think about the steps again:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid, IR carbonyl)
2. product 1 + Al isopropoxide → product 2
3. product 2 undergoes ozonolysis → product 3

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 could be an enone (conjugated dienone? No, just an enone). Then, ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is (Z)- or (E)-1,3-diketone or something similar, ozonolysis would add O's.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a bicyclic enone. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, creating two carbonyl groups. The product 3 might then have two ketone groups or aldehydes.

Wait, but after ozonolysis and workup with dimethylsulfide, which is a reductive workup, the ozonides are typically cleaved into aldehydes or ketones, depending on the substitution.

Alternatively, if the double bond is between two CH2 groups, ozonolysis would give two aldehyde groups. So product 3 would be two aldehyde groups connected via cleavage.

But wait, in the ozonolysis step, if the alkene is in a ring, the cleavage would open the ring. Let's say product 2 is a cyclic enone, like bicyclo structure with a double bond. Breaking that would form two carbonyl groups, perhaps leading to a dicarbonyl compound.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, but that doesn't have protons on the carbonyls. So the most deshielded protons would be on adjacent carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded proton is in a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then the central CH2 protons would be split by neighboring groups.

Wait, but in the ozonolysis, if the starting alkene is, say, between two CH2 groups, the product would be two aldehyde groups. So product 3 would be O=CH-CH2-CH2-CHO, but that's just a guess.

Wait, but the most deshielded proton would be on the aldehyde group. Aldehyde protons typically appear around 9-10 ppm, which is highly deshielded. But in the NMR of product 3, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H.

In an aldehyde group, the proton is usually a singlet because there's no neighboring protons (since aldehydes are RCHO). But wait, no, the aldehyde proton is a singlet because it's adjacent to only one carbon (the R group), and if R is CH2 or similar, perhaps the aldehyde proton is split by adjacent groups.

Wait, no, the aldehyde proton is usually a singlet because it's attached to the carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. So in that case, the aldehyde proton would be a singlet. But the question is about the most deshielded, which would be the aldehyde proton. But in the options, there's no singlet option. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded proton isn't an aldehyde but something else, like a vinylic proton, but after ozonolysis, the double bonds are cleaved, so vinylic protons aren't present.

Wait, perhaps product 3 isn't an aldehyde but a ketone with adjacent protons. Let's imagine product 3 has a structure like (CH2)2CO. Then the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl would have protons that are split by neighboring groups.

Wait, but in the case of ozonolysis, the product is cleaved into two carbonyl groups. So if the original alkene in product 2 is between two CH2 groups, product 3 would have two aldehyde groups. So each aldehyde is RCHO, and the R is perhaps a CH2 group.

Wait, in that case, the aldehyde protons would be at ~9-10 ppm, and be singlets. But the options don't include singlet. So perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the alkene in product 2 is part of a more complex structure. For example, if product 2 is a bridgehead alkene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups on the bridge.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a bicyclic molecule with a bridgehead double bond. Ozonolysis would cleave that bridgehead into two carbonyls. Then, product 3 would have a bridge structure with carbonyl groups.

But how would that affect the NMR? The most deshielded proton might be in a CH2 group next to the carbonyl. If that CH2 is next to two different types of protons, it could split into a triplet of triplets or something else.

Wait, maybe in product 3, the structure is such that a CH2 group is between two other CH2 groups, each with different coupling constants. For example, if a central CH2 is next to two different sets of protons, each with their own J values, the splitting would be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and has neighboring protons on either side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but how would that happen? Let's say the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, the central CH2 would have two neighboring CH2 groups. Each of the neighboring groups would have two protons, leading to splitting.

Wait, if the central CH2 is between two CH2 groups, each with two protons, then the central protons would couple with each of the adjacent groups. Each coupling would split the signal. So if each adjacent CH2 has two protons, and the central CH2's protons are split by each adjacent group, the splitting pattern could be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, each adjacent group may have two protons, each with the same J value, leading to a triplet for each coupling, and the combination would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the central CH2 is next to two different sets of protons, each with a different J, then the splitting would be more complex.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the structure of product 3, so I'm a bit stuck. However, the options are about the coupling pattern. Looking at the options:

A) triplet
B) triplet of triplets
C) doublet of triplets
D) pentet

If the most deshielded proton is in a CH2 group that's next to two other CH2 groups, each with two protons, then each coupling would split the signal into a triplet. So the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, if it's next to two different groups, maybe a doublet of triplets or a triplet of doublets, but that's less likely.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to a CH group, which has two protons, that could complicate the splitting.

But given the options, I think the most likely answer is that the coupling is a triplet of triplets (option B), but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, if the CH2 is adjacent to two different sets of protons each with a J value, it could be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, another approach: the NMR of product 3 is from ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of an internal di-substituted alkene would produce two carbonyl groups. So the structure after ozonolysis would have two carbonyl groups connected by a chain.

For example, if the alkene was in the middle of a four-carbon chain, ozonolysis would break it into two two-carbon fragments, each with a carbonyl group. So the structure would be O=C-(CH2)n-C=O.

In that case, the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls would have protons that are split by neighboring groups. Suppose n=2, like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Each CH2 next to the carbonyl would have neighboring protons.

The central CH2 in this four-carbon chain would be between two CH2 groups. Each adjacent group would have two protons. The central protons would couple with each adjacent group's protons, leading to a triplet for each coupling. So the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets, making option B the correct answer.

Alternatively, the central protons would have two neighboring groups, each with two protons, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, the most deshielded hydrogen would be in the central CH2 group, which is split into a triplet of triplets.


The problem involves analyzing the reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and determining the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the final product (product 3) based on the given data.

### Reaction Sequence Analysis:
1. **Initial Reaction (1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH):**  
   The starting material reacts with KOH, forming a light yellow solid (product 1). The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group. The NMR data for product 1 includes signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). This suggests that product 1 is likely a ketone, as the carbonyl group aligns with the IR data, and the NMR signals correspond to a rigid adamantane-like structure with a ketone functionality.

2. **Second Reaction (product 1 + Al isopropoxide):**  
   Heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide likely leads to the formation of an enone (product 2). Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, facilitates dehydration or rearrangement, introducing a double bond adjacent to the ketone (conjugated enone structure).

3. **Ozonolysis of Product 2:**  
   Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3. Ozonolysis typically breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups. If product 2 is a conjugated enone, the cleavage would result in two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is a structure like **O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O**, ozonolysis would yield a diketone or related compound.

### NMR Analysis of Product 3:
The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen would experience splitting due to coupling with neighboring
