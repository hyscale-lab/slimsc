Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is asking about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. They also provided the components of the operator P (Px, Py, Pz) as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors correspond to the possible states of the system when measured. So here, the operator P is probably a spin operator because the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, which are the spin eigenvalues for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon.

But wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components. So first, I think I need to construct the operator P itself. Because the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, the operator P must be along a direction n, which can be written as a combination of x, z, maybe y? Wait, wait—the direction is in x-z, so it's a combination of x and z, but not y. Oh, because the x-z plane has angles θ from the z-axis, and phi would be 0 or something because it's in x-z. Hmm, but the eigenvector is along this arbitrary direction, so I think the operator P would be the component of the spin along that direction.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, it says the operator is P along direction n. So the operator would be P · n, right? Because the spin operator in the direction n is the dot product of the vector operator P with the unit vector n.

Wait, but wait: the operator P is given as a vector operator with components Px, Py, Pz. So, P = (Px, Py, Pz), each of which is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, the actual operator P along direction n would be (n_x Px + n_y Py + n_z Pz), right? Because the operator for the spin component along direction n is the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding direction cosine.

But in this case, the direction n lies in the x-z plane. So, that means the angle n makes with the z-axis is θ, and phi is zero because it's in the x-z plane (since for the x-z plane, phi is 0 or 180, depending on direction). So, the direction vector n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in spherical coordinates, the unit vector is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). Since φ is zero for x-z plane, it's (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, and n_y=0.

So the operator P along n would be (sinθ) * Px + (cosθ) * Pz. Because n_y is zero, the Py term drops out.

But wait, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (ħ/2) |v>, because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So I need to find the eigenvector |v> such that (sinθ Px + cosθ Pz) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

But wait, let's first write down each component of P:

Px = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, the operator P_n is (sinθ) * Px + (cosθ) * Pz, each multiplied by ħ/2, right?

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Each component is already multiplied by ħ/2. So when you multiply by sinθ or cosθ, it's just a scalar coefficient. So let me write it out.

P_n = (n_x Px + n_y Py + n_z Pz) = (sinθ) * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + (0) * (ħ/2) [[0,-i],[i,0]] + (cosθ) * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So combining terms, P_n would be (ħ/2) times the sum of the matrices:

sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So that's (ħ/2) * [
[ cosθ, sinθ ],
[ sinθ, -cosθ ]
]

Wait, let's compute that:

First row: [ [0*cosθ + 1*sinθ, 1*sinθ + 0*cosθ? Wait, no, I think I should just sum the matrices.

Wait, the matrix for n_x Px is (sinθ) times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]. Then, n_z Pz is (cosθ) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]. So summing these gives:

[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So the operator P_n is (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix.

Now, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (ħ/2) |v>. Wait, no: the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so P_n |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

So the matrix equation is:

(ħ/2) * [
[ cosθ, sinθ ],
[ sinθ, -cosθ ]
] * |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

We can divide both sides by ħ/2 (since it's non-zero), so the matrix equation becomes:

[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * |v> = |v>

Hmm, so the matrix equation is:

[ [cosθ - 1, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ - 1] ] |v> = 0

Wait, no. Wait, the equation is M |v> = I |v>, where M is the above matrix. So M |v> = I |v> implies (M - I)|v> = 0. So the matrix is:

[ cosθ - 1, sinθ        ]
[ sinθ,      -cosθ -1 ]

So to find the eigenvectors, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(M - I) = 0. But wait, since we're considering the eigenvalue 1 (since (ħ/2) is already factored in), but wait no, the eigenvalue for this equation is 1, because P_n has eigenvalues (ħ/2) * (either +1 or -1). So in this case, the eigenvalue is +1 when multiplied by (ħ/2).

Wait, maybe I should proceed differently. Let me think.

The eigenvalue equation is [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] |v> = |v>

So, writing it out:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Where |v> is a column vector [a; b].

So from the first equation:

a (cosθ - 1) + b sinθ = 0

From the second equation:

a sinθ - b (cosθ + 1) = 0

These are two equations. Let me write them as:

(1) (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
(2) sinθ a - (cosθ + 1) b = 0

We can solve these for a and b. Let's take equation (1):

(cosθ - 1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ - 1) ] b.

Hmm, but denominator is cosθ -1, which can be rewritten as -(1 - cosθ), so a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b.

Alternatively, using the identity (1 - cosθ) = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So:

a = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [2 sin²(theta/2)] ) b

Simplify numerator and denominator: 2 cancels, sin(theta/2) cancels, so a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b → a = cot(theta/2) b.

So a = cot(theta/2) * b.

So the eigenvector can be written as [a; b] = [ cot(theta/2) b; b ] = b [ cot(theta/2); 1 ]

We can set b = 1 for simplicity, then a = cot(theta/2). But we need to normalize this vector.

Wait, let's compute the normalization condition. The vector is [a, b] = [cot(theta/2), 1]. The squared magnitude is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = cot²(theta/2) + 1 = csc²(theta/2) → 1/(sin²(theta/2)).

So the normalization factor is sin(theta/2), so the normalized eigenvector is [ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), 1 * sin(theta/2) ].

But cot(theta/2) is cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), so:

a = [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ] * sin(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2)

b = sin(theta/2)

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but wait, because when we have a general direction, it's possible that the eigenvector would have both magnitude and phase factors. Also, quantum states are defined up to a phase, so maybe the eigenvector is expressed in terms of spherical coordinates.

Wait, but in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi is zero. So the eigenvector would have components involving cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), perhaps multiplied by some exponential factor. But looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) for the elements. But in quantum mechanics, sometimes the spin states are written as |+n> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T. But in our case, phi is zero because the direction is in the x-z plane, so the phase factor e^{i phi} becomes 1. So the eigenvector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, looking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches. However, let me check the other options.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)) which looks like spherical coordinates, but for the components, perhaps for a different convention. But in our case, the vector components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), so option C fits.

Wait, but wait another moment. The operator P is in the direction n. So the eigenstate is |+n> which is ( cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) )^T. But in our case, phi is zero because n is in the x-z plane, so phi=0. So e^{i phi} is 1. So the components are [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So the normalized eigenvector is this, which is option C. But looking at the options, option C says exactly that. So the elements are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, looking at option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)), which seems to have additional factors. Hmm, but our result doesn't have any factors like sqrt(2/3) or sqrt(1/3). So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let's check the equations again. I think I may have missed some factors when constructing P.

Wait, the operator P along direction n is P · n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

But each P_x, P_y, P_z are already multiplied by ħ/2. So when I construct P·n, each term is (n_x * (ħ/2) matrix) + (n_y * (ħ/2) matrix) + ... So P·n equals (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z ), where σ_x, etc., are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, but in any case, the eigenvalue equation is (P·n)|v> = (ħ/2) |v>, because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalues of the spin operator S·n are ± ħ/2. So the operator (P·n) has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the equation is (P·n)|v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

So when I formed the matrix for P·n, I included the ħ/2 factor. So the matrix I have is (ħ/2) times [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ].

Wait, so the equation is (ħ/2) * matrix * |v> = (ħ/2) |v> → matrix |v> = |v>.

So as I did before, the matrix is [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ].

So solving the equations gave me the normalized eigenvector [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

So option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches. So the correct answer would be option C.

But wait, looking back at the options, option D includes sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors multiplied by ħ. Hmm, but in our solution, the eigenvector components are just cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), without any additional factors or ħ. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the eigenvector could have a dependence on the direction, but in this case, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so the eigenvector depends on theta and phi. But in this problem, phi is zero, so perhaps the eigenvector is only a function of theta.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the eigenvector given in the options isn't normalized correctly. Let me check option C: the vector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is normalized because cos^2 + sin^2 =1.

But wait, looking at the problem statement, the options are for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So option C is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spin matrices without the ħ/2 factor, but no, each component is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrices.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in constructing the operator P·n. Let me re-express.

Given that P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], and similarly for P_y and P_z. So P·n = (n_x (ħ/2) σ_x) + (n_y (ħ/2) σ_y) + (n_z (ħ/2) σ_z).

Which equals (ħ/2) (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z ).

So the matrix for P·n is (ħ/2) times the matrix (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z ), which in this case is (n_x, 0, n_z) because n is in x-z plane (so n_y=0).

So the matrix is (ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

Wait, because σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], and σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. So when n_y is zero, the matrix is n_z σ_z + n_x σ_x.

So adding those together, the matrix is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

So the operator P_n is (ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

So for the eigenvalue equation, (P_n)|v> = (ħ/2)|v>, which gives [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] |v> = |v>.

So that gives us the same equations as before. So the solution is [a, b]^T = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Thus, the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

Wait, but option D seems to have factors of sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3). How could that be?

Alternatively, perhaps the operator P_n is being treated differently. Wait, perhaps the operator for spin in an arbitrary direction is S · n, where S is (ħ/2) σ. So S · n = (ħ/2) (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). So the eigenvalues are +/- ħ/2, which matches the problem statement.

Therefore, the eigenvectors are the same as the spin-up and spin-down states along direction n.

So the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T.

In our case, since direction n is in the x-z plane, phi = 0, so the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Looking back at the options, option C is exactly this: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So the correct answer should be option C.


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each expressed as $\hbar/2$ times a $2 \times 2$ matrix. The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is constructed as $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z$, where $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$ lies in the x-z plane.

### Key Steps:
1. **Constructing the Operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$**:
   - Substituting the components of $\vec{n}$ into $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$, the operator becomes:
     \[
     \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix}
     \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
     \sin\theta & -\cos\theta
     \end{bmatrix}.
     \]

2. **Eigenvalue Equation**:
   - The eigenvalue equation is:
     \[
     \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
     \]
   - Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, the matrix equation becomes:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\
     \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1
     \end{bmatrix}
     \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = 0.
     \]

3. **Solving for the Eigenvector**:
   - From the equations:
     \[
     (\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0, \quad \sin\theta a - (\cos\theta + 1)b = 0,
     \]
     it is found that $a = \cot(\theta/2) b$. Substituting $b = 1$ for simplicity, the eigenvector is:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
     \]

4. **Normalization**:
   - The vector is already normalized since $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$.

5. **Comparison with Options**:
   - Option C matches the derived eigenvector: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.
   - Other options either include incorrect factors (e.g., $\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$ in Option D) or incorrect phase terms (e.g., $e^{i\phi}$ in Option B), which are not relevant here since $\phi = 0$ for the x-z plane.

### Conclusion:
The normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$ is $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$, which corresponds to **Option C**.

**Answer: C**
