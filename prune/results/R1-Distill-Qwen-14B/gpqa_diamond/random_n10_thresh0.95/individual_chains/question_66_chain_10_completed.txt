Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators in it must respect. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) as a low-energy limit. Effective theories are useful because they let us describe physics without knowing all the details of the high-energy (UV) completion. But they still have to respect certain symmetries that are present in the underlying theory.

The question lists four symmetries and asks which must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are combinations of these. Let me go through each symmetry one by one.

1. Lorentz Symmetry: I think SMEFT operators have to be Lorentz invariant. Because the Standard Model itself is Lorentz symmetric, so any effective theory extending it should also respect that. Otherwise, the theory wouldn't make sense as a low-energy description. So Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

2. Poincaré Symmetry: Wait, Poincaré includes Lorentz plus translations. So if the theory has Poincaré symmetry, it automatically has Lorentz symmetry. But wait, SMEFT is a field theory, and all field theories respect Poincaré symmetry because they're built upon it. So I think all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincaré symmetry. But wait, the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So Lorentz is part of Poincaré. So if an operator respects Poincaré, it respects Lorentz too. But does SMEFT require Poincaré symmetry? Because field theories are built around that.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The question is whether all operators must respect each symmetry. So let me think: are there any operators in SMEFT that might break Lorentz symmetry? No, because the effective theory by construction must respect the same symmetries as the SM. The SM is Lorentz symmetric, so SMEFT operators must also be. So Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely a must.

What about Poincaré symmetry (2)? Since Poincaré includes translations, then for a field theory, all terms must be translation invariant. Operators in SMEFT have to have terms that are local and translation invariant. So yes, Poincaré symmetry is also a must. Wait, but the question says 'must be respected by all operators'—so for each operator, its form must respect these symmetries.

So both 1 and 2 are correct. But wait, looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4, and option A is 1,2. But I'm not sure about the other symmetries yet.

3. CP symmetry: CP symmetry is a combination of charge conjugation and parity. The SM doesn't respect CP symmetry in general. For example, CP violation is observed in the neutral kaon system. So in the SM, operators can have terms that violate CP. Therefore, SMEFT would allow operators that violate CP as well. So I don't think CP symmetry (3) is a must. So operators don't all have to respect CP; some can violate it.

4. CPT symmetry: CPT is a bigger symmetry combining charge, parity, and time reversal. The SM is CPT symmetric. And since SMEFT is built on the SM, it should also respect CPT symmetry. Wait, but is that always the case? If the UV theory (beyond SMEFT) respects CPT, then the effective theory should as well. So I think all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. So 4 is a must.

Wait, but wait again. Are operators in SMEFT required to respect CPT symmetry? I'm a bit hazy on that. Let me think. The effective theory is built by matching the UV theory, which would respect CPT. So any term in SMEFT must be such that when you combine them with their conjugates (C, P, T), the theory remains consistent.

Wait, maybe CPT isn't necessarily required for each individual operator, but the theory as a whole must respect CPT. Because if an operator doesn't respect CPT, it would lead to a violation, but let me think about that. For example, in SMEFT, if you have a term that is not invariant under C, P, or T, does it affect the overall CPT symmetry?

Wait, no, because CPT symmetry combines all three. So an operator might violate P, but have its CPT conjugate also present. So the overall theory would respect CPT. But for individual operators, they don't have to be CPT-symmetric themselves. So the SMEFT operators can have terms that violate C, P, or T individually, as long as the combination preserves CPT.

Wait, but the question is about what each operator must respect. So each operator must be a part of a CPT-symmetric theory, but each individual term might not need to be CPT-invariant. So maybe the operators themselves don't have to respect CPT symmetry, but the entire theory must. So perhaps the operators themselves don't have to individually respect CPT.

But I'm probably getting this wrong. Let me think differently. The Standard Model is CPT symmetric. So the effective theory must also be CPT symmetric. Therefore, the terms in the effective theory must be arranged such that the theory is CPT symmetric. So individual operators may not have to respect CPT, but the theory as a whole must. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

Hmm, perhaps each operator must be CPT-symmetric on their own. Because if an operator isn't, then when you take its CPT conjugate, it would have to appear with a coefficient that's the CPT conjugate of the original coefficient. But in SMEFT, the coefficients are parameters (Wilson coefficients) that are arbitrary, except for constraints from symmetries. So unless the operator itself is CPT-invariant, the Wilson coefficients would have to take specific values to maintain CPT symmetry.

Wait, but the Wilson coefficients in SMEFT are generally arbitrary unless the operator is forbidden by some symmetry. So, for example, if the operator violates CPT, then the Wilson coefficients would have to satisfy certain conditions to preserve CPT in the theory. But in reality, the SMEFT is valid only if the underlying theory is CPT symmetric, so the SMEFT must respect CPT. Therefore, the operators must be such that their contributions don't break CPT. So perhaps each operator must be CPT-invariant? Or maybe all operators come in CPT-conjugate pairs with appropriate coefficients.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about an example. Suppose I have an operator O that is not CPT-invariant. Then, to maintain CPT symmetry in the theory, the coefficient c would have to satisfy c = c' (where ' denotes CPT conjugation) perhaps. But in SMEFT, the Wilson coefficients are arbitrary unless forbidden by symmetries. So if an operator is not CPT-invariant, it's allowed as long as the coefficients are such that CPT is preserved.

Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the operators themselves are required to be CPT-invariant. Because otherwise, the presence of such operators would require the Wilson coefficients to satisfy certain relations, which might not always be possible. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps only the theory as a whole must be CPT-symmetric, but individual operators don't have to be. So the question is whether each operator must be CPT-invariant. If that's the case, then 4 would be correct, but if individual operators don't have to be, then 4 isn't a must.

Wait, I think that's the case. For example, in the Standard Model, individual terms can violate P or T, but the overall theory respects CPT. So in SMEFT, individual operators can violate C, P, or T, but the theory as a whole must respect CPT. Therefore, each operator doesn't need to be CPT-invariant itself; the combination of all operators must preserve CPT.

So if that's the case, then 4 (CPT symmetry) isn't a symmetry that each operator must respect. So which symmetries must each operator respect?

So let me recap:

1. Lorentz symmetry: Yes. All operators must be Lorentz-invariant. Because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory.

2. Poincaré symmetry: Yes. Because Poincaré includes translations. So all operators must be translation-invariant. But wait, each term in the SMEFT Lagrangian is a local term, so they must be translation-invariant. So yes, operators must respect Poincaré symmetry. But wait, Poincaré is more than Lorentz; it includes translations. So if an operator doesn't respect translations, it's not a valid term. So 2 is correct.

But wait, the question gives option C as 1,2,4 and option A as 1,2. So earlier I thought that 4 (CPT) must be respected, but now I'm not so sure.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So for example, Lorentz symmetry must be respected by each operator because each term must be a Lorentz scalar. Same with Poincare, each term must be a Poincare scalar.

3. CP symmetry: No, because SMEFT allows for operators that violate CP. For example, certain operators that cause CP violation, like in the SM.

4. CPT symmetry: Hmm. So each operator must be CPT-invariant? Or the theory as a whole just needs to respect CPT.

Wait, but if the theory is CPT-invariant, then the operator and its CPT conjugate must appear with compatible coefficients. So if an operator O is not CPT-invariant, then its CPT conjugate O' would have to be present with a coefficient that's the CPT conjugate of the original coefficient. But for the theory to respect CPT, the sum of all terms must be CPT-invariant. So individual operators don't have to be CPT-invariant, but the entire Lagrangian must be.

So since the question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators, each operator doesn't necessarily have to be CPT-invariant. Therefore, 4 is not a requirement for each operator.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Because the SMEFT is built from the SM, which respects CPT, but perhaps individual operators don't have to— but the overall theory must.

So the correct symmetries that each operator must respect are Lorentz (1), Poincaré (2), and CPT (4)? Or not?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the definition of the effective theory. The SMEFT is Lorentz symmetric, so all terms must respect Lorentz symmetry. Poincaré symmetry is a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz and translations. So any term must be a scalar under Poincaré, which includes being translation-invariant. So 1 and 2 are correct.

CPT symmetry is a separate issue. The SM is CPT symmetric, so the SMEFT must also respect CPT. But individual operators don't have to be CPT-invariant. So the question is, does each operator individually have to respect CPT? I think no. Because the SMEFT could include operators that are not CPT-invariant as long as their contributions are such that the total Lagrangian is CPT-invariant.

Wait, but how would that work? For instance, if operator O is not CPT-invariant, then to maintain CPT invariance, the coefficient of O would need to have a certain relation to the coefficient of its CPT conjugate O'. But if O' is not present, that would cause a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the operators must come in CPT-conjugate pairs if they are not CPT-invariant. But the SMEFT includes all possible operators that are allowed by Lorentz symmetry (and other SM symmetries), so not necessarily all possible CPT pairs would be present.

Wait, but the SMEFT is constructed by matching to an unknown UV theory. The UV theory must respect CPT, so the effective theory must also respect CPT. Therefore, any operator added must be such that their contributions to physical processes are consistent with CPT symmetry.

But the question is about the symmetries that each individual operator must respect, not the theory as a whole. So if an operator isn't CPT-invariant, does it violate some symmetry that the operator must respect? Or does it only matter for the overall theory.

In other words, each operator must transform in a certain way under the symmetry group. For Lorentz, each operator must be a scalar (thus Lorentz-invariant). For Poincaré, each operator must be a scalar under Poincaré (translation and Lorentz-invariant).

What about CPT? Each operator isn't required to be CPT-invariant; it's the Lagrangian as a whole that must be CPT-invariant. So each operator doesn't need to individually respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, 4 is not a must for each operator.

So putting it all together, the symmetries that each operator must respect are 1 (Lorentz) and 2 (Poincaré). But wait, is Poincaré symmetry automatically respected if Lorentz and translation are? Because Poincaré includes both.

Wait, Poincaré symmetry includes translations, rotations, boosts. So for operators to respect Poincaré, they must be scalars under both Lorentz and translations.

But in field theory, all terms in the Lagrangian are translation-invariant, because the action is a integral over spacetime, and the Lagrangian density must be local. So all operators in SMEFT must be translation-invariant, hence respecting Poincaré symmetry.

Wait, but in terms of the operators (the terms in the Lagrangian), they must be scalars under the Poincaré group. So yes, each operator must respect Poincaré symmetry.

So the correct options are 1 and 2, which is option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought about CPT symmetry. So the answer might include CPT, but perhaps not.

Wait, the question is about symmetries that must be respected by all operators. So 1 and 2 are correct. So option A is 1 and 2.

But wait, wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Because Poincaré symmetry includes more than just Lorentz symmetry, like translations. So the operators must respect both Lorentz and translation symmetries, hence Poincaré.

So the correct answer would be 1 and 2, so option A.

But wait, I'm a bit unsure because sometimes people refer to Lorentz symmetry and Poincaré symmetry separately, but Poincaré is a bigger symmetry. So all operators must be Poincaré scalars.

So the answer would be options 1 and 2 must be respected, which is option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 4 (CPT) is also a must. But perhaps that's not the case for each operator. Because each operator doesn't have to be CPT-invariant, but the theory as a whole must be.

So the correct answer would be 1 and 2, which is option A.


To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, as it extends the Standard Model (SM), which itself respects Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz-invariant.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry with translation symmetry. Since SMEFT is a field theory, all terms in the Lagrangian must be translation-invariant and local. This ensures that all operators respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not respect CP symmetry in general (e.g., CP violation is observed in certain processes). SMEFT inherits this feature and allows operators that violate CP symmetry. Thus, CP symmetry is not a requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM is CPT-symmetric, and SMEFT, as an effective theory, must respect CPT symmetry overall. However, individual operators in SMEFT do not need to be CPT-invariant themselves. The CPT symmetry of the theory is ensured by the combination of operators and their coefficients, not necessarily by each operator individually.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are **Lorentz symmetry (1)** and **Poincaré symmetry (2)**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
