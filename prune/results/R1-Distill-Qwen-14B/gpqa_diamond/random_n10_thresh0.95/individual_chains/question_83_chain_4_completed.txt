Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titration, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each with two pH values. Hmm.

First, I need to understand the setup. The initial solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ water. So, the first thing I should do is calculate the concentration after dilution. Oh wait, right, dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

So, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. After adding 20 cm³ of water, V2 becomes 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40. Let me compute that. 0.05 * 20 is 1, divided by 40, which gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid has a concentration of 0.025 M.

Next, the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The first point is 25% titration. Wait, does that mean 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized, or 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence has been added? Hmm, I think it's the former. Because usually, when we talk about percentage titration, it's the percentage of the acid that's been neutralized.

Wait, let me think. At equivalence, all the acetic acid would have been neutralized by the NaOH. So 25% titration means 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH.

So, let's find out the moles of acetic acid initially. The volume is 40 cm³ (after dilution), and concentration 0.025 M. So moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). Volume is 40 cm³ = 0.04 L. Moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol.

At 25% titration, 25% of these moles have reacted. So moles reacted = 0.001 * 0.25 = 0.00025 mol.

So, during the titration, NaOH reacts with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio. So NaOH added will be 0.00025 mol. Let's find the volume of NaOH used. The concentration is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 cm³.

Wait, but maybe that's not needed for the pH calculation. Let me think about the solution at 25% titration. So we have a solution that's a mixture of acetic acid and its conjugate base, sodium acetate.

Wait, after the reaction, part of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate ions. So the initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid. Then, when we add NaOH, which is a strong base, it reacts with the acetic acid:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O.

So, at 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the moles of acetic acid remaining would be 0.75 * 0.001 = 0.00075 mol. And the moles of acetate ions produced would be 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total volume of the solution at this point is the initial 40 cm³ plus the volume of NaOH added, which is 2.5 cm³, so 42.5 cm³ total, or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations would be:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = let me compute that. 0.00075 is 7.5e-4. 7.5e-4 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Wait, but wait, that's when considering the added NaOH volume. Alternatively, maybe the volume change is negligible, but given that it's 2.5 cm³ added to 40, it's 5% change, so perhaps we can approximate, but I think the correct approach is to include it.

But perhaps in some cases, they neglect the volume change, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the options are expecting to ignore the volume change. Hmm. Let me think. Let's proceed with the exact calculation.

So the concentrations are:

CH3COOH: 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L = 0.017647 M.

CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L = 0.005882 M.

Now, the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is the negative log of Ka. Given Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = let's compute that. Log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + (-5). Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is approx -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, pKa is -log(Ka), right? So Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa = 4.733. Yes.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256. So approximately 4.26.

Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 4.26; 8.52. Option D is 4.57; 6.92. Another option, perhaps? But I'm not sure yet. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, but wait, wait. Another approach: maybe when the solution is diluted, the initial concentration is 0.025 M, but perhaps when we add NaOH, the volume change is significant. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the situation without considering the volume change. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the concentrations. Let me double-check.

Moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of CH3COOH reacts, producing 0.00025 mol of CH3COO^-.

So, the moles remaining are CH3COOH: 0.00075 mol, and CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol.

But the solution's total volume is 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

So, [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approx 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = approx 0.005882 M.

So the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Thus, pH = 4.733 + log(0.3333) ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256, which rounds to 4.26. So that's the first pH value.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the solution will consist of the sodium acetate, which is the conjugate base of acetic acid, and since sodium hydroxide is a strong base, the solution will be basic.

So, the moles of NaOH added will be equal to the moles of acetic acid. Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol. So moles of NaOH added: 0.001 mol.

The total volume of solution at equivalence is the initial 40 cm³ plus the volume of NaOH added. Let's calculate the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / 0.1 = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

The concentration of acetate ions (CH3COO^-) is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH^- ions, making the solution basic.

The hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for acetate can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So we can set up the expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced, so:

Kb = x^2 / (0.02 - x) ≈ x^2 / 0.02, since Kb is very small.

So x^2 = Kb * 0.02 ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

So x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.287e-6 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 3.287e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.287e-6) ≈ 5.484.

pH = 14 - pOH ≈ 8.516, which is approximately 8.52.

Wait, but wait, that's not matching any of the options. Hmm, looking back at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52. So that would fit.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the calculations again for the equivalence point.

Wait, when you have a salt of a weak acid and strong base, like sodium acetate, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion. So, the steps seem right.

But let me double-check the Kb calculation. Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10, correct.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M, so correct.

The expression is correct, and the approximation is valid because Kb is small.

So x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x ≈ 3.29e-6.

Then, [OH^-] = 3.29e-6, pOH = log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.485.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, log(3.29e-6) is log(3.29) + log(1e-6) → log(3.29) is approximately 0.517, so pOH is approx 5.517.

So pH = 14 - 5.517 ≈ 8.483, which is about 8.48. But the option A says 8.52. Hmm, perhaps more precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume calculation. Let me see: initial volume after dilution is 40 cm³, NaOH added at equivalence is 10 cm³, so total 50 cm³. So [CH3COO^-] is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M, correct.

Wait, perhaps using more precise numbers. Let me compute Kb more accurately.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 → 0.54054e-9 → 5.4054e-10.

Yes, correct.

Then, x^2 = 5.4054e-10 * 0.02 = 1.08108e-11.

x = sqrt(1.08108e-11) = approx 3.288e-6.

[OH^-] = 3.288e-6 → pOH = -log(3.288e-6).

Let me compute this more accurately. log(3.288) → log(3) is 0.4771, log(3.288) is a bit more. Let's see: 3.288 is between 3.2 and 3.3.

log(3.2) is 0.50515, log(3.3) is 0.5185.

3.288 is 3.2 + 0.088. So 0.088/0.1 is 0.88, so 0.50515 + 0.88*(0.5185-0.50515)=0.50515 + 0.88*(0.01335) ≈ 0.50515 + 0.01177 ≈ 0.5169.

So pOH = 5.5169.

pH = 14 - 5.5169 = 8.4831. So approximately 8.48.

But in option A, it's 8.52. Hmm, why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise calculation for the square root. Let me compute sqrt(1.08108e-11) precisely.

Compute 3.288e-6 squared: (3.288e-6)^2 = 1.0812e-11, which is accurate.

So [OH^-] = 3.288e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → Let me compute this using a calculator approach.

log(3.288e-6) = log(3.288) + log(1e-6) → about 0.517 + (-6) → -5.483.

pOH is 5.483 → pH = 14 -5.483 → 8.517. So approximately 8.52.

Ah, okay, so option A's equivalence point is 8.52.

So the first part (25% titration) gives pH around 4.26, and equivalence point around 8.52. That matches option A.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option D is 4.57 and 6.92. So why am I getting these values?

Wait another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution calculation.

Wait, initial solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluted with 20 cm³ water. So the new volume is 40 cm³. Molarity = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = (1 mmol) / 40 mL = 0.025 M. Correct.

At 25% titration, 25% of the moles have reacted. So 0.001 * 0.25 = 0.00025 mol reacted. So [A^-] is 0.00025 / (40 + 2.5) cm³ = 0.00025 / 42.5 cm³ = 0.005882 M; [HA] is 0.00075 / 42.5 cm³ = 0.017647 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log (0.005882 / 0.017647) → pKa is 4.733, and the ratio is 0.3333, log(0.3333)= -0.477.

So 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, which is 4.26. So that part is correct.

So, the first pH is 4.26, the second is 8.52, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, why would that be? Did I make a miscalculation in the equivalence point?

Another thought: perhaps the initial dilution is correct, but maybe when calculating the equivalence point, the concentration isn't 0.02 M.

Wait, the moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, and the total volume is 50 cm³. So 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider activity coefficients or something else, but no, at this level, I think it's okay to proceed with the basic approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should have used the exact concentration after considering the dilution before any titration. Wait, but when you titrate, the initial solution is the diluted acetic acid, and then you add NaOH. So yes, I think the approach is correct.

Hmm.

So, according to this, the correct answer would have pH at 25% titration of 4.26 and equivalence point at 8.52, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option A) 4.26; 8.52  
Option D) 4.57; 6.92  
Others: B and C.

So option A is the one that matches my calculations.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the 25% is referring to the volume of NaOH added, not the percentage of the acid neutralized. Hmm, could that be? Let's think.

Wait, the problem states "25% titration". In titration terminology, sometimes this refers to the percentage of the titrant added relative to the equivalence point volume. So, 25% of the volume needed for equivalence has been added. Let me check this possibility.

In that case, I need to find the volume of NaOH added at 25% of the equivalence point volume.

Earlier, I found that the equivalence point requires 10 cm³ of NaOH. So 25% would be 2.5 cm³ added.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier in the first calculation. So that's the same scenario: 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added, which is 25% of the equivalence volume.

So the initial approach was correct. So the first pH is 4.26, the second is 8.52.

So the correct option is A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Alternative approach: perhaps for the equivalence point, the solution is a buffer solution, but no, because at equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate ions. So the solution is just the sodium acetate in water, which is a basic solution as I calculated.

So yes, the equivalence point's pH is around 8.52.

So the correct answer should be option A: 4.26; 8.52.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ at 0.05 M, and it is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40.00 cm³. Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the new concentration is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1 \cdot V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we calculate the pH at 25% titration. At this point, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of acetic acid initially are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.025 \cdot 0.04 = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

At 25% titration, 25% of these moles have reacted with NaOH:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH remaining} = 0.001 \cdot 0.75 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]
\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- \text{(produced)} = 0.001 \cdot 0.25 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is now \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 \) (from the NaOH added). The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right).
\]

The ratio \( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \approx 0.3333 \), and \( \log(0.3333) \approx -0.477 \). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 - 0.477 \approx 4.256 \, \text{(rounded to 4.26)}.
\]

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming sodium acetate. The moles of sodium acetate are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 \). The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( K_b \) for acetate is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation \( K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} \), where \( x = [\text{OH}^-] \):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.483.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.483 \approx 8.517 \, \text{(rounded to 8.52)}.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. These values match **Option A**.
