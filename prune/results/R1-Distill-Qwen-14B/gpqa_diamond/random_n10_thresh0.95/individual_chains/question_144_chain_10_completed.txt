Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when particles like mesons decay, their mean decay distance depends on their lifetime and speed. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A, B, C, D with some numbers in meters.

Wait, I think I remember that the mean decay distance (L) is given by the product of the particle's speed (v) and its lifetime (τ). So, L = v * τ. Right. So I need to find τ first.

But how do I find τ? Oh, right, the lifetime is related to the particle's width Γ through the uncertainty principle. The relation is τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, the units here are in GeV and MeV, so I need to make sure I convert everything properly.

Wait, Γ is given as 320 MeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV. Because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So Γ_X = 0.32 GeV.

But wait, the formula for τ is τ = ħ / (Γ c²), or something like that? Hmm, I might be mixing up some terms. Let me think again.

The width Γ is related to the lifetime via τ ≈ ħ/(Γ), but I'm a bit unsure about the exact factors. Oh wait, no, the general formula is Γ = ħ/τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I think the width is given in energy terms, so maybe I need to account for the mass-energy equivalence correctly.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused about the units. Let me structure this.

First, calculate the lifetime τ. The formula for the lifetime is τ = ħ / (Γ). But Γ is given in GeV, so I need to convert that into appropriate units, probably to Joules or something else that works with the Planck constant.

Wait, Planck constant ħ has units of J·s. So I need to convert Γ from GeV to J.

So first, let's convert Γ from GeV to Joules. 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J. So 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So 1 GeV = 1.60218e-10 J.

So Γ = 0.32 GeV = 0.32 * 1.60218e-10 J = let's compute that.

0.32 * 1.60218e-10 = 0.32 * 1.60218 ≈ 0.5126976e-10 J. So approximately 5.127e-11 J.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, no: 0.32 * 1.60218e-10 = 0.32 * 1.60218 = 0.5126976, but multiplied by 1e-10. So 5.126976e-11 J.

So Γ is 5.126976e-11 J. Now, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (5.126976e-11 J) = let's compute that.

1.0545718e-34 / 5.126976e-11 = approximately (1.05457 /5.126976) * 1e-24. Let me compute 1.05457 /5.126976.

1.05457 ÷ 5.126976 ≈ 0.2057.

So τ ≈ 0.2057e-24 s, which is 2.057e-25 seconds.

Wait, that seems really short. But mesons are elementary particles, so their lifetimes are very short. Okay, I'll go with that.

Next, I need the velocity v of the meson. How to find v?

I think I can get the velocity from the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The production energy E_X is given as 8 GeV, and the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV. So I can find the kinetic energy, but probably it's easier to work in natural units where c=1 and then adjust for units.

Wait, in particle physics, energies are often given in units of GeV, masses in GeV/c². Hmm, but when working with velocities, I might need to use the relation between energy, mass, and momentum.

The total energy E of the particle is given, which is 8 GeV. The rest mass is m_X c² = 1.2 GeV. Wait, but in natural units (like when c=1 and ħ=1), E is in GeV, m in GeV/c², and when you set c=1, it's just GeV.

So, the energy E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. So γ = E / (m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So γ is 6.6667.

But wait, in natural units, c=1, so E = γ m, and m = m_X = 1.2 GeV.

So, since E = γ m, γ = E / m = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666667.

The Lorentz factor γ is 6.6667.

Now, the velocity v can be found from γ. The relation between gamma and velocity is γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Solving for v:

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²).

So, let's compute 1/γ²: (1/6.6667)^2 ≈ (0.15)^2 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 1/γ² ≈ 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

So sqrt(0.9775) ≈ approximately 0.9887.

So v ≈ c * 0.9887.

Let me compute that more accurately. Let's compute 1/γ²:

γ is 8/(1.2) = 20/3 ≈6.6666666667.

So 1/γ² = (3/20)^2 = 9/(400) = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

The square root of 0.9775: Let's calculate it.

0.9775 is 1 - 0.0225.

We can approximate sqrt(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2 for small x. So x is 0.0225, so sqrt(1 - 0.0225) ≈ 1 - 0.01125 = 0.98875.

But wait, let's compute it more accurately. Let's see:

0.9887^2 = 0.9887 *0.9887.

Let me compute that:

0.9887 * 0.9887 = (1 - 0.0113)^2 = 1 - 2*0.0113 + 0.0113^2 ≈ 0.9774.

Which is correct. So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

Alternatively, maybe using a calculator approach: sqrt(0.9775) is about 0.9887.

So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

Now, the speed of light c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, with τ = 2.057e-25 seconds, and v ≈2.966e8 m/s, the decay length L is v * τ.

So L = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.057e-25 s.

Multiply 2.966e8 by 2.057e-25.

Let me compute that: 2.966 * 2.057 ≈ 6.115.

So 6.115e(8 -25) = 6.115e-17 meters.

Wait, but that's 6.1e-17 meters. That's 6.1 * 1e-17 m. But the options are around 1e-15 or 1e-16. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me double-check the numbers. Maybe I messed up a unit conversion.

Wait, I had τ = 2.057e-25 s, and v = 2.966e8 m/s.

So 2.966e8 * 2.057e-25 = (2.966 * 2.057) * 1e(8-25) = (6.115) * 1e-17 = 6.115e-17 m.

But the options don't have 6e-17. Let me see the options again.

Options:

A)5.0223 * 10^-16 m

B)4.0655 *10^-15 m

C)5.0223 *10^-15 m

D)4.0655 *10^-16 m

Hmm, my calculation gives 6e-17 m, but that's not one of the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of τ.

Wait, let me recalculate the steps.

First, Γ is 0.32 GeV. So converting that to Joules: 0.32 GeV = 0.32 * 1.602e-10 J = 5.1264e-11 J.

Then, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (1.05457e-34) / (5.1264e-11) = let's compute this.

1.05457e-34 divided by 5.1264e-11 equals approximately (1.05457 /5.1264) * 1e-23.

1.05457 /5.1264 ≈ approx 0.2057.

So 0.2057e-23 = 2.057e-24 seconds.

Wait, I think I made a miscalculation earlier. Because 1e-34 /1e-11 is 1e-23, right.

Wait, 1e-34 divided by 1e-11 is 1e-23. So the previous calculation had 1e-24, which was incorrect. So correct τ is 2.057e-24 seconds.

Ah, that's a big difference. So now, L = v * τ = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.

Multiply 2.966e8 by 2.057e-24.

2.966 * 2.057 ≈ let's compute 2.966 *2 =5.932, 2.966 *0.057≈0.168, total around 6.10.

So 6.10e(8-24) = 6.10e-16 meters.

Wait, 6.1e-16 meters. But the options don't have that either.

Wait the options are A)5.0223e-16, D)4.0655e-16.

Hmm. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of v?

Wait, let's check that again.

Earlier, I computed gamma as 8 GeV /1.2 GeV = 6.6667.

Then, v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) = c * sqrt(1 - (1/(40/9))) because 6.6667 is 20/3, so (20/3)^2 is 400/9.

Wait, 1/γ² = (3/20)^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 -0.0225 is 0.9775, sqrt is ~0.9887, so v=0.9887c.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute more precisely. Let's compute 20/3 is approximately 6.66666666667.

So gamma is 20/3.

So 1/γ² is (3/20)^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

Square root of 0.9775: let me compute it more accurately. Let's use a calculator approach.

We can compute sqrt(0.9775) as follows.

We know that 0.9887^2 = approximately 0.9775, as earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps using a better approximation.

Let's compute 0.9887^2:

0.9887 *0.9887 = (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = (0.98)^2 + 2*(0.98)(0.0087) + (0.0087)^2 = 0.9604 + 0.0172 + 0.00007569 = 0.9604 + 0.0172 = 0.9776 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.97767569.

Which is very close to 0.9775. So perhaps a better approximation is 0.9887.

So v ≈ 0.9887c.

Hmm, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps using beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)}.

Which is sqrt(1 - (9/400}) = sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(0.9775).

Wait, another way: using the relation between gamma and velocity.

Gamma is 20/3. So gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 20/3.

So 1 - beta^2 = (3/20)^2 = 9/400.

So beta^2 = 1 -9/400 = 391/400 = 0.9775.

So beta = sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So that's correct.

So v = 0.9887c.

But wait, perhaps I should calculate beta more accurately.

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775).

What is sqrt(0.9775)?

Let me compute it numerically.

Let me think: 0.988^2 = (0.98)^2 + 2*0.98*0.008 +0.008^2 = 0.9604 + 0.01568 + 0.000064 = 0.9604+0.01568=0.97608 +0.000064 = 0.976144. Which is less than 0.9775.

So 0.988^2 = 0.976144.

0.989^2: 0.989 *0.989.

Compute 1000 * 0.989 is 989.

So 989 * 989 = ?

Wait, perhaps compute (0.989)^2 = 0.989 *0.989.

= (1 -0.011)^2 = 1 - 2*0.011 + 0.000121 = 1 -0.022 +0.000121= 0.978121.

But wait, that's 0.978121, which is higher than 0.9775.

So sqrt(0.9775) is between 0.988 and 0.989.

Let's find a better approximation.

Let me set x = 0.988, x²=0.976144.

We need x such that x²=0.9775.

Let me compute x=0.988 + delta.

We have (0.988 + delta)^2 =0.9775.

Expanding, 0.988^2 + 2*0.988 *delta + delta^2 =0.9775.

We have 0.976144 + 1.976 * delta + delta^2 =0.9775.

Subtract 0.976144: 1.976 delta + delta^2 =0.9775-0.976144=0.001356.

Assuming delta is small, delta^2 is negligible.

So 1.976 delta ≈0.001356 → delta ≈ 0.001356 /1.976 ≈0.000686.

So x≈0.988 +0.000686=0.988686.

So beta ≈0.988686.

So v=0.988686 c.

So more accurately, v ≈0.988686 *3e8 m/s ≈2.966e8 m/s.

Wait, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So maybe the issue is elsewhere.

Let me go back to the calculation of tau.

Tau = ħ / (Gamma).

Gamma is 0.32 GeV, which is 0.32 *1.602e-10 J =5.1264e-11 J.

So tau = (1.0545718e-34 J s) / (5.1264e-11 J) = 1.05457e-34 /5.1264e-11.

Let me compute this division.

1.05457e-34 /5.1264e-11 = (1.05457 /5.1264) * 1e-23.

1.05457 /5.1264 ≈0.2057.

So 0.2057e-23 → 2.057e-24 seconds.

So tau is 2.057e-24 seconds.

Then, L = v * tau = (0.988686 c) * (2.057e-24 s).

c is 3e8 m/s.

So 0.988686 *3e8 ≈2.966e8 m/s.

So L = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s = (2.966 *2.057) * 1e-16 m.

Wait, 2.966e8 * 2.057e-24 is 2.966*2.057 * 1e(8-24) → 6.106e-16 meters.

Wait, 6.106e-16 m. But the options are A:5.02e-16, D:4.06e-16.

Hmm, none of the options match that. Did I make a mistake in unit conversions?

Wait, perhaps I messed up gamma calculation.

Wait, the energy given is production energy E_X=8 GeV. The mass is m_X=1.2 GeV. So the total energy E is 8 GeV, which is the sum of rest mass and kinetic energy.

Wait, but in relativity, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So perhaps I should compute the momentum p, then find beta from p and E.

Let me try that approach.

So E =8 GeV, m c^2=1.2 GeV.

So, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So, (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2 = (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 (GeV)^2.

Which is 64 - 1.44 =62.56 (GeV)^2.

So pc = sqrt(62.56) GeV ≈7.91 GeV.

Wait, sqrt(62.56)=7.91?

Wait, sqrt(64) is 8, so sqrt(62.56) is a bit less. Let me compute it accurately.

7.91^2 = (7.9)^2 + 2*(7.9)*0.01 + (0.01)^2.

7.9^2 is 62.41. 2 *7.9 *0.01=0.158. So 62.41 +0.158=62.568, plus 0.0001 (from 0.01^2) is 62.5681.

So 7.91^2 =62.5681, which is a bit higher than 62.56. So let me compute sqrt(62.56) accurately.

Let me note that 7.9^2=62.41.

62.56-62.41=0.15. So delta is 0.15.

So 7.9 + x)^2 =62.56.

We have (7.9)^2 + 2 *7.9 x +x^2 =62.56.

62.41 + 15.8 x +x^2 =62.56.

15.8x ≈0.15 → x≈0.15/15.8≈0.00949.

So sqrt(62.56) ≈7.9 +0.00949≈7.9095.

So pc ≈7.9095 GeV.

So p = (7.9095 GeV) / c.

Because pc =7.9095 GeV, so p =7.9095 GeV /c.

Now, relativistic momentum p is given by p = gamma m v.

But perhaps it's better to find beta from p and E.

We have beta = v/c = (pc^2)/(E).

Because E = gamma m c^2, and p = gamma m v.

So, beta = v/c = (p c)/(gamma m) = (p c^2)/(E).

So beta = (p c^2)/E.

Wait, because E = gamma m c^2, and p = gamma m v.

So, p c = gamma m v c.

So, p c = gamma m v c = gamma m c (v/c) = gamma m c beta.

So, beta = (p c)/(gamma m c) ) = p c/(gamma m c) = p/(gamma m).

Wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, another way: beta = (pc^2)/(E).

So, beta = (p c^2) / E.

Because E = gamma m c^2.

So, p c = beta gamma m c^2.

So, p c^2 = beta gamma m c^3.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again.

We have E = gamma m c^2.

p = gamma m v.

So v = beta c.

So, p = gamma m beta c.

We can write beta = p c/(gamma m c^2) ) = (p c^2)/(gamma m c^3) )? Hmm, not sure. Maybe better to express beta in terms of E and p.

Another approach: The relation between E, p, and beta is:

E = gamma m c^2.

p = gamma m beta c.

So, beta = (p c)/(gamma m c^2) )= (p c)/(E).

Because gamma m c^2 = E.

So, beta = (p c) / E.

So, in terms of GeV and c=1 units (natural units), p c is in GeV, E is in GeV.

So, beta = (p c) / E.

We calculated p c =7.9095 GeV.

E=8 GeV.

So beta =7.9095 /8 ≈0.9887.

Which is consistent with our earlier calculation.

So beta is ≈0.9887, so v ≈0.9887 c.

So that part is correct.

Now, back to the decay length.

L = v * tau.

v =0.9887 c ≈ (0.9887)(3e8 m/s) ≈2.966e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.057e-24 seconds.

So, L =2.966e8 m/s *2.057e-24 s = 6.106e-16 m.

Hmm, but the options are A)5.02e-16, D)4.06e-16.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau.

Wait, perhaps I should take into account that the width Gamma is in units of energy, and the lifetime is tau = ħ/(Gamma c^2).

Wait, wait a second. Because Gamma has units of energy, and the lifetime is related by tau = ħ/(Gamma).

But wait, when units are involved, perhaps I should write the formula correctly.

The decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime tau by Γ = ħ / tau.

Wait, wait, no: the uncertainty principle says delta E * delta t ≈ ħ/2.

In particle physics, the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) is the width Γ, and the uncertainty in time is the lifetime τ. So Γ * τ ≈ ħ.

So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But in natural units where ħ=1, this would be Γ ≈ 1/tau.

But when including units, perhaps the formula is Γ (in energy) = ħ c^5 / (tau) ?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me check the formula for the mean lifetime of a particle.

The mean lifetime tau (in seconds) is related to the decay width Gamma (in energy units, say GeV) by the formula:

tau = ħ / (Gamma c^2)

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, more accurately, the decay width Γ (in GeV) is related to the mean lifetime tau (in seconds) by:

Gamma (GeV) = (ħ c^5) / (tau (s)) ) * [unit conversion factor].

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

Gamma (in eV) = (ħ c^5) / (tau (s)) ) * (conversion factors).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the following relation:

Gamma (eV) = (ħ c^5) / (tau (s)) )

So, solving for tau:

tau = ħ c^5 / (Gamma (eV)).

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Let me think in terms of units.

Gamma has units of energy, say GeV.

Tau has units of seconds.

Planck's constant ħ has units of J·s = (C·V·s).

But c has units of m/s.

So, let's see:

Gamma (GeV) = 1e9 eV.

ħ has units of J·s = (kg·m²/s).

c^5 has units of (m/s)^5.

So, putting it all together, tau (s) = ħ / (Gamma * c^5) ) * [some unit conversion factors].

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me instead look for the standard formula.

Upon checking, the relation between the decay width Γ (in energy units) and the mean lifetime τ is given by:

Γ = ħ / τ

But wait, this would be in natural units where c=1. But when including c, perhaps the formula is:

Γ = (ħ c^5) / (tau) * (some factor).

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Γ (eV) = (ħ c^5)/(tau (s)) ) * (1/(eV·s)).

Wait, I'm getting really stuck on this. Let me look for a standard formula.

Another approach: The natural unit system uses c=1 and ħ=1.

In that system, energy and mass are measured in eV and eV/c², but when c=1, they are eV and eV.

So, the formula Γ (eV) = ħ (eV s) / tau (s) → So, tau (s) = ħ (eV s) / Γ (eV) → tau = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (Gamma in J).

Wait, so perhaps I was correct in the initial calculation.

Gamma = 0.32 GeV =0.32e9 eV =0.32e9 *1.602e-19 J =0.32 *1.602e-10 J =5.1264e-11 J.

Tau = ħ / Gamma = (1.0545718e-34 J s) / (5.1264e-11 J) )= 2.057e-24 seconds.

So that part is correct.

So L = v tau = (0.9887 *3e8 m/s) * 2.057e-24 s = 6.106e-16 m.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the velocity.

Wait, perhaps the production energy is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Wait, the question says, "production energy is E_X=8 GeV."

Wait, in particle physics, when a particle is produced, the energy given is often the center-of-mass energy, which is the total energy. So I think the initial approach is correct, that E is the total energy.

But perhaps it's the kinetic energy. Let me check that.

If E_X is the kinetic energy (K), then the total energy E would be K + m c^2.

So, E =8 GeV +1.2 GeV=9.2 GeV.

Then, gamma would be E/(m c^2) =9.2 /1.2 ≈7.6667.

So gamma=7.6667.

Then, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Gamma^2= (7.6667)^2 ≈58.777.

So, 1/gamma^2=1/58.777≈0.017.

So, 1 -0.017=0.983.

sqrt(0.983)≈0.9915.

So beta≈0.9915.

So v=0.9915 c.

Then, L= v * tau =0.9915 *3e8 m/s *2.057e-24 s.

Compute that: 0.9915 *3e8 =2.9745e8 m/s.

2.9745e8 *2.057e-24 = (2.9745 *2.057) *1e-16.

2.9745 *2.057 ≈6.13, so L≈6.13e-16 m.

Still not matching the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the decay width is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV, but I should use Γ in GeV, but perhaps I should use it in MeV in the formula?

Wait, the formula is tau = ħ/(Gamma), where Gamma is in J.

So, if I had Gamma in J, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should use the natural unit conversion where Gamma is in GeV, and use the appropriate factors with ħc.

Wait, another approach: compute the decay length using the formula:

L = (v * c) * (tau) → but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a standard formula for the mean decay length of a particle.

The standard formula is:

L = (gamma * beta c * tau) ) 

Wait, but gamma beta c tau would be (gamma beta) * c tau.

Wait, but perhaps not. Let me think.

Wait, I think the formula for decay length is L = gamma * beta c tau.

Because tau is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame), and in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau. So the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau, and the speed is beta c. So L = (gamma tau) * (beta c ) = gamma beta c tau.

So, let's compute it that way.

Gamma is 6.6667, beta is 0.9887.

So, gamma beta =6.6667 *0.9887≈6.60.

So, gamma beta c tau =6.60 *3e8 m/s *2.057e-24 s.

Compute that:6.60 *3e8 =1.98e9 m/s.

1.98e9 m/s *2.057e-24 s = (1.98 *2.057) *1e-15 m.

1.98 *2.057 ≈4.08.

So, L≈4.08e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.08e-15 meters.

Looking back at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option D is 4.0655e-16 m.

So 4.08e-15 is close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.

So perhaps this is the correct approach.

Wait, but why did I get a different answer before? Oh, because when I used L = v * tau, I forgot to account for the time dilation. Because tau is the proper lifetime, in the lab frame the lifetime is gamma * tau. So L = v * (gamma tau) = gamma beta c tau.

Ah, I see. That makes sense. So in my initial calculation, I used L = v * tau, which is incorrect because tau is the proper lifetime. The lab frame lifetime is gamma tau, so the correct formula is L= v * gamma tau = gamma beta c tau.

That explains why the previous calculation was wrong. Using the correct formula gives L=gamma beta c tau, which is approximately 4.08e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.

So the correct answer should be option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but let me compute it with more precise numbers.

Gamma is 8 GeV /1.2 GeV = 6.666666667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) =sqrt(1 - (1/(400/9))) = sqrt( (400/9 -9)/ (400/9) ) = sqrt( (391/9)/(400/9) ) = sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887.

So, gamma beta =6.666666667 *0.9887 ≈6.60.

Then, c tau =3e8 m/s *2.057e-24 s =6.171e-16 m.

So, L= gamma beta * c tau =6.60 *6.171e-16 ≈4.08e-15 m.

Which is close to option B's 4.0655e-15 m.

Hmmm, so perhaps I should recalculate with exact numbers.

Let me compute gamma beta more accurately.

Gamma is 8/1.2=20/3≈6.6666667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (3/20)^2 )= sqrt(1 -9/400)=sqrt(391/400)=sqrt(0.9775)=0.98868.

So gamma beta=6.6666667 * 0.98868≈?

6 *0.98868=5.93208.

0.6666667 *0.98868≈0.65912.

Total gamma beta ≈5.93208+0.65912=6.5912.

So gamma beta≈6.5912.

Now, c tau=3e8 m/s *2.057e-24 s=3e8 *2.057e-24 =6.171e-16 m.

So, L=gamma beta * c tau=6.5912 *6.171e-16=?

6.5912 *6.171e-16 = (6 *6.171) + (0.5912 *6.171) )e-16.

Wait, 6 *6.171 =37.026.

0.5912 *6.171 ≈3.645.

So total is approximately (37.026 +3.645)=40.671 →40.671e-16 m =4.0671e-15 m.

Which is very close to option B's 4.0655e-15 m.

So the correct answer is B.


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau \)
The width \( \Gamma \) is related to the proper lifetime \( \tau \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \), we convert \( \Gamma \) to joules:

\[
\Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{J/GeV} = 5.1264 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{J}
\]

The reduced Planck constant is \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). Substituting into the formula for \( \tau \):

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{5.1264 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 2.057 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \)
The total energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and the rest mass energy \( m_X c^2 = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X c^2} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

The velocity \( \beta \) is calculated using:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1}{6.6667}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \), \( \beta = 0.9887 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau = 2.057 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 6.6667 \times 0.9887 \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 2.057 \times 10^{-24}
\]

First, calculate \( \gamma \beta \):

\[
\gamma \beta = 6.6667 \times 0.9887 \approx 6.5912
\]

Then, calculate \( c \tau \):

\[
c \tau = 3 \times 10^8 \times 2.057 \times 10^{-24} = 6.171 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
\]

Finally, calculate \( L \):

\[
L = 6.5912 \times 6.171 \times 10^{-16} \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The closest option to \( L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.
