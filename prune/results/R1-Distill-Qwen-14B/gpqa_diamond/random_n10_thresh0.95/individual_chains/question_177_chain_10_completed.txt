Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I want to make sure I understand it properly before diving in. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Similarly, Star_1's mass is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured the radial velocities: Star_1 is stationary (0 km/s), and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. The question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. So, the first thing I recall is that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity (L) of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. The peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So, if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Wait, because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So if λ_max is same, T is same.

Wait, but wait—that's assuming no redshift or blueshift due to radial velocity. Because if a star is moving towards us or away, its light would be Doppler shifted, which would change the observed wavelength. So I think I need to take that into account.

So, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so no Doppler shift. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Hmm, but which direction? If it's moving towards us, it would blueshift, making the observed λ shorter. If moving away, redshift, λ longer. Wait, but the question says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So maybe the Doppler shift affects the observed λ_max.

Wait, let's think. For Star_2, which is moving at 700 km/s, but the problem doesn't specify direction. Oh, but wait, the radial velocity is given as 700 km/s. Radial velocity is the component along the line of sight. So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of +700 km/s (assuming away from us), then its light is redshifted. So the observed λ_max would be longer than its actual emitted λ_max. Conversely, if moving towards us, blueshifted, λ_max would be shorter.

But the problem states that the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So, let me model this.

Star_1's observed λ_max is λ₁ = b / T₁.

Star_2's observed λ_max is λ₂ = (b / T₂) * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c)/(1 - v_r2/c) ) ), where v_r2 is the radial velocity of Star_2.

Wait, no. The Doppler effect formula for wavelength shift when the source is moving with velocity v relative to the observer is:

λ_observed = λ_source * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) 

or λ_observed = λ_source * (1 + v/c)/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) ) ?

Wait, no, the relativistic Doppler shift formula is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), assuming v is positive when moving away (redshift). Alternatively, for non-relativistic speeds, which 700 km/s probably is (as c is ~3e5 km/s), so v << c, so we can approximate the Doppler shift with the non-relativistic formula: λ_observed ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v/c )

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me get this straight. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when moving away is λ = λ0 (1 + v/c), where v is positive if moving away. So if Star_2 is moving away at v = 700 km/s, then its observed λ_max is longer than the emitted λ_max. But Star_1's λ_max is the same as Star_2's observed λ_max. Or wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, Star_1's λ_max is λ₁, and Star_2's observed λ_max is λ₂, and they are the same. So λ₁ = λ₂.

Wait, let me clarify. If Star_2 is moving away, its emitted λ_max would be λ_emitted = λ_observed * (1 - v/c), or wait, perhaps I should think in terms of frequency. Because wavelength and frequency are inversely related. Let me think again.

The Doppler effect for a star moving with velocity v (radial) is given by:

λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c) 

But wait, wait. When the star is moving away (v positive), the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), so λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c), where v is positive if moving away. So if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ is longer than the emitted.

But according to the problem, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So, let's denote λ₁ as Star_1's observed λ_max (which is equal to the emitted, since Star_1 has v=0), and λ₂ as Star_2's observed λ_max. So λ₁ = λ₂.

So, for Star_2, λ₂ = λ_emitted_2 * (1 + v_2/c ), where v_2 is Star_2's radial velocity. The problem says v_2 is 700 km/s. But wait, is v positive or negative? If the velocity is towards us, v is negative, so (1 + v/c) would be (1 - |v|/c). But the problem just gives the radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s. It doesn't specify direction. Hmm, but in the context of radial velocity measurements, if the velocity is positive, it's moving away, and negative is moving towards.

Wait, the problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. So Star_1 is at rest relative to us, and Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. But positive or negative? The question doesn't specify, but typically, in such contexts, a positive radial velocity means moving away. So I think it's safe to assume that Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s.

So, λ₁ = λ_emitted_1, because Star_1 is at rest. λ₂ = λ_emitted_2 * (1 + v_2/c ), where v_2=700 km/s.

But the problem states that λ₁ = λ₂. So,

λ_emitted_1 = λ_emitted_2 * (1 + v_2/c )

Wait, no. Because Star_1's emitted λ is λ₁, and Star_2's emitted λ is λ_emitted_2 (which, if it were at rest, would be λ_emitted_2; but because it's moving away, its observed λ is longer). So, to have λ₁ = λ₂, we have:

λ₁ = λ_emitted_2 * (1 + v_2/c )

But from Wien's law, λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So:

λ_emitted_1 = b / T₁

λ_emitted_2 = b / T₂

So,

λ₁ = (b / T₂) * (1 + v_2/c )

But λ₁ is also (b / T₁), because for Star_1, since it's not moving, λ₁ = b / T₁.

So,

b / T₁ = (b / T₂) * (1 + v_2/c )

Cancel b from both sides:

1 / T₁ = (1 / T₂) * (1 + v_2/c )

So,

T₂ = T₁ * (1 + v_2/c )

But since v_2 is 700 km/s, and c is about 3e5 km/s, v_2/c is 700 / 3e5 ≈ 0.002333... So (1 + v_2/c ) ≈ 1.002333.

So,

T₂ ≈ T₁ * 1.002333.

Wait, but that would make T₂ slightly higher than T₁. That can't be, because if Star_2 is moving away, the observed λ would be longer than emitted. Wait, but in terms of temperature, T is proportional to 1/λ. So if Star_2's observed λ is same as Star_1's emitted λ, which is shorter than Star_2's emitted λ (because it's moving away and λ_observed is longer), that would imply that Star_2's emitted λ is shorter than Star_1's emitted λ. So, T₂ would be higher than T₁.

Wait, let me think again. Let me go step by step.

Star_1: stationary. Its λ_max is λ₁ = b / T₁.

Star_2: moving away at v=700 km/s. Its emitted λ_max is λ_2_emit = b / T₂. But because it's moving away, the observed λ is λ_2_obs = λ_2_emit * (1 + v_2/c )

We are told that λ_1 = λ_2_obs.

So,

λ₁ = λ_2_emit * (1 + v_2/c )

But λ₁ is also λ_1_emit = b / T₁.

So,

λ_1_emit = λ_2_emit * (1 + v_2/c )

But λ_1_emit = b / T₁ and λ_2_emit = b / T₂.

So,

b / T₁ = (b / T₂) * (1 + v_2/c )

Divide both sides by b:

(1/T₁) = (1/T₂) * (1 + v_2/c )

=> T₂ = T₁ * (1 + v_2/c )

So T₂ is higher than T₁. Because (1 + v_2/c ) is about 1.002333.

So T₂ ≈ T₁ * 1.002333.

So, temperatures are T₁ and T₂ = T₁ * 1.002333.

But wait, this seems like a very small difference in temperature. Maybe I should compute it more accurately.

v_2 =700 km/s. c = 3e5 km/s.

v_2/c = 700 / 300000 = 0.002333...

So, 1 + v_2/c ≈ 1.0023333.

So T₂ = T₁ * 1.0023333.

So, the temperature of Star_2 is slightly higher than that of Star_1.

Now, the luminosity of each star is given by L = 4π R² σ T^4.

So, L₁ = 4π R₁² σ T₁^4.

L₂ = 4π R₂² σ T₂^4.

We need to find the ratio L₁/L₂.

Given: R₁ = 1.5 R₂.

So,

L₁/L₂ = ( R₁² T₁^4 ) / ( R₂² T₂^4 )

= ( (1.5 R₂ )² / R₂² ) * ( T₁^4 / T₂^4 )

= ( (2.25 R₂² ) / R₂² ) * ( T₁^4 / T₂^4 )

= 2.25 * ( T₁ / T₂ )^4.

But T₂ = T₁ * (1 + v_2/c ), so T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_2/c ) = 1 / 1.0023333 ≈ 0.99767.

So,

( T₁ / T₂ )^4 ≈ (0.99767)^4.

Let me compute 0.99767^4.

Compute 0.99767^2 first: 0.99767 * 0.99767 ≈ (1 - 0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2 ≈ 0.99534 - 0.0000054 (approx 0.995335). Wait, perhaps exact calculation is better.

Wait, 0.99767 is approximately 1 - 0.00233.

So,

(0.99767)^2 = (1 - 0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00466 + 0.0000054 ≈ approximately 0.9953454.

Then, (0.99767)^4 = (0.99767^2)^2 ≈ (0.9953454)^2.

Compute 0.9953454^2: (1 - 0.0046546)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.0046546 + (0.0046546)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0093092 + 0.00002166 ≈ approximately 0.990712.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait 0.9953454 * 0.9953454:

Let me compute 0.9953454 * 0.9953454.

= (0.995 + 0.0003454)^2

= 0.995^2 + 2*0.995 * 0.0003454 + (0.0003454)^2

0.995^2 = (1 - 0.005)^2 = 1 - 0.01 + 0.000025 = 0.990025.

2*0.995 * 0.0003454 = 2 * 0.995 * 0.0003454 ≈ 2 * 0.995 * 0.0003454 ≈ 0.995 * 0.0006908 ≈ 0.0006908 * approx 1 (since 0.995 ≈ 1) → approx 0.000689.

(0.0003454)^2 ≈ 1.19e-7.

So adding all together: 0.990025 + 0.000689 + 0.000000119 ≈ approx 0.990714.

So, (0.99767)^4 ≈ 0.990714.

So, L₁/L₂ ≈ 2.25 * 0.990714 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

Wait, 2.25 * 0.9907 = let me compute that.

2 * 0.9907 = 1.9814.

0.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 0.247675.

Adding, 1.9814 + 0.247675 ≈ 2.229075.

Hmm, so approximately 2.229.

Looking back at the options, option D is ~2.23, option A is ~2.25. So the calculated value is approximately 2.23, which matches option D.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations. Because maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere.

So, v_2 =700 km/s. v_2/c = 700 / 3e5 = 700/300000 = 0.0023333... So 1 + v_2/c = 1.0023333.

So, T₂ = T₁ * 1.0023333.

Thus, T₁/T₂ = 1/1.0023333 ≈ 0.99767.

So, (T₁/T₂)^4 ≈ (0.99767)^4.

Earlier, I approximated that as 0.9907.

But let me compute more accurately.

Compute 0.99767^4:

Compute 0.99767^2: 0.99767 * 0.99767.

Let me compute 0.99767 * 0.99767.

= (1 - 0.00233) * (1 - 0.00233)

= 1 - 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2.

0.00233^2 = 5.4289e-6.

So, 1 - 0.00466 + 0.0000054289 = 0.9953454289.

Now, square that again: (0.9953454289)^2.

Compute 0.9953454289^2:

= (1 - 0.0046545711)^2.

= 1 - 2*0.0046545711 + (0.0046545711)^2.

= 1 - 0.0093091422 + 0.000021665.

= 0.990690823.

So, (0.99767)^4 ≈ 0.9906908.

So, L₁/L₂ = 2.25 * 0.9906908 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99069.

Let me compute 2.25 * 0.99069:

2 * 0.99069 = 1.98138.

0.25 * 0.99069 = 0.2476725.

Adding them: 1.98138 + 0.2476725 = 2.2290525.

So approximately 2.229, which is about 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

Wait, but let me think again: the problem states that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2. So, the ratio L₁/L₂ is greater than 1.

Wait, wait! Wait a minute. Wait, in the problem statement, when they compute the luminosity, they find that Star_1's luminosity is greater by a factor. So the ratio is L₁/L₂.

But according to our calculation, it's approximately 2.23. So the correct option is D.

But wait, another approach. Let's think about the Doppler effect. Star_2's observed temperature is lower than its emitted temperature? Or higher?

Wait, when a star moves away, the observed wavelength is longer, which corresponds to lower temperature.

Because λ_max = b / T. So if observed λ is longer, then T (as seen) is lower.

Wait, but in this scenario, Star_2's observed λ_max is same as Star_1's emitted λ_max.

So, Star_2's emitted λ_max would be shorter than Star_1's emitted λ_max, since when it's moving away, the observed λ is longer.

Wait, that would imply that Star_2's emitted λ_emit is shorter than Star_1's λ_emit.

Because: λ_observed = λ_emit * (1 + v/c )

So if λ_observed = λ₁, and λ_emit_2 = λ_observed_2 / (1 + v/c )

So, λ_emit_2 = λ₁ / (1 + v/c )

But λ_emit_1 = λ₁.

So, since (1 + v/c ) > 1, λ_emit_2 = λ₁/(something>1) → so λ_emit_2 < λ₁.

Which means T₂ = b / λ_emit_2 = (b/λ_emit_2) → larger than T₁ = b/λ₁.

So T₂ > T₁, which is consistent with our earlier conclusion.

But let me think about the luminosity ratio again. L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So L₁ = (R₁/R₂)^2 * (T₁/T₂)^4 * L₂.

Wait, I think I got that wrong earlier.

Wait, no. Wait, L₁ and L₂ are each expressed in terms of their own R and T.

L₁ = 4π R₁² σ T₁^4.

L₂ = 4π R₂² σ T₂^4.

So, L₁/L₂ = (R₁² T₁^4) / (R₂² T₂^4 )

= (R₁/R₂)^2 * (T₁/T₂)^4.

Given R₁ = 1.5 R₂ → (R₁/R₂) = 1.5 → (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

We have T₂ = T₁ * (1 + v/c )

So T₁ / T₂ = 1/(1 + v/c ) ≈ 0.99767.

So (T₁/T₂)^4 ≈ (0.99767)^4 ≈ 0.99069.

So,

L₁/L₂ = 2.25 * 0.99069 ≈ 2.229.

So, about 2.23, which is option D.

But wait, another thought: why does Star_2 have a higher temperature? Because when a star is moving away, the observed λ is longer, which implies a lower temperature. But here, the observed λ for Star_2 (λ₂) is the same as Star_1's λ₁. Since Star_1 is not moving, its λ₁ is b / T₁.

Star_2's observed λ is λ₂ = λ_1 = b / T₁.

But Star_2's emitted λ is λ_emit_2 = λ_2 / (1 + v/c ), because λ_2 = λ_emit_2 * (1 + v/c ).

So,

λ_emit_2 = (b / T₁) / (1 + v/c )

Which is less than b / T₁, because (1 + v/c ) > 1.

So, λ_emit_2 < λ₁ = λ_emit_1 → since λ is inversely proportional to T, T_emit_2 > T_emit_1.

Thus, T₂ > T₁.

So, when we calculate luminosity, L is proportional to R² T⁴.

So, R₁ is larger than R₂ by 1.5, so R₁/R₂ =1.5 → (1.5)^2 =2.25.

But T₂ is larger than T₁, so T₁/T₂ <1. So their ratio to the fourth power will be a number less than 1.

So, the ratio L₁/L₂ is (2.25) * (something less than 1), which may be about 2.23, as computed.

So, the correct answer should be option D) ~2.23.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(R\) is the radius, \(T\) is the effective temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The problem specifies that Star_1 has a radius \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\) and a mass 1.5 times that of Star_2. Additionally, the observed wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest (\(\lambda_{\text{max}}\)) are the same, and Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, while Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s.

### Step 1: Relating Temperature and Wavelength
The peak wavelength for a blackbody is given by Wien's law:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

where \(b\) is Wien's displacement constant. Since the observed \(\lambda_{\text{max}}\) for both stars is the same, we equate the observed wavelengths:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}
\]

For Star_1, which is stationary, the observed wavelength is equal to the emitted wavelength:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \frac{b}{T_1}
\]

For Star_2, which is moving away with a radial velocity \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\), the observed wavelength is Doppler-shifted:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \left(1 + \frac{v_2}{c}\right)
\]

Equating the two observed wavelengths:

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \left(1 + \frac{v_2}{c}\right)
\]

Substituting \(\lambda_{\text{emit}} = \frac{b}{T}\) into the equation:

\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \left(1 + \frac{v_2}{c}\right)
\]

Canceling \(b\) and rearranging:

\[
T_2 = T_1 \left(1 + \frac{v_2}{c}\right)
\]

### Step 2: Calculating the Temperature Ratio
The radial velocity of Star_2 is \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\), and the speed of light is \(c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s}\). Thus:

\[
\frac{v_2}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]

So:

\[
T_2 = T_1 (1 + 0.002333) \approx T_1 \cdot 1.002333
\]

The temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.002333} \approx 0.99767
\]

### Step 3: Calculating the Luminosity Ratio
The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

Substituting \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\) and \(\frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx 0.99767\):

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \cdot (0.99767)^4
\]

First, calculate \((1.5)^2\):

\[
(1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

Next, calculate \((0.99767)^4\). Using the approximation \((1 - x)^4 \approx 1 - 4x\) for small \(x\), where \(x = 1 - 0.99767 = 0.00233\):

\[
(0.99767)^4 \approx 1 - 4(0.00233) = 1 - 0.00932 = 0.99068
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.99068 \approx 2.229
\]

### Final Answer:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2.

**Answer: D**
