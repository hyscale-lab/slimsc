Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the movement of the star towards and away from us.

The problem says that two stars have the same mass, each similar to the Sun. Each has a Neptune-mass planet in a circular orbit. So, the planets have similar masses, and the stars are identical. But when using RV, the spectral line shifts are different: 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for #2.

Wait, what's a milliangstrom? Oh right, 1e-3 of an angstrom. But I'm not sure if the actual value matters for the ratio. The question is about the orbital periods.

I remember that the RV method is sensitive to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula involved must relate the velocity semi-amplitude (which causes the spectral line shift) to the orbital period.

The formula I think is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (2π)) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) )

Wait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps a simpler approach. The semi-amplitude of the RV is K = (v) which is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. 

I think the formula for the semi-amplitude (K) is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(0.5) ) ) ] * ( (2π)/P )^(1/3) ) / (c)

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up some terms. Let me think. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ] * [ (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ] / ( (1 - e²)^(0.5) )

But since the planets are Neptune mass and stars are solar mass, M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So the equation simplifies. The sin i is also a factor, but the problem says both planets are in circular orbits, so e=0, so (1-e²)^0.5=1.

So, simplifying, K ≈ ( (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p) ) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) * c ) ) * 1/(P^(1/3)) )

Wait, perhaps I should write the formula correctly. Let me recall from my notes. The RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = (v) = [ ( (G * P) / (2π c^3) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) ) ] / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) )

Wait, not sure. Another approach: the RV semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Because K ∝ (M_p) / (M_* )^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3). 

So, the formula for K is K = ( ( (G) * (M_p) ) / ( (M_*) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3) * (2π)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/c ), but I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the relationship between K and P. Since both stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, the only varying factor here is the orbital period. So, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3). Wait, no. Let's think again.

The formula for K is:

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) )

But again, since M_p is much smaller than M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) )

So, K is proportional to (1/P^(1/
