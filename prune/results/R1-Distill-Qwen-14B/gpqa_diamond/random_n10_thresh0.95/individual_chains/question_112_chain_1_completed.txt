Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the setup: There's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. I remember that the spin operators in the z-direction have eigenvalues ±ħ/2. But wait, the question is about another operator whose matrix elements are given as A_ij. The rule is A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, that sounds familiar. I think that's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2. Because the Pauli matrices usually have 0 on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal. So this A matrix would be (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So the operator is (ħ/2) σ_x.

The problem asks me to find two things: first, the probability of measuring the eigenstates of this operator A, and second, the average value (expectation value) of A.

I remember that the eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of A, since A is just a scalar multiple of σ_x. So the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of σ_x. The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

So, the strategy is: first, find the eigenstates of A, then express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates. Once I have the coefficients, the probabilities are the squared magnitudes of those coefficients. Then, the expectation value would be the sum of each probability multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue.

But wait, |alpha> is given proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>—so I should normalize it first. Because right now, it's just proportional, not necessarily a unit vector.

So, step by step:

1. Normalize |alpha>:

The state is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. Let me compute its norm.

The norm squared is (1+i)(1-i) + (2 -i)(2 +i) + cross terms. Wait, wait, no, because when you square the norm, you have the sum of squares of the coefficients plus cross terms. Wait, no, that's for inner product. Let me think.

The inner product <alpha|alpha> is (1-i)(2+i) + (1+i)(2 -i) ?

Wait, no, wait. Let me write |alpha> as (a + b)|up> + (c + d)|down>, but actually:

Wait, |alpha> is (1 + i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So when I compute the inner product <alpha|alpha>, it's [ (1 - i) (2 + i) ] + [ (2 + i) (1 - i) ].

Wait, no. Wait, the inner product is (a*) (a) + (b*) (b), but since the state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, the coefficients are u = 1+i and v = 2-i. So the inner product is u*u + v*v.

Because for two basis states |up> and |down>, their inner product is zero, so cross terms disappear. So |u|² + |v|².

Compute |1+i|²: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1=2.

Compute |2 - i|²: (2)^2 + (1)^2 =4+1=5.

So the norm squared is 2 +5=7. So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

So |alpha> normalized is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

2. Now, find the eigenstates of operator A. Since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, the eigenvalues are ±(ħ/2).

The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, given by:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no—wait. Let me think again. The eigenstates for σ_x are such that σ_x |+x> = |+x>, and similarly for |-x>.

The exact expression is:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, wait. No, wait: σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, so when you multiply by (ħ/2), the eigenvalues become ± ħ/2.

So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x> as I wrote.

Wait, but let me double-check. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so the eigenvectors for eigenvalue +1 are (1,1)/sqrt(2), and for -1 they're (1,-1)/sqrt(2). So yes, the eigenstates are as above.

3. Now, express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

So,

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>

We can compute a and b by projecting |alpha> onto |+x> and |-x>.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, I can write |+x> and |-x> in terms of |up> and |down>, and then express |alpha> as a linear combination.

Let me compute the coefficients a and b.

Expressed as:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> 

But |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
        = (1/sqrt(2)) |up> + (1/sqrt(2)) |down>

Similarly, |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)
        = (1/sqrt(2)) |up> - (1/sqrt(2)) |down>

So, to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, we can set up equations.

Let me denote |alpha> as c1 |+x> + c2 |-x>.

So,

c1 |+x> + c2 |-x> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>

Expanding the left side:

c1 (1/sqrt(2) |up> + 1/sqrt(2) |down>) + c2 (1/sqrt(2) |up> - 1/sqrt(2) |down> )

Combine terms:

[ c1 (1/sqrt(2)) + c2 (1/sqrt(2)) ) ] |up> + [ c1 (1/sqrt(2)) - c2 (1/sqrt(2)) ) ] |down> 

Set equal to right side:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>

So, equating coefficients for |up> and |down>:

For |up>:
(c1 + c2) / sqrt(2) = (1 + i)/sqrt(7)
Equation 1: (c1 + c2) = (1 + i) * sqrt(2/7)

For |down>:
(c1 - c2) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)
Equation 2: (c1 - c2) = (2 - i) * sqrt(2/7)

So now, we have a system of two equations:

c1 + c2 = (1 +i) * sqrt(2/7)
c1 - c2 = (2 -i) * sqrt(2/7)

We can solve for c1 and c2.

Adding the two equations:

2 c1 = [ (1 +i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= (3) * sqrt(2/7)
So c1 = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) = 3 sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) ) 

Wait, but wait, let me compute the exact value.

Wait, (1+i) + (2 -i) is 3, right? So yes, adding the two equations gives:

2 c1 = 3 * sqrt(2/7)
So c1 = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) 

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

2 c2 = [ (1 + i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= (1 + i -2 +i) = (-1 + 2i) 
So 2 c2 = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7)
=> c2 = [ (-1 + 2i) / 2 ] * sqrt(2/7)

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute c1 and c2 numerically, but perhaps I can find another approach.

Alternatively, I can write it as:

c1 = [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2/7) / 2
= (3) * sqrt(2/7) / 2

Similarly, c2 = [ (1 + i) - (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2/7) / 2
= (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7) / 2

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Let me recheck. When I subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

( c1 + c2 ) - ( c1 - c2 ) = [ (1+i) sqrt(2/7) ] - [ (2 -i) sqrt(2/7) ]

Wait, no, more accurately, when I subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

(c1 + c2) - (c1 - c2) = (1+i) sqrt(2/7) - (2 -i) sqrt(2/7)

Which is 2 c2 = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] sqrt(2/7 )

Which is 2 c2 = [ -1 + 2i ] sqrt(2/7 )

So c2 = [ (-1 + 2i) / 2 ] sqrt(2/7 )

So c1 is (3/2) sqrt(2/7 )

But perhaps I should compute the modulus squared of c1 and c2 to find the probabilities.

The probability of measuring +ħ/2 is |c1|^2, and the probability of measuring -ħ/2 is |c2|^2.

Compute |c1|^2:

c1 = (3/2) sqrt(2/7 )

So |c1|^2 = (3/2)^2 * (2/7) ) = (9/4) * (2/7) ) = (18)/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Similarly, |c2|^2: c2 = [ (-1 +2i)/2 ] sqrt(2/7 )

The square of the magnitude is [ ( (-1)^2 + 2^2 ) / 4 ] * (2/7 )

Compute inside the brackets: (1 +4) =5 → 5/4.

So |c2|^2 = (5/4) * (2/7) ) = (10)/(28) )= 5/14 ≈0.3571.

Wait, wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, and 5/14 is about 0.3571. But looking at the options, the probabilities are given as 0.64 and 0.36 (option A), or 0.54 and 0.46 (option B), etc. So 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, which is close to 0.64, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which would be 0.36 when rounded. So that would match option A's first two numbers.

But wait, am I sure that this is correct? Because I think I might have made a mistake in computing |c2|^2.

Wait, c2 is [ ( -1 + 2i ) / 2 ] * sqrt(2/7 )

So the magnitude squared is [ ( (-1)^2 + 2^2 ) / (2^2) ) ] * (2/7 )

Which is (1 +4)/4 * (2/7) ) = (5/4) * (2/7) ) = (10)/(28) =5/14 ≈0.357.

So that's correct.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357.

Looking at the options:

Option A says 0.64 and 0.36. That seems to match.

Now, the average value (expectation value) of A.

The expectation value <A> is the sum of each eigenvalue multiplied by its probability.

The eigenvalues are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

So,

<A> = (9/14) * (ħ/2) + (5/14) * (-ħ/2 )

= [ (9/14 -5/14) ] * ħ/2 

= (4/14) * ħ/2 

= (2/7) * ħ/2 

= (2/7 * 1/2) ) ħ 

= (1/7) ħ 

So <A> = ħ /7.

Looking at the options:

Option A says average is ħ/7, which matches.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and average value is ħ/7. So the correct option is A.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for the expectation value. Because another approach would be to compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

But since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, and we have |alpha> in terms of σ_x's eigenstates, the expectation value is the same as the average I computed, which is correct.

Hmm, but wait, the options say the average is ħ/7, which is what I have. So option A is 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. So that must be the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we analyze the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, we compute the expectation value of \( A \).

### Step 1: Normalize \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The given state is \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize, we calculate the norm squared:
\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + 1^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) is proportional to the Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix, scaled by \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) (and hence \( A \)) are:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |\downarrow\rangle, \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |\uparrow\rangle - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]
These eigenstates correspond to eigenvalues \( +\frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

### Step 3: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)
We rewrite \( |\alpha\rangle \) as:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = c_1 |+x\rangle + c_2 |-x\rangle.
\]
Expanding \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) in terms of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \), we equate coefficients:
\[
c_1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + c_2 \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}, \quad c_1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - c_2 \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]
Solving these equations:
\[
c_1 + c_2 = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \sqrt{2}, \quad c_1 - c_2 = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \sqrt{2}.
\]
Adding and subtracting the equations:
\[
2c_1 = \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \sqrt{2}, \quad 2c_2 = \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \sqrt{2}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
c_1 = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2}{7}}, \quad c_2 = \frac{-1+2i}{2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2}{7}}.
\]

### Step 4: Probabilities of eigenstates
The probabilities of measuring \( +\frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \) are \( |c_1|^2 \) and \( |c_2|^2 \), respectively:
\[
|c_1|^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{9}{14}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left|\frac{-1+2i}{2}\right|^2 \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{5}{14}.
\]
Thus, the probabilities are approximately:
\[
P(+\frac{\hbar}{2}) \approx 0.64, \quad P(-\frac{\hbar}{2}) \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 5: Expectation value of \( A \)
The expectation value is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = P(+\frac{\hbar}{2}) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-\frac{\hbar}{2}) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Substituting the probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{4}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the expectation value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches **Option A**.
