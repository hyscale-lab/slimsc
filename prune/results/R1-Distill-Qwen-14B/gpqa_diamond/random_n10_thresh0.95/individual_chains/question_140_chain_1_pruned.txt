Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's start breaking it down piece by piece. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through it.

The question talks about Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Hmm, so X has an isotope that's heavier than the usual. I remember that isotopes have the same number of protons but different neutrons. So, for example, chlorine has isotopes like Cl-35 and Cl-37.

Then, X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, same number of N and P per molecule? So each molecule of W has protons and neutrons equal in count. Let me think about common gases. Hydrogen gas is H2, but each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So that wouldn't work. What about something like CO2? No, that's a molecule but not sure about the neutron and proton counts. Wait, maybe something like NH3? No, because each molecule has 14 (N:7 protons, 7 neutrons) and 3 H (each 1 proton, 0 neutrons). But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the molecule's structure. If each molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons, maybe it's a diatomic molecule where each atom has the same number of protons and neutrons.

Wait, another approach: Let's say each molecule of W consists of atoms where each has the same number of protons and neutrons. Like, for example, if W were O2, but O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in its isotope O-16. So each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, so each molecule would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. Oh wait, but the problem says the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So for O2, that would be 16 protons (each O has 8) and 16 neutrons (each O has 8, but wait, O-16 has 8 neutrons, so two O atoms would make 16 total neutrons). So the molecule as a whole has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That fits the condition. So W could be O2. But wait, another possibility is H2, but H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so each molecule would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons. That doesn't fit. Another thought: maybe it's a molecule like CH4? No, because each C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (like in C-12). Each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. So for CH4, the molecule has 6+4=10 protons and 6 neutrons. That doesn't match. Hmm.

Wait another idea: If the gas W is CO2. Each CO2 molecule has 1 C (6 protons, 6 neutrons if C-12) and 2 O's (each O-16, 8 protons, 8 neutrons). So total in the molecule: 6 + (2*8) = 22 protons. Neutrons: 6 + (2*8) = 22. Oh! So CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons in each molecule. That fits the condition because 22=22. So W could be CO2. But wait, CO2 is a gas, but would it be released during this reaction? Alternatively, could W be something else?

Alternatively, think of O3. Each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (O-16). So O3 would have 24 protons and 24 neutrons in each molecule. That also fits. But which one is more likely?

Wait, the reaction is violent between X and Y, releasing gas W. Y is a liquid. What reactions produce CO2 gas when a solid reacts with a liquid? Maybe a carbonate reacting with acid? Or perhaps a metal reacting with something to produce CO2. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: if W is H2O, but each H2O molecule has 2 H (each 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and 1 O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So total protons: 2 + 8=10. Neutrons: 8. So 10 protons and 8 neutrons; that doesn't match. So no.

Wait another angle: gas W has same number of neutrons and protons in each molecule. So if the molecule has N atoms, each with P protons and N neutrons, how does that add up? Maybe each atom contributes the same number of protons and neutrons. Like Cl atoms: Cl-35 has 17 protons and 18 neutrons; no, not same. Cl-37 has 17 protons and 20 neutrons; still not same. So that's not it.

Wait, what about O2? Each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (O-16). So each O has equal P and N. So a molecule of O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So yes, same number. That fits. So W could be O2. Or O3 would have 24 each.

But wait, what reaction produces O2 gas? Maybe a decomposition reaction. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe W is nitrogen gas, N2? Each N atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (in N-14). So N2 has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So that works. So W could be N2.

But then, looking back, the reaction is violent between X and Y. If Y is liquid, perhaps it's water. So maybe X is a metal reacting with water to produce hydrogen gas? But H2 doesn't fit the W condition because H has 1 P and 0 N, so each molecule would have 2 P and 0 N. Doesn't match.

Wait, maybe the reaction is between a carbonate and an acid, producing CO2. If X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid, maybe H2SO4 or HCl. But then X would be a salt, so that might fit. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the precipitate G forms. When heated, G releases B, whose melting point is near 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. So B is a solid at 0 C, maybe. What has a melting point near 4 C? Hmm, water freezes at 0, but that's 273 K. Wait, 277 is 4 C. Hmm, maybe something else. Or perhaps B is a crystalline solid that melts near that temperature.

Wait, another approach: let's think about what B could be. If G is a precipitate that when heated releases B, perhaps B is something like water, but that's not likely. Or maybe B is an oxide or something else. Alternatively, maybe B is a metal oxide that decomposes upon heating.

Wait, the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Keto acidâ€”like a ketone acid. For example, acetoacetic acid is a keto acid. So when X reacts with a keto acid, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Hmm, so maybe the product is something like water? Or maybe an alcohol? Or perhaps a carboxylic acid.

Wait, maybe X is a strong base. For example, something like NaOH. When a keto acid reacts with a base, it could form a salt. But how would that relate to the product having 2 oxygen atoms? Wait, maybe the product is something like a hemiacetal or something else.

Alternatively, thinking about the reaction between a keto acid and a reducing agent. Maybe X is a reducing agent, like sodium borohydride (NaBH4), which is commonly used in organic chemistry. Sodium borohydride is a reagent used to reduce carbonyl groups.

Wait, the problem says that X and especially its analog are used as a reagent in organic chemistry
