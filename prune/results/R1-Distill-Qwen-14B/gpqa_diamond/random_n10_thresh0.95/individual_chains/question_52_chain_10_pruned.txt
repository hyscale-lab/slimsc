Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The question is about a star with certain parameters and how spots on its surface affect the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, sounds a bit involved. Let me break it down.

So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Oh, wait, but spots are cooler regions on the star's surface, right? So when those spots cover a part, the overall temperature would decrease. That makes sense.

The main point here is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. And the question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when there are no spots compared to when there are spots.

Wait, the ratio is n1/n2, right? Because when the temperature changes, the population of these levels will change according to the Boltzmann equation.

Let me recall: The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels. The ratio is (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(kT)), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.

Wait, no, wait. The ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(kT) ). Because if E2 is higher than E1, then as temperature increases, more atoms would be in the higher state, so n2 increases relative to n1. So the ratio n1/n2 would decrease with higher T.

Wait, let me get that right. Suppose E2 > E1. Then (E2 - E1) is positive. So the exponent is positive, so exp(positive) is greater than 1. Then n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(kT) ). So if T increases, the exponent increases, making the ratio n1/n2 larger if g's are same. Wait, but wait, if T is higher, the exponent is bigger, so n1/n2 is bigger. So higher T would mean more in the higher level, so n2 is larger than n1. So the ratio n1/n2 would decrease as T increases.

Wait, but let me write it down. Let me define:

n_i = (g_i) * exp( - E_i/(k T) )

So the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Yes, because n1/n2 = [g1 exp(-E1/(kT))] / [g2 exp(-E2/(kT))] = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(kT) )

So when T increases, the exponent (E2 - E1)/(k T) becomes smaller (since denominator is bigger). So the exponential term is smaller than before. So the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(something smaller). So if E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive, so when T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) is positive but smaller. So exp of that is a number less than before, so the ratio n1/n2 decreases as T increases.

Wait, but wait. Let me take an example. Suppose E2 - E1 is positive.

At higher T, the exponent is a smaller positive number. So exp(small positive) is a number like e^0.1, say ~1.1, whereas exp(0.2) is ~1.22. So as T increases, the exponent becomes smaller, so the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * [something that is getting smaller]. So if g's are the same, then n1/n2 decreases as T increases.

In this problem, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K) compared to when it's spotless (6000 K). So when spots are present, T is lower. So the ratio n1/n2 would be higher when T is lower because the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k T). At lower T, the exponent is larger (since denominator is smaller), so exp is larger, making the ratio n1/n2 larger.

So when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 is larger. But the question says that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. Wait, that's confusing.

Wait, let me read the question again. "When examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots." So when there are spots, the ratio goes down.

Hmm, but according to my earlier analysis, when T is lower (with spots), the ratio n1/n2 should be higher. So there must be something I'm missing here.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the levels. What if level 2 is lower than level 1? Let me think. Because sometimes the energy levels are labeled arbitrarily. Let me assume that E1 is lower than E2. So if the transition is between two levels, and the wavelength is about 1448 Å, which is in the near UV or visible range.

Wait, 1448 Å is 144.8 nm, which is in the UV. So the energy difference would correspond to that photon. So E2 - E1 = hc / λ.

But perhaps that's not necessary for this problem. Oh wait, the problem says that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. But for the Boltzmann factor, we just need the energy difference between the two levels. So maybe we can compute it, but perhaps it's not necessary because the ratio depends on the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T). But perhaps the exact value is needed, so let me think.

Wait, the question is about the ratio when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. So we have two scenarios: T_spotless = 6000 K and T_spotty = 5500 K.

The ratio without spots, R0 = n1/n2 (6000 K)

The ratio with spots, R1 = n1/n2 (5500 K)

The question says that R1 < R0, meaning that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Wait, but according to my earlier analysis, R (n1/n2) should be higher when T is lower. So this contradicts the observation. Hmm, that suggests my earlier reasoning is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I have the ratio backwards. Let me think again.

Let me define the ratio as R = n1 / n2.

At T=6000 K, R is R0.

At T=5500 K, R is R1.

The question says that when the star has spots (T=5500), R1 < R0. So R decreases when the star has spots.

So R0/R1 is the factor by which the ratio changes (when no spots compared to with spots).

Wait, no. The question says: "What is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots?"

So the ratio without spots is R0, with spots R1. The factor would be R0 / R1. Since R1 < R0, the factor is greater than 1.

So let's compute R0 and R1.

R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Assuming that g1 and g2 are the same. Because the problem doesn't mention anything about statistical weights, perhaps we can assume g1 = g2. So the ratio becomes exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So, R = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So, the ratio without spots is R0 = exp( (ΔE)/(k * 6000) )

Ratio with spots is R1 = exp( (ΔE)/(k * 5500) )

Wait, ΔE is E2 - E1. So if E2 > E1, then ΔE is positive.

So, R0 = exp( ΔE/(k * 6000) )

R1 = exp( ΔE/(k * 5500) )

So R0/R1 = [exp(a)] / [exp(b)] where a = ΔE/(k*6000), b = ΔE/(k*5500)

So R0/R1 = exp( a - b ) = exp( [ΔE/(k) ] (1/(6000) - 1/(5500)) )

Let me compute the exponent.

Compute 1/6000 - 1/5500. Let me find a common denominator.

Denominator is 6000 * 5500 = 33,000,000.

1/6000 = 5500/33,000,000

1/5500 = 6000/33,000,000

So 1/6000 - 1/5500 = (5500 - 6000) / 33e6 = (-500) / 33e6 = -500/(3.3e7) = approximately -1.515e-5.

So the exponent is [ΔE/(k)] * (-1.515e-5 )

Wait, but ΔE is positive, so the exponent is negative. So R0/R1 = exp( negative ) = 1 / exp( positive )

Which means R0 < R1, because R0/R1 is less than 1. But the problem states that R0 is higher than R1, because when the star has spots, R decreases.

Wait, but according to this, R0 = ratio at higher T, which would be smaller than R1. Because when T is higher, [ (ΔE)/(k T) ] is smaller, so exp( that ) is smaller, so R0 = smaller number than R1.

Wait, but this contradicts the problem statement which says R decreases when the star has spots, meaning R1 is less than R0.

Hmm, so maybe I have the ratio backwards. Perhaps the ratio is n2/n1, not n1/n2.

Let me go back to the problem statement. It says: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)".

So, the ratio could be either n1/n2 or n2/n1. The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots.

So, if the ratio is n2/n1, then when T increases, n2/n1 increases because higher T favors higher energy states.

Wait, let me compute R as n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) )

But if E2 > E1, then (E1 - E2) is negative. So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So, as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp( less negative ) is larger. So n2/n1 increases when T increases.

So in this case, when the star has spots, T is lower, so n2/n1 decreases. So if the observed ratio is n2/n1, then when the star has spots, the ratio decreases, which is what the problem states.

So, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio R as n2/n1. So, that would make sense.

Wait, let me re-express.

If the ratio is R = n2/n1, then R = (g2/g1) exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Assuming g2/g1 is a constant (since if the levels have same degeneracy, g2/g1 =1), then R = exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So R is inversely proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So when T increases, R decreases. So R is n2/n1.

When the star has spots, T =5500 K. So R is higher than when T=6000 K. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, R = exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the negative of that increases. So R increases as T increases.

Wait, wait no: let me write it as R = exp( - x ), where x = (E2-E1)/(k T)

As T increases, x decreases, so -x increases. So exp(-x) increases as T increases.

So R = n2/n1 increases with T.

But the problem says that when the star has spots (T=5500 K), R decreases. So that's a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's define R = n2/n1.

At T_spotless =6000 K, R0 = exp( -(ΔE)/(k *6000) )

At T_spotty =5500 K, R1 = exp( -(ΔE)/(k *5500) )

Now, since 5500 <6000, the denominator is smaller, so (ΔE)/(k T) is larger. So -(ΔE)/(k T) is more negative. So exp of a more negative number is smaller. So R1 < R0.

Which matches the problem statement: the ratio (n2/n1) decreases when the star has spots. So the ratio R = n2/n1.

The question is: factor by which R0 (no spots) is larger than R1 (spots). So factor is R0/R1.

Compute R0/R1 = [ exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k*5500) ) ] 

= exp( [ -ΔE/(k*6000) + ΔE/(k*5500) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/5500 - 1/6000 ] )

Compute the exponent term:

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667

Difference: 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 ≈ 0.000015151

So exponent is (ΔE/k) * 0.000015151

Wait, but what is ΔE? ΔE is E2 - E1. Which corresponds to hc/λ.

So ΔE = hc / λ

h is Planck's constant = 6.626e-34 J s

c is speed of light = 3e8 m/s

λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 J s)(3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m )

Calculate that:

6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25

Divide by 1.448e-7: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.373e-18 J per photon.

But wait, each atom has that energy difference. So ΔE is 1.373e-18 J per atom.

Now, Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So (ΔE)/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ 9.95e4 K ≈ 99500 K.

So, the exponent is (99500 K) * (0.000015151) ≈ 1.507 K.

So the exponent is approximately 1.507.

So R0/R1 = exp(1.507) ≈ e^1.507 ≈ 4.5.

Because e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.481, which is close to 4.5.

So the factor is about 4.5. So the answer is option C) ~4.5.


The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when a star transitions from being spotless (Teff = 6000 K) to having spots (Teff = 5500 K). The ratio is defined as \( R = \frac{n_2}{n_1} \), where \( n_2 \) and \( n_1 \) are the populations of the higher and lower energy levels, respectively. This ratio is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
R = \frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_2 \) and \( g_1 \) are the statistical weights of the levels, \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Difference (\( \Delta E \)):**  
   The energy difference corresponds to the transition wavelength \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). Using the relation \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we calculate:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Ratio at Different Temperatures:**  
   The ratio \( R \) depends on temperature as \( R \propto \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right) \). For the two cases:
   - At \( T = 6000 \, \text{K} \) (spotless), \( R_0 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k \cdot 6000}\right) \),
   - At \( T = 5500 \, \text{K} \) (with spots), \( R_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k \cdot 5500}\right) \).

   The factor by which the ratio changes is:
   \[
   \frac{R_0}{R_1} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k \cdot 6000} + \frac{\Delta E}{k \cdot 5500}\right).
   \]

3. **Simplifying the Exponent:**  
   Factoring out \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} \), the exponent becomes:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right).
   \]
   Compute \( \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{5500} \approx 0.0001818, \quad \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001667, \quad \text{so } \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.00001515.
   \]

   Substituting \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99500 \, \text{K} \), the exponent becomes:
   \[
   99500 \cdot 0.00001515 \approx 1.507.
   \]

4. **Final Factor:**  
   The factor is:
   \[
   \frac{R_0}{R_1} = \exp(1.507) \approx 4.5.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio \( \frac{n_2}{n_1} \) decreases when the star has spots, and the factor by which it changes is approximately **4.5**. This matches option **C**.
