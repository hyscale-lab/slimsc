Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through glass that's itself moving. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. Wait, same direction as the beam and toward the observer? So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer too, but in the same direction as the beam. That might be a bit confusing, but I think the key is that the glass's movement is in the same direction as the light beam.

The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.

So, first, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So normally, in the glass, the speed would be 1/n because the problem states c=1. But wait, the glass itself is moving. So this is a case where both the medium and the light are moving, and I have to find the relative speed.

I think this is a problem that involves the addition of velocities, perhaps using special relativity. Because when the medium is moving, its motion affects the observed speed of light. But wait, don't the laws of physics say that the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame? Oh wait, no, that's only in a vacuum, right? Or does it apply regardless of the medium?

Wait, no. According to Einstein's postulate, the speed of light in a vacuum is c in all inertial reference frames. But in a medium, the speed can be different. So if the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Alternatively, maybe I should think about it using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because both the glass and the light are moving, I need to consider how their velocities combine.

Wait, but the medium (glass) is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving at v, and the light is moving at v_light relative to the glass. So the speed of light in the glass is v_light = c/n. But in what frame? Oh, right, in the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is 1/n. But the glass is moving, so in the lab frame, the light's speed would be the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity in the glass, but with relativistic considerations.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because velocities don't just add linearly when you switch frames. You have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²), right? But wait, in this case, the light's speed in the glass's frame is u = 1/n, and the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So to find the speed of the light in the lab frame, we use the relativistic addition formula.

Wait, but wait. The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at v_light = 1/n towards the observer. So in the lab frame, the light's speed would be u = (v_light + v) / (1 + (v_light * v)/c²). But since c=1, the equation simplifies to (u + v)/(1 + u*v).

Wait, but in the glass's frame, the light is moving at 1/n. So substituting u = 1/n, and v is the speed of the glass. The observer in the lab would measure the speed as (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n)*v).

Wait, but that's the case when the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So if the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, then from the lab's perspective, the light's speed would be higher than 1/n.

So the formula would be (u + v)/(1 + (u v)), because c=1.

Plugging in u = 1/n, we get ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n)*v ) = [v + 1/n ] / [1 + v/n ].

Hmm, let me compute that. Let's factor out 1/n from numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (v*n + 1)/n

Denominator: (n + v)/n

So when we divide, (v n +1)/n divided by (n + v)/n equals (v n +1)/(n + v) = (n v +1)/(n +v). Wait, but that's the same as (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n +v) which matches.

But wait, I'm not so sure. Because the glass is moving in the same direction as the light. Wait, but what if the glass is moving towards the observer? Oh, no, the question says the glass is moving toward the observer in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well. So their velocities are in the same direction.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the glass is moving at v towards the observer, and the light beam is moving at v_light in the glass. So in the lab frame, the light's speed would be higher.

Wait, but according to the velocity addition formula, the light's speed in the lab frame is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)), but only if u and v are in the same direction. Since both are in the same direction, their signs are the same.

So if u is the light speed in the glass (1/n) and v is the speed of the glass, then yes, the formula applies. So the speed becomes (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v).

Which simplifies to (v + 1/n) / (1 + v/n).

Multiply numerator and denominator by n: (n v +1)/(n + v).

So that gives (1 + n v)/(n + v), which is option A.

Wait, but I also remember that in some cases, the speed of light in a medium moving at velocity v would have the speed adjusted by the refractive index. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the Doppler effect, but that's more about frequency and wavelength changes, not speed.

Alternatively, let me consider a simple approach. If the medium is moving, how does it affect the light's speed? In the rest frame of the medium, light travels at 1/n. If the medium is moving at v, then from the lab frame, the light's speed would be 1/n + v, but that's only in the classical sense, not relativistic. But according to relativity, velocities don't simply add like that. So the correct approach is to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

So according to that formula, the speed is (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n) v) = (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n) = (n v +1)/(n + v) when multiplied by n/n.

So the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n +v). That's the same as (n v +1)/(n +v), which is what we derived. So yes, option A is correct.

But I'm a little confused because sometimes when a medium moves, the speed of light in the medium can be affected differently. But I think the key here is that the speed of light in the medium is 1/n in the medium's frame, and then we're applying the velocity addition formula because the medium is moving.

Alternatively, another approach: The glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving at velocity u in the lab frame. The question is what is u.

In the frame of the glass, the light's velocity is u' = 1/n (since in the medium, speed is 1/n).

Using the velocity addition formula, u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c^2)).

But since u' = 1/n and c=1, then u= (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/(n))).

That's the same as before. So yes, the answer is A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic velocity addition. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, and the speed of light in the glass (in the glass's rest frame) is \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass. The goal is to find the speed of light in the lab frame, \( u \).

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' \cdot v}{c^2}}
\]

Since \( c = 1 \) (as given in the problem), the formula simplifies to:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + u' \cdot v}
\]

Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \), we get:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

To simplify further, multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \):

\[
u = \frac{n \cdot \frac{1}{n} + n \cdot v}{n \cdot 1 + n \cdot \frac{v}{n}}
\]

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \)**
