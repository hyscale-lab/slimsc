Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson X. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, I remember that the Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λ f f_bar(y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that better. Oh right, it's a Yukawa interaction term. The Yukawa coupling usually describes the interaction between a scalar boson and fermions. So in this case, the boson X is interacting with some fermions via a Yukawa coupling.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So kinematically allowed means the decay products' masses must be less than X's mass.

Wait, but what determines what fermions the boson can decay into? Oh right, each fermion has a mass, and for a decay X → f f_bar, the mass of the fermion must be less than half the mass of X. Because each fermion would need to have energy to match their rest mass. So each f would have mass m, and for two of them (like f and anti-f), the total rest mass is 2m. So 2m must be less than or equal to the mass of X, which is 6 GeV.

So let's list all the possible fermions. Wait, but wait, what fermions are available in the Standard Model? Let's see, quarks (u, d, s, c, b, t) and leptons (e, mu, tau, neutrinos). Also, neutrinos have very small masses, but I think in this problem, they might be neglected. Or perhaps the problem assumes that the mass of the neutrino is zero, so they could be decay products, but given the options, the answer doesn't include neutrinos, so maybe it's considering only charged leptons.

Wait, but the Lagrangian says f and ψ_f. Wait, what's the structure? Oh, the term is -λ f f_bar (y) (upsilon + X) ψ_f(y). Oh wait, maybe that's a typo in the question? Because the term should probably involve the product of two fermion fields, like maybe ψ_f and another. Alternatively, perhaps it's ψ_f and ψ_f bar. Hmm, perhaps the interaction term is proportional to (ψ_f^dagger ψ_f) X, but that's for a Yukawa coupling where X is a scalar. Alternatively, perhaps it's a term like ψ_f^dagger X ψ_f, which would be a Yukawa interaction where the scalar couples to the fermion bilinear.

Wait, the Yukawa interaction is typically something like L = - g ψ_i ψ_j X, where g is the coupling and ψ_i and ψ_j are fermion fields. So in this case, the term given is -λ f f_bar (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe that's a bit unclear, but perhaps it's L = -λ (something like ψ_f^dagger (y) X(y) ψ_f(y)) ), which would mean that X couples to the fermion ψ_f.

Wait, perhaps the term is L = -λ f_bar ψ_f (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's just a typo, and the actual interaction is f and another fermion, but perhaps it's more straightforward to think that the interaction is between X and fermions f. So X can decay into any fermion pair f f_bar where the fermion mass is less than 3 GeV each, because 6 GeV is the mass of X, so 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV → m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So which fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV?

Let's list the known fermion masses. Quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), top (t). Wait, but top quark is about 173 GeV, which is way over. So the quarks with mass below 3 GeV are u, d, s, c. Wait, what about the c quark? Its mass is about 1.27 GeV, right? So 2m_c is about 2.54 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So c quark is allowed.

What about the b quark? The bottom quark is around 4.7 GeV. So 2m_b would be about 9.4 GeV, which is larger than X's mass (6 GeV), so the b quark cannot be a decay product. Similarly, the top quark is way too heavy.

Now for leptons: electrons (e), muons (mu), taus (tau), and neutrinos. The electron has a mass of ~0.0005 GeV, muon is about 0.105 GeV, tau is about 1.78 GeV. So 2m_tau is about 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau can be a decay product. The muon is even lighter, so 2m_mu is 0.21 GeV, which is definitely allowed. Same with electron: 0.001 GeV, negligible.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, the tau is about 1.78 GeV, so 2*1.78 is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau can be produced. So tau pairs (tau+ tau-) are allowed.

What about the electron and muon? Yes, their masses are way below 3 GeV, so their pairs are allowed.

So possible fermion pairs are:

- u and anti-u: allowed.
- d and anti-d: allowed.
- s and anti-s: allowed.
- c and anti-c: allowed.
- tau and anti-tau: allowed.
- mu and anti-mu: allowed.
- e and anti-e: allowed.

Wait, but let's check their masses again. For the electron, mass is about 0.0005 GeV, so 2m_e is negligible. Same for mu: 0.105 GeV, so 2m_mu is about 0.21 GeV. Both are way below 6 GeV.

But wait, the bottom quark (b) is about 4.7 GeV. So 2m_b is ~9.4 GeV, which is more than X's mass, so b is excluded.

So decay channels allowed would be:

X → u u_bar, d d_bar, s s_bar, c c_bar, tau tau_bar, mu mu_bar, e e_bar.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b_bar, s s_bar, u u_bar, d d_bar, tau, e+ e-. Wait, no, because B is an option. Why? Because if b is too heavy, it can't decay into b b_bar. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X→c c_bar, s s_bar, u u_bar, d d_bar, tau, mu, e. So that's all the allowed ones except for tau and the others.

Wait, but wait, the tau is allowed because 2m_tau is 3.56 GeV <6 GeV. Hmm, so in option B, it includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So yes.

Option C includes t, which is too heavy, so C is out. Option D includes b, which is too heavy, so D is incorrect.

Wait, looking at option B: ... c c_bar, s s_bar, u u_bar, d d_bar, tau+ tau-, etc.

So the allowed decay products are all the fermions with mass less than 3 GeV. So all the quarks except b and t (but t is not in any options except C), and all charged leptons except maybe the electron neutrinos, but the problem seems to be considering charged leptons.

So the correct decays would include c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Looking at the options:

Option B includes all these, except for the top quark. So option B's list is c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed, so D is incorrect.

So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but let me double-check the fermion masses. For instance, the strange quark is about 95-100 MeV, so 0.095 GeV. 2m_s is about 0.19 GeV, which is way below 6 GeV. So s is allowed.

The charm quark is about 1.27 GeV, so 2m_c is 2.54 GeV, which is allowed. So c is allowed.

The bottom quark is about 4.7 GeV, so 2m_b is ~9.4 GeV, which is way over 6 GeV, so b is not allowed.

So the correct decays are all except the b and t quarks, and any other heavy fermions. So the only quarks allowed are u, d, s, c.

The charged leptons allowed are e, mu, tau, since their masses are all under 3 GeV (tau is 1.78 GeV, so 3.56 GeV for two, which is under 6 GeV).

So the decay products allowed are:

c c_bar, s s_bar, u u_bar, d d_bar, tau tau_bar, mu mu_bar, e e_bar.

Looking at the options, option B is:

c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Which matches.

So option B is the correct one.


To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) at the lowest order, we analyze the interaction given by the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y) \left(\upsilon + X(y)\right) \psi_f(y).
\]

This represents a Yukawa interaction where the boson \( X \) couples to fermions \( \psi_f \). The mass of \( X \) is \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \), and for a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the total rest mass of the fermion pair \( 2m_f \) must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq m_X \). Thus, \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses in the Standard Model
- **Quarks**: \( u, d, s, c, b, t \) (masses: \( m_u \sim 2.2 \, \text{MeV}, m_d \sim 4.7 \, \text{MeV}, m_s \sim 95 \, \text{MeV}, m_c \sim 1.27 \, \text{GeV}, m_b \sim 4.7 \, \text{GeV}, m_t \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)).
- **Leptons**: \( e, \mu, \tau, \nu_e, \nu_\mu, \nu_\tau \) (masses: \( m_e \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV}, m_\mu \sim 0.105 \, \text{GeV}, m_\tau \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV}, m_\nu \sim 0 \, \text{GeV} \)).

### Analysis of Allowed Decays
1. **Quarks**:
   - \( u, d, s, c \): Their masses are well below \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( X \to u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c} \) are allowed.
   - \( b, t \): Their masses (\( m_b \sim 4.7 \, \text{GeV}, m_t \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)) exceed \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( X \to b \bar{b}, t \bar{t} \) are forbidden.

2. **Leptons**:
   - \( e, \mu, \tau \): Their masses are \( m_e \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV}, m_\mu \sim 0.105 \, \text{GeV}, m_\tau \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \). For \( \tau \), \( 2m_\tau \sim 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( X \to e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^- \) are allowed.
   - Neutrinos: Their masses are negligible (\( m_\nu \sim 0 \, \text{GeV} \)), but the problem does not explicitly include them in the options.

### Evaluation of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is forbidden because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is forbidden because \( 2m_t > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is forbidden because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.

### Conclusion
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), which matches **Option B**.

Answer: B
