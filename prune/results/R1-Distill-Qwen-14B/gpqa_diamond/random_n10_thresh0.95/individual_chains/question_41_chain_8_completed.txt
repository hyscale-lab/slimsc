Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm, I remember that when objects are moving relative to each other, you have to consider relativity or maybe just relative velocities, but I'm not too sure which applies here. Let me think.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. What's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

Wait, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. Oh wait, no, wait: the beam is moving through the glass, and the glass itself is moving toward the observer? Or is the glass moving in the same direction as the beam? Wait, the wording is a bit tricky. Let me read it again.

"A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory."

Hmm, same direction as the beam, which would mean the glass is moving in the same direction the light is going. But it's toward the observer, which I'm a bit confused about. Wait, maybe the beam is moving towards the observer, so the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam—which would be towards the observer. Or maybe the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam's propagation. Let's clarify.

The light beam is going through the glass, so in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam. Let's say the beam is moving to the right, and so is the glass. But the description says the glass is moving toward the observer. Oh wait, perhaps the beam is moving towards the observer, so the glass is moving in the direction of the beam, which is towards the observer. That makes sense.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the lab frame. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam (which is toward the observer). So the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity.

But wait, in the glass's rest frame, the speed of light would be c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n relates to the speed as v = c/n. So normally, if the glass isn't moving, the speed of light in it would be c/n. But when the glass is moving, does that change the observed speed?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about this in the frame of the glass first. In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n. Now, since the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame, perhaps we need to transform the velocity of the light from the glass frame to the lab frame.

Ah, right! So this is a case where we have to use the velocity addition formula from relativity. But wait, what's the speed of light in the lab frame? Because according to relativity, the speed of light is always c in all inertial frames. Oh wait, but in this case, the glass is a medium, so the usual relativity of light speed doesn't apply the same way. Because in a medium, the speed of light can be slower than c, but when the medium is moving, does it affect the observed speed in the lab frame?

Wait, but in the lab frame, light is moving through the medium (glass) which is itself moving. I'm a bit confused here. Let me rephrase.

In the lab frame, the glass is moving with velocity v. The glass has an index of refraction n, so in the glass's rest frame, the light travels at speed c/n. But in the lab frame, what speed do we observe?

I think the key here is that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's motion. But wait, in the lab frame, the glass is moving, so perhaps the light's speed is different than just c/n.

Alternatively, maybe the speed of the light in the lab frame is c, because the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But that doesn't seem right, because the medium's properties affect the light's speed. Wait, no—if the medium is moving, but the light is within that medium, then the speed of light relative to the lab frame would be different.

Wait, no, Einstein's postulate says that the speed of light in a vacuum is c in all frames, but when the light is in a medium, it's different. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving, and the light's speed is determined by the medium and the relative motion.

Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the glass's rest frame: in that frame, the light moves at c/n. Then, transform this velocity to the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass.

Wait, but the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So the lab frame is moving at velocity -v relative to the glass.

So to find the speed of light in the lab frame, we can use the velocity addition formula. The velocity u in the glass frame is c/n. Then the lab frame's velocity u' is given by the Lorentz transformation.

Wait, wait. The velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/(c^2)).

In this case, u is the velocity of the light in the glass frame, which is c/n. The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So from the glass frame to the lab frame, the velocity addition would be u' = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c^2 )

Simplify the denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)).

So u' = ( (c + n v) / n ) / ( (n c + v ) / (n c) ) )

Wait, wait: Let me write it correctly. The formula is (u + v) / (1 + (uv)/(c²)).

So u = c/n, v is the velocity of the glass relative to lab, which is v. Wait, no: the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So when moving from the glass frame to lab, the lab is moving at velocity -v relative to glass. So the velocity addition would be u' = (u + (-v)) / (1 + (u*(-v))/c² )

Wait, no, no. Let me think again. The lab frame is moving at velocity v relative to the glass. So to find the velocity of the light in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass, we have to use the velocity addition formula.

Wait, the velocity of the light in the glass (S') frame is u = c/n. The lab (S) frame is moving at velocity V = v relative to S' (since the glass is moving at v in lab). So to find the velocity u' in lab frame, use u' = (u + V) / (1 + (u V)/(c²)).

Wait, no, in the velocity addition formula, if S' is moving at velocity V relative to S, then u' = (u + V) / (1 + (u V)/(c^2)).

In this case, S' is the glass frame, which is moving at velocity V = v relative to the lab frame S. So u is the velocity of the light in S', which is c/n. So u' will be the velocity of the light in S (lab frame), which is u' = (c/n + v) / (1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² ) = (c/n + v) / (1 + v/(n c)).

Simplify the denominator: 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v)/(n c).

So u' becomes [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ]

Which is [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ].

The n's cancel: (c + n v) * c / (n c + v).

Wait: (c + n v) is same as (n c + v) * (1/n), wait:

Wait, numerator is (c + n v), denominator after multiplication is (n c + v).

Wait, let me compute the numerator times c and denominator.

So u' = [ (c + n v) * c ] / (n c + v )

But wait, is that correct? Wait, the denominator is (n c + v) as per the multiplication.

Hmm, but looking at the options, option B is 1, which would be the case if the speed was c in the lab frame, but according to this, it's [c (c + n v)] / (n c + v). Wait, but that's not matching any option. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says, what is the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab?

Wait, no, the question says, "What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory?" Oh, perhaps I'm mixing up the frames.

Wait, the speed of light in the glass, as measured in the lab frame. So the glass is moving at velocity v, but the light is moving through the glass, so in the lab frame, the light's speed would be something else.

Wait, but according to the velocity addition, the speed we calculated was u' = [ (c + n v) / (n + v) ) * ( c ) ]? Or no, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's go through it again.

u = velocity of light in S' (glass frame) = c/n.

S' is moving at velocity V = v relative to S (lab frame). So using the velocity addition formula:

u' = (u + V) / (1 + (u V)/c² )

Substituting u = c/n, V = v:

u' = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator:

1 + (v c)/(n c²) ) = 1 + v/(n c) )

So denominator is (n c + v) / (n c )

Numerator is (c + n v)/n.

So u' = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ].

Multiply numerator and denominator:

[ (c + n v) / n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

n cancels out:

(c +n v) * c / (n c + v )

Wait, but n c + v is the same as c n + v, same as denominator.

Wait, let me write it as:

u' = [c (c + n v) ] / [n c + v ]

Hmm, but none of the options seem to match that. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) (1 + n v)/(n + v )

B) 1

C) (1 + n v)/(n - v )

D) (1 -n v)/(n +v )

Wait, but in our expression, the numerator is c (c + n v ), but the options are in terms where c=1, as the question says to take c=1.

Ah! The problem says to take c=1. So substituting c=1 in our expression:

u' = (1 + n v) / (1 * n + v )

Wait, because c=1, the expression becomes:

u' = ( (1) + n v ) / (n + v )

Which is option A: (1 +n v)/(n +v )

So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the velocity addition formula applies only when the light is in a vacuum. But in this case, the light is in a medium (glass) with index of refraction n. So does the velocity addition formula still apply correctly?

Hmm, that's a critical point. Because in the glass's frame, the speed of light is c/n, but when the glass is moving, the speed in the lab frame isn't simply a matter of adding velocities because the medium is in motion. But according to relativity, the speed of light in a medium depends on the frame, but the velocity addition formula applies to the speed of objects, not the speed of light in a medium.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Because when the medium (glass) itself is moving, the speed of light in the medium may not just be c/n in the lab frame. Wait, because the medium's motion affects the speed.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the relativistic velocity addition formula, treating the light's speed in the glass's frame as c/n, then adding the glass's velocity to the light's velocity.

But wait, I thought that the speed of light in a medium is c/n in that medium's rest frame, but when the medium is moving, the speed in the lab frame could be different. But according to relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, but in a medium, it's not necessarily.

But this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think again. The initial approach was to use the velocity addition formula, treating the light's speed in the glass as c/n, and the glass's speed as v in the lab. Then, the lab's frame would see the light moving at u' = (c/n + v)/(1 + (c v)/(n c²)) ), which when c=1, becomes (1 +n v)/(n + v ), which is option A.

But I'm not sure if that's correct because the velocity addition formula applies to objects in motion, not the speed of light in a medium. Because when the medium is moving, the speed of light in the medium is determined by the medium's properties as seen in the lab frame.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to consider the glass as a medium, and when it's moving, the refractive index as seen in the lab frame is modified. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the speed of light in the glass in the lab frame is c/n, regardless of the glass's motion. Because the refractive index depends on the medium, not the frame. So even if the glass is moving, from the lab frame's perspective, the light's speed in the glass would still be c/n.

Wait, that's conflicting with the earlier approach. So if the glass is moving, but the speed of light in the glass is still c/n, then the lab would measure the speed as c/n. But that doesn't make sense because if the glass is moving, the light would have to catch up.

Wait, no, because the speed of light in a medium is dependent on the medium's properties, not the frame. So perhaps in the lab frame, the light's speed is still c/n. But then, the glass is moving at velocity v, so the light's velocity relative to the lab would be (c/n) + v, but that can't be right because that would exceed c if v is positive and c/n is about 1/n.

Wait, but when the medium is moving, the speed of light in the medium as observed in the lab frame isn't simply c/n plus the medium's velocity. Because the medium's motion affects the refractive index, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the relativistic velocity addition formula because the glass's motion is involved. So despite the medium, the speed of light would be considered using u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c² ), where u is the speed of light in the glass frame, which is c/n.

But then, when c=1, u' becomes (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is option A.

But wait, I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about the case when v is zero. Then the speed should be 1/n, because the glass isn't moving, so the light's speed is c/n, which is 1/n when c=1. Plugging v=0 into option A: (1 + 0)/(n + 0 )= 1/n. That's correct.

Another test case: say v is very small compared to c (so n*v is <<1). Then, using option A, u'≈ (1 +n v )/(n +v ) ≈ (1/n) (1 +n v )/(1 +v/n ) ) ≈ (1/n) (1 +n v -v ), because 1/(1 +x) ≈1 -x for small x. So u' ≈ (1 + (n-1) v )/n. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, if v is small, the speed should be approximately (c/n) + v, but that's not what option A gives.

Wait, no, because when v is small, the denominator (n +v ) ≈n, so option A gives approximately (1 +n v ) /n = (1/n) + v. Which is what I would expect if the glass is moving at v, and the light is moving at 1/n plus v. That seems correct.

So when v is small, our approximation using option A gives u' ≈ (1/n) + v, which makes sense.

Another test: if v is negative, say the glass is moving opposite to the light. Hmm, but in the problem, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is toward the observer. So v is positive in that direction.

So, given that, and considering the velocity addition formula, I think option A is correct.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic principles. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, and the light beam is propagating through the glass with an index of refraction \( n \). In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( \frac{1}{n} \) (since \( c = 1 \)).

To find the speed of light in the lab frame, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u = \frac{1}{n} \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame.
- \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab frame.
- \( c = 1 \) is the speed of light in a vacuum.

Substituting \( u = \frac{1}{n} \) and simplifying:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{1}{n} \cdot v}{1}}
\]

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. Testing edge cases confirms the result:
1. When \( v = 0 \), the speed of light in the glass is \( \frac{1}{n} \), which matches the expected result.
2. For small \( v \), the expression approximates \( \frac{1}{n} + v \), which is consistent with classical intuition.

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
\frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]
