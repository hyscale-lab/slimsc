Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read through it again and see what it's about.

Alright, so the question is about a star with certain characteristics. When the star doesn't have any dark spots on its surface, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but does that mean the spots are cooler or hotter than the surrounding photosphere? Oh right, dark spots are cooler, so the surrounding areas must be hotter? Or wait, no, the overall effective temperature decreases because the spots are cooler. So when spots cover part of the surface, the average temperature goes down.

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. And the question is asking by what factor this ratio changes—specifically, when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. So when there are spots, the observed ratio (n1/n2) is lower than when there are no spots. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Wait, but the problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio n_j/n_i is equal to (g_j/g_i) * exp( - (E_j - E_i)/(k T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature.

But wait, the question says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So T goes down. So how does that affect the ratio? Let me see.

The transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. Wait, 1448 angstroms is in the near UV or maybe far UV. But I'm not sure if that's relevant for the calculation here. Maybe it's about the energy difference between the two levels.

So let's think about the energy difference. The energy E is related to wavelength via E = hc/lambda. But since the ratio is about the exponential term, which depends on the temperature, maybe I can work with that.

Wait, but wait. The star's surface isn't at a uniform temperature when it has spots. The spots are cooler, and the rest is perhaps hotter. But the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. Wait, does that mean that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K, or that the average is 5500 K because some parts are cooler (spots) and others are hotter? Hmm, the wording says the "overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K." So maybe the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present, but without spots, it's 6000 K.

Wait, no. That can't be right because the presence of spots would lower the overall effective temperature, but the rest of the photosphere would be at a higher temperature. But the problem seems to be treating the entire photosphere as being at a single temperature. Hmm, but the problem says, when the star's surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K.

Wait, perhaps this is about the star's overall luminosity. The effective temperature is an average based on the total emitted flux. But the photosphere's actual temperature structure is more complicated. But the problem states, "the stellar photosphere is in LTE," so each region is in LTE.

But when they talk about the ratio of Ti atoms, they are looking at the photosphere. So if parts of the photosphere are cooler (spots) and others are hotter, does the observed ratio come from an average? Because if the star has spots, then part of the photosphere is hotter (the non-spots) and part is cooler (the spots). So the observed ratio would be a mixture of the ratios from the different regions.

Wait, but the question says, when the star's surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the average Teff is 5500 K when 40% of the surface is at a lower temperature (the spots), and the remaining 60% is at a higher temperature. Let me think about the luminosity equation.

Stellar luminosity is given by L = 4πR²σTeff^4. So when spots cover 40% of the surface, the total luminosity is the sum of the spotted and unspotted regions.

Let me denote:

A = area of the star (πR²)
Fraction spotted: f=0.4
Fraction unspotted: (1-f) = 0.6
Teff_spot = T_spot
Teff_unspotted = T_high

The total luminosity would be L = (f*A)σT_spot^4 + ( (1-f) A )σ T_high^4 )

But the star's overall Teff is given by L = 4π R² σ T_eff^4. So:

4π R² σ T_eff^4 = f A σ T_spot^4 + (1-f) A σ T_high^4

But A = π R², so:

4π R² σ T_eff^4 = f π R² σ T_spot^4 + (1-f) π R² σ T_high^4

Divide both sides by π R² σ:

4 T_eff^4 = f T_spot^4 + (1-f) T_high^4

But we don't know T_spot or T_high. However, perhaps we can make an assumption. Alternatively, maybe when the spots are present, the unspotted regions compensate to reach the lower Teff. Hmm, but this might complicate things.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. So perhaps the key is that each region (spot and unspotted) has its own ratio, and the observed ratio is a weighted average.

The problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. But the individual regions (spots and unspotted) would have their own temperatures, which are higher and lower than the average, respectively.

Wait, but without knowing the temperatures of the spots and the unspotted regions, this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying and considering that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when the spots are present, but that doesn't seem right because the presence of spots would imply that the rest is hotter.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K when 40% is covered. But that doesn't make sense because the effective temperature is an area-weighted average. So when 40% is cooler, the remaining 60% must be hotter to bring the average down to 5500 K.

Wait, no, if 40% is cooler, the average would be lower than 6000 K. But the question says when 40% is covered, the effective temperature is 5500 K.

Wait, but that's a significant drop. Maybe the spots are much cooler.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. The question states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower.

The ratio is n1/n2. When the star has spots, this ratio is lower. So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher. We need to find the factor by which it changes, i.e., (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

But to find this, we need to model how the ratio changes with temperature.

The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Assuming E2 > E1, which is typical for higher energy levels.

Wait, so n1 is the lower energy level, n2 is the higher. So the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

If T increases, the exponent becomes larger, so exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) increases, making n1/n2 larger. So a higher temperature would lead to a higher n1/n2 ratio.

Wait, wait, let me think again. Let's say E2 > E1. So E2 - E1 is positive. Then, the ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). So if T increases, the exponent becomes a smaller negative number, which makes the exponential larger. So n2/n1 increases with T.

Alternatively, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So if T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent is smaller, so exp(...) is smaller. So n1/n2 decreases as T increases.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me clarify.

The Boltzmann factor is for the energy difference. So, the formula is:

n_j / n_i = (g_j/g_i) * exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k T) )

Assuming j is the higher level. So E_j > E_i → E_j - E_i is positive.

Thus, n_j / n_i = (g_j/g_i) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

If T increases, the exponent becomes less negative (since denominator is bigger), so the exponential increases. So n_j/n_i increases with T.

Which means that for higher T, more population in the higher energy level.

So, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, no. Let me double-check. Suppose level 1 is lower than level 2. So E2 > E1.

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So when temperature T increases, (E2 - E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent is smaller, so exp(...) is smaller. So n1/n2 decreases as T increases.

Wait, so higher T makes n1/n2 smaller. So when the star has spots, its overall Teff is lower, so the ratio n1/n2 would be higher? But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So without spots, ratio is higher. But according to this, if T is lower, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

If T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so the exponential increases, so n1/n2 increases.

Therefore, when the star has spots (Teff is lower), the ratio n1/n2 would be higher. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So that would imply that our earlier conclusion is wrong.

Wait, so something must be wrong here. Let me go back.

Ah, wait. Maybe the energy levels are inverted. Suppose level 1 is higher than level 2. No, that can't be because in that case, E1 > E2. But the question says "energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)", which is a bit ambiguous. But generally, level 2 would be higher than level 1.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is n2/n1, not n1/n2. If the problem says the ratio decreases, then when spots are present, n2/n1 decreases.

Wait, let me recheck the question.

The question states: "the ratio of the number of
