Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. The options are different powers of r.

Hmm. So I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh wait, right! Parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (d), but in parsecs, right? So plx = 1/d. So if plx is small, the distance is large, and vice versa.

The problem says the number of stars N varies with 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N would be proportional to (d)^5, because 1/( (1/d) )^5 is d^5. Wait, let me double-check that. 1/(plx)^5 is same as (1/plx)^5. And since plx is 1/d, 1/plx is d. So yeah, (d)^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. Oh, right, so we're probably being asked about the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r, with thickness dr. That is, the number per unit distance would be the derivative of N with respect to r, I think.

Wait, because if N is the total number up to distance d, then the number per unit distance would be dN/dr. Alternatively, if the number is given as a function of plx, perhaps I need to express it in terms of r and find how it scales.

Wait, let's formalize it. The given is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Because plx = 1/d, so substituting, N ∝ (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So when d increases, N increases rapidly.

But wait, if N is the number of stars as a function of d, then the number per unit distance is dN/dr. Let me compute that. Since N ∝ d^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to 5d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (r) is proportional to r^4. So that would be option C.

Wait, but wait another thought. Maybe I should think of it in terms of differential elements. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr would be N(r) dr. If N(r) is the number per unit volume, but wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps N is the total number within a certain distance, but the question says "number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." That suggests that N is a function of plx, so perhaps it's N = k/(plx)^5, where k is some constant.

But since plx = 1/d, N = k * d^5. So for a given d, the number of stars is proportional to d^5. So if d increases, the number of stars increases as the fifth power of d.

Wait, but the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So for a small change in distance, say from r to r + dr, what's the change in N?

If N is proportional to d^5, then dN = 5d^4 dr. So dN/dr = 5d^4, which is proportional to r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (like the density) increases as the fourth power of r.

Looking at the options, the answer would be option C, which is r^4.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me recheck the math.

Given N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But plx = 1/d, so 1/(plx) = d. So 1/(plx)^5 = d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

So dN/dr would be 5d^4. So the number per unit distance (like stars per parsec) increases as r^4.

So the correct option is C, which is r^4.


The question states that the number of stars \( N \) in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \), where \( \text{plx} \) is the parallax. Since parallax and distance are inversely related (\( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \)), substituting \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \) into the given relation yields \( N \propto d^5 \), where \( d \) is the distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. This corresponds to the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \), which represents the number of stars per unit distance. Taking the derivative of \( N \propto d^5 \), we find:

\[
\frac{dN}{dd} \propto 5d^4.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( d^4 \), or equivalently \( r^4 \), where \( r \) represents distance. Among the given options, the correct scaling is \( r^4 \), corresponding to option C.

Answer: C
