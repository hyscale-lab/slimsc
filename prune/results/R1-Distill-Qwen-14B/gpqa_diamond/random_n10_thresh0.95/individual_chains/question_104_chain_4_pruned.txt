Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Let's think through this step by step.

So, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass, each hosting a planet. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune. The stars themselves have masses similar to our Sun. The planets are in circular orbits, which probably means their orbits are stable and not eccentric, which might affect the RV measurements.

The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets. The key data given involves the periodic shifts in the spectral lines of their host stars. For Planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for Planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. I need to find out how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

I remember that the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The velocity semi-amplitude (K) of the star's motion is what's measured here. K is related to the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the orbital period, and the distance of the planet from the star (or the semi-major axis, since the orbit is circular).

The formula I think is relevant here is the one that relates the velocity semi-amplitude K to the orbital period P. The formula goes something like:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) * (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P * sqrt(1 - e²)) )

Wait, but since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's (Neptune is much less than the Sun's mass), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies a bit.

Another approach: the RV method's detected velocity (K) is related to the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period. I think the formula can be written as:

K = ( ( (M_p) * sin i ) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * ( (2π G) / (P) )^(1/3) ) / (some constants)

Wait, maybe a better approach is to recall the equation that connects K and the orbital period. The formula is often given as:

K = (v * sin i) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1/(2π))^(1/3) )) )

Hmm, perhaps I should think of the formula in terms of the semi-amplitude K. The standard formula is:

K = [ ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ]^(1/ (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

Wait, that seems a bit confused. Alternatively, I've read that the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (1 + M_p / M_star)^(1/3) ) ) ] * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) )^(1/3)

But again, since M_p is much smaller than M_star, the term (1 + M_p/M_star) is approximately 1. So it simplifies to:

K ≈ [ (G * M_p * sin i) / M_star^(1/3) ) ] * (1 / (P * sqrt(1 - e²)))^(1/3)

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula. Maybe a better approach is to consider the equation that relates the velocity semi-amplitude K to the orbital period P. I remember that for a circular orbit (e=0), the formula simplifies. 

The formula I think is:

K = ( ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. The RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude, which depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance. But since both stars have the same mass and both planets have similar mass (Neptune), perhaps the ratio of their velocities will relate to the cube root of the ratio of their periods.

Wait, no. Wait, if K is the velocity semi-amplitude, then for the same star mass and planet mass, K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period P. Because from the formula:

K ∝ (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, let me make sure. Let's get the formula right. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star) * (1 + M_p/M_star) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) )^(1/3)

But when M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:

K = [ (G * M_p ) / (M_star^(4/3)) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/6) ) )

Wait, maybe I should get the exact formula from reliable sources. Oh right, the correct formula is:

K = ( ( (G * (M_p) / (M_star) ) )^(1/3) ) * (2π / (P))^(1/3) ) ) / (c * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )

No, that's not right. Let me think again. Another approach: the RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2π) / (P) )^(1/3) ) ] / (c * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )

Wait, perhaps I should write it in terms of the known variables. Given that M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So, K ≈ [ ( G * M_p )^(1/3) / ( M_star^(1/3) ) ) ] * ( 2π / (P) )^(1/3) ) / (c * sqrt(1 - e²) )

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Another approach: since the problem gives us K for each planet (5 and 7 milliangstroms), and both stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses, perhaps we can relate the periods using the formula.

So, for each planet, K is proportional to ( M_p / M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, let me see. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^2 ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / (P))^(1/3) ) / c 

Wait, no, I think the key point is that K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period P. So, if K1 and K2 are the velocities for planets 1 and 2, then:

K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, is that correct? Because if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then higher K means shorter P.

So, K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) → (K1/K2)^3 = P2 / P1 → P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1

Therefore, the ratio of the periods (P2/P1) is (K1/K2)^3

Wait, no, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1/K)^(3). So P2 / P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, wait, let me think:

If K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3), then P ∝ 1/K^(3)

So, P2 / P1 = ( K1 / K2 )^3

Because P is proportional to (1/K)^3. So, P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1

Therefore, the ratio P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^3

So, if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364

So, P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So, P2 is shorter than P1. Wait, but that can't be right because Planet #2 has a higher velocity shift.

Wait, let me think again. Because a larger K implies a shorter period. Because for a given planet mass and star mass, a higher velocity semi-amplitude means the star is moving faster in its orbit, which would require a shorter period to complete the orbit. So if K2 is larger than K1, P2 is shorter than P1.

So, according to the problem, K1 is 5, K2 is 7. Therefore, (K1/K2) is 5/7. So the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 ≈ 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is about 0.364 times that of P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. Therefore, planet #2's period is shorter, so how many times longer is it? Wait, the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So if P2 is shorter, the answer would be less than 1, which is option A: ~0.36.

But wait, let me make sure. Let's check the calculation again. 

K1 = 5 milliangstroms
K2 = 7 milliangstroms

Since both have same M_p and same M_star, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So, K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1/K^3.

So, the ratio of periods (P2/P1) is (K1/K2)^3.

So, (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So, P2 is about 0.364
