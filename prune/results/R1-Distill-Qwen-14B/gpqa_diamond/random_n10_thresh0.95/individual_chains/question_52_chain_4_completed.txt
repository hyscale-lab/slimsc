Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a star's photosphere and the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. The options are A to D, and I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

Alright, let me read the problem again carefully. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature is 6000 K, but when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but wait—what's the effect of spots on the star's observed temperature? I remember that spots are cooler, so when they cover part of the surface, the total emitted radiation would decrease, making the star appear cooler. But in this case, the star's effective temperature is given as 5500 K when spots are present. So the average temperature of the photosphere has gone down.

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the photosphere. The ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 is lower than when it doesn't. And the question is what's the factor by which the ratio changes—so the factor is N1/N2 (no spots) divided by N1/N2 (with spots), which would be (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_spots.

Wait, no—wait, no, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when there are spots, the ratio is lower. So the factor is the ratio when there are no spots divided by the ratio when there are spots. So if the ratio is R, then the factor is R_no / R_spots.

But wait, another thought: when the star has spots, the photosphere's temperature is lower in the spotted regions, but the rest is at 6000 K. But the problem says the overall effective temperature is 5500 K. However, the problem states that the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so each region's conditions can be considered locally. But wait, the question is about the ratio in the photosphere as a whole when the star has spots. So perhaps the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K when spots are present, but the star without spots is 6000 K.

Wait, but the star's photosphere is a mix of spotted and unspotted regions. Hmm, but the problem says, "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K." So maybe it's considering the average temperature of the entire photosphere as 5500 K when 40% is spotted. But how does that affect the excitation of Ti atoms?

Oh, wait, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio (n1/n2) is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights of the levels, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

So the ratio depends on the temperature. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. I think that's in the near-ultraviolet or far-ultraviolet. But maybe that's not too important for this calculation.

When the star doesn't have spots, the effective temperature is 6000 K. When it has spots (40% coverage), the overall Teff is 5500 K. Wait, but wait—does the presence of spots lower the average temperature of the entire photosphere? Or is the Teff calculated based on the total luminosity?

Wait, effective temperature is defined as the temperature a blackbody would have to emit the same total radiation. So if 40% of the surface is cooler (spots), and 60% is at 6000 K, then the total luminosity would be: L = 4π R² (σ T_eff^4). So the star's luminosity when spots are present would be the sum of the unspotted and spotted regions.

Let me think: the star is a mix of two regions—40% of the surface is cooler, let's say T_spot, and 60% is 6000 K. The effective temperature T_eff is 5500 K. So how do we find T_spot?

But maybe that's not needed here. Because the problem says the overall Teff is 5500 K. So when the star has spots, the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K. So for the purpose of calculating the Ti ratio, which depends on T, we can model the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when there are spots.

Wait, but that might not be correct because the star's surface isn't uniformly at 5500 K. It's 60% at 6000 K and 40% at T_spot. But the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the calculation considers the effective temperature as the average, but for the Boltzmann ratio, which depends on the local T. Hmm, but the problem says to assume LTE, so maybe each region is in LTE, but when considering the entire photosphere, the average is taken. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is observed as an average of the two regions. But the question is about the ratio in the photosphere when 40% is covered by spots. So maybe we can model the star's photosphere as a single temperature of 5500 K for the purpose of the ratio calculation. Or perhaps not.

Wait, no. Because the star's photosphere when spotted consists of two regions: unspotted (6000 K) and spotted (T_spot). So for the ratio of Ti atoms, each region contributes based on their own temperature. So the total ratio would be a weighted average of the two regions' ratios.

But the problem says that the ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. When the star has spots, the overall ratio is lower. So perhaps the 5500 K is the effective temperature, but the actual photosphere is a mix of 6000 K and lower T regions.

But this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think: the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is modeled as being at 5500 K for the purpose of this ratio calculation. Because that's what the effective temperature would imply. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is measured as the average over the entire surface. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the ratio depends on the local temperature. So when the star has spots, different regions have different temperatures. So the observed line ratio would be a combination of the ratios from both the spotted and unspotted regions.

But the problem states that the ratio of Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2 is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So the observed ratio is an average of the two regions.

But without knowing the temperature of the spotted regions, perhaps we can't calculate this. Wait, but the problem gives the overall effective temperature of 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered. So perhaps we can compute the temperature of the spotted regions.

Let me compute the temperature of the spots.

The star without spots: T1 = 6000 K, entire surface.

When 40% is covered by spots (so 60% remains at 6000 K), the total luminosity is L = 0.6 * 4π R² σ T1^4 + 0.4 * 4π R² σ T_spot^4.

The effective temperature when spots are present is T_eff =5500 K.

The effective temperature is given by L = 4π R² σ T_eff^4.

So,

0.6 T1^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 = T_eff^4.

Substituting the values:

0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(T_spot)^4 = (5500)^4.

Let me compute each term.

Compute each term in terms of 10^12 or similar.

Compute 6000^4: 6^4 = 1296, so 6000^4 = 1.296e16.

5500^4: 5.5^4 = 915.0625, so 5500^4 = 9.150625e16 *1e8 (since 1000^4 is 1e12, so 5500^4 is (5.5e3)^4= (5.5)^4 * 1e12= 915.0625e12= 9.150625e14). Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 6000 K is 6e3, so (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

Similarly, 5500^4 = (5.5e3)^4 = 5.5^4 * 1e12 = 915.0625 *1e12 = 9.150625e14.

Wait, wait, no: 1e3 to the 4th power is 1e12, so 6000^4 is 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

Similarly, 5500^4 is 5.5^4 * 1e12. 5.5^4= (5.5)^2 squared. 5.5^2 is 30.25, squared is ~915.0625. So 5.5^4 = 915.0625, so 5500^4 = 915.0625e12 = 9.150625e14.

So the equation is:

0.6 * 1.296e15 + 0.4 * T_spot^4 = 9.150625e14.

Compute 0.6 *1.296e15: 0.6 *1.296=0.7776, so 0.7776e15.

So 0.7776e15 + 0.4 T_spot^4 = 9.150625e14.

Let me subtract 0.7776e15 from both sides.

0.4 T_spot^4 = 9.150625e14 - 0.7776e15.

Wait, 0.7776e15 is 7.776e14.

So 9.150625e14 - 7.776e14 = (9.150625 -7.776) e14 = 1.374625e14.

So,

0.4 T_spot^4 = 1.374625e14.

Divide both sides by 0.4: T_spot^4 = (1.374625e14) / 0.4 = 3.4365625e14.

Take the fourth root to find T_spot.

Compute 3.4365625e14^(1/4). Let me compute the fourth root.

First, note that (1e14)^(1/4) = (1e14)^0.25 = (1e3.5)^0.25. Wait, 1e14 is 10^14.

But 10^14 = (10^3.5)^2. Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of exponents.

Alternatively, take natural logarithm. ln(3.4365625e14) = ln(3.4365625) + ln(1e14) ≈ 1.235 + 32.236 = 33.471.

Divide by 4: 33.471 /4 ≈ 8.3678.

Exponentiate: e^(8.3678) ≈ 4655 K.

Wait, but wait, e^8 is about 2980, e^8.3678? Let me compute it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the fourth root of 3.4365625e14.

But maybe using a calculator approach:

Compute 1e14^(1/4) = (1e14)^(0.25) = 1e(14 * 0.25) )= 1e3.5 = 3162.27766 K.

Now, 3.4365625e14 is 3.4365625 times 1e14, so the fourth root is (3.4365625)^(1/4) * 1e3.5.

Compute (3.4365625)^(1/4). Let's see, 3^0.25 is about 1.316, and 4^0.25= sqrt(2)=1.414. 3.436 is closer to 3. So perhaps around 1.36?

Let me compute 1.36^4: 1.36^2 = 1.8496. Then 1.8496^2 = approximately 3.42, which is close to 3.436. So 1.36^4 ≈3.42. So the fourth root of 3.436 is about 1.36.

So T_spot ≈ 1.36 * 3162 ≈ 4305 K.

Wait, 3162.27766 *1.36 = ?

3162 *1.36: 3162 *1 =3162, 3162 *0.3=948.6, 3162 *0.06=189.72. Sum: 3162+948.6=4110.6 +189.72=4300.32 K.

So T_spot ≈ 4300 K.

So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots at T_spot ≈4300 K, and the remaining 60% is at 6000 K.

Now, the ratio of Ti atoms in levels 1 and 2 depends on the local temperature. So when the star has spots, the photosphere is a mix of regions at 6000 K and 4300 K.

But the problem says the photosphere is in LTE, so each region is in LTE. Then the observed ratio would be a flux-weighted average of the two regions' ratios.

Wait, but the line emission depends on the number of atoms in each level, which depends on the local temperature. So the observed ratio would be a flux-weighted average of the two regions.

Wait, but how exactly? Because the line strength depends on the number of atoms in a particular level. If a region is hotter, more atoms are in higher energy levels. The line we're considering (1448 Å) corresponds to a transition between levels 1 and 2. So if the ratio n1/n2 is higher in cooler regions, then a star with spots would have a lower overall n1/n2 ratio because the cooler spots have lower n1/n2? Wait, no—wait, the Boltzmann equation: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), so as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio n2/n1 decreases, meaning n1/n2 increases. Wait, no: Let's clarify.

The ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1) / (k T) )

So if E2 > E1, which is usually the case for an upward transition, then as T increases, the exponent (E2 - E1)/(k T) increases, which makes exp(...) larger, hence n1/n2 increases. Wait, no: if E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive. So when T increases, the exponent becomes larger, so the exponential grows, which means n1/n2 increases. So higher T leads to higher n1/n2.

Wait, no. Let me correct.

Suppose E2 > E1. Then (E2 - E1) is positive. So when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes smaller (since denominator is bigger), because (E2-E1) is fixed. Wait, no: wait, (E2-E1) is a positive number, T in denominator. So as T increases, the whole fraction (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases. So the exponential of a smaller number is a smaller number, so the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) would decrease as T increases. Wait, wait, no: exp(x) increases when x increases. So if (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases as T increases, then exp(...) decreases, so n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * [smaller number], so n1/n2 decreases as T increases.

Wait, that can't be right. Because higher T should populate higher energy levels more. So n2 should be higher at higher T, hence n1/n2 would be lower. So the ratio n1/n2 is inversely proportional to T. So higher T leads to lower n1/n2.

Wait, let me think again. The Boltzmann factor is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1. So if ΔE is positive, then the term is negative. So n2 = n1 * (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). As T increases, exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) approaches 1, so n2/n1 approaches g2/g1. So higher T means more n2, so n1/n2 decreases.

So the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( ΔE/(k T) ), which decreases as T increases. So higher T leads to lower n1/n2.

So when the star has spots, the overall average of n1/n2 would be a weighted average of the two regions: the unspotted (6000 K) and spotted (4300 K).

Wait, but how is the average taken? If the surface area is 60% at 6000 K and 40% at 4300 K, then the average would be area-weighted, but the flux is also area-weighted because flux is proportional to T^4 * area. Hmm, but the line ratio depends on the local n1/n2, which depends on T. So the observed ratio would be a flux-weighted average of the two regions' n1/n2 ratios.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure about this. Let me think: the line emission depends on the number of atoms in each level. If a region is cooler, it's emitting less continuum, but the line depth would depend on the number of absorbers in that region. Wait, but this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is measured as the sum of all atoms in each level across the entire surface.

But perhaps the question is more straightforward. Maybe it's assuming that the temperature is the effective temperature (5500 K) when spots are present, so the entire photosphere is considered to be at 5500 K for the ratio calculation. But this would be incorrect, as the effective temperature is an average based on luminosity, not on the actual temperature distribution. However, perhaps that's the approach we are supposed to take here.

But given that the problem states that the ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots, and we have to find the factor by which the ratio changes, maybe we can model the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present.

So without spots, T=6000 K, and with spots, T=5500 K. Then the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ), so the ratio when no spots (R_no_spots) is proportional to exp(ΔE/(k * 6000)), and when spots are present (R_spots) is proportional to exp(ΔE/(k * 5500)).

Wait, but wait. Wait, (E2-E1) is ΔE. So the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp(ΔE/(k T)). So when T increases, the exponent increases, so the ratio increases. Wait, but earlier I thought that higher T would lead to lower n1/n2. Which is correct?

Wait, let me take ΔE = E2 - E1. So for a transition from level 1 to level 2, ΔE is positive if E2 > E1.

n2 = n1 * (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T))

So to find n1/n2, it's (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T)).

So, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T)).

So as T increases, the exponent ΔE/(k T) decreases because the denominator is larger (T is higher), so the exponential term becomes smaller. Hence, n1/n2 decreases as T increases. Wait, that can't be right because higher T would mean more excitation, so more atoms in higher energy levels, so lower n1/n2.

Wait, no, because in this expression, higher T makes the exponent smaller, so exp(ΔE/(k T)) is smaller. So n1/n2 is smaller when T is higher. So n1/n2 decreases with increasing T. So when the temperature is higher, the ratio of level 1 to level 2 is lower.

Wait, but in the problem statement, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, the overall T_eff is 5500 K, which is lower than 6000 K. So according to this, n1/n2 should be higher when T is lower, because as T decreases, ΔE/(k T) increases, so the exponential increases, making the ratio n1/n2 larger.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So in that case, when the star has spots, the T_eff is lower (5500 K), but the ratio n1/n2 is lower. That contradicts our previous conclusion. Hmm, so this suggests that perhaps my initial assumption about whether the star's effective temperature is 5500 K is incorrect, or perhaps the model is that the entire photosphere isn't at 5500 K.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the star without spots as being at 6000 K, and with spots as being at 5500 K, but the spots are cooler regions. So each region has its own T, and the observed ratio is a combination.

But without knowing the actual T of the spots, perhaps the problem is considering the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present.

Wait, but if the problem says that the overall Teff is 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, then the entire photosphere's average T_eff is 5500 K. But the local T in the spots is lower, and the rest is at 6000 K.

But perhaps the question is more straightforward: when the star has spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K, so the ratio is calculated at 5500 K. Without spots, it's 6000 K. So the factor is the ratio of the ratios.

So the ratio when no spots is R_no = exp(ΔE/(k T_no)), and when spots are present, R_spots = exp(ΔE/(k T_spots)).

So the factor is R_no / R_spots = exp(ΔE/(k T_no)) / exp(ΔE/(k T_spots)) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T_no - 1/T_spots) ) )

Wait, but wait, because the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp(ΔE/(k T)), so the factor would be [exp(ΔE/(k * 6000)) ] / [exp(ΔE/(k * 5500)) ] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Let me compute this.

Compute (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500 - 6000)/(6000 *5500) ) * (-1) ?

Wait, 1/6000 - 1/5500 = (5500 - 6000) / (6000 *5500) ) = (-500) / (33,000,000) ) = -500 / 33e6 = approx -0.0000151515.

But it's negative, so the exponent is ΔE/(k) * (-0.0000151515) )

So the factor is exp( (ΔE/(k)) * (-0.0000151515) )

Which is the same as exp( - (ΔE/(k)) * 0.0000151515 )

Wait, but we don't know ΔE. The transition is at 1448 Å.

What's the energy difference ΔE between the two levels corresponding to this wavelength?

The energy of a photon is E = hc / λ.

So h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 *3e8 ) / (1448e-10) )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So E = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

But this is the energy per photon. To convert to eV, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

E = 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.56 eV.

So ΔE is approximately 8.56 eV.

But wait, the energy difference between the two levels is 8.56 eV. That's a significant energy difference.

Now, let's compute (ΔE)/(k).

k is Boltzmann's constant, 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So ΔE/(k) = 8.56 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 8.56 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 99330 K.

So, ΔE/(k) ≈ ~99330 K.

So the exponent is (ΔE/k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) ) = 99330 K * (-0.0000151515 ) ≈ 99330 * (-0.0000151515) ≈ -1.506.

So the factor is exp( -1.506 ) ≈ e^(-1.506) ≈ 0.221.

Wait, but wait. No, because the factor is R_no / R_spots = exp( [ΔE/(k T_no)] - [ΔE/(k T_spots)] )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T_no) - 1/(T_spots) ] )

Which is exp( (99330 K) [ 1/6000 - 1/5500 ] )

Which is exp( 99330 * [ (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) ] ) = exp( 99330 * (-500)/(33,000,000) )

Compute the term inside:

(-500) / (33e6) ) = -5e2 / 3.3e7 = -5/(33000) ≈ -0.000151515.

So 99330 * (-0.000151515) ≈ -15.06.

So the exponent is -15.06, so exp(-15.06) ≈ 3e-7.

Wait, that can't be right because that would make the ratio factor very small, but the options don't have such a small number. The options are around 1, 7, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in determining the exponent.

Wait, let me recompute the exponent.

Wait, the exponent is (ΔE/(k)) * (1/T_no - 1/T_spots).

Wait, I computed (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500 -6000)/(6000 *5500) ) = (-500)/(33e6) = approximately -0.00001515.

Multiply by (ΔE/k) which is 99330 K.

So 99330 * (-0.00001515) = let's compute that:

99330 * 0.00001515 = 99330 * 1.515e-5 = approx 99330 * 1.5e-5 = 99330 * 0.000015.

Well, 99330 * 0.00001 = 0.9933.

So 0.000015 is 1.5 times that, so 1.49.

So 99330 * (-0.00001515) ≈ -1.506.

So the exponent is -1.506, so exp(-1.506) is approximately 0.221.

So the factor (R_no / R_spots) is approximately 0.221. But wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So R_spots = R_no * 0.221.

Wait, but the options are given as the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it has spots. So the factor is R_no / R_spots ≈ 0.221, which is about 1/4.5. So the factor is approximately 0.221, which is 1/4.5. So the factor is 4.5 times.

Wait, no. R_no / R_spots = 0.221, which implies R_spots = R_no * 0.221, so the ratio decreases by a factor of 4.5.

Wait, because 0.221 is approximately 1/4.5. So if R_no is 1, R_spots is 1/4.5. So the ratio when no spots is 4.5 times larger than when spots are present.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So R_spots < R_no.

So the factor is R_no / R_spots = ~4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we analyze the problem using the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} \propto \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the two levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The problem specifies that the star's effective temperature is 6000 K without spots and 5500 K with spots. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, which allows us to calculate \( \Delta E \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \Delta E \)
The energy of a photon is given by:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). Substituting these values:

\[
E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
E \approx \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, \( \Delta E \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV} \).

### Step 2: Compute the factor
The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{spots}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}}\right)\right),
\]

where \( T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \). Substituting \( \Delta E = 8.56 \, \text{eV} \) and \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.56}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99330 \, \text{K}.
\]

Now calculate the temperature term:

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} = \frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} = \frac{5500 - 6000}{6000 \times 5500} \approx -0.00001515.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}}\right) = 99330 \times (-0.00001515) \approx -1.506.
\]

The factor is then:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(-1.506) \approx 0.221.
\]

This means the ratio \( \frac{n_1}{n_2} \) decreases by a factor of approximately \( 1 / 0.221 \approx 4.5 \) when the star has spots compared to when it does not.

### Final Answer:
The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately **4.5**.
