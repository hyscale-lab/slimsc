Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement, like F = -kx. But wait, this is a relativistic version, so I think that complicates things a bit because relativistic effects come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are all different formulas involving c, which is the speed of light, so I'll have to consider relativistic effects here. Let's think about how the maximum speed is determined in such a system.

In a classical harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, the question is relativistic, so I can't just use that formula.

Relativistically, the energy is given by the total energy, which includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The total energy E is gamma times mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The potential energy in a relativistic oscillator might be different too. 

Wait, but the problem says it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the force is the same as in the classical case, but the energy expressions change because of relativity. Hmm, how does that work?

In the harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is conserved. In the relativistic case, when the mass is at the maximum amplitude A, all the energy would be potential, and at the equilibrium point (x=0), all would be kinetic. But wait, in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv²; it's (gamma - 1)mc².

So, at x = A, the potential energy U is (1/2)kA², same as before. The total energy E is then U plus the rest energy mc² plus the kinetic energy. Wait no, the total energy should be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. Wait, maybe the potential energy is still (1/2)kA² because the force is given by Hooke's law, so the potential is the integral of F dx, which is (1/2)kx², same as classical.

So at maximum displacement A, the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential: E = (1/2)kA² + mc². Wait, no, the rest energy is mc², but in classical, E is (1/2)kA², but in relativistic, the total energy is E = mc² + kinetic energy. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, in the classical case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which is the sum of kinetic and potential. But in relativity, the total energy is mc² plus the kinetic energy. So, perhaps the potential energy remains (1/2)kA², but the total energy would be E = mc² + (1/2)kA². 

When the mass is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic. So, at x=0, the energy is E = gamma mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. So, setting E equal, we have:

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Hmm, that makes sense. So,

gamma = 1 + (1/(2mc²)) k A².

But wait, let me write that equation again. The total energy at x=A is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy? Or is the potential energy separate? Wait, no, the potential energy in the classical case is part of the total mechanical energy. But in relativity, the rest energy is separate. So maybe the total energy is the sum of rest energy and the potential energy.

Wait, no. Because in the classical case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², but the kinetic is zero. So in the relativistic case, the potential energy should still be (1/2)kA², and the total energy is (1/2)kA² + mc².

Wait, that makes sense. Because when the mass is at x=A, it's not moving, so all the energy is potential plus rest. So when it's at x=0, the potential is zero, and all energy is kinetic plus rest.

So at x=0, the energy is E = (gamma) mc². And that's equal to (1/2)kA² + mc².

So,

gamma mc² = (1/2)k A² + mc²

Subtract mc² from both sides:

gamma mc² - mc² = (1/2)k A²

mc² (gamma - 1) = (1/2)k A²

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

gamma - 1 = (k A²)/(2 mc²) * sqrt(... ? Wait, let me solve for gamma.

From the equation:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some term, say, let's call it x for a moment.

Then,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + x

So,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + x)

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + x)^2

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + x)^2

But x is (k A²)/(2 m c² ), so substituting back:

v² = c² [1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 ]

Hmm, let me simplify the denominator.

Let me write 1 + x as 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So, 1/(1 + x)^2 = [1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))]^2

So,

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 ]

Take the square root:

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check.

Option D is v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Wait, no, option D is sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) ))^2 ? Let me recheck.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c² )) )^2 )

Wait, no. Let me look again.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c^2)))^2 )

Wait, no, the denominator inside the fraction is (1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2)) ) squared. Because the expression is 1/(1 + ... ) squared.

Wait, the formula I have is 1 - [1/(1 + ... )^2 ].

So v = c * sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 ] )

Let me compute the denominator. Let me denote y = (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

So,

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + y )^2 )

Hmm, 1 - 1/(1 + y )^2 can be rewritten as [ (1 + y )^2 -1 ] / (1 + y )^2

Which is (1 + 2 y + y² -1 ) / (1 + y )² = (2 y + y² ) / (1 + y )²

So,

v = c * sqrt[ (2y + y² ) / (1+ y )² ]

Factor numerator: y(2 + y )

So,

v = c * sqrt( y (2 + y ) ) / (1 + y )

But y is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Wait, let me substitute back:

v = c * sqrt( (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) * ( 2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) ) / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

Simplify numerator under sqrt:

(k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) * ( (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) )

Wait, perhaps this isn't the best approach. Let me think about the options again.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2m ))^2 )

Wait, no, option A is sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2m ))^2 )

Wait, the problem is that the denominator inside the square root is (1 - (k A^2)/(2m )) squared, but in our case, the denominator in the fraction is (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) squared.

So none of the options seem to match exactly. Let me look at option B:

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2 m c² )) )

But wait, in option B, the denominator is 1 - (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 ), which is not the same as our (1 + ... )^2. Option D is:

v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Which matches our expression. Because in our case, the inside is 1 - [1/(1 + y )^2 ] where y is (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )).

So the correct option would be D.

Wait, let me double-check. Our expression is v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + y )^2 ), where y = (k A^2 )/( 2 m c^2 )

So yes, that's exactly option D.

But wait, why is option C incorrect? Because in the non-relativistic case, option C is correct, but here we're considering relativistic speeds, so the answer can't be option C.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again. Is the potential energy still (1/2)k A² in the relativistic case? Because in relativity, energy is not just the sum of rest and kinetic; but in this scenario, perhaps the potential is treated the same as in classical mechanics because the force is given by Hooke's law, which is F = -kx.

So, yes, the potential energy U is the integral of F dx, which is (1/2)k x², correct. So U(A) is (1/2)k A².

So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, all energy is potential, which is (1/2)k A² plus rest energy? Wait, no. Because in classical mechanics, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)k A², which is the sum of kinetic and potential. But in relativity, the rest energy is separate.

Wait, wait a second. Maybe I got the setup wrong. Let me think again. In the classical case, when the oscillator is at x = A, the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero, and potential is (1/2)k A². So the total mechanical energy is (1/2)k A².

But in the relativistic case, the total energy is more than that because of the rest mass energy. So perhaps my initial setup was incorrect.

Wait, no. Because in the relativistic case, the potential energy would still be (1/2)k A². The rest energy is mc², which is separate. So at x = A, the total energy is (1/2)k A² + mc², and at x=0, it's all kinetic and rest energy: E = gamma mc².

So,

gamma mc² = (1/2)k A² + mc².

Which leads to gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc² )

So the same as before. So the previous analysis holds, leading to option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the setup is different because the potential energy in a relativistic oscillator is different. But the problem states that it's obeying Hooke's law, so I think using U = (1/2)k A² is correct.

So the correct answer should be option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the system's energy conservation. The total energy \( E \) is conserved and includes the rest energy \( mc^2 \), the potential energy \( U = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \) at maximum displacement, and the kinetic energy at equilibrium.

At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential and rest energy:
\[
E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 + mc^2.
\]

At equilibrium \( x = 0 \), all energy is kinetic and rest energy:
\[
E = \gamma mc^2,
\]
where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

Equating the total energy at both points:
\[
\gamma mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 + mc^2.
\]

Subtracting \( mc^2 \) from both sides:
\[
\gamma mc^2 - mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Factoring out \( mc^2 \):
\[
mc^2 (\gamma - 1) = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \):
\[
mc^2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} - 1 \right) = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Let \( y = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:
\[
\gamma - 1 = y.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \):
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} - 1 = y.
\]

Rearranging:
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + y.
\]

Taking the reciprocal and squaring:
\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + y}.
\]

Squaring both sides:
\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + y)^2}.
\]
