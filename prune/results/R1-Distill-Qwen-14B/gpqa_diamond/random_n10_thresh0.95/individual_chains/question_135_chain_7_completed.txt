Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's see what I can remember. The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term and the mass of the boson, and I need to find the allowed decay products. 

The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused about the notation here. Oh right, in the interaction term, the X boson is coupling to fermions. The fermions are represented by ψ_f, and λ is the coupling constant. 

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So I'm supposed to find what particles X can decay into. Decays are possible if the energy (mass) of the boson is enough to produce the rest mass of the decay products. 

First, I need to figure out which fermions can be produced. The Lagrangian term here seems to involve Yukawa interactions because it's similar to the Yukawa coupling term, which couples a scalar field (like the Higgs) to fermions. So the interaction is something like X ψ ψ. That makes sense because Yukawa interactions are for spin-0 bosons coupling to fermions.

Wait, but the question is about the decay of X. So X can decay into two fermions because the interaction term allows for two-fermion production. So X → f f̄.

Now, the fermions f are quarks and leptons, I think. So I need to check which fermions have a mass less than or equal to half the X mass, because the maximum mass each fermion can have is when they are produced in pairs (since energy is split between them). 

Wait, so the mass of X is 6 GeV. So each fermion in the decay must have mass less than or equal to 3 GeV, because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV. 

So let's list all the possible fermions and their masses. 

Quark masses (current quarks):

- Up quark (u): about 2 MeV
- Down quark (d): about 4-5 MeV
- Strange quark (s): about 95-100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): about 1.2-1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): about 4-5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV, but way beyond 3 GeV.

Lepton masses:

- Electron (e-): about 0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ-): about 105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ-): about 1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: their masses are super tiny, but for this problem, probably negligible. But wait, the decay would produce a neutrino and anti-neutrino? But neutrinos are very light, but in the Lagrangian, I don't see any term involving neutrinos. Hmm, looking back, the given Lagrangian couples X to ψ_f, which I think in this context refers to charged leptons and quarks. Or maybe neutrinos are part of ψ_f? Not sure. But the problem probably considers only charged leptons. 

Wait, but in the options, I see things like e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau- as possible decay channels. So the X can decay into any fermion pair where each fermion has mass less than 3 GeV.

Let's list each fermion's mass:

- e: ~0.5 MeV
- mu: ~105 MeV
- tau: ~1.78 GeV
- u, d: ~2-5 MeV
- s: ~100 MeV
- c: ~1.5 GeV
- b: ~4.5 GeV (way over 3 GeV, so can't be produced)
- t: way too heavy.

So the fermions whose mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c. Wait, but wait: tau is 1.78 GeV, so each tau is 1.78 GeV. So two taus would sum to about 3.56 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. Wait, no, because X is 6 GeV. So each tau is 1.78 GeV, so two taus would need 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. Oh wait, no, because the sum of the rest masses must be less than or equal to the mass of X. So for X → τ+ τ-, each tau is 1.78 GeV, so combined 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So that's allowed.

Wait, but wait: the maximum mass for each fermion in a pair would be when m_fermion * 2 <= m_X. So m_fermion <= 3 GeV.

Tau is 1.78 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. So yes, X can decay into tau pair.

Charm quark is ~1.5 GeV, so 1.5 *2 is 3 GeV, which is exactly half of 6 GeV. So X can decay into c c̄.

Bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV, so X cannot decay into b b̄.

Now, what about the other quarks? u, d, s are all way below 3 GeV. So X can decay into u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄, e+ e-, μ+ μ-, tau+ tau-.

Wait, but wait: top quark is way too heavy, so no t t̄ decay. Bottom is too heavy, so the options that include b or other heavy quarks are out.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau, e. Hmm, but b is 4.5 GeV, so if X is 6 GeV, each b would require 4.5 GeV, but 2 *4.5 is 9 GeV which is more than 6, so b decay is not allowed. So option A includes b, which can't be correct. So A is wrong.

Option B: includes c c̄. Wait, no, option B is X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau, mu, e. Oh wait, let's check: c is 1.5 GeV. So 2c is 3 GeV, which is allowed. So c is allowed. So B includes c, which is allowed. Also, what about tau? 1.78 *2 = 3.56 <6. So that's allowed. So B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's all except the bottom quark. So B seems possible.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. Wait, t is way too heavy. X is 6 GeV, t's mass is about 173 GeV, so 2t is 346 GeV, way beyond 6. So C includes t, which is impossible. So C is invalid.

Option D: includes b, but also mu and tau. Wait, no, does it include b? Let me check. Option D says X→ b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau, mu, e. Oh, D includes b, which is 4.5 GeV. So each b would need 4.5 GeV, so 2b would be 9 GeV, more than X's 6 GeV. So D includes b, which is not allowed. So D is wrong.

So now, only B and perhaps another option. Wait, let me look again.

Option B: includes c c̄. So the decay channels are c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Are all these possible?

Yes, because their masses are all below 3 GeV except maybe the tau. Wait, tau is 1.78 GeV, so 2 * 1.78 is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So that's allowed.

So the correct answer should include all these except any fermion with mass above 3 GeV.

Looking at the options, option B is the one that includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's correct.

Wait, but what about the quark masses? For example, the strange quark is about 100 MeV, so 2s would be 200 MeV, which is allowed. So s is in the allowed list.

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the given interaction Lagrangian. The interaction term suggests that \( X \) couples to fermion-antifermion pairs, and the decay products must satisfy the condition that the total rest mass of the pair is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), or \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Analysis of Fermion Masses:
1. **Quarks**:
   - \( u, d \): \( m \sim 2-5 \, \text{MeV} \), well below \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - \( s \): \( m \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \), also below \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - \( c \): \( m \sim 1.2-1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), satisfies \( m \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - \( b \): \( m \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), exceeds \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( X \to b\bar{b} \) is not allowed.
   - \( t \): \( m \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \), far exceeds \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( X \to t\bar{t} \) is not allowed.

2. **Leptons**:
   - \( e \): \( m \sim 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \), well below \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - \( \mu \): \( m \sim 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \), also below \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - \( \tau \): \( m \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), satisfies \( m \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( X \to b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( b \) quarks are too heavy (\( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \)). **Invalid**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( X \to c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \). All these fermions have masses \( \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \), so this option is **valid**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( X \to t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( t \) quarks are far too heavy (\( m_t \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \)). **Invalid**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( X \to b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( b \) quarks are too heavy (\( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \)). **Invalid**.

### Conclusion:
The only kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order are those listed in **Option B**.

Answer: B
