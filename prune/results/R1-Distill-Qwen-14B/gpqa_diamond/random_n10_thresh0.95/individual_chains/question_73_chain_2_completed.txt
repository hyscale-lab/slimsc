Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about relativity. Hmm, let me read it again. Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is about finding the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Wait, wait. I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. Oh right, the velocity addition formula is needed here. So for relative speed between the two, I can't just subtract 0.6c and 0.5c because that would give 0.1c, but relativistic speeds don't work that way.

So the formula for relative velocity, when one frame is moving at u and the other at v relative to the first frame, is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). But wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So astronaut A is at 0.6c, and astronaut B is at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, what's the speed of B?

Hmm, I think I need to calculate (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)), where v is 0.6c and u is 0.5c. So substituting, the numerator would be 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) which is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.14286c, which is about 0.14c. That matches option C and D for the relative speed.

Wait, but what about the total energy of the system? So each astronaut has relativistic kinetic energy, but I think the total energy would be the sum of their rest mass energies plus their kinetic energies. But wait, wait, no. Wait, in relativity, the total energy includes their rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. So the total energy E_total is gamma m c² for each, added together.

So for the first astronaut, mass 2m, moving at 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So v is 0.6c, so v² is 0.36c². 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So his energy is 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Similarly, the second astronaut has mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So his energy is 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

So adding them together: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 mc², which is approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D says E=5mc², same v_rel. So the correct E is 5.96, so the correct option is C.

Wait, but let me double-check the velocity calculation. Oh right, the relative velocity is the speed that one sees the other moving at. So from the first astronaut's frame, the second is approaching at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²) = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1/0.7 c ≈ 0.14286c, which is approximately 0.14c when rounded. So that matches.

So the relative speed is about 0.14c, and the total energy is about 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, the speeds of the two astronauts are \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14286c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \). For each astronaut, we calculate their energy and sum them to find the total energy.

1. **First astronaut** (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):
   \[
   \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
   \]
   \[
   E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
   \]

2. **Second astronaut** (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):
   \[
   \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
   \]
   \[
   E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
   \]

The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96mc^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
