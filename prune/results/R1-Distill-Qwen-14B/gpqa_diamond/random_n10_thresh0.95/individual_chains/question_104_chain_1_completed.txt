Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me try to think through it. I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. So the star moves back and forth, and that causes the spectral lines to shift in wavelength.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected each planet, and the shifts in their spectral lines are given: 5 milliangstrom for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods—specifically, how many times longer is planet #2's period compared to planet #1.

Wait, but wait—how does the RV shift relate to the orbital period? I think the RV shift is related to the mass of the planet and the star's velocity. Oh right, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ) / ( (P * (2π))^1/3 ) ). But since e is zero here (circular orbits), that term goes away. Also, since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, which is the mass of the star, same for both planets.

So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(1/3)) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) ). Because K is the velocity semi-amplitude, which is given by the wavelength shift. Wait, but actually, the wavelength shift is related to the velocity via the Doppler effect. The shift (delta lambda) is proportional to v (velocity) times lambda (wavelength of the spectral line). But since the same spectral line is used for both stars, lambda is the same for both. So the velocity is proportional to delta lambda. So for each planet, K is proportional to delta lambda.

So K1 = 5 mA, K2 =7 mA. So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

But K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), because from the equation K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). So if K increases, P decreases. So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 must be smaller than P1? Wait, no, no—wait. Let me think again.

The formula for K is K ∝ (M_p) / ( (M_*^2 * P)^(1/3) ) * (1/(1 - e²)^(1/2)) ). Since e is zero, it's just K ∝ (M_p) / ( (M_*^2 * P)^(1/3) ). But both M_p and M_* are the same for both planets. So K ∝ 1 / (P^(1/3)) ).

So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So P ∝ 1/(K^(3)).

Wait, no. Let's see: K = (some constant) * (M_p) / ( (M_*)^2 * P )^(1/3) ). Since M_p and M_* are same for both planets, the ratio of K's is K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3). Because K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)), so K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

So let's plug in the numbers. K2/K1 is 7/5 = 1.4. So,

1.4 = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

To find the ratio of orbital periods, P2/P1, we can cube both sides.

Wait, let me think. Let me write the equation again. Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3). So K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

We have K2/K1 =7/5 =1.4. Therefore,

1.4 = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

To find P2/P1, take reciprocal of both sides: (P2/P1) = (P1/P2)^(-1). So,

(P1/P2) = (1.4)^3.

Wait, no, let's see: 1.4 = (P1/P2)^(1/3). Cube both sides: (1.4)^3 = P1/P2.

So, P1 = (1.4)^3 * P2.

So, P2 = P1 / (1.4)^3.

Therefore, the ratio P2/P1 is 1/(1.4)^3.

Let me compute 1.4 cubed. 1.4^3 = 1.4 *1.4=1.96, then 1.96 *1.4= 2.744. So 1.4^3 = 2.744. So P2 is 1/2.744 times P1, so approximately 0.364 times.

Wait, but the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. That means it's shorter, not longer. So the question is: How many times longer is P2 than P1? So the answer would be ~0.36 times longer, which is option A.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no, because if P2 is shorter than P1, then the period of P2 is shorter, so it's not longer. But the question is, how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1. So if P2 is shorter, then it's 0.36 times as long as P1. So the ratio is P2/P1 = ~0.36. So the answer is 0.36, option A.

Wait, let me recheck. Because K is proportional to (M_p) / (P^(1/3)) * ... Since other terms are same, K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3). So P is proportional to 1/(K)^3.

So, P2 = (K1^3 / K2^3) * P1.

Wait, no: since K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so P ∝ 1/K^3. Hence, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Because P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3.

Compute 5^3 =125, 7^3=343. So 125/343 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is approx 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is: How many times longer is P2 than P1? So that's 0.36 times as long, so P2 is shorter. So the answer is 0.36 times, so option A.


To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), meaning:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that both stars have the same mass and both planets have similar masses, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes \( K_2 / K_1 \) is related to the ratio of the orbital periods \( P_2 / P_1 \) by:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( P_2 / P_1 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

The RV semi-amplitudes are given as \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{mA} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{mA} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \):

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This means planet #2's orbital period is shorter than planet #1's, not longer. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
