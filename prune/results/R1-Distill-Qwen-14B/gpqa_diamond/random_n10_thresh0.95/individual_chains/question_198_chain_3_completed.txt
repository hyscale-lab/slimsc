Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm. I remember that stability constants are used to determine the concentration of metal complexes in solution. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex. So each beta corresponds to a different complex, probably with different numbers of SCN- ligands attached.

Wait, the complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n^2+ or something like that. So for n=1,2,3,4, the beta values are given. The blue dithiocyanato complex is probably the one with two SCN- ligands. Or wait, maybe it's a different n. Oh, the name is "dithiocyanato", which implies two SCN- per Co. So we're looking for the percentage of Co(SCN)_2^2+ (if that's the case) or whatever the correct formula is.

But how do I approach finding the percentage? I think I need to calculate the fraction of each complex and then find which one is the dithiocyanato and sum accordingly.

The approach I remember is that the distribution of metal complexes can be found using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions. It involves calculating the fraction of each possible complex.

The general idea is that each complex is formed step by step, each with a certain probability based on the concentration of ligand and the beta values.

The formula for the fraction of each complex is f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / (1 + sum from k=0 to k_max of β_k [SCN]^k ).

Wait, no, actually, for each species, the fraction is given by (β_n [SCN]^n) divided by the sum of all (β_k [SCN]^k) for k from 0 to 4, since there are four stability constants. Because the possible complexes are Co(SCN)_0, Co(SCN)_1, ..., Co(SCN)_4.

Wait, but each beta is for a specific n. Let me think: the stability constant β_n is for the formation of the complex with n SCN- ions. For example, β1 is for Co(SCN)²+.

So, the fraction f_n is (β_n [SCN]^n) / (sum_{k=0}^4 β_k [SCN]^k ), but wait, no. Because for each n, the complex formation is a stepwise process. The stability constants are for the formation of each successive complex.

Wait, actually, the fraction of each species is calculated using the formula f_n = (β_n [L]^n) / (sum_{k=0}^4 β_k [L]^k )

Wait, but the β is for the overall formation, so for the complex with n ligands, the formula is Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_n^2+.

The stability constants are given for each n, so the fraction of each complex is f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / (sum_{k=0}^4 β_k [SCN]^k )

Wait, but is that correct? Because the total concentration of Co is the sum of all f_n multiplied by their respective concentrations. Hmm, maybe I should consider that the total concentration is c_total = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]²+ + [Co(SCN)_2]²+ + ... + [Co(SCN)_4]²+.

But the fractions are each f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / (sum_{k=0}^4 β_k [SCN]^k )

Wait, but wait, the [Co^2+] is the free ion, which corresponds to n=0. So for n=0, β_0 is 1 (since it's the formation constant for the complex with zero ligands, which is just the metal ion itself). So, in the denominator, we sum β_0 [SCN]^0 (which is 1*1=1), β1 [SCN]^1, β2 [SCN]^2, etc.

So, putting that together, the fractions are:

f_0 = β0 [SCN]^0 / (β0 [SCN]^0 + β1 [SCN]^1 + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Similarly for f_1, f_2, etc.

But wait, β0 is 1, because the formation constant for the complex with zero ligands is just the inverse of the dissociation constant, which for free ions is 1.

So, the denominator becomes 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

So, let's compute each term:

Given [SCN] is 0.1 M.

Compute each term in the denominator:

Term 0: 1 [since β0=1, [SCN]^0=1] → 1

Term 1: β1 * [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term 2: β2 * (0.1)^2 =40 * 0.01=0.4

Term3: β3*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063

Term4: β4*(0.1)^4=16 * 0.0001=0.0016

So the denominator is 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = let's compute that.

1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator is approximately 2.3646.

Now, each f_n is (β_n [SCN]^n ) / 2.3646.

So:

f_0 = 1 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.4225 → 42.25%

f_1 = (9 * 0.1) / 2.3646 → 0.9 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.3805 → 38.05%

f_2 = (40 * 0.01) / 2.3646 → 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169 → 16.9%

f_3 = (63 * 0.001) / 2.3646 → 0.063 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.0266 → 2.66%

f_4 = (16 * 0.0001) / 2.3646 → 0.0016 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.000676 → 0.0676%

So the fractions add up to roughly 42.25 + 38.05 +16.9 +2.66 +0.0676 ≈ 100%.

Now, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato suggests two SCN- per Co, so that's f_2.

f_2 is approximately 16.9%, looking at the numbers.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, which matches.

But wait, let me check the fractions again.

Wait, the β values given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, wait. Did I assign the terms correctly?

Wait, the formation of Co(SCN)_n^2+ would have a formation constant β_n, where β_n is the equilibrium constant for the reaction:

Co^(2+) + n SCN^- → Co(SCN)_n^2+.

So, the first complex (n=1) has β1=9.

n=2 is β2=40.

n=3 is β3=63.

n=4 is β4=16.

So, the calculation seems correct.

Wait, but β4 is 16, which is lower than β3. So the complex with four SCNs is less stable than the one with three. That makes sense because higher beta means more stable. So the most stable is n=3.

But the question is about the percentage of the dithiocyanato, which is n=2.

So, f_2 is 16.9% according to my calculation. But looking back, in the options, option D is 16.9%.

But wait, wait a second. Let me recalculate the denominator more accurately.

Denominator:

Compute each term:

Term0: 1.

Term1: 9 * 0.1 = 0.9 → 0.9.

Term2:40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

Term3:63 * (0.1)^3=63 * 0.001=0.063.

Term4:16*(0.1)^4=16 * 0.0001=0.0016.

Sum all terms:

1 +0.9 =1.9.

1.9 +0.4=2.3.

2.3 +0.063=2.363.

2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646.

Now, f_2 is (40*(0.1)^2) / 2.3646 = (40 *0.01)/2.3646=0.4 / 2.3646.

Let me compute 0.4 divided by 2.3646.

2.3646 is approximately 2.3646.

So, 2.3646 times 0.169 is approx 0.4.

Wait, 2.3646 *0.169 → let's compute 2 *0.169=0.338; 0.3646 *0.169 ≈ 0.0618. Sum is about 0.3998, which is close to 0.4.

So, 0.4 /2.3646 ≈ 0.169 or 16.9%.

So the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the option C is 38.1% which is f_1, but the question is about dithiocyanato, which is n=2. So, the correct answer is D.

But wait, let me think again. Is the question about dithiocyanato, which is two SCN- per Co, so the fraction is f_2 =16.9%, which is option D.

Yes, that's correct.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂²⁺]) among all cobalt-containing species, we use the stability constants (β) and the concentrations of cobalt and thiocyanate ions. The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants are given as β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16.

The fraction of each cobalt complex, fₙ, is calculated using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{\sum_{k=0}^4 \beta_k [\text{SCN}]^k}
\]

Here, the denominator is the sum of all terms \(\beta_k [\text{SCN}]^k\) for \(k = 0\) to \(k = 4\). The terms are calculated as follows:

- Term 0: \(\beta_0 [\text{SCN}]^0 = 1\)
- Term 1: \(\beta_1 [\text{SCN}]^1 = 9 \times 0.1 = 0.9\)
- Term 2: \(\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \times (0.1)^2 = 0.4\)
- Term 3: \(\beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \times (0.1)^3 = 0.063\)
- Term 4: \(\beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \times (0.1)^4 = 0.0016\)

The denominator is the sum of these terms:

\[
1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)₂²⁺]) corresponds to \(f_2\), which is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2}{\text{denominator}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169 \, \text{(or 16.9%)}.
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
