Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so they form an orthonormal basis. 

The first part of the question is about finding the probabilities of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij where Aij = ħ/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, I think that means the matrix is a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin-½ particles.

Wait, let me write down the matrix. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (where i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are ħ/2. So the matrix would look like:

[ 0      ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2    0  ]

Wait, that's a matrix with zero diagonal and ħ/2 off-diagonal. That reminds me of the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], but scaled. Let me think: if I take (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, that's exactly this A matrix. Because:

Pauli X = [[0,1],[1,0]], so (ħ/2) * X would be [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

So the operator A is ħ/2 times the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of Pauli X are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. But wait, the question is about the eigenstates of the operator A. Since A is proportional to X, its eigenstates are the same as those of X, and the eigenvalues would be scaled accordingly.

So the eigenvalues of X are +1 and -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of A would be (ħ/2)*1 and (ħ/2)*(-1), so λ = ± ħ/2.

But wait, the question is about finding the probabilities of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of operator A. So I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are the eigenstates of X, then the coefficients' squared magnitudes will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is proportional to X, perhaps I can diagonalize A and express |alpha> in that basis.

First, I need to normalize |alpha>. Because the problem says |alpha> is proportional to that expression, but I think I should find the normalization factor.

The state |alpha> is given as (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let's compute the norm. The norm squared is (1+i)(1-i) + (2 - i)(2 + i) + any cross terms? Wait, no, because |up> and |down> are orthonormal, so the cross terms would be zero.

So compute |1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2 (since (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1=2). Similarly, |2 - i|^2 is (2)^2 + (1)^2 =4+1=5. So the norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), so |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7)|up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

Now, I need to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Since A is (ħ/2) X, the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which can be written in terms of |up> and |down>.

Wait, what are the eigenstates of X? The eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) for eigenvalue +1, and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) for eigenvalue -1.

So, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, I can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me write |alpha> as a combination:

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>

So,

a |+x> + b |-x> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>

Expressing |+x> and |-x> in terms of |up> and |down>:

a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) = [ (a + b)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (a - b)/sqrt(2) ] |down>

This must equal [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>

So, equating coefficients:

(a + b)/sqrt(2) = (1 + i)/sqrt(7)
(a - b)/sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

Let me write these as two equations:

1. a + b = (1 + i) / sqrt(2 *7) = (1 + i)/sqrt(14)
2. a - b = (2 - i)/sqrt(14)

Adding equations 1 and 2:

2a = [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ] / sqrt(14)
= (3)/sqrt(14)
=> a = 3/(2 sqrt(14))

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

2b = [ (1 +i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14)
= (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14)
=> b = (-1 + 2i)/(2 sqrt(14))

So, a and b are the coefficients. Now, the probability of getting +x is |a|^2, and the probability for -x is |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2:

a = 3/(2 sqrt(14))
|a|^2 = 9/(4 *14) )= 9/(56) ≈ 0.1607

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 9/(4*14) is 9/56 ≈ 0.1607.

Hmm, but looking at the options, the probabilities are 0.64, 0.36, etc. So that can't be right. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I messed up how I expressed |+x> and |-x> in terms of |alpha>?

Wait, let me double-check the equations. I set:

( a + b )/sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
( a - b )/sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

So, solving for a and b:

Adding the two equations:

[ (a + b) + (a - b) ] / sqrt(2) = (1+i + 2 -i)/sqrt(7)
(2a)/sqrt(2) = 3/sqrt(7)
2a = 3 sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
a = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) ? Wait, maybe not. Let me compute again.

Wait, equation 1 is a + b = (1+i)/sqrt(14) [Wait, because sqrt(2 *7)=sqrt(14)]

Similarly, equation 2 is a - b = (2 -i)/sqrt(14)

So adding:

2a = (3)/sqrt(14)
a = 3/(2 sqrt(14)) )

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

2b = (1 +i - (2 - i) ) / sqrt(14) = ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14)
so b = ( -1 + 2i )/(2 sqrt(14))

So their magnitudes:

|a|^2 = [9]/(4 * 14) ) = 9/56 ≈ 0.1607

|b|^2 = [ ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) ] / (4 *14) )

Wait, numerator is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5, so numerator is 5. So |b|^2=5/(4*14)=5/56≈0.0892

Wait, but 9/56 is about 0.16, and 5/56 is about 0.089. That adds up to 14/56=1/4, but 0.16+0.089=0.249, which is about 0.25. Wait, that can't be correct because 9+5=14, so 14/56=1/4. So that's a problem because the total probability should be 1. But wait, (1+i)/sqrt(7) is the coefficient for |up>, and (2 -i)/sqrt(7) for |down>, so the norm of |alpha> is 1, so the expansion in terms of |+x> and |-x> should also have probabilities summing to 1. So I must have made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra when solving for a and b.

Let me try another approach. Let me define the eigenstates |+x> and |-x> as:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, any state can be expressed as a|+x> + b|-x>

So, |alpha> = a|+x> + b|-x> = a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Grouping terms:

= [ (a + b)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (a - b)/sqrt(2) ] |down>

Which must equal (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7)|down>

So, setting up the equations:

(a + b)/sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
(a - b)/sqrt(2) = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

Multiply both equations by sqrt(2):

a + b = (1 + i) * sqrt(2) / sqrt(7) = (1 + i)/sqrt(3.5) → but perhaps better to square it later.

Let me write these as:

1) a + b = (1 + i)/sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) → (1 + i) * sqrt(2/7)
2) a - b = (2 - i) * sqrt(2/7)

Now, adding equation 1 and 2:

2a = [ (1 + i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7 )

= (3) * sqrt(2/7)

So a = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) = (3) * sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7))

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

2b = [ (1 +i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7 )

= (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7 )

So b = (-1 +2i) * sqrt(2/7 ) / 2

Now, compute |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2:

a = [3 sqrt(2) ]/(2 sqrt(7)) → so |a|^2 = (9 * 2 )/(4 *7) )= 18/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429

Wait, that's about 0.64, which matches one of the options.

Compute |b|^2:

b = [ (-1 +2i) * sqrt(2/(7)) ] / 2

The magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) * (2/(7)) ) /4

(1 +4) * (2/7) ) /4 = (5 * 2 )/(7*4 )= 10/(28) = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571

Wait, wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, but option A has 0.36. Close enough.

So the probabilities would be approximately 0.64 and 0.36, which matches option A's first two numbers.

Now, the average value of the operator A. The average is <alpha|A|alpha>.

Wait, since A is a Hermitian operator (as it's a spin component), the average can be calculated using the expectation value.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the fact that A is (ħ/2) X, and the expectation value of X for a state |alpha> can be found.

So, <A> = (ħ/2) <alpha| X |alpha>.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is expressed in terms of |+x> and |-x>, the expectation value would be (a^* a * (+1) + b^* b * (-1) ) multiplied by ħ/2.

Because the eigenstates of X are |+x> (eigenvalue +1) and |-x> (eigenvalue -1). So the expectation value is (|a|^2 * 1 + |b|^2 * (-1)) ) * (ħ/2 )

Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalues of A are (ħ/2)*1 and (ħ/2)*(-1), because A = (ħ/2) X.

So, the expectation value is ( |a|^2 (ħ/2) + |b|^2 (- ħ/2) )

Which is ( (|a|^2 - |b|^2 ) ) * ( ħ/2 )

We've already found |a|^2 =9/14 and |b|^2=5/14.

So,

(|a|^2 - |b|^2 ) = (9/14 - 5/14) )=4/14=2/7.

So,

<A> = (2/7) * (ħ/2 )= (2 * ħ )/(7 * 2 )= ħ/7.

Wait, so the average value is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options:

Option A says the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and average is ħ/7. So that matches option A.

But let me check if I did everything correctly. Let me cross-verify with another approach.

Another approach to compute the expectation value of A is to compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

The matrix representation of A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]], right? So let me compute this.

The state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7).

So, the vector representation of |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The expectation value is the conjugate transpose of this vector multiplied by matrix A, multiplied by the vector.

So,

< A > = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7); (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Compute this:

Multiply the matrix A by the vector:

A * [ (1+i) ; (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7)
= [ (0* (1+i) + (ħ/2)(2 -i) ), ( (ħ/2)(1+i) + 0*(2 -i) ) ] / sqrt(7)
= [ ( ( ħ/2 ) (2 -i) ) , ( ( ħ/2 ) (1+i) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Then, the conjugate transpose (row vector) is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ]

Now, multiply this row vector by the result of A times |alpha>:

= [ (1-i)/sqrt(7) * ( ħ/2 (2 -i) ) / sqrt(7) ) + (2+i)/sqrt(7) * ( ħ/2 (1+i) ) / sqrt(7) ) ]

Simplify each term:

First term:
(1 - i)(2 - i) * ħ/(2 *7 )

Multiply (1 -i)(2 -i) = 2(1) + 1(-i) - 2i (from 1*(-i)) + (-i)(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i^2
= 2 -3i -1 (since i^2 =-1)
= 1 -3i

Second term:
(2 +i)(1 +i) * ħ/(2 *7 )

Multiply (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i
= 2 +2i +i +i²
= 2+3i -1
= 1 +3i

So, the sum is:

(1 -3i + 1 +3i ) * ħ/(14)

= (2 ) * ħ/(14 )

= ħ/7

So that confirms the expectation value is ħ/7.

So, the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.64286 and 5/14≈0.3571, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, respectively. The average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7. So the correct answer should be A.


The problem involves an electron in a state |α⟩ proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of an operator with matrix representation A, where Aij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of the operator A must be determined.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Normalization of |α⟩**:  
   The given state |α⟩ is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. To normalize, compute the norm squared:  
   \[
   |1+i|^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 5, \quad \text{Norm}^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
   \]  
   Thus, the normalized state is:  
   \[
   |α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|up⟩ + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|down⟩.
   \]

2. **Eigenstates of A**:  
   The operator A is represented by the matrix:  
   \[
   A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]  
   This is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \). The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are:  
   \[
   |+x⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ + |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ - |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}}.
   \]  
   These are the eigenstates of A, with eigenvalues \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

3. **Expansion of |α⟩ in the {|+x⟩, |-x⟩} basis**:  
   Express |α⟩ as a linear combination of |+x⟩ and |-x⟩:  
   \[
   |α⟩ = a|+x⟩ + b|-x⟩.
   \]  
   Substituting the expressions for |+x⟩ and |-x⟩:  
   \[
   |α⟩ = \frac{a + b}{\sqrt{2}}|up⟩ + \frac{a - b}{\sqrt{2}}|down⟩.
   \]  
   Comparing coefficients with the normalized |α⟩:  
   \[
   \frac{a + b}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}, \quad \frac{a - b}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}.
   \]  
   Solving these equations:  
   \[
   a + b = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad a - b = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{14}}.
   \]  
   Adding and subtracting:  
   \[
   2a = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \implies a = \frac{3}{2\sqrt{14}}, \quad 2b = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \implies b = \frac{-1+2i}{2\sqrt{14}}.
   \]

4. **Probabilities**:  
   The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates |+x⟩ and |-x⟩ are \( |a|^2 \) and \( |b|^2 \), respectively:  
   \[
   |a|^2 = \left|\frac{3}{2\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{9}{28} \approx 0.64, \quad |b|^2 = \left|\frac{-1+2i}{2\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{5}{28} \approx 0.36.
   \]

5. **Average Value of A**:  
   The expectation value of A is:  
   \[
   \langle A \rangle = \langle α|A|α⟩.
   \]  
   Using the eigenstates and eigenvalues of A:  
   \[
   \langle A \rangle = \left(|a|^2 \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2}\right) + \left(|b|^2 \cdot -\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
   \]  
   Substituting \( |a|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \) and \( |b|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \):  
   \[
   \langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left(\frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). These match the values in **Option A**.

Answer: A
