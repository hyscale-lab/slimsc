Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me go through it slowly.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with KOH in excess. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically forming an alkene. Since it's a dihalide, it should lose two HX molecules (probably HBr here) to form a double bond.

So heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH at 240°C would likely give me an alkene. The product is a light yellow solid, which makes sense because alkenes are often isolable as such, especially if they're conjugated or have some stability. The NMR spectrum of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is around where carbonyl groups (C=O) absorb. Hmm, wait a second—elimination should give an alkene, but there's a carbonyl here. That's confusing. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't just elimination. Let me think again. KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. When dealing with dihalides, another possibility is substitution, but that would likely require a good leaving group and perhaps some solvent. But wait, dibromide with KOH—maybe it's a double substitution. But wait, substitution would typically replace Br with OH groups, but that would give a diol. But the IR has a carbonyl, so that's not it.

Wait, maybe it's an epoxide formation? No, because that usually involves peracids, not KOH. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination? Hofmann elimination is when a quaternary ammonium salt is treated with a strong base, but that doesn't apply here. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-elimination forming a ketone? Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the initial reaction. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so if we eliminate two HBr molecules, we'd form a double bond between carbons 1 and 3. Wait, but that's not adjacent. Oh wait, no: 1,3-dibromo means the Brs are on adjacent carbons? Wait, no, adamantane's structure is a diamondoid structure. Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Brs on adjacent bridgehead carbons.

When KOH is used, it's a strong enough base to eliminate. So two HBr molecules would be lost, but where would the double bond form? Wait, elimination reactions typically form a double bond between the two carbons that were adjacent to the leaving groups. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two Brs and form a double bond between carbons 1 and 2? Or maybe 1 and 3?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure. Each bridgehead is a carbon connected to three others. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine on two bridgehead carbons that are two steps apart. Wait, perhaps I should visualize it. Adamantane has a structure where each bridgehead is part of four-membered rings. So 1 and 3 are across from each other on the same face? Or maybe not—it's a bit confusing.

When you eliminate two HBr molecules, you form a double bond. Since it's 1,3-dibromo, perhaps the elimination leads to a conjugated diene? Or maybe a single double bond. Wait, but the IR showing a carbonyl suggests a ketone or another carbonyl-containing compound.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution
