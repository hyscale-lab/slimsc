Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective field theory that includes all possible operators compatible with the Standard Model's gauge symmetry, SU(2)_L × U(1)_Y. But wait, what about other symmetries like Lorentz, Poincare, etc.?

So, the Standard Model itself respects Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Because SMEFT is built upon the Standard Model, I think all its operators must also respect Poincare symmetry. That would mean both Lorentz (option 1) and Poincare (option 2) are required.

Next, what about the other options, CP and CPT? I know that in the Standard Model, the SM respects CP symmetry only to a certain extent. Wait, no, the SM doesn't automatically respect CP. For example, there's the CKM matrix which leads to CP violation. So in the SM, CP is not necessarily a symmetry, but in SMEFT, I think the operators are allowed to have terms that violate CP unless the operator is protected by some symmetry. Wait, no, the SMEFT doesn't require the operators to conserve CP. Because the low-energy limit is the SM, which can have CP violation. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP. That would mean that CP symmetry (option 3) isn't something that must be respected by all operators. So option 3 is not necessarily required.

Wait, but wait a second. The question is about which symmetries must be respected. So if the SM allows for CP violation, then SMEFT operators can include terms that violate CP. So the operators don't have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not a must; thus, it's not part of the correct answer.

What about CPT symmetry? I remember that all Lorentz-invariant theories must respect CPT symmetry. Because if a theory is Lorentz-invariant, then it's automatically CPT-symmetric. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must respect CPT as well. So option 4 (CPT) is required.

So putting it all together: the operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. But wait, wait. Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So option 1 is Lorentz symmetry, and option 2 is Poincare. So if Poincare is required, does that automatically include Lorentz? Because Poincare includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries.

Wait, but the question lists option 1 as Lorentz and option 2 as Poincare. So what's the deal here. The question is which must be respected by all operators. So if all operators must respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz, then perhaps option 2 (Poincare) implies that option 1 (Lorentz) is also required. So in that case, the correct answer would have both 1 and 2 as required.

Wait, but isn't Poincare symmetry the combination of Lorentz and translation? So if an operator respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz, but if it respects Lorentz, it doesn't necessarily respect Poincare. So in SMEFT, since it's a Lorentz-invariant theory, all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. Also, since it's a Poincare-invariant theory (as the SM is), the operators must respect Poincare as well. So both 1 and 2 are required.

So the correct symmetries are Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. Now, looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4. So that's Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. That matches what I'm thinking.

Wait, but let me make sure. The Standard Model, and hence SMEFT, is built in a way that all operators must respect the Poincare symmetry and Lorentz symmetry. Are there SMEFT operators that don't respect Poincare? No, because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory. So all operators should respect both Lorentz and Poincare.

And since they have to respect Lorentz, they must also respect CPT. Because in any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT is a symmetry. So yes, all operators must respect CPT.

So the correct answer is options 1,2,4. That is, option C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an effective field theory that includes all possible operators compatible with the gauge symmetry of the Standard Model, SU(2)\(_L\) × U(1)\(_Y\). However, SMEFT must also respect certain global symmetries, as these are required for the theory to remain consistent.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry (Option 1):** SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, meaning all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. This is a fundamental requirement for any relativistic field theory.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry (Option 2):** Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since SMEFT is built upon the Standard Model, which respects Poincaré symmetry, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Poincaré symmetry. This implies that Lorentz symmetry (Option 1) is automatically included if Poincaré symmetry is respected.

3. **CP Symmetry (Option 3):** The Standard Model allows for CP violation (e.g., through the CKM matrix). Consequently, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry, as CP violation is permitted in the theory.

4. **CPT Symmetry (Option 4):** All Lorentz-invariant theories, including SMEFT, must respect CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it is guaranteed to respect CPT symmetry as well.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (Option 1), Poincaré symmetry (Option 2), and CPT symmetry (Option 4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
