Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about identifying a product formed from a reaction. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll go as slowly as I can.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction, which is a reaction that reduces ketones to alkanes. Wait, no, wait—Clemmensen uses HCl with red phosphorus on a metal surface, right? Or was that something else? Oh wait, no, the other one is the Wolff-Kishner which uses NH2NH2 and heat, and that's for ketones and aldehydes. Clemmensen is for ketones to alkanes, but using HCl and P. Maybe HI isn't the same. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI could be for a different kind of reaction. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: red phosphorus and HI might be involved in a substitution reaction, like maybe a deoxygenation or a reduction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrohalogenation or elimination. Or maybe it's a case where the compound has a carbonyl group that's getting reduced. So, I should first figure out what Compound X is.

The data given are IR and 1H NMR. Let's look at the IR first. The IR peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch, maybe a carbonyl, and some other groups. Wait, let's list all the peaks: 3400–2500 is a broad region, possibly O-H or maybe an alkyne. 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which is typical for a carbonyl group like a ketone or maybe an ester. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretches. So, combining these, perhaps Compound X has a benzene ring and a carbonyl group, maybe an ester or ketone. The broad peak around 3400 might suggest an acid or an alcohol, but given the 1720, maybe it's an ester since esters have carbonyls around 1720. Or maybe a ketone with an O-H from somewhere else.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a very high chemical shift. Broad singlet. Usually that's an O-H proton, like from a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a broad peak, might it be an -OH group? Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde proton, but that's usually around 9-10 and a triplet or something. Since it's a singlet, maybe it's -OH from a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait: In the IR, 3400-2500 cm-1 is a broad range, which fits an O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. So that supports the idea of a carboxylic acid group. But wait, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak. Wait, carboxylic acids have O-H (broad around 2500-3300) and a carbonyl around 1700. So that fits. So maybe Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative.

So the NMR shows a peak at 10.5, which is probably the -COOH proton. Then, the aromatic region: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted benzene, with two doublets. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzoic acid. Like 4-substituted benzoic acid.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let's try to interpret these.

The 0.9 t (3H) is probably a methyl group attached to a CH2, like a CH2CH2CH3. The 1.4 d (3H) is maybe a CH(CH3) group. Wait, so let me think: 1.4 ppm, doublet, 3H. That's often a methyl group attached to a CH that is next to another CH2 or something. For example, in an isobutyl group.

Wait, let me sketch this. Let me think about the substituents.

The aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene. So, perhaps the substituent is a side chain. So the benzoic acid is at the para position, and there's a chain attached to the ring. Alternatively, the substituent could be a group like a side chain with a carbonyl group. Wait, but the IR shows 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. So perhaps it's an ester or a ketone.

Wait, maybe the compound is a benzophenone derivative, but that's getting away from the data. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a substituted phenyl ketone.

Wait, wait. Let's go back. If the IR shows a strong peak at 1720, that's more likely an ester than a ketone because ketones are usually around 1700-1750, but esters are similar. Wait, but wait, carboxylic acids have lower carbonyl frequencies, around 1700 but stronger absorption, but when in a deprotonated form, but in this case, the IR shows 1720, which is higher than a typical carboxylic acid. So maybe it's an ester. Or perhaps a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, but the 10.5 ppm peak in the NMR is a singlet, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid, because the O-H is a broad peak. Alternatively, maybe a substituted aldehyde, but that's less likely because that's a proton around 9-10, but as I thought earlier, the singlet might suggest a phenolic O-H, but that's usually broader, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton from something else, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR shifts again.

So, the aromatic protons are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So, if it's a para-substituted benzene, the two H's on each adjacent carbon would be as doublets. So for example, in para-methyl benzoic acid, the aromatic protons would be at around 8 and 7.2, which fits with the given data. Let's see:

In para-methyl benzoic acid, the protons ortho to the methyl would be deshielded and appear upfield, but wait, in the case of benzoic acid, the substituent is the COOH. So the ortho and para protons would be deshielded. Wait, in benzoic acid, the proton para to COOH (if there's another substituent) would be a doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is at the para position, and the aromatic protons are split into two doublets.

Let me look at the other NMR signals: the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (m), 1H. Then, 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), 0.9 (t, 3H). Let's try to piece this together.

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) might be a CH(CH3) group. So putting this together: perhaps a CH-CH2-CH3 structure. Wait, like a substituent that's a (CH2) group attached to a CH(CH3) and then a CH2CH3? Hmm, not sure. Let me think about possible substituents.

Alternatively, maybe it's an isobutyl group. Because an isobutyl group has a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3)—no, wait, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, isobutyl is (CH2)2CHCH3? Wait, no, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait more accurately, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3) no, wait, no, wait. Isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)-, but maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: the structure of isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)— no, wait, no. Wait, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? No, that doesn’t fit. Wait, perhaps looking at the substituent as an isobutyl group. Let me think about the NMR signals.

The 0.9 ppm triplet would come from a CH2 group attached to another CH2. So, that would be like CH2CH2CH3. The triplet would come from the CH2 next to the CH3. So that's the terminal CH3.

Then, the 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) would be a methyl group attached to a CH that's next to another group. So maybe the structure is something like CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, that's actually a tert-butyl group, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH(CH3)
