Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on some spectroscopic data. Let's try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might make some mistakes, but I'll think it through carefully.

First, the question gives me information from three different characterization techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. My goal is to match the data to one of the four options provided.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ probably indicates O-H stretching. Broad peaks in that region are often from either alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait—carboxylic acids have a very broad peak because the -OH is acidic and can form hydrogen bonds. So if this peak is very broad, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But then, another possibility is that it's an alcohol, but maybe a less broad peak. Hmm, but the data says it's very broad, which I think is more indicative of a carboxylic acid. 

Then, there are strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. The peak at 1650 could be an aromatic ring (C=C) stretch or maybe an amide, but I don't see any info about amides here. Alternatively, if the compound has conjugated carbonyl groups, maybe like a conjugated ester or something. Wait, but 1650 is lower than a typical carbonyl. Oh wait, the 1700 is probably the main carbonyl, like a ketone or ester. The 1650 could be a conjugated double bond, like in an aromatic ring but more likely an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, which would have a lower wavenumber than a regular carbonyl.

So putting that together, it's possible that the compound has a carboxylic acid group (from the broad O-H) and another carbonyl group, perhaps an ester or ketone, but wait, the 1700 is higher than esters usually are. Wait, wait, actually, esters have carbonyl around 1730-1740 cm⁻¹, while ketones are around 1700. So if the FTIR has a peak at 1700, that might be a ketone. But then, the other peak at 1650 could correspond to something else, maybe a conjugated double bond, like in a vinyl group or an aromatic ring.

But wait, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl refers to CH₂= groups. So the compound has some double bonds, possibly in a conjugated system. Maybe like an enone structure, where there's a conjugated carbonyl and double bond. So perhaps the compound is something like a ketone with a conjugated double bond, or maybe an ester with a conjugated double bond.

Now, looking at the mass spec data. The fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm. 45 is a common mass for a fragment. Let me think: the molecular ion might break apart into smaller fragments. For instance, CH3CO would be 43, but wait, perhaps it's something else. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O, which is 45 (15 for O, 12*2 +3*2 = 12+6=18 → 18+15=33? No, wait, 12*(2) for the two CH3 groups is 24, plus 3*2=6 (Hydrogens), so no, that's not right. Wait, molecular formula of (CH3)2O is C2H6O, which is 2*12 +6 +16 = 24+6+16=46. Hmm, so that's 46. So 45 is one less than that. Maybe a fragment without a hydrogen? Like an O-CH2- group? Alternatively, maybe a CO group.

Wait, another possibility: the m/z 45 could correspond to (CH2)2O, which is 44 (12*2 +4 +16=24+4+16=44), but that's 44. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH3-O-CH2- group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, 45 could be a fragment from a larger molecule. Let me think about the possible options. The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O2.

If the fragment is 45, let's think about possible groups that would give that. Let's calculate the molecular weight of each option:

Option A: C6H12O → 6*12=72 + 12*1=12 +16=80 → 72+12=84 +16=100. So molecular weight is 100.

Option B: C6H10O → 6*12=72 +10=82 +16=88. So molecular weight 88? Wait, no, 72 +10=82 plus 16 is 98. Wait, no, 6*12=72, 10*1=10 → 72+10=82, plus 16=98. So molecular weight 98.

Option C: C6H10O2 → 6*12=72, 10=10, 2*16=32 → 72+10=82 +32=114.

Option D: C6H12O2 → 6*12=72, 12=12 → 84 +32=116.

So the molecular weights are 100, 98, 114, 116.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z 45. So that fragment must be part of the molecule. Let's think about possible fragments.

If the compound is a carboxylic acid with a ketone group, for example, maybe it's something like cyclohexanecarboxylic acid. Wait, but cyclohexanecarboxylic acid would have a molecular formula C7H12O2. Hmm, but the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps it's a simpler structure.

Alternatively, considering the IR absorption for a carbonyl, if there's a conjugated system, maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl, like an acrylic acid derivative. Wait, but let's think about the NMR. The presence of vinyl protons suggests double bonds. So, perhaps the molecule has a conjugated dienone or something similar.

Wait, another approach: looking at the possible molecular formulas. Let's try to find which of these would have a fragment at 45.

Looking at the options, some of them have more oxygen atoms, which could lead to different fragmentations.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight 116. If it breaks into something like (CH2O)2, but that's 44. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is (COOCH3) but that would be 59. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: when you have a carbonyl group and a neighboring group, fragmentation can occur. For example, in esters, the molecule can break at the carbonyl, leading to a fragment with the carbonyl and another part.

Wait, m/z 45—let me think about possible ions. The formula for m/z 45 would be C3H7O. Because the molecular weight is 45. Let's see: 3*12=36 +7=43 +16=59. No, wait, 36+7+16=59. That's more than 45. Hmm, perhaps it's another formula.

Wait, 45 could be C2H5O2? 2*12=24 +5=29 +32=85. No, that's higher.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CO group. The CO group is 28 (12+16), but that's not 45. Wait, COCH3 would be 43 (28 +15=43). Close, but not 45.

Wait, another possible fragment: maybe a methoxy group. But methoxy is OCH3, which is 31. Not 45.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketone group plus something. Wait, acetone is (CH3)2CO, molecular weight is 58. But that's higher than 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is something like CH2CH2O, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a water molecule (18), but that's lower than 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a combination of a carbonyl and a methyl group: like CH3CO, which is 43. But that's close to 45. If the fragment is CH2CO, that's 44. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the IR data again. The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak suggests a carbonyl group, which could be an ester, ketone, or maybe an acid. But the broad peak suggests it's a carboxylic acid. So if it's a carboxylic acid, the formula would have at least two oxygen atoms. So the options with O2 would be A (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2). So B and D have only one O.

So now I can eliminate options B and D because they have only one O. Because the IR shows a broad O-H (carboxylic acid likely), which requires two O's (COOH). So the options are A and C.

Now, looking again at the mass spec. The fragment at m/z 45. Let's see: for option A, C6H12O2. The molecular weight is 116. If the fragment is 45, what could that correspond to?

Well, 45 is a possible mass for a (CH2)2O group. Let's see: (CH₂)₂O would be C2H4O. Molecular weight: (2*12) +4 +16=24+4+16=44. Close but not 45. Alternatively, maybe CH3-O-CH2, but that would be 46 (CH3 is 15, O is 16, CH2 is 14; 15+16+14=45). Wait, 15+16 is 31, plus 14 is 45. So CH3-O-CH2 would have a mass of 45. But that's a fragment. But how would that form?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. That would have a ring structure, and upon fragmentation, it could break to form a smaller fragment, perhaps like a cyclic ether, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, considering the NMR data: vinyl hydrogens present. So the molecule has a double bond, maybe conjugated with a carbonyl.

So, if the compound has a conjugated system, maybe it's something like a cinnamic acid derivative. Cinnamic acid is C9H8O2, but our options are C6, so perhaps a smaller version. Maybe an acrylic acid derivative.

Wait, another thought: if the compound is an ester with a double bond, like methyl acrylate, which is CH2=CHCOOCH3. But that's C5H8O2. Not matching our options. Our options are C6H... O2.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is something like cyclopentene with a substituent. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted cyclohexene with a ketone or ester group.

Wait, another approach: looking at the degrees of unsaturation. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since we don't have X or N, it's (2C +2 - H - O)/2, because O is considered as a substituent.

Let me compute it for each option:

Option A: C6H12O2. C=6, H=12, O=2. So, (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 → (14 -12)/2 = 2/2 = 1. So one degree of unsaturation. That could be a ring or a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. (2*6 +2 -10)/2 → (14-10)/2=4/2=2. Two degrees: could be two double bonds, or a ring and a double bond.

Given that the NMR shows vinyl protons, there's at least one double bond (so at least one degree of unsaturation). The IR has a carbonyl group, which is another degree. So that would require two degrees of unsaturation, meaning the formula must have at least two. So option A has only one, which would be insufficient because we have a carbonyl (one) and a double bond (another), making two. So wait, option A: C6H12O2. Its degrees of unsaturation is 1. But if the compound has both a carbonyl and a double bond, that requires two. So that suggests that option A is not possible. So that would eliminate option A, leaving us with option C.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 → (14-10)/2= 4/2=2. So two degrees: could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a triple bond and a ring, etc.

So let's think again: the FTIR shows a broad O-H (carboxylic acid, probably), a carbonyl at 1700, and another peak at 1650. NMR has vinyl H. So structure possibilities: perhaps a substituted acrylic acid, like CH₂=CHCOOH (but that's C3H4O2, molecular weight 76. Doesn't match our options). So maybe a larger structure with a conjugated double bond and a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another structure: maybe something like cyclohexene carboxylic acid. But that would have the formula C7H10O2, which isn't one of the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester, a lactone. But that would have a ring structure. Let me think: for a six-carbon lactone, like delta-valerolactone, but that's five-membered. Hmm, perhaps a six-membered lactone would have the formula C6H10O2. Which matches option C.

Wait, if it's a lactone, the structure would have a cyclic ester, which is a ring with a carbonyl group. The IR would show the ester carbonyl (around 1700 cm⁻¹), but wait, esters usually have higher wavenumbers, around 1740. Hmm, but the given IR shows 1700, which is about the value for a ketone, not an ester. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, the compound could be a beta-keto acid. For example, something like CH₂(CO2H)CH₂CH₂CH₂CH3. Wait, but that's more carbons than our options. Or perhaps a smaller molecule with the conjugated system.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. For example, acrylic acid, which is CH₂=CHCOOH, but that's three carbons. But perhaps a longer chain with conjugated groups. But in that case, the IR would show the conjugated carbonyl, which might appear at a lower wavenumber, like around 1650, which matches the data. So the 1700 peak would be from another carbonyl, maybe an ester or another group.

Wait, but if the compound has two carbonyl groups, that might complicate things. Let me think: the FTIR shows two strong peaks, 1700 and 1650. If the 1700 is a ketone and the 1650 is a conjugated double bond, but then where is the O-H from the carboxylic acid?

Wait, maybe the O-H is the broad peak, the 1700 is an ester or ketone, and the 1650 is an aromatic ring. But earlier, I thought the 1650 could be a conjugated double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl protons, which are on a double bond, not necessarily aromatic. So perhaps an enone structure, where the double bond is conjugated with a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: the compound could be a dienone, with a conjugated diene and a ketone. But that would require more double bonds, which may fit with the degrees of unsaturation.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ketone with a double bond. But combining that with the O-H from the IR data is tricky.

Let me go back to the mass spec. The fragment at m/z 45. So the molecular formula must have a part that adds up to 45. For option C, the formula is C6H10O2. So maybe the molecule can break into a fragment of C3H7O2? Wait, that would have a molecular weight of (3*12)+(7)+(32) = 36+7+32=75. Not 45.

Wait, another angle: the fragment could be a common ion. For example, if the molecule has a benzene ring, but the options don't have C6H...O with benzene. Wait, no, C6H...O could be benzene derivatives. Wait, benzene is C6H6. So if the molecule is something like phenylacetic acid, which is C8H8O2, but that's not one of the options either.

Hmm, perhaps the fragment is a CH2CH2O group, but that's 44. Alternatively, maybe it's a COOH group breaking off. Wait, COOH has a molecular weight of 44 (12+16+16+1=45? Wait, COOH is CHO₂H: 12 + 16*2 + 1= 12+32+1=45. Oh! So the fragment could be a COOH group, which is 45. So if the molecule has a COOH group, upon fragmentation, it could lose that group and have a fragment at m/z 45.

So if the compound is a COOH with another group, like an ester or a ketone, then the mass spec would show a fragment at 45. For example, if it's a substituted acrylic acid, like CH₂=CHCOOH (but that's C3H4O2, which doesn't fit the options). Alternatively, perhaps a larger molecule.

Wait, considering option C: C6H10O2. If the compound is a beta-keto acid, maybe something like CH₂(CO)CH₂CH₂COOH. But that's five carbons. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond. Wait, but earlier I thought that the IR would show a higher wavenumber for an ester.

Wait, let me think about each possibility.

Option C is C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation 2: could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

If the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone), the structure would be a ring with an ester group. The carbonyl in a lactone is typically around 1750 cm⁻¹, but in the IR, the peak is at 1700, which is lower. Could that be possible if it's a conjugated ester? Or perhaps it's not an ester but a ketone.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. Structure like CH₂=CH-CO-OH. Wait, that would be C4H6O2. Doesn't fit our options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CO-OH. That would be C6H10O2. Yes! That fits option C. So the structure has a conjugated double bond (CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-) and a carboxylic acid group (COOH).

So in the FTIR, the broad peak is the O-H from the carboxylic acid. The 1700 cm⁻¹ is the carbonyl from the acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids typically have their carbonyl around 1700 cm⁻¹? Or is it lower? Wait, I think esters have higher wavenumbers (around 1740), while carboxylic acids are around 1700. So that fits.

The 1650 cm⁻¹ could be the conjugated double bond (the CH₂=CH part). The presence of vinyl protons in the NMR also supports this structure.

Now, the mass spec. When such a compound breaks apart, it could lose the COOH group as a fragment. The COOH group has a mass of 45 (because COOH is CHO₂H: 12 + 16*2 + 1 = 45). So the fragment at m/z 45 is likely the COOH group.

Putting it all together: the compound has a conjugated double bond (so vinyl protons in NMR), a carboxylic acid group (broad O-H and COOH carbonyl), and the formula is C6H10O2. So option C is the correct answer.


The unknown compound is analyzed using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicative of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid due to the broad nature of the peak. Two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of a carbonyl group and a conjugated double bond, respectively. The ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the presence of vinyl hydrogens, indicating a double bond in the structure. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45, which corresponds to the molecular weight of a COOH group.

To determine the chemical formula, the degrees of unsaturation are calculated for each option:

- **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 1. This is insufficient to account for both the carbonyl group and the double bond, as both contribute to degrees of unsaturation.
- **Option B (C₆H₁₀O)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 2. However, this formula contains only one oxygen atom, which is inconsistent with the broad O-H peak in the FTIR spectrum, suggesting the presence of a carboxylic acid (which requires two oxygen atoms).
- **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 2. This formula accounts for both the carbonyl group and the double bond. The structure could be an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid, such as CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, which matches the spectroscopic data. The fragment peak at m/z = 45 corresponds to the COOH group.
- **Option D (C₆H₁₂O)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 1. Similar to Option A, this is insufficient to account for both the carbonyl group and the double bond.

Based on the spectroscopic data and the analysis of the molecular formulas, the compound is identified as **C₆H₁₀O₂**.

Answer: C
