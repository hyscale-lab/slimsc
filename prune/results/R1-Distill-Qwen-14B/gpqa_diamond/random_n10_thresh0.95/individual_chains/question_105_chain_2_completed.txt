Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, but with some spots on one hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler, I suppose, because they have a temperature difference of 1000K. Wait, the problem says the spots have a temperature difference of 1000K. Hmm, does that mean the spots are 5000K or 7000K? Oh wait, wait, no, the star's Teff is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. So spots are 5000K. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing changes in brightness. But the problem says that this can be mistaken for an exoplanet because the brightness variation is similar to what we'd see when a planet transits the star.

The question is, what would be the radius of an exoplanet (relative to the star) needed to produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots? So, we're comparing the brightness variation caused by the planet transit to the variation caused by the spots.

First, let's think about what causes the brightness changes. When a planet transits the star, it blocks some of the star's light. The amount of light blocked depends on the area of the planet compared to the star. The flux drop is proportional to (Rp / Rstar)^2, I think. So the depth of the transit is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Now, the star has spots. The spots are cooler, so when they are on the visible side, they emit less light. The filling factor is 20%, which I think is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So, the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. So the total area of spots is 20% of half the star's surface.

Wait, the star's surface area is 4πR². One hemisphere is 2πR². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R². So the area of the spots is 0.4π R².

But since the star is a sphere, the spots are on one side. When the star rotates, the spots come into view as seen from Earth (assuming we're observing from that direction). So the brightness variation would be due to the spots' temperature difference compared to the rest of the star.

So, the flux from the star when spots are visible is lower than when the spots are on the far side. The change in flux depends on the area of the spots and the temperature difference.

The flux from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR² σ Teff^4. So the total flux from the star is proportional to R² Teff^4.

When a spot is present on the hemisphere facing us, the flux from that area is less. The flux from the spot is σ T_spot², per unit area, while the normal flux is σ Teff^4. Wait, no, the flux per unit area from a spot is σ T_spot^4. Because each square meter emits σ T^4. So, the change in flux when a spot is present would be the area of the spot times the difference between the star's flux and the spot's flux.

The spot's area is 0.4π R², as calculated earlier. The flux difference per unit area is (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) * σ. Because when the spot is not there, the flux from that area is σ Teff^4, but when the spot is there, it's σ T_spot^4. So the difference is (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) σ.

Wait, but the star's radius is the same as the Sun, so R is R_sun. The Teff is 6000 K, and the spots are 5000 K. So the difference in flux per unit area is (6000^4 - 5000^4) * σ.

But to find the overall change in flux when the spots rotate into view, the total change in flux would be the area of the spots multiplied by the per unit area difference, and then divided by the total area of the star, because the star's total flux is proportional to its area.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the fractional change in flux. The star's total flux is F = σ Teff^4. The spots contribute less flux. When the spots are on the side we see, the total flux is F_total = F * (1 - (A_spot / A_total) * (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)) ).

Wait, no. Let me think again. The entire star emits F = σ Teff^4. The area of the spots is A_spot. So the total flux when the spots are visible is F_total = F * (1 - (A_spot / A_star) * ( (T_spot^4) / (Teff^4) )) ) ?

Wait, no. Because for the spots, the flux per unit area is lower. So, the total flux when the spots are visible is F * (1 - (A_spot / A_star) * ( (T_spot^4 - Teff^4) / Teff^4 )) )

Wait, maybe the change in flux is (A_spot / A_star) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4.

Alternatively, another approach: the star's total flux is F = σ Teff^4. The spots have a lower flux, so each spot emits σ T_spot^4 per unit area.

So the total flux when the spots are visible is F = (A_clean / A_total) * σ Teff^4 + (A_spot / A_total) * σ T_spot^4.

So the fractional change in flux is [F - F0]/F0, where F0 is the flux when no spots are visible (i.e., all the area is at Teff).

So F0 = A_total σ Teff^4.

F = (A_clean * σ Teff^4 + A_spot * σ T_spot^4) / A_total.

So F = σ [ (A_clean Teff^4 + A_spot T_spot^4 ) / A_total ].

Then, the fractional change is (F - F0)/F0 = [ ( (A_clean Teff^4 + A_spot T_spot^4 ) / A_total ) - Teff^4 ] / Teff^4.

Simplify this: [ (A_clean Teff^4 + A_spot T_spot^4 - Teff^4 A_total ) / A_total ] / Teff^4.

The numerator is Teff^4 (A_clean - A_total) + A_spot T_spot^4.

But A_clean = A_total - A_spot.

So, substituting, numerator becomes Teff^4 (A_total - A_spot - A_total) + A_spot T_spot^4 = -Teff^4 A_spot + A_spot T_spot^4 = A_spot (T_spot^4 - Teff^4).

So fractional change is [ A_spot (T_spot^4 - Teff^4) / (A_total) ] / (Teff^4) ) = [ A_spot (T_spot^4 - Teff^4) ] / (A_total Teff^4 ).

But since T_spot is lower, T_spot^4 - Teff^4 is negative, so the fractional change is negative, implying a decrease in flux.

The magnitude of the fractional change is (A_spot * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)) / (A_total Teff^4 ) = (A_spot / A_total) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4.

So the fractional change in flux is (A_spot / A_total) * ( (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / Teff^4 )

Which can be written as (F_spot) = (A_spot / A_total) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) )

Because (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)/Teff^4 = 1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )

So, the fractional change in flux is (F_spot) = (A_spot / A_total) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) )

Now, the area of the spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area), which is half the star's surface. So the hemisphere area is 2π R². So A_spot = 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

The total area of the star is 4π R².

So, A_spot / A_total = (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R² ) ) = 0.4 / 4 = 0.1.

So that term is 0.1.

Next, compute (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )):

T_spot = 5000 K.

So T_spot^4 = 5000^4 = (5e3)^4.

Teff^4 = 6000^4 = (6e3)^4.

So, T_spot^4 / Teff^4 = (5/6)^4.

(5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 ≈ 0.517747.

So F_spot = 0.1 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.05177.

But wait, this is the fractional change in flux when the spots are visible. So the maximum depth of the light curve due to the spots would be approximately 5.177% (about 5.18%).

Wait, but wait, this is when the entire hemisphere of spots is facing us, right? Because the spots are on a single hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view, but only part of the time. Hmm, but the problem says that the brightness variation is due to rotational modulation, which is why it's similar to a planet transit.

Wait, but when the spots are on the far side, they are not visible, so the flux would be the same as the star without spots (F0). When the spots rotate into view, the flux drops by F_spot. So the amplitude (depth) of the variation is F_spot, which is 0.05177, about 5.18%.

But wait, the star's light curve would vary as the spots rotate into and out of view. The amplitude of the variation would be about F_spot, but perhaps that's the maximum dip, so the same as the transit depth for a planet.

So the question is, what would be the radius of an exoplanet that causes a transit depth of 5.18%?

Wait, no. Because the star's radius is R, the planet's radius is Rp. The transit depth is (Rp/R)^2.

So, if the depth is approximately 5.18%, then (Rp/R)^2 = 0.05177.

Taking the square root: Rp/R = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275, or about 0.228.

But wait, none of the options are near 0.23. Let me check the options again.

Options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Wait, none of these are near 0.23. Hmm. So perhaps I've made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, let me go back. What's the scenario? The star has one hemisphere with spots, and the other hemisphere is spot-free. So when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. But since the spots are only on one hemisphere, the maximum amount of spots visible is 100% of the spots, i.e., when that hemisphere is fully facing us.

Wait, no. Wait, the star is rotating, so only the spots on the hemisphere that is facing us can be seen. So when the star is in a certain orientation, the spots are fully visible, leading to maximum dip. When the star rotates 180 degrees, the spot hemisphere is on the far side, so no spots are visible, and the flux is at maximum.

So the dip when the spots are fully visible is F_spot = 0.1 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.05177 or 5.177%.

Wait, that's the same as before. So the amplitude is about 5.18% dip in brightness.

So an exoplanet's transit amplitude would be (Rp/Rstar)^2, which needs to be equal to 0.05177.

So (Rp/Rstar) = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275. So approximately 0.23.

But the options don't include that. Hmm. So perhaps I've made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the area of the spots. Let me recheck the initial steps.

The filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere. So one hemisphere is 2π R². The area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So A_spot / A_total = 0.4 π R² / (4 π R²) ) = 0.4 /4 = 0.1. So that's correct.

Another thing: perhaps the temperature of the spots is higher, but that doesn't make sense. Because starspots are cooler regions, so T_spot is lower than Teff. So that part is correct.

Wait, maybe I should consider that when the spots are on the near side, the star's flux is reduced, but when the spots are on the far side, everything is normal. So the variation in brightness is the same as the maximum dip, which is F_spot. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the variation in brightness when the star rotates is the difference between when the spots are on the near side and the far side. So the amplitude is the change in flux when the spots come into view.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star is only showing the spotty hemisphere when it's in a certain position. So the maximum dip is F_spot, which is 0.05177.

Hmm, but the options don't have anything near 0.23. Let me look again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculate the fractional change.

Wait, wait, perhaps the calculation is different. Because, when the spots are on the near side, the flux is F = F0 * (1 - F_spot ). So the change is a dip of F_spot * F0. So the amplitude is F_spot.

Wait, but let me think again. For a planet transit, the amplitude is (Rp/Rstar)^2, which is the fractional area blocked. So if the spots cause a dip of 5.18%, then the planet would need to have (Rp/R)^2 = 0.0518.

But maybe I should compute the actual flux variation due to the spots.

Wait, another approach: the flux from the spots when they are visible is (area of spots) * (T_spot^4 / Teff^4). So the change in flux is (A_spot / A_total) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4.

So, 0.1 * (6^4 -5^4)/(6^4) = 0.1 * (1296 - 625)/1296 = 0.1 * 671/1296 = 0.1 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.05177, same as before.

So the fractional change is about 5.177% dip.

So the planet's transit should cause the same dip. So (Rp/R)^2 = 0.05177. So Rp/R ≈ sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275, about 0.23.

But none of the options are near 0.23. Hmm.

Wait, the options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (Rp/R) = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.227. So approximately 0.23. But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is not about the maximum dip but about the average brightness variation.

Wait, the star is rotating, so only a part of the spots is visible at any time. Wait, no, the problem states that the star's one hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. So when the star rotates, the entire hemisphere (with spots) comes into view, so the maximum dip is when all the spots are visible. So the dip is 5.18%.

So the planet's transit needs to cause the same dip. So the planet's radius should satisfy (Rp/R)^2 = 0.05177.

Hmm. So Rp/R is sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the mistake is that I'm computing the dip as (Rp/R)^2, but perhaps the actual dip is different.

Wait, another possibility: the star's brightness variation is not the dip but the peak-to-peak variation. Wait, no, because the star's brightness is lower when the spots are visible, so the dip is the key.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the variation on the entire light curve, including the rise and fall, but I'm not sure that affects the amplitude calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the flux from the star as the sum of the flux from the spotted and unspotted regions, considering the rotation. Wait, but when the star is rotating, only a portion of the spotted hemisphere is visible. No, wait, the problem says "only one hemisphere is spotty". So when we're looking at the star, either we see the spotty hemisphere or the non-spotty one. So the dip is the maximum when the spotty hemisphere is entirely in view.

Wait, another mistake: perhaps the star's total surface area is 4π R², but the hemisphere is 2π R², so the filling factor is 20% of that. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the fraction of the star's surface that is spots is 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1, which is the same as we had before.

So the calculation remains the same.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's effective temperature includes the spots. No, the effective temperature of the star is given as 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So the star's overall Teff isn't affected by the spots; the spots are cooler regions on the star's surface.

So perhaps when calculating the flux, the spots are part of the star, so the star's total flux would change when spots are visible. So the dip is indeed as calculated before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star isn't a blackbody, but for the sake of the problem, we're assuming it is. So the approach is correct.

Hmm. Now, I'm a bit stuck because none of the options match the expected 0.23. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the fractional change.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total flux from the spots and the rest of the star.

Total flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible: F = (A_non_spots * Teff^4 + A_spots * T_spot^4 ) / A_total.

But A_non_spots is the area of the non-spotty part of the hemisphere, which is 0.8 * 2π R² = 1.6 π R².

Wait, no, the entire star has two hemispheres. One hemisphere is 2π R², and 20% of it is spots. So the other hemisphere is completely unspotted, right? Because the problem says only one hemisphere is covered.

So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is from the 20% spotted area and 80% non-spotted area of that hemisphere, plus the entire other hemisphere, which is spot-free.

Wait, wait, no. Let me clarify: the star has two hemispheres. One has spots covering 20% of its area (so 20% of 2π R²), and the other is entirely unspotted (so 100% of 2π R²). When the star rotates such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux comes from the spotty 20% and the entire non-spotty 2π R², plus the other hemisphere's non-spotty area.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of the star as a sphere. The total surface area is 4π R². One hemisphere (2π R²) has 20% of its area covered by spots. So the area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². The rest of the spotty hemisphere (0.8 * 2π R² = 1.6 π R²) is at Teff. The other hemisphere (non-spotty) is all at Teff, so 2π R².

So when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux comes from:

- Spots: 0.4 π R² * σ (5000)^4
- Non-spotty parts of the spotty hemisphere: 1.6 π R² * σ (6000)^4
- Non-spotty hemisphere: 2 π R² * σ (6000)^4

Total flux when spotty hemisphere is visible: 

F_visible = (0.4 π R² * 5000^4 + 1.6 π R² *6000^4 + 2 π R² *6000^4) * σ

= σ [ (0.4 *5000^4 + (1.6 + 2)*6000^4 ) * π R² ]

Wait, that's not correct. Because the entire star's surface is 4π R². Wait, when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, we can see both hemispheres: the spotty one and the non-spotty one. No, no, wait. The star is a sphere. When we look at it, we see only the hemisphere that is facing us. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the visible area is the spotty hemisphere (2π R²), and the far side is the non-spotty hemisphere.

Wait, no. The star's surface is a sphere, and when you look at it, you see the near side (hemisphere) and the far side is not visible. So when the spotty hemisphere is the one facing us, the visible area is the spotty hemisphere (2π R²), which has 0.4π R² of spots and 1.6π R² of normal surface.

When the star rotates so that the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, the entire visible area (2π R²) is normal, no spots.

So when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

F_visible = (0.4 π R² * σ (5000)^4) + (1.6 π R² * σ (6000)^4 )

= σ π R² [ 0.4 (5000^4) + 1.6 (6000^4) ]

Divide by the total area of the star (4π R²) to get the average flux per unit area?

Wait, no, we're looking at the flux from the visible hemisphere when the spotty side is facing us. So the flux is just the sum from that hemisphere.

But the total flux without any spots (F0) would be when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing, so 2π R² * σ (6000^4).

So the flux when spotty hemisphere is visible is:

F_visible = [0.4 *5000^4 + 1.6 *6000^4 ] * σ π R².

Wait, but the total flux without any spots (F0) is when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, which is:

F0 = [2 *6000^4 ] * σ π R².

So the fractional change is (F_visible - F0) / F0.

Compute F_visible:

= σ π R² [0.4*(5e3)^4 + 1.6*(6e3)^4 ]

= σ π R² [0.4*(625e12) + 1.6*(1296e12) ]

Wait, 5e3^4 = (5^4)*(1e3)^4) = 625 * 1e12 = 6.25e13? Wait, actually, 5000^4 is (5e3)^4 = 5^4 * 1e12 = 625 * 1e12 = 6.25e14? Wait, 1e3^4 is 1e12. So 5000^4 = 5^4 * (1e3)^4 = 625 * 1e12 = 6.25e14.

Similarly, 6000^4 = 6^4 *1e12 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

So,

F_visible = σ π R² [0.4 * 6.25e14 + 1.6 * 1.296e15 ]

= σ π R² [ 2.5e14 + 2.0736e15 ]

= σ π R² [ 2.5e14 + 20.736e14 ] = σ π R² (23.236e14 )

F0 = σ π R² [2 * 1.296e15 ] = σ π R² (2.592e15 )

So F_visible is 2.3236e15 σ π R².

F0 is 2.592e15 σ π R².

So fractional change is (2.3236e15 - 2.592e15 ) / 2.592e15 = (-0.2684e15) / 2.592e15 ≈ -0.1035.

So the fractional change is about -10.35%? Wait, that's a bigger dip than before.

Wait, wait, wait, I think I messed up some calculations because 0.4 *6.25e14 is 2.5e14, and 1.6 *1.296e15 is 2.0736e15.

Adding them: 2.5e14 + 2.0736e15 = 2.5e14 + 20.736e14 = 23.236e14.

F0 is 2 *1.296e15 = 2.592e15.

So F_visible = 2.3236e15, F0 = 2.592e15.

Fractional change: (2.3236e15 - 2.592e15 ) / 2.592e15 = (-0.2684e15 ) / 2.592e15 ≈ -0.1035, so about -10.35%.

Wait, that makes a lot more sense. So the dip is about 10.35% when the spotty hemisphere is visible. That's much larger than the previous 5.18% I thought earlier.

Hmm, so where did I go wrong before? Oh wait, I think I made a mistake in considering the total area. Earlier, I thought that the entire star's flux is considered, but when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, only that hemisphere's flux is seen. So when the hemisphere is the spotty one, the flux is from that hemisphere, which includes both the spotted and non-spotted parts of that hemisphere.

So the correct approach is to compute the flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible, subtract the flux when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, and find the fractional change.

So the fractional change is (F_visible - F0)/F0, where F_visible is the flux from the spotty hemisphere, and F0 is the flux from the non-spotty hemisphere.

So in this case, the dip is about 10.35%.

So the amplitude of the light curve is about 10.35%.

Wait, but if the planet transit causes the same amplitude, then (Rp/R)^2 = 0.1035.

So Rp/R = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217, approximately 0.32, which is option D.

Ah, that's one of the options. So the correct answer is D.

Wait, let me double-check the numbers.

Compute F_visible:

0.4 *5000^4 = 0.4 * 6.25e14 = 2.5e14.

1.6 *6000^4 = 1.6 * 1.296e15 = 2.0736e15.

F_visible = 2.5e14 + 2.0736e15 = 2.3236e15.

F0 = 2 *6000^4 = 2 *1.296e15 = 2.592e15.

F_visible - F0 = 2.3236e15 - 2.592e15 = -2.684e14.

Fractional change: (-2.684e14) / 2.592e15 ≈ -0.1035, or -10.35%.

So the amplitude is about 10.35%.

So the planet would need to have (Rp/R)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/R ≈ 0.3217.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

So the correct answer is D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's spotted hemisphere, we analyze the fractional change in flux caused by the spots and compare it to the transit depth caused by a planet.

### Key Parameters:
- **Star's effective temperature**: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \)
- **Spot temperature**: \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \) (cooler by \( 1000 \, \text{K} \))
- **Filling factor**: \( 20\% \) of one hemisphere is covered by spots.
- **Star's surface area**: \( A_{\text{total}} = 4\pi R^2 \)
- **Hemisphere area**: \( A_{\text{hemisphere}} = 2\pi R^2 \)
- **Area of spots**: \( A_{\text{spot}} = 0.2 \times 2\pi R^2 = 0.4\pi R^2 \)

### Step 1: Fractional Change in Flux Due to Spots
The flux from a surface is proportional to \( T^4 \). The total flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is:

\[
F_{\text{visible}} = \left( A_{\text{non-spot}} \cdot T_{\text{eff}}^4 + A_{\text{spot}} \cdot T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right) \cdot \sigma
\]

where:
- \( A_{\text{non-spot}} = A_{\text{hemisphere}} - A_{\text{spot}} = 2\pi R^2 - 0.4\pi R^2 = 1.6\pi R^2 \)
- \( A_{\text{spot}} = 0.4\pi R^2 \)

Substituting values:
\[
F_{\text{visible}} = \sigma \pi R^2 \left[ 1.6 \cdot 6000^4 + 0.4 \cdot 5000^4 \right]
\]

The flux when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible (baseline flux, \( F_0 \)) is:
\[
F_0 = \sigma \pi R^2 \cdot 2 \cdot 6000^4
\]

The fractional change in flux is:
\[
\frac{F_{\text{visible}} - F_0}{F_0} = \frac{\sigma \pi R^2 \left[ 1.6 \cdot 6000^4 + 0.4 \cdot 5000^4 - 2 \cdot 6000^4 \right]}{\sigma \pi R^2 \cdot 2 \cdot 6000^4}
\]

Simplify:
\[
\frac{F_{\text{visible}} - F_0}{F_0} = \frac{1.6 \cdot 6000^4 + 0.4 \cdot 5000^4 - 2 \cdot 6000^4}{2 \cdot 6000^4}
\]

\[
= \frac{-0.4 \cdot 6000^4 + 0.4 \cdot 5000^4}{2 \cdot 6000^4}
\]

\[
= \frac{0.4 \cdot (5000^4 - 6000^4)}{2 \cdot 6000^4}
\]

Substitute \( 5000^4 = 625 \times 10^{12} \) and \( 6000^4 = 1296 \times 10^{12} \):
\[
= \frac{0.4 \cdot (625 - 1296)}{2 \cdot 1296}
\]

\[
= \frac{0.4 \cdot (-671)}{2592}
\]

\[
= \frac{-268.4}{2592} \approx -0.1035
\]

Thus, the fractional change in flux is approximately \( -10.35\% \), meaning the flux decreases by \( 10.35\% \) when the spotty hemisphere is visible.

### Step 2: Radius of the Exoplanet
The transit depth caused by a planet is proportional to \( \left( \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 \). To match the flux variation of \( 10.35\% \), we set:
\[
\left( \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1035
\]

\[
\frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3217
\]

### Step 3: Compare with Options
The closest option to \( 0.3217 \) is \( 0.32 \), which corresponds to **Option D**.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: D**
