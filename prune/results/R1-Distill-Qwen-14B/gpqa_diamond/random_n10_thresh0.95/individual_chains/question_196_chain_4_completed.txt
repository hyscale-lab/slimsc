Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but let me think through it.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of a mass in a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A, and it obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. Oh right, and the speed of light is c.

Wait, in non-relativistic cases, the maximum velocity of a harmonic oscillator happens when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², right? So then the non-relativistic speed would be v = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But this is a relativistic problem, so things are different.

In relativity, energy isn't just kinetic; there's rest mass energy too. The total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (x=A), all its energy is potential. But when it passes through the equilibrium point, all the energy is kinetic. Oh wait, no, wait: in the harmonic oscillator, the potential is (1/2)kx². So at x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. At x=0, the kinetic energy is maximum, but wait, no—that's in the non-relativistic case. But in relativity, the kinetic energy is different.

Wait, but wait, in relativistic situations, the energy isn't just (1/2)mv². It's higher because of the gamma factor. So the total energy E must be conserved, but the kinetic energy is (gamma -1)mc².

Wait, no, wait. Relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy E is gamma mc². But in the case of the harmonic oscillator, when the mass is at maximum displacement x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A². So E = (1/2)k A² + mc². Because when the mass is at rest (v=0), the total energy is the sum of rest energy and potential energy.

Wait, no, wait again. If the oscillator is at rest at x=A, is that the case? No, because in classical mechanics, the oscillator is in motion, so the maximum displacement is where the potential is maximum, and the kinetic is zero. But in reality, even in the maximum displacement, the mass is moving with velocity zero, so v=0 there. So at x=A, the velocity is zero. So the kinetic energy is zero, and the potential is (1/2)k A². So the total energy E is (1/2)k A², plus the rest energy? Wait, no, because in the non-relativistic case, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. So in the relativistic case, the total energy would be the sum of the rest energy and the potential plus kinetic. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to model the situation as the total energy being the sum of the potential energy and the total relativistic energy of the mass. Wait, no. The total energy of the system is the sum of the oscillator's potential energy and the mass's relativistic energy. So when the mass is at its maximum displacement A, its velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy E is (1/2)k A² + mc², because mc² is the rest energy. But wait, if the mass is at rest, its total energy is mc². But if it's in a potential well, does the potential add to the energy? Or is that part of the system's potential energy.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should approach this step by step.

In a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)k x². The mass is moving under this potential. In the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is conserved. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So the total energy, including the rest mass energy, is gamma mc². But also, the oscillator's potential energy is part of the system. So the total energy E is the sum of the oscillator's potential energy and the relativistic energy of the mass.

So when the mass is at x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A². The velocity is zero, so its kinetic energy is zero, so the mass's energy is just mc². So the total energy E is (1/2)k A² + mc².

When the mass passes through x=0, its displacement is zero, so the potential energy is zero. All the energy is now kinetic (relativistic). So at that point, the mass's total energy is gamma mc², and the potential energy is zero. So the total energy is gamma mc².

But wait, the total energy must be the same in both cases. So:

E = (1/2)k A² + mc² = gamma mc².

So, gamma = [ (1/2)k A² + mc² ] / (mc² )

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me write that as:

gamma = 1 + (k A²) / (2 m c² )

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Because (1/2 k A²)/(m c²) times 2m c² would be the numerator. Wait, no:

Wait, (1/2 k A²) + mc² is E, which is gamma mc². So:

gamma = [ (1/2 k A²) + mc² ] / mc² = (k A²)/(2 m c²) + 1.

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

But wait, wait—gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so I can solve for v.

So, gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) as some term, say, beta. So beta = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Then gamma = 1 + beta.

So 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + beta.

Squaring both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + beta)^2.

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + beta)^2.

Rearranging:

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + beta)^2.

So,

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + beta)^2 ]

= c² [ ( (1 + beta)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + beta)^2 ) ]

Expanding (1 + beta)^2: 1 + 2 beta + beta^2.

So,

v² = c² [ (2 beta + beta² ) / (1 + beta)^2 ]

But since beta is (k A^2)/(2 m c² ), which might be small? Not necessarily, but let's proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in E. Because in the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc². So when the mass is at x=A, the potential is (1/2)k A², and the mass's energy is mc². So E = (1/2)k A² + mc². When it's at x=0, the potential is zero, and the mass's energy is gamma mc². So E = gamma mc².

So,

gamma mc² = (1/2)k A² + mc².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

Which brings us back to the same equation I had before.

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

But wait, this is only valid if (k A²)/(2 m c² ) is positive and not too large, but for small amplitudes, perhaps it's acceptable.

So from gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ), and gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

So let me solve for v.

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Let me denote delta = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + delta.

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + delta)^2.

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + delta)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + delta)^2.

So,

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + delta)^2 ]

Factor out 1/(1 + delta)^2:

v² = c² [ ( (1 + delta)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + delta)^2 ) ]

Expanding (1 + delta)^2 -1:

1 + 2 delta + delta^2 - 1 = 2 delta + delta^2.

So,

v² = c² [ (2 delta + delta^2) / (1 + delta)^2 )

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated, but perhaps we can approximate for small delta, but the problem doesn't say it's a small amplitude. So perhaps we need to find an expression in terms of delta.

Alternatively, maybe we can factor the numerator and denominator.

Wait, denominator is (1 + delta)^2. Numerator is delta (2 + delta).

Hmm, perhaps leave it as it is for now.

So,

v² = c² ( delta (2 + delta) ) / (1 + delta)^2 )

But delta is (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So plugging that back in:

v² = c² [ ( (k A²)/(2 m c² ) ) ( 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ) ) ) / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 ]

Let me simplify:

The numerator inside the big fraction is:

[ (k A²)/(2 m c² ) ) * (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )) ]

Let me compute this:

= (k A²)/(2 m c² ) * [ 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ) ]

= (k A²)/(2 m c² ) * [ (4 m c² + k A²) ) / (2 m c² ) ]

Wait, because 2 is 2 * (2 m c²)/(2 m c²) )= 4 m c²/(2 m c²). Wait, perhaps I should factor as:

2 = 2 * (2 m c²)/(2 m c²) ) → no, perhaps better to get a common denominator.

So,

2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ) = [4 m c² + k A² ] / (2 m c² )

So,

(k A²)/(2 m c² ) ) * [ (4 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c² ) ]

Multiply them:

= (k A² (4 m c² + k A² )) ) / [ (2 m c²) * (2 m c²) ) ]

= [ k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / (4 m² c^4 )

So the entire expression for v² becomes:

v² = c² * [ [ k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / (4 m² c^4 ) ] / [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 ]

Wait, the denominator is (1 + delta)^2, which is [ (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c² ) ]^2.

So,

(1 + delta) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ) = [ 2 m c² + k A² ]/(2 m c² )

So,

(1 + delta)^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A² )^2 ] / (4 m² c^4 )

Putting it all together:

v² = c² * [ (k A² (4 m c² + k A² )) / (4 m² c^4 ) ) ] / [ ( (2 m c² + k A² )^2 ) / (4 m² c^4 ) ) ]

Notice that the denominators (4 m² c^4) will cancel out:

v² = c² * [ k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / ( (2 m c² + k A² )^2 )

Hmm, simplifying numerator and denominator.

Let me factor numerator and denominator.

Numerator: k A² (4 m c² + k A² )

Denominator: (2 m c² + k A² )²

Wait, 4 m c² = 2 * 2 m c². So, 4 m c² + k A² = 2 (2 m c²) + k A². Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, let me write 4 m c² = 2*(2 m c² ). So:

Numerator: k A² [ 2*(2 m c² ) + k A² ]

Denominator: (2 m c² + k A² )^2

Hmm.

Wait, it's possible that 4 m c² + k A² = 2*(2 m c² + (k A²)/2 )

No, not sure. Maybe I can factor 2:

Wait, 4 m c² = 2*(2 m c² )

So,

Numerator becomes k A^2 [ 2*(2 m c² ) + k A² ]

= k A^2 [ 2*(2 m c² ) + k A² ]

Which is 2*(2 m c^2 ) * k A² + (k A^2 )^2.

Hmm, not sure. Let me think about the denominator:

Denominator is (2 m c² + k A² )^2 = (2 m c^2 + k A² )^2 = 4 m² c^4 + 4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4.

The numerator is k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) = 4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4.

So, the numerator is 4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4.

The denominator is 4 m² c^4 + 4 m c² k A^2 + k^2 A^4.

So, the numerator is equal to (4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4) = (k A^2) (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Hmm.

Not seeing an obvious simplification. Perhaps I can factor the denominator.

Denominator: (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

So, perhaps express numerator as something else.

Wait, numerator is (4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4 ) = k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Denominator is (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )².

Hmm, perhaps factor the denominator as (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )*(2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

So, the numerator is (k A^2 )*(4 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Wait, 4 m c^2 is 2*(2 m c^2 )

So, 4 m c^2 + k A^2 = 2*(2 m c^2 ) + k A^2. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps write 4 m c^2 as 2*(2 m c^2 )

So,

numerator = k A^2 (2*(2 m c^2 ) +k A^2 )

= k A^2 [ 2 (2 m c^2 ) +k A^2 ]

Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the denominator as (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )².

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ]

But let me factor 4 m c^2 as 2*(2 m c^2 )

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ k A^2 (2 * (2 m c^2 ) + k A^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ]

Hmm, perhaps factor out 2 in the numerator term:

= c^2 * [ k A^2 * 2 (2 m c^2 ) + k A^4 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 ]

Wait, that's not correct. Let me correct.

Wait,

4 m c^2 + k A^2 = 2*(2 m c^2 ) +k A^2 = 2*(2 m c^2 ) +k A^2.

Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) from the numerator.

Wait,

4 m c^2 + k A^2 = 2*(2 m c^2 ) + k A^2.

Hmm, not directly.

Wait, perhaps write 4 m c^2 as (2 m c^2 ) * 2.

So,

4 m c^2 +k A^2 = 2*(2 m c^2 ) + k A^2 = [2 m c^2 * 2 ] + k A^2.

Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps factor the denominator into (a + b)^2, a=2 m c², b=k A².

Alternatively, perhaps binomial expansion or other methods.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to take the expression we have for v^2 and see which option matches.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m))^2 )

Wait, that's a bit complicated.

Wait, let me see:

We have v² = c² * [k A² (4 m c² +k A² ) ] / [ (2 m c² + k A² )^2 ]

Wait, perhaps let me factor out (2 m c² ) from numerator and denominator.

So,

v² = c² [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

Factor numerator and denominator:

Let me factor 2 m c² from each term.

4 m c² = 2 * 2 m c².

So,

numerator inside the big fraction:

k A^2 [ 2*(2 m c²) +k A^2 ]

So,

= k A^2 [ 2 (2 m c²) +k A^2 ]

Denominator: (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

Hmm, perhaps factor 2 m c² in denominator as well.

Let me write denominator as (2 m c^2 (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )^2.

So denominator becomes (2 m c^2 )^2 * (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))².

Similarly, in the numerator:

2 (2 m c² ) +k A^2 = 2 m c^2 * (2 ) +k A^2 = 2 m c^2 ( 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, not sure.

Wait, perhaps go back.

Wait, let me define a variable, say, x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Then,

delta = x.

So, delta = x.

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ (k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 ]

Expressed in terms of x:

k A^2 = 2 m c^2 x.

So,

4 m c^2 +k A^2 =4 m c^2 + 2 m c^2 x = m c^2 (4 + 2 x )

Similarly, denominator: (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) = 2 m c^2 (1 + x )

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ (2 m c^2 x ) ( m c^2 (4 + 2 x )) ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 (1 + x ))^2 ]

Let me compute each part:

Numerator inside the big fraction:

(2 m c^2 x ) * ( m c^2 (4 + 2x ) ) = 2 m c^2 x * m c^2 (4 + 2x )

= 2 m^2 c^4 x (4 + 2x )

Denominator:

(2 m c^2 (1 +x ))^2 = 4 m^2 c^4 (1 +x )^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ 2 m^2 c^4 x (4 + 2x ) ] / [4 m^2 c^4 (1 +x )^2 ]

Simplify:

m^2 c^4 cancels out.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ 2 x (4 + 2x ) ] / [4 (1 +x )^2 ]

Simplify numerator and denominator.

Factor 2 in numerator: 2 x (4 + 2x ) = 2x *2 (2 +x ) = 4 x (2 +x )

So,

v^2 = c^2 [4 x (2 +x ) ] / [4 (1 +x )^2 ]

4 cancels.

v^2 = c^2 [ x (2 +x ) ] / (1 +x )²

So,

x is (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ (k A^2/(2 m c² )) * (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² )) ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² ))^2

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but maybe we can write this as v^2/c^2 = [ x (2 + x) ] / (1 + x )^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = x (2 +x ) / (1 + x )^2.

Let me compute this:

x (2 +x ) = 2x + x^2.

(1 +x )^2 = 1 + 2x + x².

So,

v²/c² = (2x +x² ) / (1 + 2x +x² )

= [x² + 2x ] / [x² + 2x +1 ]

= [x(x +2) ] / (x +1 )².

Hmm, but not sure how to proceed. Let me see if any of the options can be rewritten in this form.

Looking back at the options, option D is v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Wait, let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + x )^2.

x is (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

So,

1 - 1/(1 +x )^2 = [ (1 +x )^2 -1 ]/(1 +x )^2

= [ 1 + 2x +x² -1 ]/(1 +x )^2

= (2x + x² )/(1 +x )^2

Which is exactly the same as v²/c².

So, v²/c² = (2x +x² )/(1 +x )^2 = 1 - 1/(1 +x )^2.

So,

v² = c² (1 - 1/(1 +x )^2 )

Which implies that,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 +x )^2 )

But wait, let me substitute x = (k A^2 )/(2 m c² )

So,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which is option D.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option D says v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I have here.

Alternatively, let's look at the other options.

Option B is v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, that seems different.

Option A is sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m ) )^2 )

Wait, but our denominator has 2 m c² in the denominator, so that would make option A not correct.

Option C is non-relativistic, but we have to pick the relativistic one.

So, the correct answer is D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system's energy conservation. The total energy \( E \) of the system is the sum of the potential energy of the oscillator and the relativistic energy of the mass. 

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the potential energy is \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), and the velocity is zero, so the total energy is:  
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 + mc^2
   \]  
   At \( x = 0 \), the potential energy is zero, and all the energy is relativistic kinetic energy. The total energy is then:  
   \[
   E = \gamma mc^2
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Equating the two expressions for \( E \):  
   \[
   \gamma mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 + mc^2
   \]  
   Solving for \( \gamma \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]

2. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v \)**:  
   Using \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we substitute \( \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]  
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2
   \]  
   Rearranging:  
   \[
   1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]  
   \[
   v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]  
   \[
   v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing the derived expression for \( v \) with the given options, it matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
