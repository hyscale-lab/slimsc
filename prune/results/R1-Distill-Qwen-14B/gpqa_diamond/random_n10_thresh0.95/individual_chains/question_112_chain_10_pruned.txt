Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem gives me a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, spin-z up and spin-z down states, I think.

The first task is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. This operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j and zero otherwise. Oh wait, that's a 2x2 matrix because the spin is in two states, right? So the operator A has off-diagonal elements of ħ/2 and diagonal elements zero.

Wait, the operator's matrix is:
[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0  ]

Hmm, that's an anti-diagonal matrix. I remember that such matrices are often related to spin in the x-direction or something like that. Because the Pauli matrices, for example, have a similar structure. Let me think, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this looks similar but scaled by ħ/2.

So maybe this operator is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli matrices are 2x2, and each has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So the operator A would then have eigenvalues ±(ħ/2), perhaps.

But wait, the question is about finding the eigenstates of this operator A. So the eigenstates of A are probably the eigenstates of the Pauli X operator, which are the eigenstates of spin in the x-direction.

Because for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operator in the x-direction is (ħ/2) σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix. So the eigenstates of σ_x are |right> and |left>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

So the question is about measuring the particle in the eigenstates of A, which are |right> and |left>. The state |alpha> is given in the z-basis, so I'll probably need to express |alpha> in terms of the x-basis eigenstates. That way, I can find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate.

But before that, I should normalize the state |alpha>, because the question says it's proportional, not necessarily normalized. So let's compute the normalization factor first.

The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

The norm squared is |1+i|² + |2 - i|².

Calculating each term:
|1+i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +1 = 2.
Wait, wait, no. The modulus squared of a complex number a+bi is a² + b². So 1+i has a magnitude squared of 1^2 +1^2=2. Similarly, 2 - i is (2)^2 + (-1)^2=4 +1=5. So the total norm is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), because |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> / sqrt(7).

So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, to find the probability of measuring in each eigenstate of A, which are the eigenstates of the x-spin. Let me recall that the eigenstates of σ_x (or A, which is (ħ/2)σ_x) are |+x> and |–x>, where:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|–x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. The standard eigenstates of σ_x are (|0> + |1>)/√2 and (|0> - |1>)/√2, but in our case, the basis is |up> and |down>, which are the spin-up and spin-down in z. So the eigenstates of σ_x, which corresponds to the spin in x-direction, are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, but wait, the eigenvalues of σ_x are +1 and -1. So when you have a state |+x>, it's an eigenstate of σ_x with eigenvalue +1. So the state (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) is |+x>.

So, to find the probability of measuring |alpha> in |+x> and |-x>, I need to compute the inner products.

Alternatively, since the operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x, its eigenstates are the same as σ_x, scaled by a factor. So the eigenstates are the same as above.

So the probability of measuring +ħ/2 is the square of the amplitude of |+x> in |alpha>, and similarly for -ħ/2 with |-x>.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x> and then find the coefficients.

Let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>.

First, let me write |alpha> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)|up
