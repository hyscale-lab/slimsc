Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again. The question is about the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm, I remember that when objects move, things like light can have their speeds affected by the motion, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

So the setup is: a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab.

Wait, I think the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. But in this case, the glass is moving. So does the motion of the medium affect the speed of light as measured by someone outside (the lab frame)?

I recall something about the relativity of light speed. Oh! Einstein's postulate says that the speed of light in a vacuum is always c in any inertial frame, regardless of the motion of the source or the observer. But that's in a vacuum. How about in a medium like glass?

Hmm, this is trickier. Because glass isn't a vacuum, so maybe the usual rules don't apply. But wait, the problem is about the speed of light in the glass. So perhaps I should think about how the glass's motion affects the observed speed.

Wait, when the glass is moving, the light's speed as observed in the lab frame might change. But let me think about it step by step.

So light in glass normally has velocity v_light = c/n. But if the glass is moving, what's the observed speed?

In the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is moving at velocity v_light' (as observed in the lab). I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity here.

Wait, but wait. The velocity addition formula is for when you have velocities in different inertial frames. So if the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, and light's velocity in the glass's frame is v_light = c/n, then in the lab frame, the speed would be different.

The velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²), but wait, I'm not sure if that's the right formula. Let me think. Oh, right, the formula is when you go from the frame of the moving object (S') to the lab frame (S). If u is the velocity of an object in S', then in S, which is moving at speed v relative to S', the velocity is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, but in this case, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at v_light = c/n. Then, in the lab frame, which is moving at speed v relative to the glass (since the glass is moving towards the observer), the light's speed would be u' = (v_light + v)/(1 + (v_light * v)/c²).

Wait, that's the formula from S' to S, where S' is the glass frame. So in this case, the glass is moving at speed v in the lab frame, so to get the lab's measurement, we use the velocity addition.

So substituting u = v_light = c/n, and v is the speed of the glass relative to the lab. Wait no, wait. The velocity addition formula is when the lab frame (S) sees the glass (S') moving at v. So objects in S' have speed u, then in S their speed is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²).

But wait, wait. The glass is moving towards the observer, so in the lab frame, the glass is moving in the direction of the light beam. The light in the glass is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n towards the observer. Wait no, no: in the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion. So when we switch to the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass (since the glass is moving at v in the lab), the light's velocity would be calculated using the velocity addition.

Wait, but is the glass moving towards the observer or away? The question says, "the glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory." So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, which is towards the observer.

Wait, that could be confusing. Wait, the light is propagating through the glass, so the beam is going through the glass, and the glass is moving toward the observer. So in the lab frame, both the glass and the light are moving towards the observer, but the light is moving faster than the glass.

So, in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n towards the observer. Now, the lab frame sees the glass moving towards them at v. So what is the light's speed in the lab frame?

So using the velocity addition formula: u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² )

Here, u is the speed of the light in the glass's frame, which is c/n. Wait, no, wait: in the glass's frame, the light is moving towards the observer. The glass is moving towards the observer in the lab frame. So in the glass frame, the light's velocity is u = c/n towards the observer. The lab frame is moving at v towards the observer relative to the glass. Wait, no. Let me think again.

The lab frame is the stationary frame. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So the glass is moving in the +x direction (towards the observer) with speed v. In the glass frame, the light is moving at u = c/n in the +x direction.

So to find the speed of the light in the lab frame, we use the velocity addition. So the formula is:

u_lab = (u_glass + v_glass) / (1 + (u_glass * v_glass)/c² )

Where u_glass is the speed of the light in the glass's frame, and v_glass is the speed of the glass relative to the lab. But wait, the velocity addition formula is for when you have a frame S' moving at velocity v relative to S. So if S is the lab frame, and S' is the glass frame, which is moving at v relative to S in the +x direction, then an object moving at u' in S' will have u in S given by u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c² )

So in this case, u' is the speed of the light in the glass's frame, which is c/n. So u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator: 1 + (v * c)/(n c² ) = 1 + v/(n c )

So u = ( (c + n v ) / n ) / ( 1 + v/(n c) )

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator. Numerator is (c/n + v) = (c + n v)/n.

Denominator is 1 + (v (c/n) ) / c² = 1 + (v)/(n c).

Wait, let me check that. (c/n) * v = (c v)/n. Divide by c^2: (c v)/(n c²) = v/(n c).

So denominator is 1 + v/(n c).

Putting together,

u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [1 + v/(n c) ]

Simplify denominator: 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v)/(n c)

So u = [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ (n c) / (n c + v) ) ]

Wait, no, because when you divide by denominator, it's multiply by reciprocal.

So,

u = (c + n v)/n * (n c) / (n c + v )

Simplify numerator and denominator: n cancels from numerator and denominator.

So numerator: (c + n v) * c

Denominator: (n c + v) 

But wait, n c + v is the same as c (n) + v, which is the same as the numerator's first term times c? Not quite. Let me think again.

Wait, numerator is (c + n v) * c = c^2 + c n v.

Denominator is (n c + v) = c n + v.

So, u = (c^2 + c n v) / (c n + v )

Wait, but that's (c (c + n v )) / (n c + v )

But n c + v is same as (n c + v) = c n + v.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor c from numerator and denominator.

Wait, numerator: c^2 + c n v = c (c + n v )

Denominator: n c + v = c (n) + v. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps I can factor c from the denominator:

Denominator: c (n) + v = c (n + v/c )

So,

u = c (c + n v ) / [ c (n + v/c ) ] 

The c's cancel:

u = (c + n v ) / (n + v/c )

Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, let me check what the options are.

The options are:

A) (1 + n*v)/(n + v)

B) 1

C) (1 +n v)/(n -v )

D) (1 -n v)/(n +v )

Wait, but my expression has a lot of c's in it because I used the speed of light in a vacuum as c. But wait, the problem says to take c=1 as the speed in vacuum. So let's set c=1 and see.

If c=1,

u = (1 + n v ) / (n + v )

Because,

In the numerator: 1 + n v.

Denominator: n + v/c → since c=1, denominator becomes n + v.

So,

u = (1 + n v ) / (n + v )

Which is option A.

Wait, but wait. Let's double-check the velocity addition formula. I sometimes get confused about the direction.

Because the glass is moving towards the observer in the lab, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, so in the lab frame, the light's velocity should be higher than in the glass's frame.

Wait, but according to the formula I used, when you add velocities, you get a higher speed than either. But wait, the speed of light in the lab frame should still be less than c, right? Because the speed of light can't exceed c according to relativity.

Wait, but in this case, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction. So the lab measures the light's speed as (1 + n v )/(n + v )

Wait, let me plug in some numbers. Let's say n=1 (like air), and v is 0. Let me test edge cases.

If v=0, then u= (1 + 0)/(1 + 0 )=1, which is correct because when the glass is stationary, the speed of light is 1 (since c=1).

Another case: if n=1, v=0.5.

Then u = (1 + 1*0.5)/(1 + 0.5 )= (1.5)/(1.5 )=1. Which is correct because even if the medium is moving at v=0.5, the speed of light in lab is still 1.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because in reality, when you have a medium moving towards you, the speed of light in that medium should be c/n in the medium's frame. But in the lab frame, the observed speed according to relativity is still c in a vacuum. But this is in a medium, so perhaps it's different.

Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake in applying the velocity addition formula. Because the velocity addition formula applies to inertial frames where the speed of light is c. But in a medium, the speed of light isn't c in the medium's frame—it's c/n.

Wait, but in the medium's frame, the speed of light is c/n, and when you apply the velocity addition, you get u = (c/n + v)/(1 + (c v)/(n c² )) )

Simplify denominator: 1 + v/(n c)

Wait, but with c=1, denominator becomes 1 + v/n.

So, u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + v/(n) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

u = (1 + n v ) / (n + v )

Which brings me back to the same answer.

But wait, when v is not zero, what happens? Let's say n=2, v=0.5.

Then, u= (1 + 2 * 0.5) / (2 + 0.5 ) = (1 +1 )/2.5 = 2 /2.5 = 0.8.

Which is less than 1, which makes sense because the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light's speed is still capped somehow.

Wait, but what's the correct approach here? Because I'm not entirely confident. Let me think of another approach.

Alternatively, the speed of light in the glass is c/n in the glass's rest frame. But in the lab frame, the glass is moving, so perhaps the speed of light is different. But according to special relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame must be c. But wait, that's only in a vacuum, right? Or does it apply regardless of the medium?

Wait, Einstein's second postulate says that in any inertial frame, the speed of light in a vacuum is c. But when light is moving through a medium, its speed is different. So the medium's motion would affect the observed speed.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the problem again.

In the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v. The light inside the glass is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So what's the speed of the light as observed in the lab?

In the glass's frame, the light's speed is c/n towards the observer. So when the glass is moving towards the observer, the light's speed in the lab frame would be higher because both the glass and the light are moving towards the observer.

But according to the velocity addition formula, the observed speed is (c/n + v) divided by (1 + (c/n)v / c² ), which with c=1 becomes (1/n + v)/(1 + v/(n)).

Which is (1 + n v )/(n + v ), as I got earlier.

So according to that, the correct answer is option A. But wait, I need to make sure that this doesn't exceed c.

Wait, if the numerator is (1 +n v), denominator (n +v), when v is positive (since the glass is moving toward the observer), and n is greater than 1 (since glass has higher refractive index than air, which is 1), let's take n=2, v=0.5.

Then, numerator: 1 + 2*0.5 = 2.

Denominator: 2 + 0.5 = 2.5.

So u = 2/2.5 = 0.8, which is less than 1. So that's fine.

Another test: v=0.9, n=2.

Numerator: 1 + 2*0.9 = 1+1.8=2.8.

Denominator:2 +0.9=2.9.

u=2.8/2.9≈0.9655, which is still less than 1.

So the formula gives a speed less than the speed of light, which is correct.

Alternatively, if the glass is moving in the opposite direction, v would be negative. Let's say v=-0.5, n=2.

u=(1 +2*(-0.5 ))/(2-0.5) = (1-1)/1.5=0/1.5=0.

Which makes sense, because the glass is moving away from the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So relative to the lab, the light's speed would be 0—only possible if the glass is moving away at the same speed as the light in the glass. Hmm, interesting.

So I think my initial approach was correct. The answer should be option A: (1 +n v)/(n + v).


To determine the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using the principles of special relativity. The light beam is propagating through a glass medium with a refractive index \( n \), and the glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the beam, toward the observer. The speed of light in a vacuum is given as \( c = 1 \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Speed of Light in the Glass's Rest Frame**:  
   In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( u' = \frac{c}{n} = \frac{1}{n} \).

2. **Velocity Addition Formula**:  
   To find the speed of light in the laboratory frame, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:
   \[
   u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
   \]
   Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \), the formula becomes:
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]

3. **Simplification**:  
   Multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \) to simplify:
   \[
   u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]

4. **Verification Against Options**:  
   Comparing this result with the given options:
   - **Option A**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \) matches the derived expression.
   - **Option B**: \( 1 \) is incorrect because the speed of light in the glass depends on \( n \) and \( v \).
   - **Option C**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \) is incorrect because the denominator has the wrong sign.
   - **Option D**: \( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \) is incorrect because the numerator has the wrong sign.

5. **Consistency Check**:  
   The derived expression satisfies the condition that the speed of light remains less than \( c \) (or 1) in the laboratory frame, as required by special relativity.

### Conclusion:
The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is given by \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
