Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal and all angles equal too. The question gives the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. They're asking about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance. Oh right, that's the d-spacing. I think the formula for calculating d-spacing in a crystal is d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² - 2lm cos α - 2ln cos β - 2mn cos γ), where (l, m, n) are the Miller indices. But wait, no, wait. No, wait, the formula might be different. Oh right, the general formula for d-spacing in a crystal is given by 1/d² = (l² + m² + n²)/(a²) - (l m cos γ + l n cos β + m n cos α)/(a²). Or maybe I'm mixing that up. Alternatively, I remember that the formula for d-spacing is 1/d² equals the sum of the squares of the reciprocals times the lattice parameter squared, but I'm not so sure. Oh wait, maybe the formula is d = (a²/(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos γ - 2hl cos beta - 2kl cos alpha))^(1/2) divided by something. I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the structure factor. The interplanar distance for a crystal plane (hkl) in a cubic system is a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but in a non-cubic system, the formula changes because of the angles. Right, so for a rhombohedral system, the formula is a bit more complicated.

Let me try to get the formula right. I think the general formula for the interplanar spacing in any crystal system is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² + k² + l² + 2(hk \cos\gamma) + 2(hl \cos\beta) + 2(kl \cos\alpha) } }

Wait, no, wait. I think that's incorrect. Oh wait, no, the formula is a bit different. For a general hexagonal or rhombohedral system, the formula is a bit more involved. Let me think. Oh wait, I remember the formula now. The d-spacing is given by:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos\gamma) - 2(hl \cos\beta) - 2(kl \cos\alpha) } }

Wait, but I might be mixing up the signs. Let me make sure. Another source I recall says that for a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). But when the angles are present, like in a rhombohedral system, the formula includes cosines of the angles between the axes. So, the correct formula should be:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² + k² + l² - 2 h k \cos \gamma - 2 h l \cos \beta - 2 k l \cos \alpha } }

Wait, but wait, for a rhombohedral system, the angles are all the same, right? So in this case, since alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees, the formula simplifies a bit. So let's plug in the numbers.

The plane is (111), so h = 1, k = 1, l = 1.

So substituting into the formula:

d = a / sqrt(1² + 1² + 1² - 2*1*1*cos(30) - 2*1*1*cos(30) - 2*1*1*cos(30)).

Wait, let me compute the denominator step by step.

First, the numerator is a, which is 10 Angstroms.

The denominator is sqrt( (1 + 1 + 1) - 2*(1*1 cos30) - 2*(1*1 cos30) - 2*(1*1 cos30) )

Wait, but wait, the formula is h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos gamma - 2hl cos beta - 2kl cos alpha.

In the rhombohedral case, all the angles are equal, so gamma = beta = alpha = 30 degrees.

So the denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 2[ cos30 + cos30 + cos30 ] * (since h=k=l=1, all terms are 2*1*1*cos30))

Wait, let me compute each term:

h² +k² + l² = 1 +1 +1 =3.

Now, the cross terms:

2hk cos gamma = 2*(1)(1)*cos30 = 2*(sqrt(3)/2) )= sqrt(3).

Similarly, 2hl cos beta = same as above, sqrt(3).

2kl cos alpha = same, sqrt(3).

So the denominator becomes sqrt( 3 - (sqrt(3) + sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)) )) = sqrt(3 - 3*sqrt(3)).

Wait, wait, that can't be right because 3*sqrt(3) is about 5.196, and 3 -5.196 is negative. That would make sqrt of a negative number, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake in applying the formula.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the signs. Let me double-check the formula. Oh wait, maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2hk cos gamma - 2hl cos beta - 2kl cos alpha )

Wait, but that would give 3 - 2*(sum of cos30 terms). Let's compute that.

Each 2hk cos gamma term is 2*1*1*(sqrt(3)/2) )= sqrt(3). So each term is sqrt(3), and there are three such terms: 2hk cos gamma, 2hl cos beta, 2kl cos alpha.

So total cross terms sum to 3*sqrt(3).

So 3 - 3*sqrt(3) is 3*(1 - sqrt(3)).

But that's about 3*(1 - 1.732) =3*(-0.732)= -2.196.

That's negative, which can't be, because the denominator inside sqrt must be positive.

Hmm, that can't be right. So I must have the formula wrong. That would mean I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the denominator is different. Maybe it's the sum of (h² +k² +l²) plus the cross terms, not minus.

Wait, another approach: I think the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha) } }

Wait, but that's what I did before, and that leads to a negative value. That can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check a reference. Alternatively, another approach.

Wait, I think I may have the signs wrong. Maybe it's plus the cross terms. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

Wait, let me try that.

In our case, then the denominator would be sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

Because each hk cos gamma is 1*1*sqrt(3)/2, so 2 hk cos gamma is 2*(sqrt(3)/2)=sqrt(3). And there are three such terms (h k, h l, k l), so sum is 3*sqrt(3).

So denominator is sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)).

So then d = a / sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

But wait, a is 10 Angstroms.

Let me compute the denominator. Let's calculate 3 +3*sqrt(3) =3*(1 + sqrt(3)).

So sqrt(3*(1+sqrt(3))) )= sqrt(3) * sqrt(1 + sqrt(3)).

Hmm, let me compute this numerically.

Compute 3 +3*sqrt(3) =3 +3*1.732≈3+5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)≈2.864.

So d=10 / 2.864 ≈ 3.493 Angstroms. Wait, but that's not matching any of the options given (the options are around 9 or 10 Angstroms).

Wait, that can't be right. So clearly, I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I have the formula inverted. Maybe it's 1/d² equals that expression. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach. The interplanar distance formula for a crystal can be derived from the Miller indices and the lattice parameters. For a rhombohedral system, the lattice is defined by vectors a, b, c, each of length a, and the angles between them are all 30 degrees.

The general formula for the interplanar distance is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (h k cos gamma + h l cos beta + k l cos alpha)/(a²)

Wait, that's possible. So 1/d² = [h² +k² +l² - hk cos gamma - hl cos beta - kl cos alpha ] / a².

Wait, but in that case, d is a/(sqrt(...)), same as before. So perhaps I'm correct. But when I plug in the numbers, I get a negative value under the sqrt.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the angles are measured differently. Wait, maybe in the formula, the angles are between the crystallographic axes. Let me think: in a rhombohedral system, the angles between the axes are 30 degrees. So, perhaps the formula is correct, but maybe I'm getting the angles the wrong way.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are 180-30=150 degrees. Wait, no, because the angle in the formula is the angle between the axes, which for rhombohedral is 30°, so I think that's correct.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

Wait, that's what I thought earlier. So let's compute that.

h=k=l=1, so h² +k² +l²=3.

The cross terms: 2*(h k cos gamma + h l cos beta + k l cos alpha )

Each term is 2*(1*1 * cos30) = 2*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3). So three terms: 3*sqrt(3).

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 -3*sqrt(3).

Which is about 3 -5.196= -2.196.

Which is negative. So that can't be. So I must have the formula wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

Wait, let's try that.

In that case, denominator is sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)) ≈ sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.864.

So d=10 /2.864≈3.493 Angstroms. But that's way too small compared to the options.

Wait, so none of the options are around 3.5. All options are around 9-10. So perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption.

Another thought: perhaps the formula uses the reciprocal of the angles.

Alternatively, maybe I got the formula wrong. Maybe the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ), but that gave the small d which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the formula is incorrect because in a rhombohedral system, the angles are all the same, but the formula for d-spacing is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the reciprocal lattice. Hmm, not sure.

Another possibility: Maybe the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter a. So a=10 Angstroms. But in that case, perhaps for the (111) plane, the d-spacing is a / sqrt(3), which would be 10 / sqrt(3) ≈5.77 Angstroms. But that's not one of the options either.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me try to find another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the general formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral crystal.

I found a source that says that the interplanar distance for (hkl) in a rhombohedral system is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

Where θ is the angle between the axes, and all angles are equal (rhombohedral). So in this case, θ=30°.

So substituting h=k=l=1, we get:

d = 10 / sqrt( 3 + 2(1 + 1 +1) cos30 )

Wait, 2*(hk + hl + kl) is 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) )= 2*3=6.

But wait, no: in the formula, each term is (hk + hl + kl), multiplied by cosθ and then multiplied by 2? Wait, the formula I'm seeing is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, that would be the denominator: 3 + 6*cos30.

Since cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So 3 +6*(0.866) =3 +5.196=8.196.

So d=10 / sqrt(8.196) ≈10 / 2.864 ≈3.493 Angstroms.

Which again is about 3.5 Angstroms, which doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, but the options are in the 9-10 range. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Another approach: perhaps the formula uses the reciprocal of cosθ. Because 30 degrees is a small angle, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the vectors are at 30 degrees, but in terms of their dot product.

Wait, maybe the formula for the interplanar distance is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk cosθ + hl cosθ + kl cosθ) )

But wait, that would be 3 - 2*(3 * cosθ).

θ=30°, cosθ=√3/2 ≈0.866.

So denominator becomes 3 - 2*(3*0.866) =3 - 5.196= -2.196.

Again, which is negative. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the metric tensor.

Wait, the metric tensor for a rhombohedral system is given by:

a_ij = a^2 [ δ_ij + (cosα -1)/ (1 + ... ) ] ?

Wait, no, the metric tensor for a rhombohedral system is:

[ 1      cosθ     cosθ     ]

[ cosθ    1       cosθ     ]

[ cosθ   cosθ      1       ]

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the reciprocal lattice.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the volume of the unit cell and then the volume of the reciprocal lattice.

Wait, but perhaps another approach: think about the structure factor.

The structure factor for a plane (hkl) is given by F = (some expression involving the lattice parameters). But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the planes in a rhombohedral system. For a (111) plane in a cubic system, the d-spacing is a/sqrt(3). But in this case, with angles, it's different.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the interatomic distance given is not the lattice parameter a. Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a. But in a rhombohedral structure, if it's a primitive lattice, the interatomic distance would be a. So perhaps a=10 Angstroms.

So if a=10, then with (111) plane, the d-spacing is a / sqrt(3) ≈5.77 Angstroms. But again, that's not matching the options.

Wait, but the options are around 9-10, so perhaps the problem is considering a hexagonally close-packed structure or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the (111) plane in a face-centered cubic structure, but no, that's cubic.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula earlier. Let me double-check.

Another source I found says that for a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cosθ } }

But in this case, theta is the angle between the axes. So substituting:

h=k=l=1,

denominator inside sqrt is 3 - 2*(3) * cos30.

Which is 3 -6*(sqrt(3)/2 )=3-3*sqrt(3) ≈3-5.196= -2.196.

Which gives a negative, so that can't be. So perhaps the formula is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Then,

denominator inside sqrt is 3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2 ) =3 +3*sqrt(3)≈3+5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.862.

So d=10/2.862≈3.493 Angstroms. Again, not matching any options.

Hmm, but the options are all around 9, which is near a=10. That suggests that for some reason, the denominator is close to 1. So perhaps a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, which is a special case of a rhombohedral system. But I don't think so; FCC is a cubic system.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering a rhombohedral system with a=10 Angstroms, and the (111) planes, but perhaps the formula is different. Another approach: perhaps the (111) plane in a rhombohedral system has a d-spacing that's larger than a. How? That would mean the denominator is less than 1. But with a=10, how?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is taking the inverse, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ), but that would make d larger than a, but 10 * sqrt(3 +5.196) would be 10*sqrt(8.196) ≈10*2.864=28.64, which is way too big.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²)/(1 + 2 cosθ) ), but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h^
