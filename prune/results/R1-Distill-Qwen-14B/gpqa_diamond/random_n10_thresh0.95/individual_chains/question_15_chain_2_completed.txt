Okay, so I have this question about transiting planets and which one is more likely to transit. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step. 

The question gives two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same minimum mass, detected via the RV method. Their orbital periods are different: Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1's period is P1, and Planet_2's is P2 = 3*P1? Wait, no. Wait, the question says Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter. So, if Planet_2's period is P, then Planet_1's is P/3. Right, because it's orbiting faster.

Both have circular orbits. Host stars have same radii, but the host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's host. The host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, but same radius. So, both stars have the same radius, but different masses. 

The researchers want to choose the planet with the higher probability of transiting. So which one has a better chance?

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star is given by an equation involving the star's radius and the planet's orbital distance. The formula for the transit probability is:

Probability = (R_star + R_planet)² / (a_planet)^2 

Wait, but more accurately, I think the probability is (R_star / a_planet)² multiplied by some function of the orbital inclination. Oh wait, no, the transit probability (independent of inclination) is actually more complicated. Because for a planet to transit, its orbital plane must be edge-on relative to our line of sight. 

Wait, the transit probability is the fraction of times when the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it transits. The geometric probability P_geo is (R_star + R_planet)² / (a_planet)^2. Wait, but R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so it's approximately (R_star / a)^2.

But wait, another approach: the probability that the planet transits is roughly (R_star / a)² * (1 + (M_planet / M_star)), but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, the probability that the orbital plane is aligned so that we see a transit is (R_star / a_planet)². Because the area of the star is πR_star², and the area where the planet can be in front is a circle of radius a_planet, so the probability is (R_star / a_planet)². But wait, I think that the transit probability is (R_star / a)^2 multiplied by the product of the ratio of the star's and planet's radii, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me think again. The probability of a transit is given by the formula:

P_transit = (R_* + R_p)^2 / (a_p)^2 * (1 / (1 - e²))^(1/2) 

But since both orbits are circular, e=0, so it simplifies. Also, R_p is much smaller than R_*, so (R_* + R_p) ≈ R_*. So the transit probability is approximately (R_* / a_p)^2.

But wait, that's the geometric probability, assuming all inclinations are equally likely. So, the probability depends on the square of the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance.

So, the main factors are R_star and a_planet. The closer the planet is to the star (smaller a), the higher the probability. Also, bigger star (larger R_star) increases the probability.

Now, the question is about which planet has a higher a, which affects the transit probability.

Wait, but the orbital period is given. We can use Kepler's third law to find a.

Kepler's third law: (a^3)/(P^2) = (G(M_* + M_p)) / (4π²). But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate it as (a^3)/(P^2) = G M_* / (4 π²). 

So, a = [ (G M_* P^2) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3)

But since both planets are around different stars, their a depends on their host's mass and their period.

Given that Planet_1's period is P1 = P/3 (since it's three times shorter than Planet_2's). Wait, no, wait. The question states: "the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2." So, P1 = (1/3) P2. So, if P1 is shorter, then P1 is smaller. 

So, for Planet_1, P1 = (1/3) * P2.

But for each planet, a is determined by the host star's mass, M_*, and the period, P.

Let me denote:

a1 is the semi-major axis of Planet_1.

a2 is the semi-major axis of Planet_2.

We can write for each:

a1^3 / P1^2 = G (M1) / (4 π²)

a2^3 / P2^2 = G (M2) / (4 π²)

But M1 is twice M2, because the host of Planet_1 is twice as massive as the host of Planet_2. So M1 = 2 M2.

Wait, let me define M1 = 2 M2.

We can write the a for each planet in terms of their periods and masses.

Taking the ratio a1/a2:

(a1^3)/(P1^2) = (G M1)/(4 π²)

(a2^3)/(P2^2) = (G M2)/(4 π²)

Divide the two equations:

(a1^3)/(a2^3) = (M1 * P1^2) / (M2 * P2^2 )

Substituting M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = (1/3) P2.

So:

(a1/a2)^3 = (2 M2 * (P1^2)) ) / (M2 * P2^2 )

Simplify M2 cancels out:

= 2 * ( ( (1/3 P2 )^2 ) / (P2^2) )

= 2 * ( (1/9 P2^2) / P2^2 )

= 2 * (1/9) = 2/9.

So, (a1/a2)^3 = 2/9.

Take cube root: a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So, a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

So, the semi-major axis of Planet_1 is about 0.6 times that of Planet_2.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Because if Planet_1's period is shorter, and its host star is more massive, how does a compare?

Wait, higher mass star would require a shorter a for the same period. Because for higher mass, the same period would mean a is smaller. Since for same P, a^3 is proportional to M.

So, a is proportional to (M)^(1/3) * (P)^(2/3).

So for a1, since M1=2 M2 and P1 = (1/3) P2.

a1 = [ (M1) * (P1)² ]^(1/3) 

= [ 2 M2 * ( (1/3 P2 )² ) ]^(1/3)

= [ 2 M2 * (P2² / 9) ) ]^(1/3)

a2 = [ M2 * P2² ]^(1/3 )

So, a1 = [ (2/9) M2 P2² ]^(1/3)

a2 = [ M2 P2² ]^(1/3 )

So the ratio a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So yes, a1 is about 0.606 times a2.

So, a_planet_1 is smaller than a_planet_2. Because for the same mass, shorter period would mean smaller a. But in this case, the star is more massive, which also pulls the planet in, so a is smaller.

So, a1 < a2.

Now, the transit probability is (R_*/ a_planet)^2.

But both host stars have same radius, R_*. So R1 = R2 = R.

So, the transit probabilities are:

P1 = (R/a1)^2

P2 = (R/a2)^2

So, P1/P2 = ( (R/a1)^2 ) / ( (R/a2)^2 ) ) = (a2/a1)^2.

Since a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1, because a1 = 0.606 a2 → a2 ≈ 1.65 a1.

Wait, no, a1 = 0.606 a2 → a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So, P1/P2 = (a2/a1)^2 = (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

So, P1 is about 2.7 times higher than P2.

Wait, but wait, no: P1 is (R/a1)^2, which is (R/(0.6 a2))^2 = (R/(0.6 a2))^2 → (1/0.6)^2 (R/a2)^2 → ( (5/3)^2 ) * (R/a2)^2 → (25/9) * (R/a2)^2.

But (R/a2)^2 is P2. So P1 = (25/9) * P2 ≈ 2.777 * P2.

So P1 is higher. So Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.

So the researchers should choose Planet_1, because it has a higher probability to transit.

Looking at the options:

Options C and D say Planet_1 is preferred. The question is about which option is correct.

Option C: ~1.65 times higher. Hmm, wait, 1.65 is the ratio a2/a1. But the transit probability ratio is (a2/a1)^2, which is (1.65)^2≈2.7.

So option D says ~2.7 times, so Planet_1 is preferred due to higher probability.

But wait, the question is about which planet has higher probability to transit. So if a_planet is small, R/a is large, so probability is higher.

So, with a1 < a2, R/a1 is larger than R/a2. So P1 > P2. So the probability for Planet_1 is higher.

So the researchers would choose Planet_1, and the correct option is either C or D. The calculations say P1 is 2.7 times P2. So option D says ~2.7 times, so the correct answer is D.

But wait, let me double-check. Because another approach is that transit probability is (R_*/a)^2. So, if a1 is 0.6 a2, then (R_*/a1) = (R_*/(0.6 a2)) = (1/0.6) (R_*/a2) = 1.666... (R_*/a2). So (R_*/a1)^2 is (1.666)^2 = 2.777 times (R_*/a2)^2. So P1 is about 2.777 times P2.

So the transit probability of Planet_1 is about 2.7 times higher than that of Planet_2. So the researchers will prefer Planet_1, as it has a higher chance of transiting.

So the correct answer is option D, which says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula:

\[
P_{\text{transit}} \propto \left(\frac{R_*}{a}\right)^2
\]

where \(R_*\) is the radius of the host star, and \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Both planets orbit stars of the same radius (\(R_1 = R_2\)), so the transit probability depends on the ratio of the semi-major axes (\(a_1\) for Planet_1 and \(a_2\) for Planet_2).

### Step 1: Relating Orbital Periods and Semi-Major Axes
Using Kepler's third law:

\[
a^3 \propto M_* P^2
\]

where \(M_*\) is the mass of the host star and \(P\) is the orbital period. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

- \(M_1 = 2M_2\) (Planet_1's host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's).
- \(P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2\) (Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's).

Taking the ratio of the semi-major axes:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_1 P_1^2}{M_2 P_2^2}
\]

Substituting \(M_1 = 2M_2\) and \(P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2\):

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{2M_2 \left(\frac{1}{3}P_2\right)^2}{M_2 P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \(a_1 \approx 0.606a_2\), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its host star than Planet_2.

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is proportional to \(\left(\frac{R_*}{a}\right)^2\). Since \(R_*\) is the same for both stars:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{R_*}{a_1}\right)^2 \div \left(\frac{R_*}{a_2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2
\]

Substituting \(a_1 \approx 0.606a_2\):

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{0.606a_2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{0.606}\right)^2 \approx 2.7
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1, as it has a significantly higher probability of transiting (~2.7 times that of Planet_2).
