Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

Alright, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both stars are similar to the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets have circular orbits. 

The key data points are the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum as the planet orbits, causing the star to move a little. The larger the shift, the more massive the planet, or the closer it is to the star, right? Or wait, maybe it's about the velocity of the star.

Oh wait, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 AU)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / (1 day)^(1/3) ) ) * ( sin(i) ) / ( (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3) ) )

Wait, no, maybe the formula is K = [ (27 * pi * G) / (c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the relation between the RV signal (the velocity semi-amplitude) and the orbital period and other factors.

I think the RV semi-amplitude (K) is inversely proportional to the orbital period (P) when other factors are similar. Because, from the formula, K is proportional to (M_planet) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) (P)^(1/3) )) ) ... something like that.

Wait, let me think. The RV method measures the star's velocity as it moves due to the planet's orbit. The formula for K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should look for a simplified version. I remember that when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's (which is the case here as Neptune is much less than the Sun), the formula simplifies.

In that case, K ≈ (v) ≈ ( (G * M_planet) / (M_star^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )^(something) ?

Wait, another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (2 pi G) / (c) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 day) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps I should use the relation involving the orbital period. Since both stars have the same mass (same as the Sun), and both planets have similar masses (Neptune), perhaps we can assume M_planet is the same for both planets. So M1 = M2.

But in the problem, both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so M1 ≈ M2. So M_planet is same, M_star is same, so the ratio of K1 and K2 would depend on 1/(P1)^(1/3) and 1/(P2)^(1/3) ?

Wait, no, let's get the exact formula. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c^3) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe it's better to remember that when M_p is much less than M_star, then M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies to K ≈ (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / (M_star^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )^(something) ?

Wait, another approach: the RV amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (P)^(−1/3) ) / (1 + ... ) but since M_p is small, it's approximately K ∝ (M_p / M_star^(1/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the equation relating K and the orbital period.

I remember that K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) ). So for two planets, K1 and K2, we can write:

K1 / K2 = ( (M_p1) / (M_star^(1/3) * P1^(1/3) ) ) ) / ( (M_p2) / (M_star^(1/3) * P2^(1/3) ) ) )

But since M_p1 ≈ M_p2 (both Neptune masses) and M_star is same for both, the ratio becomes:

K1/K2 = (1 / P1^(1/3) ) / (1 / P2^(1/3) ) ) = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, no, let me recheck that. Wait, if K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ), then for K1 and K2, since M_p and M_star are same,

K1/K2 = [ (1) / (P1^(1/3) ) ] / [ (1) / (P2^(1/3) ) ] 

Which is equal to (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

So, K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

But wait, in the problem, K1 is 5 milliangstrom, K2 is 7. So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4

So,

K2/K1 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) 

So,

1.4 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

To find the ratio P2/P1, we cube both sides.

(1.4)^3 = P2/P1

What is 1.4 cubed?

1.4 * 1.4 = 1.96, 1.96 * 1.4 = 2.744.

Wait, 1.4^3 = 2.744

So P2/P1 = 2.744

Wait, but wait, the question is how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than that of planet #1. So P2 is longer by a factor of 2.744.

But wait, the options are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

Wait, none of these options are 2.744. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I get the ratio backwards?

Wait, let me recheck. Let me write the equation again.

From earlier, K2/K1 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, because the formula is K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3), so higher K means smaller P.

So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1? Because a higher velocity semi-amplitude would imply a shorter period?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the proportionality.

Wait, let's think again: K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. A higher K means the star is moving more quickly in its orbit, which can happen if the planet is closer (smaller orbit, higher velocity) or more massive.

But in our case, both planets have same mass, same star mass. So a higher K would mean a shorter orbital period, because the planet is moving faster around the star.

Wait, from the formula, K is proportional to (1 / P^(1/3)).

So if K2 is larger than K1, that would mean that P2 is smaller than P1.

But the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if 7/5 = 1.4, and K2/K1 = 1.4, then P2 = (K2/K1)^(-3) * P1 ?

Wait, let's re-express the equation.

We have K2/K1 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, no, from the earlier substitution:

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, perhaps I inverted the ratio earlier.

Wait, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1 = (some constant) * (1/P1^(1/3))

Similarly K2 = (same constant) * (1/P2^(1/3))

So K1/K2 = (1/P1^(1/3)) / (1/P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, K1=5, K2=7. So K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So 0.714 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Raise both sides to the power of 3: (0.714)^3 ≈ P2/P1

0.714^3 is approximately (0.7)^3 = 0.343, but 0.714 is a bit larger than 0.7.

Let me compute 7/10 = 0.7. (0.7)^3 is 0.343.

But 7/5 = 1.4, so for K1=5 and K2=7, K1/K2=5/7 ≈0.714.

So 0.714^3 ≈ ?

Let me calculate 0.714^3:

0.714 * 0.714 = about 0.5098.

Then 0.5098 * 0.714 ≈ 0.5098 * 0.7 is 0.3568, 0.5098 * 0.014 ≈ ~0.00714. So total ≈ 0.3639.

So approximately 0.364.

So P2/P1 ≈ 0.364, which is about 0.36.

So the orbital period of Planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of Planet #1. So it's shorter by a factor of ~0.36.

But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? If P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's shorter, meaning P2 is shorter than P1. So the answer would be that P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36. So the question is how much longer is P2 than P1, which would be 0.36 times as long, meaning it's shorter. But the options given are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So the correct ratio is P2/P1≈0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but the question is phrased as: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then it's shorter. So the period of planet 2 is 0.36 times that of planet 1. So planet 2's period is shorter. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times as long. So the ratio is 0.36.

So the correct answer is option A, ~0.36.


The question involves determining how many times the orbital period of Planet #2 is longer than that of Planet #1 using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both stars have the same mass (similar to the Sun), and both planets have masses similar to Neptune. The RV semi-amplitude (K) is inversely proportional to the orbital period \( P \) when other factors are constant. The relationship is given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

For two planets, the ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Given \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714
\]

Substituting into the equation:

\[
0.714 = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(0.714\right)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, \( P_2 / P_1 \approx 0.364 \), meaning the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.

From the options provided:

A) ~0.36  
B) ~1.40  
C) ~1.96  
D) ~0.85  

The correct answer is **A) ~0.36**.
