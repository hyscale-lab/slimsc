Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem starts by giving a state |alpha> which is a combination of |up> and |down> states. The coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2-i) for |down>. So the state is proportional to that. Hmm, I think I need to normalize this state first because right now, the coefficients are just proportional, not necessarily normalized.

Wait, wait. The state is given as proportional, so I should compute the normalization factor. To normalize, I calculate the inner product of the state with itself. The inner product is (1+i)*(1-i) + (2-i)*(2+i) because |up> and |down> are orthonormal.

Let's compute each part. The first term: (1+i)(1-i) is 1 - i^2, which is 1 - (-1) = 2. Oh wait, no, wait a second. Wait, (1+i)(1-i) equals 1*(1) + 1*(-i) + i*(1) + i*(-i). So that's 1 -i +i -i². The -i and +i cancel, so it's 1 - (-1) because i² is -1. So 1 +1=2. Got it.

The second term: (2-i)(2+i) is 4 - (i)^2, which is 4 - (-1) =5. So the total inner product is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, but wait a second. The initial statement says the state is proportional to that combination, so when I normalize, I just divide each coefficient by sqrt(7), right? So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down> ] / sqrt(7).

Next part of the question: calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator A. The matrix representation of A is given. The elements A_ij are hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. So what's the matrix form of A?

Well, for a 2x2 system (since it's spin up and down), the operator A would have elements:

A_11=0, A_12= hbar/2,
A_21= hbar/2, A_22=0.

Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 on the off-diagonal. So the matrix is:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0      ]

Hmm. So operator A is a spin operator, maybe similar to the Pauli matrices. Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

So the eigenstates of A will be the same as the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. Because the Pauli matrices are used for spin components, right?

Wait, the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates for spin in the x-direction. So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>.

So, the problem is asking for the probabilities of measuring the system in each of these eigenstates. Because when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes of the corresponding eigenstates in the state vector.

So, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x> and find the coefficients. The probability for each will be the square of the absolute value of these coefficients.

Alternatively, since A is proportional to sigma_x, the eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), but I'm not sure about the exact expressions. Let me write them down.

The eigenstates for sigma_x (which is the Pauli X matrix) are |+x> = (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|0> - |1>)/sqrt(2), but in this problem, the basis states are |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of sigma_z. So |up> corresponds to |0> and |down> to |1> in the standard notation.

So, the eigenstates of A are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, actually I think I got that wrong. Let me double-check. The eigenstates of sigma_x are such that sigma_x |+x> = +|+x>, and sigma_x |−x> = −|−x>.

The correct expressions are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute sigma_x acting on |+x>:

sigma_x |+x> = sigma_x (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) 
= (sigma_x |up> + sigma_x |down>)/sqrt(2)
= (|down> + |up>)/sqrt(2) = |+x>, so that's correct.

So yes, that's the correct expansion.

So, to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, I can write:

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>

Then, the probability of measuring a + eigenvalue (for A) is |a|^2, and for the - eigenvalue it's |b|^2.

Alternatively, since I can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>, I can compute the coefficients a and b by taking the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

So, let's compute a = < +x | alpha >, and b = < -x | alpha >.

But wait, |alpha> is already expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, so maybe it's easier to compute a and b by expressing |+x> and |-x> in terms of |up> and |down>, then taking the inner products.

Wait, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, the inner product < +x | alpha > is:

( ( < up | + < down | ) / sqrt(2) ) * |alpha>
= [ ( < up | alpha ) + ( < down | alpha ) ] / sqrt(2)

But |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

So, < up | alpha > is (1+i)/sqrt(7)
< down | alpha > is (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

So,

a = [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

Let me compute numerator: (1+i)+(2 -i) = 3 +0i. So a = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, compute b = < -x | alpha >.

| -x > is (|up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2)
So,

< -x | alpha > = [ < up | alpha - < down | alpha ] / sqrt(2)
= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) )

Compute numerator: (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i + i ) = (-1) + 2i.

So, b = ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14 )

Now, the probabilities are |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2: (3)^2 / (14) =9/14 ≈0.642857

Compute |b|^2: ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.3571429.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, and 5/14 is about 0.3571. Wait, but looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which matches these approximately.

Alternatively, let me compute a and b again to make sure.

Wait, a is [ (1+i) + (2-i) ] / sqrt(14) = (3)/sqrt(14)
So |a|^2 = (3)^2 / 14=9/14= ~0.642857.

b is ( (-1 +2i) ) / sqrt(14), so |b|^2 is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1+4)/14=5/14≈0.35714.

So the probabilities are approximately 9/14 and 5/14, which are 0.6428 and 0.3571, so roughly 0.64 and 0.36 when rounded.

So the first part of the answer, the probabilities, would be 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36). So that points to option A or B.

Now, the second part is to find the average value of the operator A.

The average value <A> is given by <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is a Hermitian operator, and |alpha> is a normalized state, <A> is the expectation value.

But perhaps there's a smarter way. Since A is diagonal in the eigenbasis of A, which is |+x> and |-x>. So, in that basis, A is diagonal with eigenvalues +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Wait, wait. Wait: the operator A has matrix elements A_ij = hbar/2 when i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 system, it's [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. So the eigenvalues can be found by solving det(A - lambda I) = 0.

The matrix is:

[ -lambda    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2   -lambda ]

The determinant is ( -lambda )^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = lambda^2 - (hbar^2)/4 =0 → lambda^2 = (hbar^2)/4 → lambda= ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

So, the expectation value <A> is sum ( eigenvalue * probability )

Which would be (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) )= [ (9 -5)/14 ] (hbar/2 ) = (4/14) (hbar/2 ) = (2/7) (hbar/2 ) = hbar/7.

Wait, 9/14 is probability for +hbar/2, and 5/14 for -hbar/2.

So:

< A > = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2)
= [ (9 -5) /14 ] * hbar/2
= (4/14) * hbar/2 
= (2/7) * (hbar/2)
= ( hbar ) /7 

So <A> is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A says average is hbar/7, which matches.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7. So option A is correct.

Wait, but let me check what the options are:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7 → matches.

Option D) has 0.61, 0.29, so that's different.

Wait, but wait, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. Let me compute 9/14 exactly.

9/14 is 0.642857..., which is approximately 0.64, and 5/14 is approximately 0.3571, which is 0.36 when rounded to two decimal places. So the probabilities fit option A.

So the answer should be option A.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by computing the inner product of the state with itself:

\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This operator is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, and its eigenstates are the spin eigenstates in the \( x \)-direction, denoted as \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), with eigenvalues \( +\frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively. These eigenstates are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle \right), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we compute the overlap of \( |\alpha\rangle \) with these eigenstates:

\[
a = \langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow | \alpha \rangle + \langle \downarrow | \alpha \rangle \right),
\]
\[
b = \langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow | \alpha \rangle - \langle \downarrow | \alpha \rangle \right).
\]

Substituting \( \langle \uparrow | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( \langle \downarrow | \alpha \rangle = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \), we find:

\[
a = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
b = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of \( a \) and \( b \):

\[
|a|^2 = \left( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64,
\]
\[
|b|^2 = \left( \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{1+4}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Thus, the probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively.

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is given by the expectation value \( \langle A \rangle \). Using the eigenbasis of \( A \), this is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \text{Prob}( |+x\rangle ) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \text{Prob}( |-x\rangle ) \cdot \left( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \right).
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \right) = \frac{9 - 5}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{4}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) 0.64, 0.36, and \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).**
