--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We're supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, wait. So the question is about the distribution of different Co(II) complexes in solution. The blue dithiocyanato complex is probably the one with two SCN- ligands. I remember that the stability constant (or formation constant) indicates how stable a complex is. Higher β means the complex is more stable.

The stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, what are these β values for? Oh right, each β corresponds to a different complex. I think βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ions. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]+, β2 for [Co(SCN)2], β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^2-, and β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^3-? Or wait, maybe I should double-check that. Alternatively, βn might refer to the stepwise formation constants, like each β is for adding one SCN- at a time. Oh wait, but if that's the case, the overall β for the complex with n ligands would be the product of the stepwise constants up to that point. But in this problem, the β's are given as the overall stability constants for each complex. So for [Co(SCN)]^+, β1=9; for [Co(SCN)2], β2=40; and so on.

Wait, no. Wait, I think I got it wrong. Because the stability constants are for each complex. So for the complex with 1 SCN-, the β is 9. For the complex with 2 SCN-, it's 40. For 3, 63, and 4, 16. So the complexes are Co(SCN)^(+), Co(SCN)2^0, Co(SCN)3^2-, and Co(SCN)4^3-.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the charges. Let's see: Co^2+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN- is -1. So:

- [Co(SCN)]^+ would have Co^2+ plus one SCN^- (charge -1). So 2+ + (-1) = +1. So the complex charge is +1.

- [Co(SCN)2] would be Co^2+ plus two SCN^- (each -1). So 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. So neutral.

- [Co(SCN)3]^2-: Co^2+ plus 3*(-1) = 2+ -3 = -1. Wait, but the overall charge is -2. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Wait, Co^2+ is +2. Three SCN^- each -1, so 3*(-1) = -3. So total charge is +2 -3 = -1. That would be a -1 charge, but the complex is [Co(SCN)3]^2-, which is -2. Hmm, perhaps each SCN is -1, but maybe the complex has a higher charge. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe each SCN is a different thing. Alternatively, perhaps I should just proceed with the given β values without worrying too much about the exact charge, as the problem doesn't require it.

But maybe the exact charge isn't needed for this problem. The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is the one with two SCN- ligands, so [Co(SCN)2], which has β2=40.

Our task is to find the percentage of this particular complex among all Co species.

So, the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the possible Co species. Each species is a complex with 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 SCN- ligands. But wait, wait, that's not right. Wait, Co can be in various complexes, but the problem states that the total Co concentration is 1e-2 M. That includes all forms: free Co^2+, [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)2], [Co(SCN)3]^2−, [Co(SCN)4]^3−.

Wait, but how about the possibility of [Co(SCN)4]^3-? Because the β4 is given as 16. Hmm, but in solution, the concentration of the ligand (SCN^-) is 0.1 M. So perhaps only the lower complexes are present. But I can't be sure without calculating.

But the key is to find the fraction of Co in the [Co(SCN)2] form. So, the approach is to calculate the distribution of Co among the various complexes, considering their stability constants and the concentrations of ligand and metal.

The general approach for such problems is to use the stability constants to calculate the fraction of each complex, then sum them to find the proportion of each.

The formula for the fraction of a particular complex is given by:

fraction of [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge} = (β_n * [SCN^-]^n ) / (1 + sum_{i=0}^4 (β_i * [SCN^-]^i) )

Wait, but wait. The stability constant β_n is the formation constant for the nth complex. So [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge} is formed by:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge}.

But the formation constant is defined as β_n = [ [Co(SCN)_n^{charge}] ] / ( [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n )

So the concentration of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

But the total Co concentration is the sum of all the complexes plus the free Co^2+.

So total Co concentration c = [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1 to 4} [Co(SCN)_n^{charge}] = [Co^2+] + sum ( β_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

We can factor out [Co^2+], so:

c = [Co^2+] (1 + sum_{n=1 to 4} β_n [SCN^-]^n )

So, [Co^2+] = c / (1 + sum_{n=1 to 4} β_n [SCN^-]^n )

Wait, but wait. Wait, the sum in the denominator is sum from n=1 to 4. Because the free Co^2+ is the first term, and the complexes are the others. So the denominator becomes 1 + sum_{n=1}^4 β_n [SCN^-]^n.

Once [Co^2+] is known, the concentration of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

So the fraction of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n] / c.

So the fraction f_n is ( β_n [SCN^-]^n [Co^2+] ) / c.

But since [Co^2+] = c / (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 β_n [SCN^-]^n ), substituting:

f_n = ( β_n [SCN^-]^n * c / denominator ) ) / c = ( β_n [SCN^-]^n ) / denominator,

where denominator is (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 β_n [SCN^-]^n )

So, denominator D = 1 + sum_{n=1}^4 (β_n [SCN^-]^n )

So f_n = β_n [SCN^-]^n / D.

But wait, wait. Wait, the denominator would actually be 1 + sum_{n=1}^4 (β_n [SCN^-]^n ), because each [Co(SCN)_n] is β_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n, and [Co^2+] is c/(D).

So, to compute f_n, for each n from 0 to 4, but wait n=0 is the free Co^2+.

Wait, but in our problem, we're interested in the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2. So, we can compute f_2 = (β_2 [SCN^-]^2 ) / D.

So, let's compute D:

D = 1 + (β1 [SCN]^1) + (β2 [SCN]^2) + (β3 [SCN]^3) + (β4 [SCN]^4)

Given that [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

So let's compute each term:

β1 [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

β2 [SCN]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4

β3 [SCN]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063

β4 [SCN]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016

So sum these up:

Sum = 0.9 + 0.4 = 1.3; 1.3 + 0.063 = 1.363; 1.363 + 0.0016 = 1.3646

So D = 1 + 1.3646 = 2.3646

Wait, no, wait. Wait, D is 1 plus the sum of all βn [SCN]^n terms.

So D = 1 + (0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = 1 + 1.3646 = 2.3646.

So D is approximately 2.3646.

Now, the fraction for n=2 is:

f_2 = (β2 [SCN]^2) / D = (0.4) / 2.3646 ≈ 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ let's calculate that.

0.4 divided by 2.3646.

Well, 2.3646 is about 2.3646. 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169. So about 16.9%?

Wait, but wait. Wait, that's the fraction of the [Co(SCN)2] complex. But the options include 16.9% as option D. But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Hmm, I thought dithiocyanato means two SCN ligands, which is this complex.

So why is the answer 16.9%? Because that's the fraction we just calculated. So the percentage would be approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Let me compute each term again.

β1 [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

β2 [SCN]^2 =40 * 0.01 =0.4

β3 [SCN]^3=63 * 0.001=0.063

β4 [SCN]^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016

Sum of these terms: 0.9 + 0.4 = 1.3; 1.3 + 0.063=1.363; 1.363 + 0.0016=1.3646.

So D =1 +1.3646=2.3646.

f_2=0.4 /2.3646 ≈ 0.1693, which is 16.93%. So approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but the options are: A) 42.3%, B) 25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

So the answer should be D.

But wait, another thought: what if the stability constants are given for the stepwise formation, not overall? Oh, that would complicate things. Because then, the overall β for [Co(SCN)_n] would be the product of β1 to βn. But in the problem statement, it says "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So it's more likely that each βn is the overall stability constant for the [Co(SCN)_n] complex.

So I think my calculation is correct. So the percentage is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]) among all cobalt-containing species, we use the stability constants provided and the given concentrations of Co²⁺ and SCN⁻. The stability constant β₂ = 40 corresponds to the [Co(SCN)₂] complex. The total cobalt concentration is given as 10⁻² M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M.

The fraction of a specific cobalt complex is calculated using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{D}
\]

where \(D = 1 + \sum_{n=1}^4 \beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n\), and \(f_n\) is the fraction of the cobalt species with \(n\) thiocyanate ligands.

### Step 1: Calculate \(D\)
The denominator \(D\) is computed as:

\[
D = 1 + \sum_{n=1}^4 \beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n
\]

Given \([\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M}\), we calculate each term:

- \(\beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \times 0.1 = 0.9\)
- \(\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \times (0.1)^2 = 40 \times 0.01 = 0.4\)
- \(\beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \times (0.1)^3 = 63 \times 0.001 = 0.063\)
- \(\beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \times (0.1)^4 = 16 \times 0.0001 = 0.0016\)

Summing these terms:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^4 \beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n = 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 1.3646
\]

Thus:

\[
D = 1 + 1.3646 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]
The fraction of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{D} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.1693
\]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[
f_2 \times 100 \approx 16.93\%
\]

### Conclusion
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]) among all cobalt-containing species is approximately **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.
