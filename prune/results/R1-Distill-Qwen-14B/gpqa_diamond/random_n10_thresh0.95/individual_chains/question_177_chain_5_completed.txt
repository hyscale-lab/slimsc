Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. 

Alright, what do I know? Well, Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. And the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. So M1 = 1.5 M2. Interesting, so both radius and mass are 1.5 times bigger for Star_1.

The question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a star's emission is related to its temperature. That's from Wien's Law, right? Wien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature T. So λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So if both have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.

The stars are radiating as black bodies, so their luminosity should follow the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So since both stars have the same temperature, the luminosity depends on the radius squared.

Given R1 is 1.5 R2, then L1 would be (1.5)^2 times L2. Because L is proportional to R² T⁴, and T is same. So (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 = 2.25 L2. So the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2.

Wait, but the options include 2.25 as option A. So that would be straightforward. But wait the question mentions radial velocities. Oh, right! The radial velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2. So Star_1 isn't moving towards or away from us, while Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s. How does that affect the luminosity calculation?

Hmm wait, the luminosity as calculated from the blackbody formula is the intrinsic luminosity, not the observed flux. The observed flux would be affected by distance and Doppler shift. But the question is about the computed luminosity, not the observed brightness. So perhaps the Doppler shift doesn't affect the intrinsic luminosity. Oh, but wait, in the problem statement, they computed the luminosity using the blackbody formula, which depends on the observed wavelength.

Wait, wait. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, there's a Doppler shift in the observed wavelengths. The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So if Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted, which would shift the peak wavelength. But the problem says the peak wavelengths are the same. So how does that affect the calculation of temperature?

Ah, this is a crucial point. Because if there's a Doppler shift, the observed wavelength is λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v/c) for receding, or (1 - v/c) for approaching. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. That's a significant velocity, so the Doppler effect would cause a shift.

But wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the observed wavelength for both peaks is the same. But for Star_2, which is moving away (v=700 km/s), its emitted peak wavelength would be shorter than what we observe. Because when a source is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). So for Star_2, the emitted λ_max would be λ_observed / (1 + v/c), where v is positive for receding.

Similarly, for Star_1, which has 0 radial velocity, its observed λ_max is the same as its emitted λ_max. So Star_1's emitted λ_max is the same as observed. Star_2's emitted λ_max is shorter than observed.

But wait, the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So for both stars, λ1_obs = λ2_obs. But because Star_2 is moving away, its emitted λ_max is shorter. So Star_1's emitted λ is same as observed. Star_2's emitted λ is λ_obs * (1 - v/c) because it's moving away. Wait, no, the formula for Doppler shift is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c) for receding. So for Star_2, λ_emit = λ_obs / (1 + v/c).

So, from the problem statement, both observed λ_max are the same. Let me denote λ1_obs = λ2_obs = λ.

So, Star_1's emitted λ_max is λ1_emit = λ1_obs because its radial velocity is zero.

Star_2's emitted λ_max is λ2_emit = λ2_obs / (1 + v2/c), where v2 is 700 km/s.

But since the stars are blackbody emitters, their emitted peak wavelengths are λ = b / T. So:

λ1_emit = b / T1
λ2_emit = b / T2

But in reality, because of the Doppler effect, we observe λ1_obs = λ1_emit, and λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v2/c).

But the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs = λ.

So:

λ1_emit = λ = b / T1
λ2_emit = λ / (1 + v2/c) = b / T2

Wait, no, I think I might have messed up. Let me rephrase. The observed λ for Star_2 is λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v2/c) because it's moving away. So λ2_emit = λ2_obs / (1 + v2/c).

But since the observed λ for both is the same, λ = λ2_obs.

So:

λ1_emit = λ / (1 + v1/c) → but v1 is 0, so λ1_emit = λ.

λ2_emit = λ / (1 + v2/c) → since v2 is 700 km/s.

But the emitted λ depends on the temperature. So:

For Star_1: λ1_emit = b / T1 → T1 = b / λ1_emit = b / λ.

For Star_2: λ2_emit = b / T2 → T2 = b / λ2_emit = b / (λ / (1 + v2/c)) ) = (b (1 + v2/c)) ) / λ.

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

Wait, because T1 is b/λ, and T2 is b (1 + v2/c) / λ.

So T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c). But that would suggest that Star_2 is hotter than Star_1. But wait, Star_2 is moving away, so its light is redshifted. If we didn't account for Doppler, we would infer a lower temperature for Star_2, because λ_obs is longer. But because the observed λ is same as Star_1, which is not moving, we have to correct for the Doppler shift.

So, in reality, Star_2's temperature is higher than Star_1's. Because T2 has that (1 + v2/c) factor.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If a star is moving away, its observed wavelengths are longer. So without knowing the velocity, you would calculate a lower temperature. But since the observed λ_peak is same as Star_1, and considering the velocity, we have to adjust the temperature calculation.

So, for Star_2, the actual emitted temperature is higher than what you would calculate based on observed λ. So T2 is T2_observed * (1 + v2/c). Wait, no, because the observed λ is longer, so without Doppler, the inferred temperature would be lower. But in reality, the emitted λ is shorter, so higher temperature.

So, to compute the actual temperature, we have to correct for the Doppler shift.

So, T1 = b / λ1_emit = b / λ_obs.

T2 = b / λ2_emit = b / (λ_obs / (1 + v2/c)) ) = b (1 + v2/c) / λ_obs → T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c).

So, the actual temperature of Star_2 is higher than that inferred from the observed λ.

So, when calculating the luminosity, which depends on T^4, we have to use the actual temperatures, not the observed (shifted) ones.

Because luminosity is intrinsic, not observed.

Wait, but the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity assuming blackbody radiation. So they would have used the observed wavelengths to compute the temperature, right? Or would they have corrected for Doppler shift?

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let's read the question again.

The question says, "Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So, the observed λ_max is same. So, the astronomers see λ_max same for both.

But for Star_2, which is moving away, the emitted λ_max is λ_emit = λ_observed / (1 + v/c), where v is 700 km/s.

But the astronomers computed the luminosity assuming blackbody; that is, they would have taken the observed λ_max to compute the temperature. So, perhaps they used T = b / λ_observed for both stars. But that would be incorrect because for Star_2, λ_obs is longer due to redshift, so they would calculate a lower temperature, but in reality, Star_2 is hotter.

Wait, but the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor of... So perhaps they didn't account for the Doppler shift. Let me think.

Alternatively, the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same, but the actual emitted wavelengths are different. So, when computing the luminosity, the astronomers would use the observed λ_max, which is same for both, so same T. But that's incorrect because the actual temperatures are different.

Wait, but this seems a bit confusing. Let me try to break it down.

The correct approach is that the luminosity depends on T^4 and R^2. So if the astronomers are computing the luminosity correctly, they must have corrected for the Doppler effect, using the actual emitted temperatures. But if they didn't correct for Doppler, their computed T would be wrong.

But the problem states that the astronomers found the same wavelengths (the same λ_max observed). So, for their calculations, they might have used the same T for both stars. But that's incorrect because Star_2 is moving away, so it's actually hotter.

Wait, but the problem says they computed the luminosity assuming blackbody. So, whether they accounted for the Doppler shift or not is crucial.

I think the key here is that the luminosity computed by the astronomers would be based on the observed parameters, which include the Doppler shift. So, they would use the observed λ_max to compute the temperature, which would be lower for Star_2, and then calculate luminosity.

But, that would be incorrect because the actual temperature is higher. But the problem says they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So, perhaps the question is assuming that they did not account for the Doppler shift in the temperature, and thus incorrectly inferred T?

Wait, no. Let me read the problem again.

They computed the luminosities, knowing the wavelengths. So, perhaps they used the observed (shifted) wavelengths to compute T. But that would lead to incorrect T for Star_2.

Wait, but the problem says, "Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So, the computation uses the observed wavelengths, which are the same. So, the astronomers would calculate the same T for both stars, but in reality, the temperatures are different.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if they computed T based on observed λ_max, and the λ_max are same, they would have same T. But Star_2 is moving away, so its actual T is higher. So, the computed luminosity would be lower for Star_2, but the actual luminosity is higher.

But the question is about what the astronomers computed, not the actual luminosity. Because the problem says, "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So, in their computation, they think T1 = T2, because their observed λ_max is same. So, based on that, their computed luminosity would be L = 4π R^2 σ T^4.

So, L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 → but they think T1 = T2, so (T1/T2) =1, so L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, which is option A.

But wait, in reality, T2 is higher, so L2 would actually be higher. But the problem isn't asking about the real luminosity; it's asking about what the astronomers computed. So if they didn't account for the Doppler shift, they would compute L1 being 2.25 times L2.

But wait, the problem says the observed wavelengths are same. So, when the astronomers compute T, they would get T1 = T2 because λ1_obs = λ2_obs. But in reality, T2 is higher.

But the problem says they computed the luminosity, assuming black bodies. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the luminosity using the observed parameters.

Wait, no. Because the question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. So, the astronomers computed it based on the observed data, which would have used the observed λ_max (same for both). So, their computed T is same for both, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

But wait, the problem says that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. So, the astronomers know the velocities? Because if they know the velocities, they can correct for Doppler shift when computing temperature.

Wait, the question says, "Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity." So, perhaps they used the observed λ_max and the Doppler shift to compute the actual T. So, for Star_1, T1 = b / λ1_obs. For Star_2, the observed λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v2/c). So, λ2_emit = λ2_obs / (1 + v2/c). Then T2 = b / λ2_emit = b (1 + v2/c) / λ2_obs. Since λ1_obs = λ2_obs, T2 = (1 + v2/c) T1.

So, if the astronomers correct for Doppler shift, their computed T for Star_2 would be higher.

So, in that case, the luminosity would be L = 4π R^2 σ T^4. So, L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)^2 σ T1^4. L2 = 4π R2^2 σ [T1 (1 + v/c)]^4.

So, L1 / L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 (T1 (1 + v/c))^4 ) )

Simplify: (1.5^2) * (T1^4) / ( T1^4 (1 + v/c)^4 ) ) → 1.5^2 / (1 + v/c)^4.

But wait, v is 700 km/s, but we need to express it in terms of c. Let me compute v/c. The speed of light is approximately 3e5 km/s, so 700 km/s is 700 / 3e5 ≈ 0.002333 or 0.2333%. So, (1 + v/c) ≈ 1.002333.

So, (1 + v/c)^4 is approximately 1 + 4*(v/c) + ... ≈ 1.009333.

Wait, but let me compute (1.002333)^4. Let's compute it:

(1.002333)^2 = approx 1.004666. Then squared again: (1.004666)^2 ≈ 1.009355.

So, (1 + v/c)^4 ≈ 1.009355.

So, the ratio L1/L2 is (2.25) / (1.009355) ≈ approx 2.228.

So, about 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23. So the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but why did I include the Doppler effect now? Because the astronomers are using the observed data, which includes the Doppler shift. So, if they compute the temperature correctly, then T2 is higher. So, in their computation, they would calculate a higher T for Star_2, which would affect the luminosity.

Wait, but earlier I thought that if they didn't account for Doppler, then L1/L2 would be 2.25. But if they did account for Doppler, then the factor would be about 2.23.

Which is what the options suggest. So, in the problem statement, it says that the astronomers computed the luminosity. So, do they account for Doppler shift when calculating the temperature? It depends on whether the calculation of the temperature involves knowing the Doppler shift.

Wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, the observed λ_max is same. So, the astronomers might have calculated T using the observed λ_max, without considering the Doppler shift. So, their computed T1 = T2 = b/λ.

But in reality, T2 is higher due to the Doppler effect. So, when computing luminosity, if they use the actual T, but the problem states that they computed based on observed data.

This is a bit confusing. I think the key is that when computing luminosity, the formula uses the star's actual temperature, which depends on the Doppler shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the observed luminosities are being compared, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. The question is about the ratio of luminosities based on the given data, considering that the observed wavelengths are same, but considering that the Doppler shift affects the inferred temperature.

Wait, the problem says that astronomers computed the luminosity 'assuming the stars radiate as black bodies'. So, perhaps they used the observed λ_max to compute T for each star, but for Star_2, due to Doppler shift, the actual T is higher. So, the computed luminosity would be based on the observed λ_max (same T for both stars), leading to L1 = 2.25 L2.

But if the calculation accounts for the Doppler shift (because the astronomers know the radial velocities), then they would compute different Ts and thus a different L ratio.

So, the problem states that the astronomers calculated radial velocities of 0 and 700 km/s. So, they know the velocities. Therefore, when computing the luminosity, they would account for the Doppler shift to get the correct T.

So, the correct approach is to compute the actual T for each star, considering their velocities, then compute the luminosity.

So, for Star_1: v = 0 → T1 = b / λ_obs.

For Star_2: v =700 km/s → λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c) → λ_emit = λ_obs / (1 + v/c).

Then, T2 = b / λ_emit = b (1 + v/c) / λ_obs = (1 + v/c) T1.

So, T2 = T1 (1 + v/c).

Then, L1 = 4π R1^2 σ T1^4.

L2 =4π R2^2 σ T2^4 = 4π R2^2 σ (T1 (1 + v/c))^4.

So, L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1 / T2)^4 → substitute R1 = 1.5 R2, and T2 = T1 (1 + v/c).

So, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (1 / (1 + v/c))^4.

Which is 2.25 * (1 / (1 + v/c))^4.

Now, v is 700 km/s. Let's compute (1 + v/c):

v =700 km/s.

c =3e5 km/s.

v/c = 700 / 300000 = 0.00233333...

So, (1 + v/c) ≈ 1.00233333.

(1 + v/c)^4 ≈ (1.0023333)^4.

Compute that: using binomial approx for small x.

(1+x)^4 ≈ 1 +4x +6x² +4x³ +x⁴.

x=0.0023333.

x² ≈ 5.44e-6, x³≈ 1.25e-8, x⁴≈ 3e-10.

So,

1 +4*(0.0023333) +6*(5.44e-6) + ... 

= 1 +0.0093333 + 3.264e-5 ≈ 1.0093659.

So, 1/(1.0023333)^4 ≈ 1/(1.0093659) ≈ approx 0.9907.

Wait, no, because (1.0023333)^4 ≈ 1.0093659, so 1/(1.0093659) ≈ 0.9907.

Wait, but wait: (1 + v/c) is about 1.002333. Its fourth power is about 1.0093659.

So, 1/(1.0093659) ≈ 0.9907.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227.

Which is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

So, the correct answer is D) ~2.23.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we analyze the problem using the given data and the relationships between luminosity, radius, temperature, and Doppler shift.

### Key Information:
1. **Radius and Mass Ratios**:  
   Star_1 has a radius \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and a mass \( M_1 = 1.5 M_2 \).  
   However, the mass does not directly affect the luminosity calculation, so we focus on the radius.

2. **Wavelengths and Temperature**:  
   The observed peak wavelengths \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) for both stars are the same. Using Wien's Law (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T \)), the observed wavelengths suggest that the temperatures inferred from the observations (\( T_{\text{obs}} \)) would appear the same for both stars. However, Star_2 has a radial velocity of \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), which causes a Doppler shift. This means the actual temperature of Star_2 (\( T_2 \)) is higher than the observed temperature.

3. **Doppler Correction for Temperature**:  
   The Doppler shift formula relates the observed wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) to the emitted wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{emit}} \)) as:  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot (1 + v/c)
   \]
   For Star_2, the emitted wavelength is shorter due to the redshift, so its actual temperature is:  
   \[
   T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v/c)
   \]
   where \( T_1 \) is the temperature of Star_1.

4. **Luminosity Formula**:  
   The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:  
   \[
   L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
   \]
   Since the stars radiate as black bodies, the luminosity depends on the radius squared and the temperature to the fourth power.

5. **Luminosity Ratio**:  
   The ratio of the luminosities is:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
   \]
   Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v/c) \), we get:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (1.5)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{1 + v/c}\right)^4
   \]

6. **Doppler Factor**:  
   The radial velocity of Star_2 is \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), and the speed of light is \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \). Thus:  
   \[
   \frac{v}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
   \]
   The Doppler factor is:  
   \[
   (1 + v/c)^4 \approx (1.002333)^4 \approx 1.009366
   \]

7. **Final Calculation**:  
   Substituting into the luminosity ratio:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot \frac{1}{1.009366} \approx 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.227
   \]

### Conclusion:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2 when accounting for the Doppler shift.
