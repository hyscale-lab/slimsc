Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's see what I remember from my studies.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between those levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, I think I need to use the Boltzmann distribution here. 

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels to temperature. The formula I remember is (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where n_i and n_j are the number densities of the energy levels, E_i and E_j are their energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the excitation level in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, let's say for star_1, the ratio is n1_upper / n1_lower = 2. For star_2, it's n2_upper / n2_lower. But wait, since the energy level difference is the same for both stars, E_upper - E_lower is the same value, delta E = 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, the problem says that the energy difference is approximately that value. So, delta E = 1.38e-23 J for both stars.

So, applying the Boltzmann equation for both stars. Let me denote T1 as the temperature of star 1 and T2 for star 2.

For star 1:
n1_upper / n1_lower = exp( -deltaE/(k*T1) )

Similarly, for star 2:
n2_upper / n2_lower = exp( -deltaE/(k*T2) )

But the problem states that star_1's excitation is twice that of star_2. So, n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower ). Because star_1 has twice as excited, so the ratio is double.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. Does that mean the population in the excited state is twice as high? Or perhaps the ratio is twice as much?

Yes, I think it means that the ratio of excited to lower state is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So,

(n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower )

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions:

exp( -deltaE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -deltaE/(k T2) )

Hmm. Let me take natural logs of both sides to simplify.

ln(exp( -deltaE/(k T1) )) = ln( 2 * exp( -deltaE/(k T2) ) )

Simplify left side: -deltaE/(k T1 ) = ln(2) + ln( exp( -deltaE/(k T2) ) )

The right side: ln(2) + [ -deltaE/(k T2) ]

So,

- deltaE/(k T1) = ln(2) - deltaE/(k T2 )

Let me rearrange this equation to solve for T1 and T2.

Bring the deltaE terms to one side:

- deltaE/(k T1) + deltaE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out deltaE/(k):

deltaE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Wait, because if I factor deltaE/(k), it's:

deltaE/(k) [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] = ln(2)

Wait, no. Let me see. Let's take the equation again:

- (deltaE)/(k T1) = ln(2) - (deltaE)/(k T2 )

Bring all terms to the left side:

- (deltaE)/(k T1) + (deltaE)/(k T2) - ln(2) = 0

Factor deltaE/(k):

(deltaE)/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] - ln(2) = 0

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's rearrange the terms:

deltaE/(k T2) - deltaE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor deltaE/(k):

deltaE/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

So,

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (ln(2) * k ) / deltaE

Hmm. But the options don't include any terms with constants like k and deltaE. So perhaps we can express the temperatures in terms of each other.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express T2 in terms of T1 or vice versa.

Wait, let's think. Let me denote x = T1 / T2, so T2 = T1 / x.

Then, the equation becomes:

1/(T2) - 1/T1 = (ln2 * k ) / deltaE

Substituting T2 = T1/x:

x/(T1) - 1/(T1) = (ln2 *k ) / deltaE

Factor 1/(T1):

[ x -1 ] / T1 = (ln2 *k ) / deltaE

Hmm, but I don't think this is helping me directly. Maybe I should instead get T1 and T2 in terms of each other without introducing variables.

Wait, perhaps I can write the initial equation as:

deltaE/(k T2) - deltaE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor deltaE/(k):

deltaE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Let me write this as:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (ln 2 * k ) / deltaE

Hmm, but how does this relate to the options given? Let me look at the options again.

The options are equations involving ln(2) = some combination of T1 and T2.

Wait, perhaps I can rearrange the equation to get ln(2) equals something.

Wait, starting from the equation after the logs:

- deltaE/(k T1) = ln(2) - deltaE/(k T2 )

Bring all terms to the right:

ln(2) = deltaE/(k T2) - deltaE/(k T1 )

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = (deltaE)/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ]

So,

ln(2) = [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] * (deltaE)/(k )

But none of the options have deltaE or k as terms. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, I think I need to consider that in LTE, the excitation is determined by the ratio of the populations, which depends on temperature. So the ratio of the excitation is given as 2. So, maybe I should express this ratio in terms of the temperatures.

Wait, the initial ratio is (n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2*(n2_upper / n2_lower )

So, from Boltzmann:

exp( - deltaE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( - deltaE/(k T2) )

Wait, that's the same as before. Let me take the ratio of the two Boltzmann factors.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the ratio of the two equations.

n1_upper/n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower )

But,

n1_upper/n1_lower = exp( - deltaE/(k T1) )

n2_upper/n2_lower = exp( - deltaE/(k T2) )

So,

exp( - deltaE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( - deltaE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( - deltaE/(k T2) ):

exp( - deltaE/(k T1) + deltaE/(k T2) ) = 2

Take natural log:

- deltaE/(k T1) + deltaE/(k T2) ) = ln(2 )

Factor deltaE/(k):

deltaE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ) = ln(2 )

Now, the equation is:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = [ ln(2) * k ] / deltaE

But I don't know the value of [ ln(2) *k ] / deltaE. Hmm, perhaps it's a constant, but the options don't include any such terms. So maybe I need to manipulate it differently.

Wait, perhaps I can express 1/T2 in terms of 1/T1 plus some term. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps I can rearrange the equation:

(1/T2) = (ln 2 *k )/(deltaE) + (1/T1 )

But that still doesn't directly match any of the options. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: ln(2) = T2/T1

No, that would suggest the ratio of temperatures, but I don't think that's correct.

Option B: ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 * T2 )

Hmm, that would be (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2) = (1/T2 + 1/T1 )

Which, from our equation, [1/T2 - 1/T1 ] is something, but this option has [1/T2 + 1/T1 ].

Option C: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )^2 

Not sure about this. Doesn't look like anything I have.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, let's see.

From our equation:

(1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = [ ln(2) k ] / deltaE 

Multiply both sides by (T1 T2 )

(T1 - T2 ) = [ ln(2) k T1 T2 ] / deltaE 

So,

(T1 - T2) = [ ln(2) * k / deltaE ] * T1 T2 

Which can be rewritten as,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) * deltaE / (k T1 T2 )

But this doesn't directly match any options. The options don't include deltaE or k, which makes me think I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait a second. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's re-examine the initial setup.

The ratio of excitation is 2, so:

(n_upper / n_lower)_1 = 2 * (n_upper / n_lower)_2 

Expressed as:

exp( - deltaE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( - deltaE/(k T2) )

Taking logs:

- deltaE/(k T1) = ln(2) - deltaE/(k T2 )

Rearranging:

deltaE/(k T2) - deltaE/(k T1) = ln(2 )

Factor deltaE/(k):

deltaE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2 )

Which is the same as before.

Wait, maybe I can write it as:

( 1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ( ln(2) * k ) / deltaE 

But the options don't have this form.

Wait, perhaps I can express (1/T2 - 1/T1) as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Because:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Yes, that's correct.

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ( ln(2) * k ) / deltaE 

But again, that doesn't directly help because the equation involves a constant term on the right. However, looking at the options, option D has ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, but according to the equation, (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) equals ( ln(2) k )/deltaE. So,

ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) * deltaE ] / (k T1 T2 )

But unless deltaE / k is a known value, that's not directly helpful.

Wait, the given deltaE is 1.38e-23 J. Hmm, Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh! Wait, that's interesting. Let me compute (deltaE)/(k).

deltaE = 1.38e-23 J

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

So,

deltaE/k = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K ) ) = 1 K.

Wow, that's a nice simplification.

So, (deltaE)/(k) = 1 K.

So, going back to our equation:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ( ln(2) * k ) / deltaE 

Wait, no, earlier equation was:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ( ln(2) * k ) / deltaE 

But after substituting deltaE/k =1 K, the right-hand side becomes (ln 2 ) * (1 K) ) / (deltaE) ?

Wait, wait, no. Let me go back to the equation:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ( ln(2) * k ) / deltaE 

But deltaE = k * 1, because deltaE/k =1, so k = deltaE. So,

( ln(2) * deltaE ) / deltaE ) = ln(2 )

So,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2 )

Which can be rewritten as:

( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

Which is the same as,

ln(2 ) = ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 )

Which matches option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1*T2 )

So, the correct equation is option D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the excitation of iron atoms in the photospheres of two stars under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann distribution relates the population ratio of two energy levels to temperature:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(n_{\text{upper}}\) and \(n_{\text{lower}}\) are the populations of the upper and lower energy levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratio is given as:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}}_1 = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}}_2.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions for each star:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \(\Delta E / k\):

\[
\Delta E / k \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Substituting \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\) and \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), we find:

\[
\Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K}.
\]

Thus, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\) as \(\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\), we obtain:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options do not align with the derived equation:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it suggests a simple ratio of temperatures, which is not supported by the derivation.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it involves the sum of reciprocals, which does not match the derived equation.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it introduces an unnecessary squared term in the denominator.
- **Option D**: Correct, as it matches the derived equation.

Thus, the correct equation for the effective temperatures is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
