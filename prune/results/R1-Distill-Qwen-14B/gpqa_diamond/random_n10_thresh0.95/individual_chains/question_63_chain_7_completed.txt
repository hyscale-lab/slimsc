--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diatomic molecules and their energy states. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll take it step by step.

The question says that the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is a non-rigid rotor model. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, the non-rigid rotor is also called the rotational-vibrational model. So this model considers both rotation and vibration of the molecule.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So, if it absorbs a photon, it needs to transition to the next lowest energy state. To find the momentum of the photon, I guess I need to calculate the energy difference between these two states and then relate it to the photon's momentum.

Wait, but wait. How do the energy levels work in this model? I remember that for a rigid rotor (which is a simpler model), the energy levels are quantized and depend on the rotational quantum number. But the non-rigid rotor probably includes vibration as well.

Oh right, the rotational-vibrational model combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels. So the energy levels are a combination of these two. Each vibrational state can have multiple rotational states.

The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So if the molecule absorbs a photon, it can either go to a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So probably, the transition is to the next higher vibrational state, v=1, with J still 0? Or maybe the next higher rotational state within the same vibrational level?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The energy levels for a diatomic molecule in the non-rigid rotor model are given by a formula that combines rotational and vibrational energies. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact formula. Maybe I should recall the general approach.

Vibrational energy levels are quantized and given by E_v = (v + 1/2) ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number (v=0,1,2...). Rotational energy levels are E_J = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

So the total energy would be the sum of these two. But when the molecule is in the fundamental state, v=0 and J=0. So the next possible state with the lowest energy would be either increasing J by 1 (so J=1, v=0) or increasing v by 1 (v=1, J=0). Which transition has a lower energy difference?

Let me calculate both possibilities to see which requires less energy. Because the question is about the photon with the momentum corresponding to the smallest possible energy increase.

So first, let's compute the energy difference for each transition.

First, the vibrational transition: from v=0 to v=1.

ΔE_vibrational = E_v=1 - E_v=0 = ( (1 + 1/2 ) - (0 + 1/2 ) ) ħω = (1) ħω = ħω.

Second, the rotational transition: from J=0 to J=1.

ΔE_rotational = E_J=1 - E_J=0 = [ (2) * ħ²/(2I) ] - 0 = (2/(2I)) ħ² * (1) = ħ²/(I).

Wait, let's calculate that correctly. E_J=1 is (1*(1+1))/something... Oh wait the formula is E_J = [ ħ² J (J+1) ] / (2I ). So for J=0, E_J=0. For J=1, E_J = (1*2 ħ² )/(2I ) = (2 ħ² )/(2I ) = ħ²/I.

So ΔE_rotational = ħ²/I.

So the question is which transition requires less energy: the vibrational or the rotational one. Because the photon's energy needs to match the energy difference. If the vibrational transition requires less energy, then that's the one to consider. Otherwise, the rotational.

So I need to compare ΔE_vibrational and ΔE_rotational.

Let me compute both and see.

First, I'll need ħ, which is the reduced Planck's constant. I think ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

But wait, let's get all the variables set.

Given:

Mass of X, Mx = 20 amu.
Mass of Y, My = 2 amu.
Bond length, R = 2 angstroms.
Angular frequency, ω = 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, moment of inertia I is given by I = μ R^2, where μ is the reduced mass.

So first, compute μ.

μ = (Mx * My ) / (Mx + My )

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, amu needs to be converted to kg. One atomic mass unit is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 * 2 ) / (22 ) * 1.660539e-27 kg.

Wait, wait, 20 * 2 is 40. 40 /22 is 20/11 ≈ 1.818. So 1.818 amu.

So μ = 1.818 * 1.660539e-27 kg ≈ let me calculate that.

1.818 * 1.660539e-27 ≈ Let's compute 1.818 * 1.660539 ≈

1.818 * 1.66 is about 2.999, so approximately 3e-27 kg.

Wait, wait more accurately: 1.818 * 1.660539.

Let me compute 1.8 * 1.660539 = 1.8 * 1.660539 = (1.660539 * 1.8)

1.660539 * 1.8: 1 * 1.8=1.8, 0.660539 *1.8 ≈ 1.189. So total about 2.989.

So μ ≈ 2.989e-27 kg.

But R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 m, so R = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ R² = (2.989e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2.

Compute (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = 2.989e-27 * 4e-20 = (2.989 *4 )e-47 = approx 11.956e-47 kg m².

Wait, 2.989 *4 is about 11.956, so I ≈ 1.1956e-46 kg m².

Wait, let me compute that again. 2.989e-27 *4e-20 = (2.989 *4 ) * 1e-47.

Yes, 2.989 *4 is ≈11.956, so I ≈1.1956e-46 kg m².

Wait, wait, no: 2e-10 squared is 4e-20, so 4e-20. So 2.989e-27 *4e-20 is 2.989 *4 = 11.956, exponents 1e-27 *1e-20 =1e-47. So I is 11.956e-47 kg m², which is 1.1956e-46 kg m².

Okay, so I is around 1.1956e-46 kg m².

Now, ΔE_rotational is (ħ²)/(2I) multiplied by (2J+1), but wait no, the formula is E_J = [ ħ² J (J+1) ] / (2I ). So from J=0 to J=1, ΔE_rotational is E_J=1 - E_J=0.

E_J=1 is [ ħ² * 2 ] / (2I ) = [ ħ² ] / I.

So ΔE_rotational = ħ² / I.

Compute that:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ² is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ (approx 1.112e-68 J² s²).

Wait, let me compute 1.0545718e-34 squared.

1.0545718e-34 *1.0545718e-34 = (1.05457)^2 * 1e-68 ≈ 1.112e-68.

So, ħ² ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s²? Wait, no, wait. Because J is Joules, which is kg m²/s². So ħ² has units of (J s)^2 = (kg m²/s² * s )^2 = (kg m²/s )^2. Hmm, perhaps that's complicating. Anyway, let's proceed.

So, ΔE_rotational = (1.112e-68 J² s² ) / (1.1956e-46 kg m² )

Wait, wait, hold on, no. Let me compute the units to make sure.

I is in kg m², so ħ² has units (J s)^2. J is kg m²/s². So (J s) is kg m²/s. Squared is kg² m^4 / s². So ħ² has units kg² m^4 / s².

I has units kg m². So ħ² / I has units [ kg² m^4 / s² ] / [ kg m² ] ) = kg m²/s², which is Joules. So that's correct.

So let's compute the numerator and denominator.

ħ² ≈ (1.05457e-34)^2 = let me compute that accurately.

1.05457e-34 *1.05457e-34 = (1.05457)^2 * 1e-68.

1.05457^2 ≈ 1.112.

So ħ² ≈1.112e-68 (kg² m^4 ) / s².

I =1.1956e-46 kg m².

So ΔE_rotational = 1.112e-68 / 1.1956e-46 = (1.112 /1.1956 ) * 1e-22.

1.112 /1.1956 ≈ 0.93.

So approximately 0.93e-22 J, so 9.3e-23 J.

Wait, but wait the order of exponents: 1e-68 / 1e-46 is 1e-22.

So 1.112e-68 /1.1956e-46 = (1.112 /1.1956) *1e-22 ≈0.93 *1e-22 = 9.3e-23 J.

Hmm, now the vibrational energy difference is ΔE_vibrational = ħ ω.

ħ is 1.05457e-34 J s.

ω is 4e14 rad/s.

So ΔE_vibrational = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

So ΔE_vibrational is 4.218e-20 J, which is much larger than the rotational transition's 9.3e-23 J.

Wait, that can't be right, because I thought the rotational transitions often have lower energy differences. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, I think I may have messed up μ.

Wait, Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My ) = (20 * 2 )/(22 ) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

Yes that's correct.

Then, converting μ to kg: 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu.

1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ Let me compute that accurately.

1.818 *1.6605e-27 = approximately 2.999e-27 kg. Wait, let me compute 1.818 *1.6605.

1.818 *1.6605: 1 *1.6605=1.6605, 0.818 *1.6605≈ 1.361 (since 0.8 *1.6605 is about 1.328, 0.018 *1.6605≈0.03). So total is 1.6605 +1.361=3.0215.

Wait, wait no, 1.818 is 1 + 0.8 +0.018.

Wait, 1.818 = 1 + 0.8 + 0.018.

So 1*1.6605=1.6605.

0.8 *1.6605 =1.3284.

0.018 *1.6605=0.02989.

Adding them up: 1.6605 +1.3284 =2.9889 +0.02989=3.0188.

So μ=3.0188e-27 kg.

Ah, so I was wrong earlier. It's about 3.0188e-27 kg, not 2.989e-27. So that changes the I.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ R² = 3.0188e-27 kg * (2e-10 m )² = 3.0188e-27 *4e-20 = 3.0188 *4 =12.075e-47 kg m².

Wait, 12.075e-47 is 1.2075e-46 kg m².

Ah, so I is about 1.2075e-46 kg m².

So now, ΔE_rotational = ħ²/(I ) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.2075e-46 )

Compute the numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68.

So 1.112e-68 / 1.2075e-46 = (1.112 /1.2075 ) *1e-22.

1.112 /1.2075 ≈ 0.921.

So approximately 0.921e-22 J =9.21e-23 J.

That's the rotational transition energy difference.

The vibrational transition is 4.218e-20 J.

So 9.21e-23 J is much smaller than 4.218e-20 J.

Wait, so the rotational transition requires less energy. So the molecule would first undergo a rotational transition before a vibrational one. So the photon must have energy equal to the rotational transition energy difference.

Wait, but the question asks for the photon that allows the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state after the fundamental state is the one with the lowest energy, which would be the one with either J=1, v=0 or v=1, J=0.

Since the rotational transition requires less energy, that's the next state. So the photon's energy must match the rotational transition.

So the energy of the photon is ΔE_rotational = 9.21e-23 J.

But wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Hmm, because photons have energy E = pc, where p is momentum and c is the speed of light.

So p = E / c.

So compute p = 9.21e-23 J / (3e8 m/s )

9.21e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but none of the options look like that. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) 1.9e-28 Ns
B) 2.3e-27 Ns
C) 1.1e-27 Ns
D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, 3.07e-31 kg m/s is 3.07e-31 Ns (since 1 Ns = 1 kg m/s).

Looking at the options, none of them are around 3e-31. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, maybe I confused the model. Because the question says the molecule can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor). I thought non-rigid rotor includes vibration, but perhaps the model being referred to is the rigid rotor plus vibration.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the energy required for the first excited state, which could be the first vibrational state (v=1), regardless of rotation. But wait, in the rigid rotor model, the vibrational energy is quantized, and each vibrational state can have multiple rotational states.

Wait, perhaps the non-rigid rotor model allows for the bond length to vary, which affects the moment of inertia. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering an electron transition, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering which transition is allowed. Because in the rotational-vibrational coupling, a photon can cause a transition that changes both vibrational and rotational states. But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the next state with the smallest energy increase.

Wait, perhaps the next state in the rotational-vibrational spectrum is a combination of a change in both vibrational and rotational states, but that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the first transition is the vibrational transition, which would have a larger energy jump, but if that's the case, the momentum would be higher.

Wait, but the options are all much larger than what I computed for the rotational transition. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the rotational transition but the vibrational transition. Because the options are in the range of 1e-27 to 2e-27 Ns, which is 1e-27 kg m/s.

So let's compute the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition.

Earlier, I found the vibrational energy difference to be 4.218e-20 J.

So p = E/c = 4.218e-20 J / (3e8 m/s) = 1.406e-28 kg m/s = 1.406e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns, which matches this.

But wait, earlier I thought that the rotational transition requires less energy, but the photon's momentum for that was 3e-31 Ns, which isn't among the options.

So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the vibrational transition.

But why would that be the case? Because the question states that the model is the rotation-vibration model, so the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But the vibrational transition would require more energy than the rotational, as we computed.

But in terms of energy, the rotational transition is lower. So why would the photon's energy correspond to the higher energy transition?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule's transition to the next state regardless of rotation, but the minimal energy transition is the vibrational. No, that doesn't make sense because the rotational transition needs less energy.

Hmm, perhaps I misunderstood the model. Maybe in the non-rigid rotor model, the vibrational energy is the main factor, and the rotational energy is considered as a correction. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the vibrational transition, perhaps because the rotational transitions are not allowed in the model, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another thought. Perhaps the question is considering the first transition from the ground state, which is a simultaneous change in both vibrational and rotational states. But that's getting complicated, and I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the vibrational transition. So the photon's energy is the difference between v=0 and v=1, which is ħω.

So the energy is E = ħω = (1.05457e-34 J s) * (4e14 rad/s) = 4.218e-20 J.

Then, the momentum p = E/c = 4.218e-20 /3e8 =1.406e-28 kg m/s, which is 1.4e-28 Ns.

Which matches option D.

So perhaps the correct answer is D.

But why did the initial calculation for the rotational transition give me a much smaller momentum (3e-31 Ns), which is not an option.

Ah, perhaps because in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational transitions are not allowed or are considered in a different way. Or perhaps the model being used here (quantum rotation-vibration) treats the energy levels such that the minimal transition is the vibrational.

Wait, maybe the rotation-vibration model's fundamental state is (v=0, J=0), and the next state is (v=1, J=0), or (v=0, J=1). But the energy for (v=1, J=0) is higher than (v=0, J=1). So the minimal energy transition is the rotational one, but perhaps in this model, the rotational transitions are not allowed? Or perhaps in the model, the molecule can't change rotational state without changing vibrational state.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a transition to the next state in the sequence of energy levels, regardless of which quantum numbers change. So the next state would be the one where v=1 and J=0.

Wait, that would make sense because the energy of (v=1, J=0) is higher than (v=0, J=1). Let me calculate both:

E(v=1, J=0) = E_v + E_J = (1.5 ħω) + 0 = 1.5 ħω.

E(v=0, J=1) = (0.5 ħω) + ( ħ²/(2I) ) ~ approximately 9.3e-23 J + 0.5 *4.218e-20 J → wait, no, E_v is (v+1/2) ħω, so v=0 is 0.5 ħω, v=1 is 1.5 ħω.

Wait, no, wait. The energy of the vibrational state is E_v = (v + 1/2) ħω.

The energy of the rotational state is E_J = [ ħ² J (J+1) ]/(2I).

So E for (v=1, J=0) is 1.5 ħω + 0 = 1.5 ħω.

E for (v=0, J=1) is 0.5 ħω + [ ħ² * 2 ]/(2I ) = 0.5 ħω + ħ²/(I )

Which one is bigger? Let's compute both.

Compute 1.5 ħω and 0.5 ħω + ħ²/(I )

We have ħω =1.05457e-34 *4e14=4.218e-20 J.

1.5 *4.218e-20=6.327e-20 J.

0.5 *4.218e-20=2.109e-20 J.

And ħ²/(I ) for I=1.2075e-46 kg m².

Compute  (1.05457e-34 )^2 / (1.2075e-46 ) ≈ (1.112e-68 ) / (1.2075e-46 ) ≈9.21e-23 J.

So 2.109e-20 +9.21e-23 = approximately 2.109e-20 + 0.000921e-20 = ~2.118e-20 J.

Which is less than 6.327e-20 J. So the (v=0, J=1) state is at lower energy than (v=1, J=0).

Wait, that can't be, because the (v=1, J=0) state is higher than (v=0, J=0), but (v=0, J=1) is higher than (v=0, J=0), but lower than (v=1, J=0). So the next state with the lowest possible energy is (v=0, J=1), which requires a photon with energy 9.21e-23 J.

But the photon momentum would then be 9.21e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈3.07e-31 kg m/s → 3.07e-31 Ns. But none of the options are around that.

So now I'm stuck. My initial calculation says that the rotational transition requires less energy, but the options don't have that value.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the rotational energy but only the vibrational. Maybe because the model is non-rigid rotor, which includes both vibrations and rotations, but the question is considering the first allowed transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the transition to the first excited state, which is the first possible state with higher energy. So the first state would be (v=1, J=0), with energy 1.5 ħω. So the energy difference is 1.5 ħω - 0.5 ħω = ħω.

But wait, the initial state is (v=0, J=0). So E_initial = 0.5 ħω + 0 = 0.5 ħω.

E_final for (v=1, J=0) is 1.5 ħω.

ΔE = 1.5 ħω -0.5 ħω = ħω =4.218e-20 J.

So p = E/c =4.218e-20 /3e8 =1.406e-28 Ns, which is option D.

So in this case, the correct answer is D.

But why is the rotational transition not considered? Because perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational energy is considered a part of the vibrational state's energy, so the minimal transition is the vibrational one.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the vibrational transition as the 'fundamental' transition, and the rotational transitions are considered in overtone or combination bands.

But I'm a bit confused. However, given the options, and the fact that option D matches the vibrational transition, I think that's the intended answer.


To determine the momentum of the photon required for the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences in the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, corresponding to the lowest vibrational state (\(v=0\)) and the lowest rotational state (\(J=0\)). The next possible state with the lowest energy could involve either a vibrational transition (\(v=1, J=0\)) or a rotational transition (\(v=0, J=1\)).

### Key Parameters:
- **Masses**: \(M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}\), \(M_y = 2 \, \text{amu}\)
- **Bond length**: \(R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\)
- **Angular frequency**: \(\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\)
- **Reduced mass**: \(\mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}\)
- \(\mu\) in kg: \(1.818 \, \text{amu} \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg/amu} \approx 3.0188 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\)
- **Moment of inertia**: \(I = \mu R^2 = (3.0188 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 \approx 1.2075 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2\)

### Energy Differences:
1. **Vibrational transition (\(v=0 \to v=1\))**:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vibrational}} = \hbar \omega = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Rotational transition (\(J=0 \to J=1\))**:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rotational}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.2075 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]

### Comparison:
The vibrational transition requires significantly more energy (\(4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}\)) than the rotational transition (\(9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\)). However, the rotational transition energy is not among the provided options. The vibrational transition energy matches the scale of the options.

### Photon Momentum:
The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \(p = \frac{E}{c}\), where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\). For the vibrational transition:
\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vibrational}}}{c} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}
\]
