Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I need to find the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. Let me think.

Wait, the crystal is rhombohedral, which means all the edges are equal, a = b = c, and all the angles are the same, alpha = beta = gamma. In this case, the angles are 30 degrees each. Oh right, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, does the interatomic distance relate to the lattice parameter a?

I think in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance depends on the structure. For a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance would be a√2 for the (111) plane? Or wait, no, the interplanar distance is different. Oh, wait, I'm confusing interatomic distance with the lattice parameter.

Wait, the interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms. In a simple cubic structure, each atom is at the corner of a cube, so the interatomic distance would be a, right? But for a rhombohedral structure, maybe it's the same as the lattice parameter a. Because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a. So perhaps in this case, a is 10 Angstrom. Because the question says the interatomic distance is 10. So a = 10.

But wait, maybe I should think more carefully. The interatomic distance in a simple cubic structure is a. In a BCC structure, it's a√3/2, and in FCC it's a√2/2. But for a rhombohedral structure, if it's a primitive structure, the interatomic distance would be a, I think.

So assuming a is 10 Angstroms.

Now, the interplanar distance formula for a plane (hkl) in a rhombohedral system is given by the formula:

d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl)cosθ)

Wait, no, wait. I'm getting confused. Let me recall the formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system.

I remember that when a = b = c and alpha = beta = gamma, the formula simplifies. The general formula for interplanar distance is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ) 

But wait, since all angles are the same (30°), and a = b = c, maybe this can be simplified.

Wait, for a rhombohedral lattice, the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Because all the angles are α. So in this case, alpha is 30°, so cos(30) is √3/2 ≈ 0.866.

So the (111) plane has h=1, k=1, l=1.

So plugging in:

d = 10 / sqrt( (1 + 1 + 1) + 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)*cos(30) )

Let me compute the denominator step by step.

First, the sum of squares: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Then, the cross terms: 2*(1*1 + 1*1 +1*1) = 2*(3) =6.

Multiply by cos(30°): 6 * (√3/2) = 3√3 ≈ 5.196.

So the denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 5.196) = sqrt(8.196).

Wait, 3 +5.196 is 8.196. What's sqrt(8.196)?

Let me calculate that. sqrt(8) is about 2.828, sqrt(9) is 3. So 8.196 is a little more than 8. Let's compute 8.196^0.5.

Alternatively, 8.196 = 8 + 0.196.

I know that 2.86^2 = (2.8)^2 + 2*2.8*0.06 + (0.06)^2 = 7.84 + 0.336 + 0.0036 = 8.1796. Close to 8.196.

Wait, 2.86^2 is 8.1796, which is 0.0164 less than 8.196. Let me see 2.86 + x)^2 =8.196.

(2.86 + x)^2 = 8.196.

Approximate x using linear approximation. Let f(x) = (2.86 +x)^2. At x=0, f=8.1796.

df/dx = 2*(2.86 +x) → at x=0, 5.72.

We need f(x) to increase by 8.196-8.1796=0.0164.

So x ≈ 0.0164 /5.72 ≈ 0.00287.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.86 +0.00287 ≈ 2.86287. Approximately 2.863.

So denominator is about 2.863.

So d ≈ 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.493? Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 10/2.863 is about 3.493 Angstroms? But the options are around 8 or 9. Hmm, that's way off. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait a minute, perhaps I mixed up the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula I'm recalling is for the interplanar distance in a cubic system when the angles are 90 degrees. But in a rhombohedral system, the formula is different.

Wait, no. Let me double-check. The general formula
