Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. 

The question is about finding the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, traveling at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options are A to D.

First, I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them normally because that would give speeds faster than light, which isn't possible. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is needed here. 

So, the formula I think is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me make sure I got that right. Since both are moving in the same direction, v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. Wait, but wait, no: wait, in relative terms, it's the velocity of one as seen from the other. So if the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c and the second at 0.5c, same direction, so the relative speed is (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by [1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)]. Let me compute that.

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately. Numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) )= 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So (0.1c) / 0.7 = (1/7) * 0.1c ≈ 0.0142857c. Oh wait, that's approximately 0.0143c, which is about 0.14c when rounded to two decimal places. So the relative speed would be 0.14c. Hmm, I see options C and D have 0.14c. So that part is between C and D.

Now the total energy. The total energy of each astronaut is their relativistic energy, which is gamma * m c². So for the first astronaut, mass 2m moving at 0.6c, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So v is 0.6c, v²/c² is 0.36. 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. Sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy is 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, v=0.5c. So v²/c² is 0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. Sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(3/4)=sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866, so gamma is 1/0.866 ≈1.1547. So energy is 1.1547 *3m c² ≈3.464 mc².

So total energy is 2.5 +3.464 = 5.964 mc². Which is approximately 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc^2 and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5mc^2, which is lower. So option C matches the calculated total energy. 

So the correct answer should be option C: v_rel =0.14c, E=5.96 mc².


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.0143c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of each astronaut is their relativistic energy, given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Conclusion
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:
