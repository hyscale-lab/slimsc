Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare Symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are A to D combinations.

Wait, first I need to remember what each of these symmetries mean. Lorentz symmetry has to do with how the laws of physics look the same in all inertial frames. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations of spacetime. Then there's CP symmetry, which is the combination of Charge conjugation (C) and Parity (P), and CPT symmetry, which combines C, P, and T (time reversal).

In the Standard Model, I think CPT is a fundamental symmetry. All interactions must respect CPT because it's tied into the structure of relativistic quantum field theories. So I remember that any effective theory should also respect CPT symmetry because it's a basic tenet of quantum field theory. So any operator in SMEFT must respect CPT.

What about Lorentz symmetry? SMEFT is an effective theory that's built to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model. The Standard Model is Lorentz invariant, so SMEFT must also respect Lorentz symmetry. So operators in SMEFT are constructed as Lorentz-invariant operators. Without Lorentz symmetry, the theory would break down in different frames, which isn't acceptable.

Wait, but what about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. In SMEFT, the operators are defined in a way that includes all possible Lorentz-invariant terms. But wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, meaning it's valid up to some cutoff scale. In effective theories, we usually work in a specific frame, like the center-of-momentum frame, to simplify things. So while the original theory (like the Standard Model) is Poincare invariant, effective theories often don't strictly respect all Poincare symmetries because you're integrating out high-energy modes and working in a particular frame. So maybe the operators in SMEFT respect Lorentz symmetry but not necessarily Poincare symmetry as a whole, especially because the effective theory is not supposed to be valid beyond the cutoff. Or wait, perhaps the operators are built to be Poincare-invariant? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the SMEFT is constructed by considering all possible Lorentz-invariant operators constructed from the SM fields. So the operators themselves are Lorentz-invariant, meaning that the theory respects Lorentz symmetry. But Poincare includes translations as well. In effective field theories, translation symmetry is generally maintained because they're local. Wait, but if the theory respects Lorentz symmetry, then it must also respect Poincare symmetry because Poincare includes translations and Lorentz transformations. Hmm, so if the operators are Lorentz-invariant, then the full Poincare symmetry would also be respected? Or does the SMEFT only require Lorentz symmetry?

Wait, no, maybe not. Effective field theories usually maintain Poincare symmetry because the low-energy expansion is consistent with the symmetries of the original theory. Since the SM respects Poincare symmetry, the SMEFT, which is an effective theory based on the SM, should also respect Poincare. Therefore, operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain here. Because in SMEFT, you can have operators of different dimensions, but each operator is a Lorentz-invariant term. So each operator individually is Lorentz-invariant, but does the entire theory respect Poincare symmetry? I think it does because each term is local and the interactions are local. So yes, the theory as a whole respects Poincare symmetry.

Wait, but I remember reading somewhere that in effective theories, you can sometimes break Poincare symmetry if you're considering a specific frame, but I might be mixing up concepts. Alternatively, perhaps in SMEFT, the operators are built to maintain Lorentz symmetry, but not necessarily Poincare because maybe the cutoff scale affects that. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to think about which symmetries are spontaneously broken or not. The SM has Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT must also respect it because it's an effective theory that incorporates the SM. So all operators in SMEFT respect Lorentz and Poincare symmetries.

Wait, but looking at the options, the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So Poincare symmetry would require that the theory as a whole is invariant under Poincare, but individual operators only need to be Lorentz-invariant. Or wait, no, because each operator must be a Poincare-invariant term. Hmm, no, because Poincare includes translations, so operators are constructed to be translation-invariant, which is a given in local field theories. So perhaps each operator is Poincare-invariant, meaning all operators must respect Poincare symmetry. Or maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe the SMEFT operators are built in a way that they are local, hence respecting Poincare.

Wait, Lorentz symmetry and Poincare: Lorentz symmetry is a subset of Poincare. So if an operator respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz. But the question is whether the operators must respect Poincare. Or, perhaps, operators are only required to be Lorentz-invariant, and Poincare is a larger symmetry that isn't necessarily enforced on individual operators because translation invariance is part of the framework, not the operators themselves.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of it another way. The SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz-invariant. So each operator must respect Lorentz symmetry. For Poincare symmetry, since it includes translations, which are part of the spacetime symmetries, the SMEFT must also respect Poincare. Wait, but maybe the effective theory is constructed in a way that includes all possible Lorentz-invariant operators, so each operator is Lorentz-invariant, but the sum of all operators in the theory (the full Lagrangian) is Poincare-invariant. So the operators themselves don't necessarily have to respect Poincare symmetry, but the overall theory does. So the question is about what each operator must respect.

Wait, but no, each operator must be a Lorentz-invariant term. Because in the SMEFT, you're writing down all possible Lorentz-invariant operators. So each operator is Lorentz-invariant, but they might not necessarily be Poincare-invariant because Poincare includes translations, but each term is local, so each term is translation-invariant. Wait, each term is a local operator, so each is invariant under space-time translations. So each operator is Poincare-invariant as well.

Wait, but I'm getting more confused. Let me try to clarify: Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. So for a term in the Lagrangian to be Poincare-invariant, it must be invariant under both. Since each operator in SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant term built from the SM fields, and since the fields are local (i.e., depend on spacetime points), the terms would automatically be translation-invariant as well, because they're constructed as such.

Wait, but that's not entirely accurate. For instance, a term like (∂μ ϕ)^2 is translation-invariant because it's a local term. But for a higher-dimensional operator, like (∂μ ϕ)(∂ν ϕ) ... etc., they're still local, hence translation-invariant. So each operator is Poincare-invariant because it's both Lorentz and translation invariant.

So that would mean that operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. But wait, is that correct? Because in the SMEFT, the operators are constructed as Lorentz-invariant, but they don't necessarily have to include all possible Poincare transformations beyond the local structure.

Wait, no, because the operators are local, so each term is invariant under spacetime translations. So each operator is both Lorentz and Poincare-invariant.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Maybe the individual operators don't have to respect Poincare symmetry, but the full theory does because you can apply translations to the entire Lagrangian. So perhaps each operator only needs to be Lorentz-invariant, but not necessarily Poincare-invariant because translation invariance is part of the framework, not each operator.

Alternatively, perhaps all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry and CPT symmetry, but not necessarily CP or Poincare.

Wait, another approach: which of these symmetries are part of the Standard Model's symmetry? The Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory, respects Poincare, but does not necessarily respect CP symmetry (in fact, there are CP-violating terms in the SM, like in the CKM matrix). And the SM respects CPT symmetry because all observed processes do.

So, in SMEFT, which is an effective theory that extends the SM, the operators must respect the same symmetries as the SM. Since the SM's operators respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, but not necessarily CP, then the SMEFT operators must also respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, but not necessarily CP.

Wait, but wait: the SM does respect Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT must also respect it. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on whether each operator must respect Poincare symmetry or if it's the entire theory that does. Because each operator is a local term, which implies translation invariance. So each operator is Poincare-invariant. So all operators must respect Poincare symmetry.

But wait, the options don't include all four. The options are 1,2,4, etc.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4 (Lorentz, Poincare, CPT). Option A is 1,2.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me try to rethink.

CPT symmetry is a combination of C, P, and T. The SM respects CPT symmetry, so SMEFT must also respect it. So all operators must respect CPT.

CP symmetry is not necessarily respected by the SM (like in processes with CP violation), so SMEFT operators don't have to respect CP.

So, the operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.

Wait, but do they? Or is it that the entire theory respects these, but individual operators may not?

The question states "must be respected by all operators". So each operator must be invariant under these symmetries.

Wait, for example, Lorentz symmetry: each operator must be a Lorentz scalar. So yes, each operator respects Lorentz symmetry.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations. Each operator is a local term, so it's translation-invariant, hence each operator respects Poincare symmetry.

CPT symmetry: each operator must transform in a way that when C, P, and T are applied, the operator remains the same. Since the SM respects CPT, the SMEFT's operators must also respect CPT.

But wait, why would each operator individually respect CPT? Because the SM respects CPT, but SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimension operators that are allowed by the SM symmetries, including CPT. So each operator must respect CPT.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: if an operator doesn't respect CPT, then applying CPT would change it into a different operator, which wouldn't be allowed in a theory that respects CPT. So each operator must be CPT-invariant.

So putting it all together, the operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4), but not necessarily CP (3).

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Option C is option C) 1,2,4.

Wait, the given options are:

A) 1,2

B) 3,4

C) 1,2,4

D)1,3,4

So the correct answer would be C) 1,2,4.


To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the symmetries in question:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, meaning all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. This is a fundamental requirement for any relativistic quantum field theory.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT is a local effective field theory, all operators are constructed to be translation-invariant. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model (SM) contains CP-violating terms, such as those arising from the CKM matrix. As SMEFT extends the SM, it does not necessarily respect CP symmetry. Thus, operators in SMEFT are not required to respect CP symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM respects CPT symmetry, and SMEFT, being an effective theory derived from the SM, must also respect CPT symmetry. This ensures that the theory remains consistent with the fundamental symmetries of quantum field theory.

From this analysis, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). They do not necessarily respect CP symmetry (3). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
