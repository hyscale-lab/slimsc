Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But let's take it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a certain concentration of a Ca-EDTA complex. 

Okay, the problem states that the solution has a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, stochiometric here probably means that the ratio is 1:1, right? So each formula unit of the complex has one Ca²+ ion. Also, the pH is ideal, which I think means that the EDTA is fully deprotonated and can form the complex without any issues. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so probably doesn't affect the calculations. The given formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. 

I remember that the formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex ion. For a reaction like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−, the Kf would be [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). 

Wait, but in this problem, they've given me the concentration of the complex, which is 0.02 M. So, the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. 

Let me think about the dissociation of the complex. The complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. So, the dissociation reaction is: CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−. The K for this reaction would be the inverse of the formation constant because formation and dissociation are reverse reactions. So, K_dissociation = 1/Kf. 

So Kf is 5x10^10, so K_dissociation would be 1/(5x10^10) = 2x10^-11. 

Now, let's set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) for the dissociation. Let's say the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. At initial, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− are zero. 

When the complex dissociates by 'x' amount, the concentration of Ca²+ increases by x, and EDTA^4− increases by x. So the equilibrium concentrations would be: 
[CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is likely very small compared to 0.02)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4−] = x

So the expression for K_dissociation (Kd) is:

Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] / [CaEDTA^2−] = (x * x) / (0.02) = x² / 0.02

We know Kd is 2e-11, so:

x² / 0.02 = 2e-11
x² = 0.02 * 2e-11
x² = 4e-13
x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, no, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2? Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, so 1e-12 is (1e-6)^2. Oh wait, no, sqrt(1e-13) would be 1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7. But wait, 4e-13's square root is 2e-6.5, which is 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7. 

So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. That would be the concentration of Ca²+ ions. 

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7 M. That matches what I got. 

Wait, but let me double-check. The Kf is given as 5e10. So Kd is 1/(5e10) which is 2e-11. So the equation x²/(0.02) = 2e-11. Then x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13. x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Wait, what's 2e-6.5 in regular terms? 10^-6.5 is about 3.16e-7, so 2 times that is 6.32e-7. Yep, that's right.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is the inverse of the formation constant \( K_f \). Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

Using an ICE table, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and at equilibrium, the concentrations of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \) are both \( x \), while the concentration of the complex is approximately \( 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \) (since \( x \) is expected to be very small). The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Substituting \( K_d = 2 \times 10^{-11} \):

\[
\frac{x^2}{0.02} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = 0.02 \times 2 \times 10^{-11} = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which matches option C.
