Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance of a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. 

Rhombohedral crystals, right. I remember they have all sides equal but the angles aren't necessarily 90 degrees. Oh wait, the question says all angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. Wait, but in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, so all edges are same length 'a' and all angles are equal. So yeah, that's given here as 10 Angstrom for the interatomic distance. 

Wait, wait, interatomic distance in a crystal is the distance between adjacent atoms. But in a rhombohedral structure, each edge is the same, so the interatomic distance 'd' is the same as the edge length 'a', so a=10 angstroms here.

The interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ ) ), but wait, wait no, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's using the general formula involving the unit cell parameters.

Wait, no, the standard formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d_{hkl} = (a² (h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ )) )^(-1/2) * something, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, I think the formula for d is a over the square root of (h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ ), but I'm not 100% sure. Wait, perhaps the formula is d = (a²/(h² +k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hk cos β ... Wait, no, wait, maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, no. The correct formula for the interplanar distance for a cubic system is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² ), but since this is a rhombohedral system, which is a type of hexagonal system? Or wait, no, rhombohedral is part of the cubic system but with non-90-degree angles. So the general formula must take into account the angles between the lattice vectors.

I think the general formula for the interplanar distance in any crystal system is given by:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) (1/(a²)) ) + terms involving cosines of the angles. Hmm, maybe I should recall the Miller Indices and the relation of the interplanar spacing. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the formula, but since I can't do that, I'll try to think.

Wait, in a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²). But when the angles are not 90 degrees, the formula gets more complicated. For rhombohedral, since all the angles are equal and a=b=c, the formula might simplify a bit.

Wait, I've read somewhere that for a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance is given by:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. Because in a rhombohedral system, all the angles α, β, γ are equal (they're all 30 degrees in this case). So that's probably the formula to use here.

So, in this problem, the plane is (111). So h=1, k=1, l=1. And a=10 angstroms, and the angle θ=30 degrees.

So plugging in the numbers:

d = 10 / sqrt( 1² + 1² + 1² + 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) * cos(30°) )

Let me compute the denominator step by step.

First, compute h² +k² + l²: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Then compute 2*(hk + hl + kl) : 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) = 2*(3) =6.

Multiply that by cos(30°). Cos(30°) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 ≈5.196.

So denominator is sqrt(3 +5.196) = sqrt(8.196).

What's sqrt(8.196)? Let me compute. 2.86 squared is 8.18, because 2.8^2 is 7.84, 2.85^2=8.1225. 2.86^2= (2.85 + 0.01)^2= 2.85² + 2*2.85*0.01 + 0.01²= 8.1225 + 0.057 + 0.0001=8.1796. Hmm, but 8.196 is a bit higher. So 2.86^2=approx 8.1796, 2.865^2 is (2.86 +0.005)^2. Let's compute 2.865^2: (2.86)^2 + 2*2.86*0.005 + (0.005)^2=8.1796 + 0.0286 + 0.000025= ~8.2082. Hmm, but 8.196 is between 8.1796 and 8.2082. So the square root would be approximately 2.862. Let me compute 2.862^2: 2.86^2 is 8.1796, add 0.002*(2*2.86 +0.002) = 0.002*(5.72 +0.002)= 0.01144. So 8.1796 + 0.01144 is 8.1910. Hmm, wait, maybe I should just calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator-like approach. Let me compute sqrt(8.196):

We know that 2.86^2 = 8.1796.

The difference between 8.196 and 8.1796 is 0.0164.

Using linear approximation, the derivative of x² is 2x. At x=2.86, the derivative is ~5.72.

So delta x ≈ delta y / (2x) = 0.0164 /5.72 ≈0.00287.

So sqrt(8.196)≈2.86 +0.00287≈2.86287.

So denominator is approximately 2.86287.

So d =10 / 2.86287 ≈ ?

Let me compute 10 divided by 2.86287.

2.86287 * 3=8.58861. 2.86287 * 3.5= 10.019045. Wait, 3.5 times 2.86287 is 10.019, which is just over 10. So 3.5 times the denominator is 10, so 10/2.86287≈3.5?

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait 2.86287 * x =10, solve for x. So x=10/2.86287.

Let me compute 2.86287 * 3.49 = ?

3 *2.86287=8.58861.

0.49 *2.86287≈0.49 *2.86= approx 1.3954, plus 0.49 *0.00287≈0.00141. So total approx 1.3968.

So 8.58861 +1.3968≈9.9854. So 3.49 times 2.86287 is about 9.9854. We need 10, so 3.49 + (0.0146/2.86287)=approx 3.49 + 0.0051≈3.4951.

So d≈3.495 angstroms? Wait, that can't be right because the options are around 8-10 angstroms. Wait, did I make a mistake?

Wait a minute, wait, the interatomic distance is 10 angstroms. So in a cubic system, the (111) plane's interplanar distance would be a/sqrt(3) =10/1.732≈5.77 angstroms. But in this case, because the angles are 30 degrees, which are smaller than 90, the interplanar spacing would be larger, perhaps. Because when the angles are smaller, the planes are further apart?

Wait, the formula I used had a denominator of sqrt(3 +6*(cos 30))=sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=~2.863. So d=10 / 2.863≈3.49 angstroms. But that's way smaller than the options given. Hmmm, something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the formula. Let me think again. The formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral system is a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ), where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. Because in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters are a, a, a, and angles are all θ.

Wait, so in this case, h=k=l=1. So the denominator becomes sqrt( 3 + 2*(3)*cos(30) )= sqrt(3+6*(√3/2))= sqrt(3 +3√3). Wait, √3 is about 1.732, so 3√3=5.196. So 3 +5.196=8.196. So sqrt(8.196)=2.863. So d=10/2.863≈3.49 angstroms. But that's way smaller than the options given. The options are around 8-10 angstroms. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the formula is inverted. Maybe it's (a²) divided by (h² +k² + l² + ... )^(1/2), but no, that can't be because units wouldn't match. Wait no, the formula is d= a / sqrt(...), so it's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are 150 degrees instead of 30. Because rhombohedral can have angles either acute or obtuse. Wait, but the question says 30 degrees. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, wait, another approach: Maybe the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ ) ) )^(-1/2).

Wait, but in our case, since all angles are 30 degrees, so cos α=cos β=cos γ=√3/2≈0.866.

So the denominator inside the square root becomes: h² +k² +l² - 2hk*(√3/2) - 2hl*(√3/2) - 2kl*(√3/2).

Which simplifies to: (h² +k² +l²) - √3 (hk + hl + kl).

So for (111), that's 3 - √3 *3 = 3 -3√3 ≈ 3 -5.196= -2.196. Wait, that's negative. That can't be right because you can't take the square root of a negative number.

Oh wait, that can't be. So perhaps I have the formula wrong. Maybe it's another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I used earlier is incorrect. Another thought: In a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors might be easier to use. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the metric tensor.

The metric tensor in a rhombohedral system can be written as:

g_ij = [ a²       a² cosγ      a² cosβ
         a² cosγ   a²       a² cosα
         a² cosβ   a² cosα    a² ]

Wait, but in our case, all angles are 30 degrees, so α=β=gamma=30°, so cosα=cosβ=cosγ=√3/2≈0.866.

So the metric tensor g becomes:

g_11 = a² = (10)^2=100.

g_12 = g_21 = a² cosγ =100 * (√3/2)=50√3≈86.60.

g_13 =g_31 = a² cosβ=50√3≈86.60.

g_22= a²=100.

g_23=g_32= a² cosα=50√3≈86.60.

g_33= a²=100.

But wait, how do I find the interplanar distance from the metric tensor? The interplanar distance d is related to the plane (hkl) by the formula:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) )

Wait, wait, no. The formula for d is:

d² = (1/h² + 1/k² + 1/l² - 2/(hk) cos γ' - 2/(kl) cos α' - 2/(lh) cos β' )

But I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the better way is to compute the reciprocal of the plane's normal vector.

Wait, perhaps using the formula from crystallography:

d = (1 / |n|) * ( sqrt( (1/a²)^2 + ... ) )

Wait, no, perhaps an alternative approach. The interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) )

Wait, but let's plug in the numbers again.

h=k=l=1.

So denominator = sqrt(3 - 2*(1*1* cos30 + 1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 ))= sqrt(3 - 2*(3 * (√3/2 )) )

Compute inside the sqrt: 3 - 2*(3*(√3/2)) )=3 -3√3 ≈3-5.196= -2.196. Again, negative, which is impossible. So perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Wait, in that case, for the (111) plane, h=k=l=1, so denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 2*(3*(√3/2)) )=sqrt(3 +3√3) ≈ sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.863. So d=10 /2.863≈3.49 angstroms. But the options are much larger, so this can't be right.

Wait, maybe I have the formula wrong. Let me think about another approach. The interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the vector (h a + k b + l c) in reciprocal space. Wait, no, perhaps not. Alternatively, the interplanar distance d is given by:

d = 1 / (sqrt( (h/a)^2 + (k/b)^2 + (l/c)^2 - 2(hk cos γ)/(a b) - 2(hl cos β)/(a c) - 2(kl cos α)/(b c) )) )

But in our case, a=b=c=10 angstroms, and alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees. So cos(alpha)=cos(beta)=cos(gamma)=√3/2≈0.866.

So the denominator becomes sqrt( (h² +k² +l²)/(a²) + ... )

Plugging in h=k=l=1, a=10:

Denominator squared is (1/100 + 1/100 + 1/100) + 2*(1*1*(√3/2)/(10^2)) * (1/10^2 each term?), wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's compute each term.

Compute each term:

Term1 = (h²)/(a²) = 1 / 100 = 0.01.

Similarly, Term2 = (k²)/(b²)=0.01, Term3= (l²)/(c²)=0.01. So sum of terms is 0.03.

Next, the cross terms:

Term4 = 2*(hk cos γ)/(a b) = 2*(1*1 * (√3/2))/(10*10) = (2 * (√3/2 )) / 100 = (√3)/100 ≈0.01732.

Similarly, Term5 = 2*(hl cos β)/(a c) = same as term4, so another 0.01732.

Term6 = 2*(kl cos alpha)/(b c) = same as term4, another 0.01732.

Adding all cross terms: 0.01732 *3=0.05196.

So denominator squared is 0.03 -0.05196= -0.02196. Oh wait, negative again. That can't be right. So something's wrong.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the cross terms are subtracted. So perhaps the formula for the denominator squared is (h² +k² +l²)/(a²) + 2*(hk cos γ)/(a b) + 2*(...), but that would make the denominator larger, leading to a smaller d, which doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d² = (1/(h² +k² +l² - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ)) ) * (1/a² + 1/b² + 1/c² ... something? I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps using the volume of the unit cell. The volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is a³ * sqrt(1 - cos² α - cos² β - cos² γ + 2 cos α cos β cos γ ). Alternatively, for a rhombohedral system with all angles equal, the volume is a³ * sqrt(1 - 3 cos² θ + 2 cos³ θ ), where θ is 30 degrees.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly with the interplanar distance.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the reciprocal vectors. The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (1/a) ( 1, 0, 0 )

b2 = (1/a) ( cos γ, sin γ, 0 )

b3 = (1/a) ( cos β, (cos α - cos β cos γ)/(sin β sin γ ), 1 )

But in the rhombohedral case with all angles equal, perhaps this simplifies.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Wait, the interplanar distance can be found using the formula for the plane (hkl) as:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

Wait, no, that was the formula I used earlier, which gave d≈3.49, but that's too small.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating a. Because in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance 'a' is not the same as the edge length. Wait, no, the interatomic distance is the edge length, so a=10 angstrom. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the reciprocal of the plane's indices. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, another thought: In a rhombohedral structure, the (111) planes may have different distances depending on the angles. Maybe I should compute the reciprocal of the plane's metric.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = (1 / sqrt( (h/a)^2 + (k/b)^2 + (l/c)^2 - 2(hk cos γ)/(a b) - 2(hl cos β)/(a c) - 2(kl cos alpha)/(b c) )) )

But since a=b=c=10, and angles are 30 degrees, this becomes:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²)/(10²) - 2(hk cos30 + hl cos30 + kl cos30)/(10²) )

Because all denominators are 10^2, and all cos terms are cos30.

So for (111):

d =1 / sqrt( (3)/100 - 2*(3 * (√3/2 )) / 100 )

Compute numerator inside the square root:

3/100 =0.03.

The second term is 2*(3 * (√3/2 )) /100 = (3√3)/100 ≈ (5.196)/100=0.05196.

So denominator inside sqrt is 0.03 -0.05196 = -0.02196. Oh, negative, which is impossible. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps the formula should have a plus instead of a minus? Let me try that.

So denominator becomes 0.03 +0.05196=0.08196.

So sqrt(0.08196)≈0.2863. So d=1/0.2863≈3.49 angstroms again. But this still doesn't match the options.

Wait, I'm getting the same result as before. So perhaps the error is in the formula being used.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

But plugging in the numbers:

3 - 2*(3*(√3/2 ))=3 -3√3≈3-5.196≈-2.196. Negative again. So this can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I've got the formula wrong. Maybe the formula for interplanar distance in rhombohedral is different.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal system. The general formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2/a^2) + (k^2/b^2) + (l^2/c^2) - 2(hk cos γ
