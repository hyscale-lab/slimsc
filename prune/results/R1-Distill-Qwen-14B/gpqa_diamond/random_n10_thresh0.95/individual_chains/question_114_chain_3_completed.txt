Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for the given reactions. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something (A) to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with CN- (from NaCN), I think that's a nucleophilic addition. Oh wait, wait, but ketones usually don't get nitrile additions. Oh wait, wait, maybe it's a substitution. Or wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Oh, wait, but I remember that when ketones react with cyanide under certain conditions, they form a cyanohydrin. Yeah, that's right. A cyanohydrin is when a ketone reacts with HCN to form a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached. But wait, NaCN is providing CN-, but maybe in the presence of an acid catalyst.

So the first reaction, butan-2-one plus NaCN and A gives the cyanohydrin. So in the cyanohydrin formation, the ketone reacts with HCN. But here we have NaCN, which is a source of CN-, but to form HCN, you need an acidic environment. So wait, perhaps the reagent A is an acid, like H3O+ (which is option A and B) or maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction uses HCN itself, but that's not one of the options here.

Wait, but in this case, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's see the structure. The starting ketone is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would perhaps form (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the product structure would have a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on the same carbon, which is exactly the cyanohydrin structure. So yeah, that's the product.

So the reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. For that, the typical conditions are HCN, but sometimes when using NaCN, you might need an acid catalyst to generate HCN in situ. Alternatively, maybe NaCN and an acid. Because NaCN is a salt, so in aqueous solution, it would dissociate into CN- and Na+.

Wait, but ketones can react with HCN via acid catalysis. So perhaps reagent A is H3O+ (acid) or something else. Let me think. If the reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN, maybe the solution is acidic. So maybe A is H3O+, because that's a strong acid. Because HCN is a weak acid, and NaCN is a weak base, so in an acidic solution, HCN can form, which is a better nucleophile.

So for the first reaction, the reagents would be NaCN and an acid (like H3O+). So looking at the options, A and B have A as H3O+. So that's possible.

Now the second part: the product of the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, but in the second reaction, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Wait, let me see. So the second reaction takes this compound and reacts it with B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Looking at the product, the nitrile group (CN) has been converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH) group. And there's still a hydroxyl group there. So the reaction is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.

So nitrile hydrolysis typically can be done in acidic or basic conditions. But in this case, the reaction is with B, which I think is an aqueous acid. Wait, but the reagent is H2O, but with another reagent. Or perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction under specific conditions.

Wait, the product has a hydroxyl group and a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the nitrile was hydrolyzed under basic conditions, but the presence of the hydroxyl suggests maybe another step.

Alternatively, the nitrile group is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. For that, usually, it's done in strong acidic or basic conditions. For example, using H2O with HCl (acidic) or under basic conditions with strong base like NaOH, followed by acid workup.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid. So the hydrolysis must have been done under acidic conditions. Let me think. Another way is that the cyanohydrin (from the first step) is being further treated.

Wait, but the starting material of the second reaction is a cyanohydrin. Wait no, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So that's a molecule with a nitrile group and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So when you hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, you have to do that without affecting the hydroxyl group.

So the reaction is nitrile to carboxylic acid. The possible conditions for that are either:

1. Using a strong acid, like HCl, with heat. For example, HCl in H2O, heat, and then perhaps H2O as the reagent B. So reagent B could be HCl.

Wait, but the product has a hydroxyl group, so perhaps it's a two-step process. Or maybe the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid under acidic conditions.

Alternatively, maybe it's using something like HCl as a catalyst in water. So for the second reaction, the reagent B is HCl. Looking at the options, option A has B as HCl, option C also has B as HCl?

Wait, let's look at the options again.

Options:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So for the second reaction, B is either HCl, CH3COOH, etc. In the second reaction, the reagent is B and H2O. So the reaction is likely the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

In acidic conditions, nitrile hydrolysis can be done with HCl and water, perhaps under reflux. So the reagent B would be HCl. So in that case, option A and C have B as HCl.

So looking at the first part, the reagent A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, for the first reaction, NaCN is added along with A, which is the catalyst. For the formation of a cyanohydrin, we need acid. So A should be an acid, like H3O+. So that would suggest options A and B.

But wait, the first reaction uses NaCN and A. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is using NaHSO3. Hmm, but why would that be?

Wait, NaHSO3 is a source of HSO3^- ions. HSO3^- is a weaker acid than H3O+ (which is H+ from H3O+). So, if the first reaction requires an acid, H3O+ would be a stronger acid and more effective in protonating the CN- to form HCN.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the first reaction is using HCN, which is generated from NaCN and H3O+. Because NaCN in acidic conditions would give HCN. So the first reaction is butan-2-one plus HCN in the presence of H3O+ as a catalyst. So the reagent A is H3O+.

So looking at the options, A and B have A as H3O+. Now, for the second reaction, we need B to be HCl. So if A is H3O+, and B is HCl, that would be option A.

Wait, but let me think again. In the first reaction, is the reagent H3O+ needed? Because NaCN is a good enough nucleophile? Or does it require acid?

Wait, the formation of the cyanohydrin typically uses HCN, which is a weak acid. But when you use NaCN, you can generate HCN in situ with an acid. So that explains why the first reaction's reagent A is H3O+.

So for the first part, A is H3O+ (so options A or B), and for the second part, B is HCl (so option A or C).

But wait, option C's A is NaHSO3, which I don't think is right for the first step. So that leaves option A as the possible choice.

But wait, what about the second reaction? The reagent is B (H2O) and another reagent. Oh, wait, the question says, 'B (H2O)'. So perhaps the reagent is H2O, and B is an acid like HCl.

Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid, so the nitrile must have undergone hydrolysis. Nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid typically uses strong acid or strong base conditions.

In acidic conditions, you can use HCl and water. In basic conditions, you'd use something like NaOH and then acidify to get the carboxylic acid.

So the second reaction, with B as HCl, would fit acidic hydrolysis. So reagent B is HCl.

Putting it together, the first reaction uses A = H3O+, and the second reaction uses B = HCl. So the correct option would be A.

Wait, but let me make sure. Option A says A is H3O+ and B is HCl. That fits.

But wait, let me think about the second reaction again. The starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So when you hydrolyze the nitrile, you have to make sure the hydroxyl group doesn't interfere or get oxidized or anything. In acidic conditions, would that be a problem?

Wait, in the presence of HCl and water, the nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. The hydroxyl group is on the same carbon as the nitrile? Wait, no, the starting material for the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the structure would be something like:

Ph-C6H4-CH2-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating the structure. The key point is that the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. So under acidic conditions, using HCl as the catalyst, that's plausible.

So option A has A=H3O+ and B=HCl, which would fit both reactions. So the answer should be option A.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. Cyanohydrin formation typically requires an acidic environment to generate HCN from NaCN. Therefore, the reagent A must be an acid, such as H₃O⁺, to facilitate this reaction. Among the options, only A and B have A = H₃O⁺, which aligns with the requirements for this step.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to form a carboxylic acid. Nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid is typically carried out under acidic or basic conditions. Since the product is a carboxylic acid, the reaction likely occurs under acidic conditions. HCl is a suitable reagent for this purpose, as it provides the necessary acidic environment. Among the options, only A and C have B = HCl. However, the first reaction requires A = H₃O⁺, which eliminates option C. Thus, the correct combination is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: A
