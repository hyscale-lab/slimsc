Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it. The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. 

Hmm, I remember that these spectrographs have different capabilities. From the question, I see that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, while HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 mag. Wait, no, wait—wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO and "brighter than 16 mag" for HIRES. Wait, magnitude scales are a bit tricky. Remember that lower magnitudes are brighter. So a star with V mag of 16 is dimmer than one with 15, right? Wait no. Wait, magnitude 6 is brighter than 7. So higher numbers mean dimmer.

Wait, the question specifies that with ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So that means ESPRESSO can see stars with V ≤17, because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, meaning V ≤16.

Wait, no, no. Wait, no. The wording can be confusing. Let me think again. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." So if a star is brighter than 17, that means its magnitude is less than 17. Because brighter objects have lower magnitudes. So, for example, a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17, so ESPRESSO can observe it. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, meaning V ≤16.

So for a star to be observable by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16. Because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, but HIRES only up to 16. So the star's V must be ≤16.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. If a star is brighter than 17, meaning V <17, then ESPRESSO can see it. HIRES can see stars brighter than 16, which is V <16. So for a star to be observable by both, it must have apparent V mag ≤16. Because for it to be seen by HIRES, it must be ≤16. Since ESPRESSO can go up to 17, any star that's ≤16 would also satisfy ESPRESSO's condition.

Wait, but wait a minute. Are the brightness limits for both spectrographs that they can observe up to 17 and 16, respectively? So to be observed by both, the star's apparent V mag must be less than or equal to 16. Because if it's, say, 16.5, it's brighter than 17 (so ESPRESSO can see it) but dimmer than 16 (so HIRES can't). Wait, no, wait: no. Wait, the condition for HIRES is that the star's apparent V mag must be brighter than 16. So if a star is 16.5, that's dimmer than 16, right? Because higher magnitude numbers mean dimmer. So a star with V=16.5 is dimmer than 16. So it's not bright enough for HIRES. But it's brighter than 17, so it can be seen by ESPRESSO. So, for a star to be observed by both, its apparent V must be ≤16. Because that's the stricter condition.

So now, for each star, I need to compute their apparent V magnitude and see if it's ≤16. Because only those stars will be observable by both.

But wait, some stars have absolute magnitude given, and some have apparent. Let's look at each star.

Star1: Absolute V mag of 15.5, distance 10 pc. So I need to calculate its apparent V mag. The formula is m = M + 5 +5 log10(d), where d is distance in parsecs. So d=10, log10(10)=1. So m =15.5 +5 +5*1 =15.5+10=25.5 mag. That's way too dim. Because 25.5 is way higher than 16, so neither spectrograph can see it.

Star2: Apparent V mag is 16.5. So that's 16.5, which is higher than 16. So only ESPRESSO can see it, since it's brighter than 17 (because 16.5 <17). HIRES requires brighter than 16, so 16.5 is dimmer than 16, so HIRES can't see it. So Star2 is not detectable by both.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5, but wait, there's extinction. E(B-V) is 0.6, and extinction in V is 3.1 * E(B-V). So Av = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. So the observed apparent V is m_observed = m_true + Av. Wait, no, wait. Wait, extinction makes stars appear dimmer, so their apparent magnitude increases. So if a star's true apparent magnitude is 15.5, but there's extinction, the observed magnitude would be 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36. Oh wait, wait, wait. Wait, no! Wait, no: extinction (interstellar dust) makes stars appear dimmer, which means higher magnitude. So the observed (apparent) magnitude is larger than the intrinsic one. 

So Star3's observed apparent V would be 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36. But wait, the question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag". No, wait, no, wait! Wait, Star3's data: it says apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, but with E(B-V)=0.6. Oh, wait, perhaps the 15.5 is the observed (apparent) magnitude, and extinction is E(B-V)=0.6. Wait, no, no, the problem says: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1."

Wait, so the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but with extinction? Or is the 15.5 the intrinsic magnitude? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me read the question again.

Star3: RA=11h, DEC=48, apparent V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, located at 15 pc. And notes that Av=3.1 * E(B-V).

Wait, wait. So I think that Star3's apparent V mag is 15.5, but this is after extinction. Wait, no. Wait, extinction makes stars appear dimmer. So if a star's true (intrinsic) apparent magnitude is m, then the observed m would be m + Av. So if the apparent V given is the observed value, then the intrinsic m would be 15.5 - Av. But I don't think that's the case. Wait, the question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us." So perhaps that 15.5 is the observed apparent magnitude, which would mean that the actual intrinsic apparent magnitude would be 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Star3's apparent V is the intrinsic, and the extinction is 1.86, so the observed V is 15.5 +1.86=17.36. But which one is it?

Wait, I think I've got it wrong. Let me think: E(B-V) is the color excess, which is E(B-V) = (B-V)_observed - (B-V)_intrinsic. But the extinction in V band (Av) is given as 3.1 * E(B-V). So if a star's absolute V magnitude is M, then the apparent magnitude without extinction is m = M + 5 log10(d) -5. But when there's extinction, the observed m_obs = m_true + Av.

Wait, but in Star3's case, what's given? The question says: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us." So perhaps that is the apparent magnitude observed, which is after extinction. So the intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) would be m_true = m_observed - Av.

Wait, no, that's not right. If the star's light is dimmed by extinction, then the observed apparent magnitude is higher. So m_obs = m_true + Av. So if the apparent V mag is given as 15.5, which includes extinction, then the actual m_true would be 15.5 minus Av. Because m_obs = m_true + Av. So m_true = m_obs - Av.

Wait, but Star3's description says: apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, and it's located at 15 pc. So without extinction, the apparent magnitude would be 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. But wait, that doesn't make sense. Because the distance is 15 pc, but the apparent magnitude without extinction would be m_true = M + 5 log10(d/10) ), right? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d) -5, where d is in parsecs. So for a star at distance d, the apparent magnitude (without extinction) is M +5*(log10(d)) -5.

Wait, let me compute that for Star3. If M is the absolute magnitude, but Star3's data doesn't give M, it gives apparent V with extinction. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Wait, Star3's data: apparent V mag is 15.5, but it's affected by extinction. So the star's true (intrinsic) apparent magnitude would be 15.5 - Av = 15.5 -1.86 =13.64. But wait, that can't be right because the distance is 15 pc. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's approach each star:

1. For each star, compute the apparent V magnitude, considering any extinction, and see if it's ≤16.

Star1: Absolute V is 15.5, distance 10 pc. So m_true = 15.5 +5*log10(10) -5. log10(10)=1, so 15.5 +5*1 -5=15.5+5-5=15.5. But that's without extinction. Wait, no extinction given for Star1, so m_true is 15.5. So apparent V is 15.5. So it's 15.5, which is ≤16. So both ESPRESSO and HIRES can see it? Wait, but wait: ESPRESSO can see up to 17, HIRES up to 16. So yes, 15.5 is ≤16, so both can observe. But wait, Star1's distance is 10 pc, so its apparent magnitude is 15.5. So it's observable by both.

But wait, Star1's RA is 15 deg and DEC is -75, which is in the southern sky. Paranal is in Chile, so it can observe southern declinations. Keck is in Hawaii, which can also observe a large part of the sky, but maybe not down to -75? Wait, the question says to disregard pointing limits and altitude, so I don't need to worry about that. So Star1's V is 15.5, so both can observe it. So Star1 would be a candidate.

Wait, but let's check the other options.

Star2: apparent V is 16.5, no extinction. So m_obs=16.5. So for HIRES, which can observe up to 16, 16.5 is too faint. So only ESPRESSO can see it. So Star2 is not a candidate.

Star3: apparent V is 15.5, but with E(B-V)=0.6. Av=3.1 *0.6=1.86. So observed m_obs = m_true + Av. So if the given apparent V is 15.5, which includes extinction, then m_true is 15.5 -1.86=13.64. But wait, that can't be. Because the distance is 15 pc. Let me compute Star3's apparent magnitude without extinction.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Star3's apparent V is given as 15.5, but that would be the observed magnitude. So the intrinsic (without extinction) apparent magnitude is m_true =15.5 -1.86=13.64. But wait, can I compute m_true using the distance? Let's see. Star3 is at 15 pc. Its absolute magnitude (M) would be m_true -5 +5 log10(d). So M = m_true -5 +5 log10(15). log10(15)=1.176. So M=13.64 -5 +5*(1.176)=13.64 -5 +5.88= 14.52. But wait, the problem doesn't give M for Star3, so perhaps that's not necessary. Alternatively, perhaps the apparent V magnitude given is the observed one, including extinction, so m_obs=15.5. So to get the intrinsic apparent magnitude, m_true =15.5 -1.86=13.64. But without considering distance, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is simply: which stars have apparent V magnitude ≤16 when extinction is taken into account. So for Star3, the apparent V is 15.5, but that's after extinction. Wait, no, wait. The given apparent V is 15.5, and the extinction is Av=1.86, so the true (intrinsic) apparent V would be 15.5 -1.86=13.64. So the star's apparent magnitude without extinction is 13.64. So when observed, it's 15.5, which is still ≤16, so HIRES can detect it. Wait, no, because the observed magnitude is 15.5. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, to clarify: the apparent magnitude given might already include extinction. So if Star3's apparent V is 15.5, which includes extinction, then the observed m is 15.5. So ESPRESSO can see it (V≤17), HIRES can see it as 15.5 ≤16. So yes, both can detect it.

Wait, but how? Because extinction makes stars appear dimmer (higher magnitude). So if a star's true apparent magnitude is M, then the observed would be M + Av. So if the observed V is 15.5, then M =15.5 -Av. So for Star3, M =15.5 -1.86=13.64. Then, without extinction, the apparent magnitude would be 13.64, which is way brighter than 15.5. So the observed magnitude is 15.5, which is within both spectrographs' limits. So yes, Star3 can be observed by both.

Star4: Absolute V magnitude 15.5, distance 10 pc, E(B-V)=0.4. So first, compute the apparent magnitude without extinction: m_true = M +5 log10(d) -5. M=15.5, d=10. So m_true=15.5 +5*1 -5=15.5. Then, the extinction adds Av=3.1 *0.4=1.24. So the observed apparent V is m=15.5 +1.24=16.74. So that's 16.74, which is higher than 16. So for HIRES, which can only go up to 16, it's too dim. So Star4's observed V is 16.74, which is not observable by HIRES. But ESPRESSO can see up to 17, so Star4 would be observable by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES. So Star4 is not a candidate.

Star5: Absolute V magnitude of 16.5, distance 5 pc. So m_true =16.5 +5 log10(5) -5. log10(5)=0.69897. So 5 *0.69897≈3.495. So m_true=16.5 +3.495 -5=16.5 + (-1.505)=14.995≈15.0. So apparent V is 15.0, and no extinction given. So observed V is 15.0, which is ≤16. So both spectrographs can detect it. So Star5 is a candidate.

Wait, but wait, Star5's data: RA=10h, DEC=60. So it's in the northern sky. Keck is in Hawaii, which can observe that. Paranal is in Chile, which can also observe declinations up to +25 or so? Wait, but the question says to disregard pointing limits, so we don't need to worry about whether the telescope can actually see it.

So let's recap:

Star1: V=15.5 → observable by both.

Star3: V=15.5 (observed) → observable by both.

Star5: V=15.0 → observable by both.

Wait, but wait, no. Let me recheck Star3. Because Star3's description says: apparent V mag of 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So observed V is 15.5 + Av? No, wait, no: wait, no, wait. Wait, when a star is observed, the extinction makes it appear dimmer. So the observed apparent magnitude is m_obs = m_true + Av. So if the star's true (intrinsic) apparent magnitude is m_true, then with extinction, it's m_obs = m_true + Av.

Wait, but in Star3's case, the apparent V is given as 15.5, but that's the observed value (including extinction). So the intrinsic (without extinction) is m_true =15.5 -1.86=13.64.

Wait, but that doesn't matter for our condition. Because we're looking at the observed V. So for Star3, observed V is 15.5, which is ≤16, so both can detect it.

Wait, but the problem is, for Star3, the apparent V is 15.5, but the extinction is 1.86, so does that mean that Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is the observed value (so it's 15.5), or is the 15.5 the intrinsic value, and the observed is higher?

Oh wait, perhaps I've got it wrong. Let me think: E(B-V) is the color excess, which is (B-V)_observed - (B-V)_intrinsic. Extinction makes stars appear redder and dimmer. So their apparent magnitude increases.

So in Star3's case, the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but this is the observed value, which includes extinction. So without extinction, the apparent magnitude would be 15.5 -1.86=13.64. But wait, that's not correct because the formula for m_obs is m_obs = m_true + Av.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach this differently. The question is asking which stars have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 (since that's the limit for HIRES, and ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so any star ≤16 can be seen by both).

So for Star3, the observed apparent V is 15.5, which is ≤16, so yes, both can detect it.

Star5's observed V is 15.0, which is ≤16, so both can detect.

Now, let's check each option.

The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4's observed V is 16.74>16 → cannot be detected by HIRES. So A is out.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both have V≤16, so yes.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 has V=16.5>16 → only ESPRESSO can see it. So C is out.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4's V=16.74>16 → no. So D is out.

Wait, but wait, Star1: its m was 15.5, which is ≤16, so both can see it. So why isn't Star1 an option? Because in the options given, none include Star1 except D, which also includes Star4 which is not suitable.

So looking at the options, option B says Star3 and Star5 can be detected by both. Star3's V is 15.5 (after extinction), which is ≤16, so yes. Star5's V is 15.0, so yes.

Wait, but wait, Star3's observed V is 15.5. So Star3 is observable by both. Star5 is observable by both. So option B includes both, which would be correct.

Wait, but wait, what about Star1? Its V is 15.5, so both can observe it. So why isn't Star1 in any of the options? The options don't include Star1 and another star. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4's V is 16.74, can't be seen by HIRES. So Star4 is out.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both have V≤16. So yes.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2's V is 16.5 >16 → no.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4's V=16.74>16 → no.

Wait, but according to this, option B is correct.

Wait, but wait, what about Star3's extinction? So if Star3's apparent V is 15.5, but when you apply extinction, would that make it even dimmer? No, because the 15.5 is the observed value. So when you apply extinction, you might be adding to it, but in this case, Star3's apparent V is already 15.5, which is within the limit. Wait, no, the extinction has already been accounted for in the observed V.

Wait, let me think again: Star3's apparent V is 15.5, which is the observed value (so it's 15.5). So it meets the HIRES condition (V ≤16), so both can see it.

So the correct answer would include Star3 and Star5.

Looking back, option B is 'Star3 and Star5'.

So the correct answer is option B.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars, considering their distances, absolute magnitudes, and extinction (if applicable). The key criteria are:

1. **ESPRESSO (Paranal)**: Can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤17.
2. **HIRES (Keck)**: Can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤16.

Thus, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detectable by both spectrographs.

### Analysis of Each Star:

#### **Star1**:
- Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 15.5 \)
- Distance: \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \)
- Apparent V magnitude (without extinction):  
  \[
  m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 15.5 + 5(1) - 5 = 15.5
  \]
- Extinction is not mentioned, so \( m = 15.5 \).
- **Conclusion**: \( m = 15.5 \leq 16 \), so Star1 is detectable by both spectrographs.

#### **Star2**:
- Apparent V magnitude: \( m = 16.5 \)
- **Conclusion**: \( m = 16.5 > 16 \), so Star2 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

#### **Star3**:
- Apparent V magnitude (observed, including extinction): \( m = 15.5 \)
- Extinction: \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \), so \( A_V = 3.1 \times 0.6 = 1.86 \)
- **Conclusion**: The observed apparent V magnitude is \( m = 15.5 \leq 16 \), so Star3 is detectable by both spectrographs.

#### **Star4**:
- Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 15.5 \)
- Distance: \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \)
- Apparent V magnitude (without extinction):  
  \[
  m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 15.5 + 5(1) - 5 = 15.5
  \]
- Extinction: \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \), so \( A_V = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24 \)
- Observed apparent V magnitude:  
  \[
  m_{\text{obs}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
  \]
- **Conclusion**: \( m_{\text{obs}} = 16.74 > 16 \), so Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

#### **Star5**:
- Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 16.5 \)
- Distance: \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \)
- Apparent V magnitude (without extinction):  
  \[
  m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 16.5 + 5(0.69897) - 5 \approx 15.0
  \]
- Extinction is not mentioned, so \( m = 15.0 \).
- **Conclusion**: \( m = 15.0 \leq 16 \), so Star5 is detectable by both spectrographs.

### Final Answer:
- **Star1**: Detectable by both spectrographs (\( m = 15.5 \)).
- **Star3**: Detectable by both spectrographs (\( m = 15.5 \)).
- **Star5**: Detectable by both spectrographs (\( m = 15.0 \)).
- **Star2 and Star4**: Not detectable by both spectrographs.

The correct option is **B) Star3 and Star5**, as both have apparent V magnitudes ≤16 and are detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

**Answer: B**
