Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let's see what it's about.

Alright, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The cavity's radius is r, and it's smaller than R. Then, someone places a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Wait, what do I remember about conductors with cavities? Oh right, when a conductor encloses a charge, the charge induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces. But wait, the conductor was uncharged initially. So, what happens when you put a charge inside the cavity?

Oh, I think the inner surface of the conductor would have an induced charge of -q, right? Because the conductor was neutral to start with. But wait, wait. If the conductor is neutral, and we place a +q inside the cavity, the inner surface must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, what about the outer surface? Since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner -q. So the total charge on the conductor would be +q, but wait, no. Wait, the conductor itself is initially neutral, so the total charge after is +q inside the cavity, which induces -q on the inner surface and +q on the outer surface. Hmm, that makes sense.

But wait, the point P is outside the conductor. So when we're outside a conductor, the electric field behaves as if all the charge is concentrated at the center. So for a point outside, the field is the same as if the charge were a point charge at the center of the sphere. But wait, the conductor is uncharged except for the induced charges. But with the +q on the outer surface, the total charge is +q. So at a point outside, the field is due to that +q at the center.

But wait, point P is outside the conductor, right? So the field E at P would be as if all the charge enclosed is at the center. So the formula would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q_enclosed) / L², where L is the distance from the center to P.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor is uncharged initially, but after putting +q inside, the outer surface has +q. So the total charge of the conductor is +q. Therefore, the field outside is as if +q is at the center of the conductor's sphere.

But the options don't all fit this. Let's look at the options. Option B says (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². That would fit if the field is using the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q, as the source, and the distance is L. So that would be the correct expression.

Wait, but the other options involve terms with l and s and cosθ. So why are they present? Oh, perhaps I'm miscalculating something. Let me think again.

Wait, the cavity's center is shifted by s relative to the conductor's center. So the charge +q is inside the cavity, which is not at the center of the conductor. So the induced charges might be a bit more complicated. Let me think about this.

The conductor is neutral, so when you place +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q to make the electric field inside the conductor zero. But where is that inner surface? It's the inner surface of the conductor, which is at radius R. The cavity's center is at a distance s from the conductor's center, and the cavity radius is r, so the center is off-center by s.

Wait, but the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, which is itself off-center. So the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge, but how does that affect the electric field outside?

Wait, the conductor is a conductor, so the electric field inside the conductor (the material) is zero. So the charges reside on the surfaces. The inner surface will have -q, and the outer surface will have +q, because the conductor was neutral.

So when considering the electric field outside the conductor, the induced charges on the outer surface (which is a sphere of radius R) will produce the field. But since the outer surface is a sphere, regardless of how the inner charges are arranged, the outer surface's charge will distribute uniformly if the conductor is a perfect sphere. Wait, but the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface must be uniformly charged, regardless of the inner arrangement. Because for a conducting sphere, the charges on the outer surface distribute uniformly only if the conductor is a perfect sphere and the electric fields inside the conductor are zero.

Wait, but in this case, the charge inside the cavity is not at the center. But the conductor is a sphere. So the inner surface must have an induced charge, but the outer surface's charge distribution depends on the inner. Hmm, but wait, the outer surface should still be spherically symmetric because the conductor is a sphere. Or maybe not?

Wait, no. If the cavity is off-center, then the inner surface's induced charge would not be spherically symmetric. So the inner surface would have a non-uniform charge distribution. But the outer surface, being a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, must have a charge distribution that causes E inside the conductor to be zero. So I think the outer surface will still be uniformly charged, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the superposition of fields. The conductor's outer surface has a charge +q. So the field outside would be as if that charge is at the center of the conductor's sphere, because the outer surface is a sphere.

So regardless of where the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the outer surface's charge ensures that the field outside is as if the charge were at the center of the conductor. So the field at point P, which is outside, would be (1/(4πε₀))*(q)/L², because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to P.

Wait, but the options also have other possibilities. For instance, option C and A involve l and s and cosθ. So maybe the induced charges create a different scenario. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the charge inside the cavity induces a dipole or something else. But no, the conductor's outer surface must have a charge of +q, so the field outside should be that of a point charge +q at the center of the conductor.

Wait a second. Let me think about the position of the charge inside the cavity. So the charge is at the center of the cavity, which is shifted by s from the center of the conductor. So the +q is located at a point that's s away from the conductor's center. So when the charge is placed in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (radius R) induces a charge of -q at the inner surface. But because the +q is not at the center, the inner surface's charge isn't symmetric. However, the outer surface is a sphere, so its charge distribution is uniform, making the field outside only depend on the total charge, which is +q.

Wait, but the point P is outside the conductor, but its position is given in terms of l, which is the distance from the center of the cavity. So the distance from the center of the conductor isn't directly l, but perhaps through the relation involving s.

But wait, the conductor is a sphere, so the field outside depends on the distance from its center. So the point P is at distance L from the center of the conductor. So the field should be as if the charge is at the center, so E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking at the options, option B says exactly that. So the correct answer should be option B. However, I need to make sure.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the point P is located at a distance L from the center of the spherical conductor, but also at a distance l from the center of the cavity. The angle between l and s is theta. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of the electric field isn't as straightforward. Let me think about how the charges arrange themselves.

The conductor has a cavity with a charge +q inside. The inner surface of the conductor must have -q, but since the cavity is off-center, this inner surface's charge isn't uniform. However, the outer surface's charge is +q, which is symmetric because it's the conductor's surface. So the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed, leading to E outside as (1/(4πε₀)) q / L².

But another approach: the field outside the conductor is due to all the charges enclosed within the conductor. Since the conductor's net charge is +q, the field outside is as if it's a point charge at the center, regardless of where inside the cavity the charge is placed.

So the answer should be option B. But let me check the options again.

Option B: (1/(4πε₀)) q / L². So that's correct.

Alternatively, if the charge distribution induced on the conductor's outer surface is uniform, then the field outside depends only on the total charge and the distance from the center.

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity's center is offset by a distance $s$ from the conductor's center, and the cavity has a radius $r$ where $r < R$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The goal is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, located at a distance $L$ from the conductor's center and at a distance $l$ from the cavity's center. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Induced Charges**: When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor induces a charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material. The outer surface of the conductor, being neutral initially, must then have a charge of $+q$ to maintain overall charge neutrality.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For points outside a spherical conductor, the electric field depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor and the distance from the conductor's center. Since the outer surface of the conductor has a uniform charge distribution of $+q$, the electric field at point $P$ (outside the conductor) is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor.

3. **Distance and Field Expression**: The distance from the center of the conductor to point $P$ is $L$. Using Coulomb's law, the electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Rejection of Other Options**:
   - Options A and C involve terms like $(l \pm s \cos\theta)^2$, which are irrelevant because the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$ from the conductor's center, not on the position of the cavity or the angle $\theta$.
   - Option D incorrectly uses $l^2$ (the distance from the cavity's center to $P$) instead of $L^2$ (the distance from the conductor's center to $P$).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it correctly represents the electric field outside the conductor.

Answer: B
