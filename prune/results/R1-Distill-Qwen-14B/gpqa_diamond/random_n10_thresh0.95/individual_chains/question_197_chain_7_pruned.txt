Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these spectroscopic analysis questions. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of an acid chloride to form a carboxylic acid. Wait, or is it more about substitution? Hmm, I think when you have an acyl chloride reacting with HI and red phosphorus, it usually leads to the formation of an acid because the phosphorus acts as a catalyst or something, and the HI provides the iodide ions which substitute the chloride in the acyl chloride.

So, the first thing I need to do is figure out what Compound X is. The problem provides IR and NMR data, so I'll start by looking at that.

Looking at the IR data: I see strong absorption around 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H stretching, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, so that's probably a carbonyl group. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretching. So putting this together, it might be a benzoic acid derivative because the carbonyl is around 1720, which is typical for a carboxylic acid.

Now the NMR data. Let's go through each peak:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. So that makes sense with the IR data. The -COOH proton would be around there.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are two sets of doublets, probably from para-substituted aromatic protons. So maybe it's a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. Like a para-substituted benzene, maybe with a substituent in one position and another group in the opposite.

Looking at the integration, 2H each, so perhaps two sets of equivalent protons. That suggests symmetry, so the substituents are on opposite sides, like in para positions.

Then at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, maybe a methylene or methine group adjacent to something. Could be a CH in a chain next to a carbonyl or an oxygen.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, perhaps another set of adjacent CH2 groups.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet integrating for 3H, which suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, maybe a CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, because a doublet for methyl would mean it's attached to a CH that's split by adjacent protons.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, likely a terminal methyl group, so maybe part of an ethyl chain. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2 group.

Putting this together, the structure seems to have a benzene ring with substituents. The carboxylic acid group is on the ring, and perhaps a side chain attached. Let me think: a benzene ring with a -COOH group and another substituent. The substituent might be an alkyl chain.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, there's an integration of 3H at 0.9 ppm as triplet, which is typical for a CH2CH3 group. Also, the 1.4 ppm doublet for 3H suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. Hmm, so maybe the substituent is a -CH2-C(CH3)2 or something else.

Wait, maybe it's a propyl group. Let's see: the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH connected to two CH2 groups. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be two adjacent CH2 groups. So perhaps it's a -CH2-CH2-CH2- group, but that doesn't explain the doublet at 1.4 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's a branching.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which is a methyl group. So if it's a -CH(CH2CH3)- group, then the methyl would be on a CH, which is attached to another CH2. So maybe the structure is something like benzene with a -COOH group and a -CH(CH2CH3) group. But wait, that would mean the substituent is a branch.

Wait, looking at the substituent on the benzene, let's say in the para position. So the substituents are -COOH and -CH2CH(CH2CH3) or something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propanoic acid group, but that probably wouldn't fit with the IR and NMR. Because the IR already shows a strong carbonyl, which would be the carboxylic acid.

Wait, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group at one position and an ethyl group at another para position. But wait, the NMR doesn't have just an ethyl; there's more.

Wait, the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which would be a CH2CH3. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH connected to two CH2 groups. So maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH2- group, but that doesn't add up because the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which is a methyl attached to a CH.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3) group. Let me draw it out mentally.

The benzene ring has a -COOH group at one position, and a -CH(CH2CH3) group at the para position. So the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3). Wait, but then the CH would be attached to the benzene, and the CH2CH3 would be a branch.

But what's the structure of the substituent? Let's consider the NMR again.

The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) would be the CH that's attached to the benzene and connected to the CH2CH3 group. The next group would be CH2CH3, which would have a triplet for the CH2CH3's terminal methyl group (0.9 ppm, triplet). The CH2 adjacent to the CH would be at 1.7 ppm (m,2H). So the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a isopropyl group? No, wait, isopropyl is CH2CH(CH3). Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. No, that doesn't fit the NMR. Alternatively, maybe it's a butyl group.

Wait, let me think the substituent.

The substituent on the benzene is a chain. The NMR shows:

At 1.4 ppm, a doublet for 3H. So it's a methyl group attached to a CH, which is itself attached to another group.

At 0.9 ppm, a triplet (3H) which is a terminal methyl, so that's a CH2CH2CH3 group.

Wait, so perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group. So the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). But wait, that's a propyl group with a branch? Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3) group, but that would have a different NMR.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me think about the NMR peaks:

- 10.5 ppm (1H, COOH)
- 8.0 (2H, aromatic)
- 7.2 (2H, aromatic)
- 2.9 (1H, perhaps a CH)
- 1.7 (2H, CH2)
- 1.4 (3H, CH3)
- 0.9 (3H, CH2CH3)

So the substituent would have the structure: -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, that would make the substituent -CH2-CH(CH2CH3), which is a pentyl group? No, wait, let's count.

The substituent is attached to the benzene ring as a side chain. Let's
