Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles the same, right? Like, it's a special case of a hexagonal crystal system or something? Wait, no, actually, rhombohedral is a type of Bravais lattice, I think. Oh wait, no, Bravais lattices are the different types of crystal structures. So rhombohedral has a primitive lattice where all edges are equal and all angles are equal.

The question gives the interatomic distance as 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice parameter 'a'. So in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters a, b, c are all equal, and the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all the same. So here, alpha, beta, gamma are each 30 degrees.

The question is about the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by (1/d_{hkl})^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) + ... wait, no, not exactly. I think the formula for a general crystal system is more complicated than that. Because in cubic systems, the formula is simpler. Oh wait, for cubic, d_{hkl} is a/(sqrt(h^2 +k^2 +l^2)), but for other systems, like hexagonal or rhombohedral, it's a bit more involved.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma is given by the reciprocal of the square root of [(h²/a²)(sin² alpha) + (k²/b²)(sin² beta) + (l²/c²)(sin² gamma) + ... ] No, wait, I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, I remember that the general formula is 1/d^2 = (h^2)/(a^2) (sin^2 beta sin^2 gamma)/(sin^2 alpha)) + ... Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look up the correct formula.

Wait, another approach: for a rhombohedral crystal, since a = b = c and all angles are equal, the formula should simplify. The interplanar distance formula for rhombohedral can be written as:

1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) - (h k (cos alpha))/(a^2) - (h l (cos alpha))/(a^2) - (k l (cos alpha))/(a^2)

Wait, is that right? I think I might be mixing it up. Alternatively, another formula I've heard is d_{hkl} = (a)/(sqrt(h^2 +k^2 + l^2 - 2hk cos alpha - 2hl cos alpha - 2kl cos alpha )) )

Wait, but that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, perhaps the general formula for d-spacing is:

d^2 = (a^2 (b^2 c^2))/( (h b c sin alpha)^2 + ... ) Hmm, no, perhaps I'm getting confused with the hexagonal case.

Wait, let me think again. For a general triclinic crystal, the interplanar distance is given by:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 (sin^2 beta sin^2 gamma) + k^2 (sin^2 alpha sin^2 gamma) + l^2 (sin^2 alpha sin^2 beta)) / (a^2 b^2 c^2) ) + (h k (sin^2 beta sin gamma cos alpha)) / (a^2 b^2 c^2) ... no, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe I should refer to the formula for a rhombohedral system. Since a = b = c and alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees, the formula simplifies.

I think in the case of a rhombohedral structure, the interplanar distance for (hkl) plane is given by:

d = a / sqrt( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(alpha) )

Since a is the lattice parameter, which is the interatomic distance, so a=10 Angstrom.

Wait, but in rhombohedral, sometimes the lattice parameter is denoted as 'a', but in some contexts, especially when angles are not 90 degrees, the interatomic distance along the edges is 'a', but the vectors may not form right angles.

Wait, another thought: the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos α - 2kl cos α )

Yes, I think that's correct. So for the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1.

So substituting:

d = 10 / sqrt( 1 + 1 + 1 - 2*(1)(1) cos(30) - 2*(1)(1) cos(30) - 2*(1)(1) cos(30) )

Wait, cos(30 degrees) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So let's compute the denominator step by step.

First, compute the sum of squares: 1+1+1=3.

Next, compute the terms with cos(30). Each term is 2*1*1*cos(30) = 2*0.8660 ≈ 1.732.

But there are three such terms: hk, hl, kl, each contributing 2 cos(30). So 3 * 1.732 ≈ 5.196.

Wait, but the formula is:

h² +k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos α - 2kl cos α

Which is 3 - [2 cos(30)]*(sum of hk + hl + kl )

Since h=k=l=1, hk=1, hl=1, kl=1. So sum is 3. So 2 cos(30) *3 = 6 * 0.8660 ≈ 5.196.

So denominator sqrt(3 - 5.196 )? Wait, 3 -5.196 is negative, which can't be. Hmm, that can't be right. Because sqrt of a negative number is not real. That must mean I made a mistake in the formula.

Ah, wait, wait! Let me re-express the formula correctly. The correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d^2 = [ a^2 ( sin α )^2 ( h^2 +k^2 + l^2 ) ] / [ (h + k + l)^2 - (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ]

Wait, no, that's probably not right either. Maybe I should think about the Miller indices and the structure factor, but perhaps another approach.

Wait, let me think about the structure of the rhombohedral crystal. All edges are of length a. The angles between edges are all alpha=30 degrees. The reciprocal lattice vectors are involved in calculating interplanar distances.

Alternatively, I've found a formula for the interplanar spacing in rhombohedral crystals. The formula for d_{hkl} is:

d_{hkl} = a / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos α + kl cos α) ) )

Wait, but when I compute that, for (111) and alpha=30 degrees, the denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 2*(3 * (cos 30) )) ?

Wait, let's compute:

h =1, k=1, l=1.

h² +k² +l² = 3.

2(hk + hl + kl) cos α = 2*(1+1+1)* cos(30) = 6 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 3*sqrt(3) ≈ 5.196.

So denominator becomes sqrt(3 -5.196) = sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. That can't be possible. So that suggests that the formula I'm using is incorrect.

Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I have the formula wrong. Let me think again. Maybe the correct formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral crystal is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha + (hl + hk + kl) (1 - cos alpha) ) )

No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me try to look for another approach.

Another idea: the interplanar distance d is related to the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. The formula can be derived using the structure factor.

Wait, perhaps the general formula for the interplanar distance is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2/lattice_vector^2 * sin^2 beta sin^2 gamma) + (k^2/lattice_vector^2 * sin^2 alpha sin^2 gamma) + (l^2/lattice_vector^2 * sin^2 alpha sin^2 beta) + ... )

No, that seems complicated. Alternatively, another approach: for a rhombohedral system, the volume of the unit cell is V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 alpha + 2 cos^3 alpha), but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, maybe I should use the reciprocal lattice approach. The reciprocal lattice vectors for a rhombohedral system are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) [1, 0, 0]

b2 = (2π/a) [0, 1, 0]

b3 = (2π/a) [0, 0, 1]

Wait, no, that's for a cubic system. For rhombohedral, the reciprocal vectors are more complex because of the angles.

Alternatively, the general formula for d_{hkl} is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a)^2 - 2(h k cos gamma + h l cos beta + k l cos alpha)/(a^2) )

Wait, but in rhombohedral, all angles are equal, so gamma=beta=alpha=30 degrees.

So substituting, becomes:

d_{hkl}^2 = (1/a^2) [ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 h k cos alpha - 2 h l cos alpha - 2 k l cos alpha ]

Wait, that's the same formula as before. So plugging in the numbers again:

h=1, k=1, l=1.

h² +k² +l² =3.

2hk cos alpha = 2*(1)(1)*cos(30) = 2 * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3) ≈1.732.

Same for 2hl cos alpha and 2kl cos alpha. So each is sqrt(3), and there are three terms.

So 3 * sqrt(3) ≈5.196.

So denominator inside the sqrt is 3 -5.196 = -2.196.

That's negative, which is impossible. So my formula must be wrong. What's the problem here?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula should have 2hk cos alpha subtracted, but in reality, if the angles are not 90 degrees, the term could be positive or negative. But in our case, the denominator is negative, which suggests that the (111) plane is not possible? Or perhaps I got the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The interplanar distance can be found using the formula in terms of the dot product of the plane normals. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the unit cell. For a rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors are a, b, c, each of length a, and the angles between them are alpha. The (111) plane is defined by the Miller indices h=1, k=1, l=1.

The interplanar distance d is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the plane's normal vector in reciprocal space. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the distance by considering the projection along the plane's normal.

Wait, maybe a better way is to calculate the volume of the unit cell and then use the formula for d_{hkl}.

The volume V of the rhombohedral unit cell is V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 α + 2 cos^3 α).

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, the volume can be calculated as a^3 * (1 - 3 cos α + 3 cos^2 α/2) ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another formula for the volume of a rhombohedron is V = a^3 sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 α + 2 cos^3 α).

Let me compute that. For alpha=30 degrees, cos(30)=√3/2≈0.8660.

So cos^2 α = (3/4) = 0.75.

cos^3 α = (3√3)/(8) ≈0.6495.

So 1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*(0.6495) = 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 ≈ (1 - 2.25) = -1.25 +1.299 ≈ 0.049.

So sqrt(0.049) ≈ 0.2214.

So V= a^3 * 0.2214. With a=10, V≈1000 *0.2214=221.4 Ang^3.

But I'm not sure how this helps with the interplanar distance. Maybe using the formula that relates d_{hkl} to the volume.

Wait, the formula for d_{hkl} is:

d_{hkl} = (volume of unit cell) / ( | (h a^* ) × (k b^* ) + ... | )

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal lattice vectors. The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) (1, 0, 0) - but I'm getting confused because this is only true for a cubic system. For rhombohedral, the reciprocal vectors have components involving cosines of the angles.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vectors for a rhombohedral system can be given as:

b1 = (2π/a) [1, 0, 0]

b2 = (2π/a) [0, 1, 0]

b3 = (2π/a) [0, 0, 1]

But wait, this is only correct if the angles are 90 degrees. For non-orthogonal systems, the reciprocal vectors are more complex. So perhaps I need to compute the reciprocal vectors correctly.

Alternatively, wait, perhaps the formula for d_{hkl} is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / [ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) * (a^2) (sin α)^2 ) / ( (h +k +l)^2 ) ) ]^(1/2)

Wait, no, that's probably incorrect.

Another approach: maybe I should recall that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d_{hkl} = a / ( sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ) )

Wait, but when I plug in the numbers, the denominator becomes negative, which isn't possible. So perhaps the formula is incorrect, or maybe the (111) plane isn't allowed? Or perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl)(1 - cos α) )

Wait, let's try that. For h=k=l=1, alpha=30 degrees.

Compute denominator:

h² +k² + l² =3.

Each term 2 hk (1 - cos α) is 2*(1)(1)*(1 - 0.8660) = 2*(0.134) ≈0.268.

There are three such terms: hk, hl, kl. So total is 3*0.268≈0.804.

So denominator is sqrt(3 + 0.804) = sqrt(3.804) ≈1.9507.

So d =10 / 1.9507 ≈5.128 Angstrom. But looking at the options, the closest is 9.08 (option A), but 5 is way lower. Hmm, none of the options match. So perhaps this formula is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should try another formula. Another idea: the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

But wait, earlier calculation gave a negative inside the sqrt, which can't be. So perhaps this suggests that the (111) plane is not possible in this structure, but that can't be the case. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is correct, and in this case, the denominator becomes imaginary, which would imply that the (111) plane is not present in the diffraction pattern, but the question is asking for the interplanar distance, so perhaps another approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of the formula. Maybe the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Wait, let's try that. For our case:

h² +k² +l² =3.

Each of the 2hk cos alpha terms is 2*(1)(1)*0.866=1.732.

There are three such terms, so 3*1.732=5.196.

So denominator is sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=≈2.862.

d =10/(2.862)=≈3.493 Angstrom. Still not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d^2 = (a²)/( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl)(1 - cos alpha) )

Wait, let me compute that.

Denominator inside the sqrt is:

3 + 2*(1+1+1)*(1 - 0.866) = 3 + 6*(0.134) ≈3 + 0.804=3.804.

So d=10 / sqrt(3.804) ≈10/1.950≈5.128 Angstrom.

Again, same as before. So clearly, none of the options match, which suggests that perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the rhombohedral system as a special case of a hexagonal system, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, wait! Another approach is using the structure of the rhombohedral system as a distorted cubic system. So, perhaps the interplanar distance can be found by considering the projection along a certain axis.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should consider that the interplanar distance formula for rhombohedral is the same as for cubic but modified by the angles. In cubic, d = a / sqrt(3), for (111). But in this case, the angles are 30 degrees, which would change the effective distance.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is d = a * sqrt( (sin(alpha))^2 ) / (sqrt(3)), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the unit cell vectors and then compute the plane (111). Let me think about the vectors.

In a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice vectors can be written as:

a = a * (1, 0, 0)
b = a * (cos α, sin α, 0)
c = a * (cos α, (cos α * cos β - sin α * sin γ)/sin β, (sin α * cos γ + cos α * sin β ) / sin β )

Wait, but since all angles are equal (alpha=beta=gamma), this simplifies. Let me set alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

So, the vectors are:

a = (a, 0, 0)
b = (a cos α, a sin α, 0)
c = (a cos α, (a cos^2 α - a sin^2 α * (cos gamma? Wait, perhaps it's easier to proceed with unit vectors.

So, each of the three vectors a, b, c has the same length, a.

The (111) plane's normal vector is (1,1,1) in terms of the reciprocal lattice.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:

d = |(a · (b × c))| / sqrt( (h a1 + k b1 + l c1)^2 + (h a2 + k b2 + l c2)^2 + (h a3 + k b3 + l c3)^2 )

Wait, but this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can avoid this by using a different approach.

Wait, another idea: the interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent planes along the direction perpendicular to the plane. For a cubic system, it's straightforward, but for rhombohedral, the calculation is more involved.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the interplanar distance using the following formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl)(1 - cos α) )

Wait, that's the same as I tried earlier. So for (111):

d = 10 / sqrt(3 + 6*(1 - cos30)).

Compute 1-cos30=1 - sqrt(3)/2≈1-0.866=0.134.

6 *0.134≈0.804.

So denominator sqrt(3+0.804)=sqrt(3.804)=approx 1.950.

So d=10 / 1.950≈5.128 Angstrom, which is not in the options. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the rhombohedral system as a simple cubic system with a strain. The interplanar distance in cubic is a/sqrt(3). But with the angles, it's scaled. So perhaps the interplanar distance is a * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 alpha + 2 cos^3 alpha) / sqrt(3). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( h^2 +k^2 +l^2 + 2 h k cos α + 2 h l cos α + 2 k l cos α )

Wait, let's try that. So for (111):

denominator = sqrt( 3 + 2*(1*1 cos30 +1*1 cos30 +1*1 cos30) )= sqrt(3 + 3*(2*0.866))=sqrt(3 + 5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.862.

So d=10 / 2.862≈3.493 Angstrom. Not matching the options.

I'm stuck. Let me check the options again. The options are around 9-10 Angstrom. My earlier attempts gave 5 or 3, which are much lower. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the interatomic distance is not the same as the lattice parameter a. Wait, the question says "interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom". So in a simple cubic structure, the lattice parameter a would be 10 Angstrom. But in a rhombohedral structure, if the atoms are at the corners, the interatomic distance would be a√3/2 for a (111) plane? No, wait, perhaps it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance refers to the edge length a. Because in a cube, the interatomic distance along the edge is a, and the face diagonal is a√2, and the space diagonal is a√3. But in rhombohedral, the structure is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for interplanar distance in rhombohedral is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α )

But earlier, this gave a negative denominator. So maybe I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α )

But with the angles being 30 degrees, let's compute:

(h^2 +k^2 +l^2) =3.

2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α = 2*(3) * cos30 =6 *0.866≈5.196.

So 3 -5.196= -2.196.

Which is negative. So the denominator is imaginary, which can't be. So perhaps for (111) plane, it's not possible to have a real d-spacing. But the question is asking for it, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( [h^2 + k^2 + l^2] + 2 [hk + hl + kl] (1 - cos α) )

Wait, let's try that. So:

3 + 2*3*(1 - cos30) =3 + 6*(0.134)=3+0.804=3.804.

sqrt(3.804)=1.95.

d=10/1.95≈5.128.

Still not matching options.

Wait, maybe the formula is different. I found a source that says for rhombohedral systems, the interplanar distance is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α )

But in our case, this leads to a negative, which is impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider a different approach. Maybe the interplanar distance is the same as the interatomic distance because the (111) plane is along the same direction. But that would suggest d=10 Angstrom, which is option D. But that seems unlikely because in a crystal, the interplanar distance is generally smaller than the interatomic distance.

Wait, but in a simple cubic structure, the (111) plane interplanar distance is a/√3≈10 /1.732≈5.77 Angstrom. Which is lower than 10. But the options provided are around 9, which is higher.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach. The interplanar distance d can be found by:

d = a * sqrt( (1 - cos α)(1 - cos β)(1 - cos γ) ) / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) )

But with alpha=beta=gamma=30, this simplifies to:

(1 - cos30)^3 = (0.134)^3 ≈0.0024.

So d=10 * sqrt(0.0024)/sqrt(3) ≈10 * 0.049 /1.732 ≈0.282 Angstrom, which is way too small. So this can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 hk (1 + cos α) - 2 hl (1 + cos α) - 2 kl (1 + cos α) )

Wait, trying that:

h=k=l=1.

Denominator: 3 - 2*(3)(1 + 0.866) )=3 -2*3*1.866=3-11.196≈-8.196. Still negative.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h^2 +k^2 +l^2 + 2hk (1 - cos α) + 2hl (1 - cos α) + 2kl (1 - cos α) )

Which would be:

3 + 2*3*(0.134) =3 +0.804=3.804.

So d=10 / sqrt(3.804)=≈5.128.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, thinking differently: perhaps the formula uses the unit cell edges but in a different way. For example, maybe the a, b, c are not all the same. But the question says a rhombohedral crystal, so a=b=c.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the angles given are the angles between the lattice vectors, so the angle between a and b is alpha=30 degrees. So, perhaps the interplanar distance is calculated using the formula for a general hexagonal system, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should try to visualize the (111) plane. In a rhombohedral structure, the (111) plane would cut the three lattice vectors a, b, c at a certain point. The interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent such planes.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance in rhombohedral is:

d = (a) / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos α) ) )

Which we've already tried, but it gives d=5.128 Angstrom.

But the options are around 9, which is higher than the interatomic distance of 10. That seems odd because interplanar distance is typically shorter than the lattice parameter.

Wait, wait! Perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the interplanar distance is calculated as a function of the reciprocal of the sum of squares. Wait, perhaps I should use the inverse of the square root of the sum of the squares of the Miller indices, scaled by the lattice parameters and angles.

Wait, another formula I found in some notes:

For a general rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

But in our case, this gives a negative denominator, which is impossible. So perhaps the (111) plane is not allowed for alpha=30 degrees in a rhombohedral system.

But the question is asking for the interplanar distance, so I must be missing something. Maybe the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos α) )

Which we did earlier and got d=5.128, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me try to look up the formula for interplanar spacing in rhombohedral systems.

Upon reflection, I think I have the formula correct. So perhaps the (111) plane doesn't exist for this structure, but the question is assuming it does.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is in fact greater than the lattice parameter, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no, interplanar distances are usually smaller than the lattice parameter.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the reciprocal of the sum, so maybe d = 1 / (something small), leading to a large d.

But I'm not making progress. Let me look at the options again. The options are:

A)9.08

B)8.95

C)9.54

D)10.05

Only options A, B, C, D are close to 10. So perhaps the calculation is different.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the interatomic distance is the edge length of the unit cell, a=10 Angstrom. Then, the interplanar distance for (111) in a cubic system is a√3/3. But since the angles are smaller, perhaps the distance is longer.

Wait, in a cubic system, d= a/√3≈5.774. But in this case, the angles are 30 degrees, which would change the distance.

Wait, perhaps the distance is a multiplied by (1 / sqrt(
