Okay, so I need to find the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li-6 maybe, since it has 3 neutrons. Let me think.

First, I remember that in particle physics, the energy of a relativistic particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the speed v is 0.96c, I can calculate gamma.

Wait, so gamma equals 1 divided by sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Let me compute that. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me double-check that. Hmm, 0.28 times 3.5714 is about 1, right? 0.28 * 3.5714 = 1, yeah.

But wait, no, 1/0.28 is actually 3.57142857... So gamma is approximately 3.57143.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6 atomic mass units (u). Oh wait, I should get the exact value. Let me recall that 1 atomic mass unit is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6 u would be 6 * 931.5 MeV, which is 5589 MeV, or 5.589 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second, Li-6 has 3 neutrons. So the mass number is 6, which is 3 protons (Li has atomic number 3) and 3 neutrons. So yeah, the mass is 6.0 u.

So the rest mass energy is 6.0 * 931.5 MeV = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV.

So the total energy E is gamma multiplied by m c squared. So E = gamma * m c². Gamma is 3.57143, m c² is 5.589 GeV.

So E = 3.57143 * 5.589 GeV. Let me compute that.

3.57143 * 5 = 17.85715, and 3.57143 * 0.589 ≈ let's see, 3.57143 * 0.5 is 1.785715, 3.57143 * 0.08 is 0.2857144, and 3.57143 * 0.009 is about 0.03214287. Adding those: 1.785715 + 0.2857144 = 2.0714294, +0.03214287 = 2.10357227. So the total is 17.85715 + 2.10357227 ≈ 19.96072 GeV.

Wait, but let me compute 3.57143 * 5.589 more accurately. Let me do it step by step.

3.57143 * 5 = 17.85715.

3.57143 * 0.5 = 1.785715.

3.57143 * 0.08 = 0.2857144.

3.57143 * 0.009 = 0.03214287.

Adding 1.785715 + 0.2857144 = 2.0714294, plus 0.03214287 gives 2.10357227.

So 17.85715 + 2.10357227 = 19.96072227 GeV.

Wait, but let me compute it more correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, 3.57143 * 5.589.

3.57143 * 5 =17.85715.

3.57143 * 0.5 = 1.785715.

3.57143 * 0.08 =0.2857144.

3.57143 * 0.009=0.03214287.

So 17.85715 + 1.785715 =19.642865.

19.642865 + 0.2857144 =19.9285794.

19.9285794 +0.03214287=19.96072227 GeV.

So about 19.96 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, D is 21.419 GeV, B is 23.069, A is 18.475.

Hmm, my initial calculation gives about 19.96 GeV. But none of the options exactly match that. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating gamma.

Wait, let me recalculate gamma. v=0.96c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

v²= (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c².

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28= approximately 3.57142857.

Wait, that's correct.

Now, the rest mass energy: 6 u -> 6 * 931.5 MeV = 5589 MeV =5.589 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise value for 1 u.

Wait, 1 u is exactly 931.494064 MeV/c². So 6 u is 6 * 931.494064 = 5588.964384 MeV, which is 5.588964384 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 * 5.588964384 GeV.

Let me compute this:

3.57142857 *5.588964384.

Let me write this as 3.57142857 *5.588964384.

Hmm, perhaps breaking it down.

3.57142857 *5 = 17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.5 =1.785714285.

3.57142857 *0.08 = 0.2857142856.

3.57142857 *0.008964384= ?

Wait, 0.008964384 is approximately 0.009. So 3.57142857 * 0.008964384 ≈ 0.031999999.

So adding all parts:

17.85714285 +1.785714285 =19.64285713.

19.64285713 +0.2857142856=19.9285714156.

19.9285714156 +0.031999999 ≈19.9605714146 GeV.

So approximately 19.9606 GeV.

Looking at the options, there's no option exactly at 19.96. The closest options would be C) 20.132 GeV and D)21.419 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass. Let me double-check the mass of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass is 6 atomic mass units. But wait, does the mass of the nucleus equal exactly 6 u? Because in reality, the mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons due to binding energy. But in these calculations, I think we use the mass number as A u, so for Li-6, it's 6 u.

Alternatively, perhaps the question considers the mass as the sum of the individual nucleons. Each proton is about 1.007276 u, and each neutron is about 1.008665 u. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So calculating the mass: 3*(1.007276) +3*(1.008665) = 3*(1.007276 + 1.008665) = 3 * (2.015941) =6.047823 u.

Wait, that's more precise. So the actual mass is 6.047823 u. So the rest mass energy is 6.047823 *931.494064 MeV.

Calculating that:

6.047823 *931.494064.

Let me compute that:

Let me compute 6 *931.494064 =5588.964384 MeV.

0.047823 *931.494064 = ?

0.04 *931.494064 =37.25976256.

0.007823 *931.494064 ≈ 7.302 (since 0.007 *931.494=6.520458, 0.000823 *931≈0.770. So 6.520458 +0.770=7.290458. So total 0.047823 *931.494064 ≈37.25976256 +7.290458 ≈44.55022056 MeV.

So total mass energy is 5588.964384 +44.55022056 = 5633.5146 MeV, which is 5.6335146 GeV.

So now, E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.6335146 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285 GeV.

3.57142857 *0.6335146 = ?

Let me compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.0335146 ≈ ?

0.03 *3.57142857 ≈0.107142857.

0.0035146 *3.57142857 ≈0.012536.

So 0.107142857 +0.012536 ≈0.119678857.

So 3.57142857 *0.6335146 ≈2.142857142 +0.119678857 ≈2.262535999 GeV.

Adding to the earlier 17.85714285:

17.85714285 +2.262535999 =20.11967885 GeV.

So approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, why is the previous method giving me 19.96 GeV, but now 20.12 GeV? Because I used the more precise mass calculation.

So the correct approach is to use the precise mass of the Li-6 nucleus, which is 6.047823 u. So E is about 20.1197 GeV, which rounds to 20.12 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but in the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 20.132, so is 20.1197 close enough? The options are given, so perhaps I should consider if the initial approach was wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact formula without approximating.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approximation of 6 u is acceptable, but that gave us 19.96 GeV, which is not an option. So maybe I was wrong in the initial approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not approximate gamma as 3.57143, but compute it more precisely.

Wait, let me compute gamma exactly.

v = 0.96c.

v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² = 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28.

So gamma =1/0.28=3.5714285714...

So that's exact.

Now, m is 6.047823 u.

Each u is 931.494064 MeV/c².

So m c²=6.047823 * 931.494064 MeV = let me compute this exactly.

6.047823 *931.494064.

I'll break this into 6 *931.494064 =5588.964384.

Then 0.047823 *931.494064.

0.04 *931.494064=37.25976256.

0.007823 *931.494064.

Compute 0.007 *931.494064=6.520458448.

0.000823 *931.494064≈0.766956.

So 6.520458448 +0.766956=7.287414448.

So total 0.047823 *931.494064=37.25976256 +7.287414448=44.547177008 MeV.

So m c²=5588.964384 +44.547177008 =5633.511561 MeV =5.633511561 GeV.

Gamma is exactly 3571428571428571/1e14 (no, actually, 3.571428571428571...) which is 25/7. Because 25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

Wait, 25 divided by 7 is 3.57142857...

So 25/7 = gamma.

So E = (25/7) * (5.633511561 GeV).

Compute 25 *5.633511561 = 140.837789 GeV.

Divide by 7: 140.837789 /7 =20.11968414 GeV.

So approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 20.132. The difference is about 0.0123 GeV, which is about 12 MeV. That's a small difference, perhaps due to more precise values in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps in the problem, they used the mass as 6 u, leading to 19.96 GeV, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is taken as the mass of Li-6, which is approximately 6.047823 u. So the correct energy is about 20.1197 GeV, which is approximately 20.12 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the question is about the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Because sometimes people confuse between the two.

Wait, the question states: 'the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?'

In particle physics, the energy of the collider refers to the total energy, which is the sum of rest mass and kinetic energy. So it's the gamma * m c².

But if the question had asked for kinetic energy, it would be (gamma -1) m c². So in that case, 20.1197 -5.6335 is approximately 14.486 GeV, which isn't an option. So the question must be about the total energy.

So, the correct answer is approximately 20.12 GeV, which is option C)20.132 GeV. But wait, the options are precise.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Compute 25/7 *5.633511561 = ?

25 *5.633511561=140.837789025.

140.837789025 /7=20.119684146 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, it's 20.1197 GeV.

But the options are given with four decimal places. Option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 20.1320. So the difference is 0.0123 GeV.

Perhaps I should check if I made a miscalculation in the mass.

Wait, let me recompute the mass.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Proton mass: 1.007276 u.

Neutron mass: 1.008665 u.

So 3*(1.007276 +1.008665) =3*(2.015941) =6.047823 u.

So that's correct.

So the rest mass energy is 6.047823 *931.494064 MeV.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation is needed.

Let me compute 6.047823 *931.494064.

Let me compute 6 *931.494064 =5588.964384 MeV.

0.047823 *931.494064 = ?

0.047823 *931.494064 = let's compute:

931.494064 *0.04=37.25976256.

931.494064 *0.007823 = ?

Let me compute 931.494064 *0.007 =6.520458448.

931.494064 *0.000823 = 0.766956 (approx 0.766956).

Adding:6.520458448 +0.766956=7.287414448.

So 37.25976256 +7.287414448=44.547177008 MeV.

So total m c²=5588.964384 +44.547177008=5633.511561 MeV=5.633511561 GeV.

Gamma is 25/7=3.571428571.

So E=3.571428571 *5.633511561.

Let me compute 3.571428571 *5.633511561.

3.571428571 *5=17.857142855.

3.571428571*0.633511561.

Compute 3.571428571 *0.6=2.1428571426.

3.571428571 *0.033511561.

Compute 3.571428571 *0.03=0.1071428571.

3.571428571 *0.003511561≈0.012536.

So 0.1071428571 +0.012536≈0.119678857.

So 3.571428571 *0.633511561≈2.1428571426 +0.119678857≈2.262535999 GeV.

Adding to 17.857142855:

17.857142855 +2.262535999=20.119678854 GeV.

So 20.119678854 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. So 20.11968 is approximately 20.120 GeV, which is 0.012 GeV less than option C.

Hmm, perhaps I should check if I missed a decimal place somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the relativistic energy formula with the mass as 6 u, leading to 19.96 GeV, which isn't an option. But that can't be it because the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 )=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the exact value of gamma is 3.571428571428571... so when multiplied by 5.633511561 GeV, it gives 20.11967885 GeV.

So the precise value is approximately 20.1197 GeV. Looking at the options, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV. But that's a bit of a gap.

Wait, perhaps the question expects the kinetic energy, but as I thought earlier, that would be about 14.486 GeV, which is not any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass. Let's see, another way: If the nucleus is Li-6, what is its mass in u?

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is not exactly 6.047823 u, but perhaps the exact atomic mass is different.

Wait, let me look up the exact mass of Li-6. Oh wait, I don't have that data. But I think the correct approach is to use the accurate mass of the nucleus, which I did. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the given options, but that can't be the case.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 20.132.

My calculation is 20.1197 GeV, which is 20.1197.

The difference is about 0.0123 GeV, which is about 12.3 MeV. That's significant, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 25/7 *5.633511561 more accurately.

25/7=3.571428571428571.

5.633511561 *3.571428571428571.

Let me compute 5.633511561 *3 =16.900534683.

5.633511561 *0.571428571.

Compute 5.633511561 *0.5=2.8167557805.

5.633511561 *0.071428571≈0.403999999.

Adding:2.8167557805 +0.403999999≈3.2207557795.

So total E=16.900534683 +3.2207557795≈20.12129046 GeV.

So approximately 20.1213 GeV.

So about 20.1213 GeV.

Now, looking at the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute with more precise values.

Wait, let me compute gamma * m c² with all decimals.

gamma =25/7.

m c²=6.047823 *931.494064 MeV.

Let me compute 6.047823 *931.494064.

6 *931.494064=5588.964384.

0.047823 *931.494064=44.547177008.

Total m c²=5633.511561 MeV=5.633511561 GeV.

E= (25/7) *5.633511561.

Compute 5.633511561 *25=140.837789025.

140.837789025 /7 =20.119684146 GeV.

So 20.11968 GeV.

The options are:

A)18.475 GeV,

B)23.069 GeV,

C)20.132 GeV,

D)21.419 GeV.

So 20.1197 is very close to 20.132 GeV. But the difference is about 0.0123 GeV, which is 12.3 MeV. Could that be due to using more precise values for the mass of the nucleus?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the mass of the lithium nucleus as exactly 6 u, leading to E=3.57142857 *5.589 GeV=19.96 GeV, which is not an option. But perhaps the intended approach was to use 6 u, which gives option A)18.475 GeV is way lower.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the particle in the collider is given by gamma m c².

But sometimes, the energy per nucleon is considered. Wait, but the question states the speed of the nucleus X, so it's the total energy.

Wait, perhaps the collider energy is given per nucleon, but the question doesn't state that.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was correct, but the options are off.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, let me compute 25/7 *5.633511561.

25/7 is approximately 3.571428571.

5.633511561 *3.571428571.

Let me compute 5.633511561 *3 =16.900534683.

5.633511561 *0.571428571.

Compute 5.633511561 *0.5=2.8167557805.

5.633511561 *0.071428571.

5.633511561 *0.07=0.394345809.

5.633511561 *0.001428571≈0.008038.

So 0.394345809 +0.008038≈0.4023838.

So 5.633511561 *0.071428571≈0.4023838.

So 5.633511561 *0.571428571≈2.8167557805 +0.4023838≈3.21913958.

So total E=16.900534683 +3.21913958≈20.11967426 GeV.

So 20.1197 GeV.

Hmm, which is very close to 20.12 GeV. So the correct answer should be option C)20.132 GeV.

But why is there a discrepancy?

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the kinetic energy and see.

Kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c².

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So gamma-1=2.57142857.

2.57142857 *5.633511561 = ?

2.57142857 *5=12.85714285.

2.57142857 *0.633511561=1.633511561 *2.57142857 ≈?

Wait, perhaps compute 2.57142857 *0.633511561=1.633511561 *2.57142857 * (0.633511561/1.633511561) Hmm, perhaps better to compute directly.

2.57142857 *0.633511561.

Approximate:

2 *0.633511561 =1.267023122.

0.57142857 *0.633511561 ≈0.57142857 *0.6=0.342857142; 0.57142857 *0.033511561≈0.0191294. So 0.342857142 +0.0191294≈0.3619865.

So total is about 1.267023122 +0.3619865≈1.62900962.

So 2.57142857 *0.633511561≈1.62900962.

So total KE=12.85714285 +1.62900962≈14.48615247 GeV.

Which is about 14.486 GeV. But that's not an option.

So the only option near 20 GeV is C)20.132 GeV.

Therefore, the correct answer must be option C.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the nucleus \( X \) (Li-6) is \( 0.96c \), we calculate the total relativistic energy using the formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \))
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

For \( v = 0.96c \):
\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]
\[
\sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28, \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.57142857
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of the nucleus
The nucleus \( X \) is Li-6, which has a mass of \( 6.047823 \, u \). Using the conversion \( 1 \, u = 931.494064 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), the rest mass energy is:

\[
m c^2 = 6.047823 \times 931.494064 \, \text{MeV} \approx 5633.511561 \, \text{MeV} = 5.633511561 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
The total energy is:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.57142857 \times 5.633511561 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:
\[
3.57142857 \times 5 = 17.85714285, \quad 3.57142857 \times 0.633511561 \approx 2.262535999
\]
\[
E = 17.85714285 + 2.262535999 \approx 20.11967885 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.1197 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:
- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too high.

The closest match is **C) 20.132 GeV**, with a small discrepancy likely due to rounding or slight differences in constants used.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
