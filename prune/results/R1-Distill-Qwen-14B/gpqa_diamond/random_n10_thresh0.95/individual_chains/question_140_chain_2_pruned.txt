Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem step by step. Hmm, the question is a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down.

So, the problem says that Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh wait, that means for each molecule, the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. So if the molecule is, say, H2O, then protons would be 2*1 (from H) + 8 (O) = 10, and neutrons would be 8 (for O) + 2*(0 for H) = 8. But 10 isn't equal to 8, so that's not it. Maybe another molecule. Wait, the problem says the gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for a molecule, total protons = total neutrons.

Wait, what about CO2? Carbon has 6 protons, oxygen has 8 each. So CO2 would have 6 + 2*8 = 22 protons. Neutrons would be 6 (if carbon is C-12) + 2*(8) = 22. Oh! So CO2 would have 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That fits. But wait, is CO2 a gas released in such reactions? Hmm, or maybe another gas.

Wait, another possibility: H2O. Wait, H2O has 2 H and 1 O. Protons: 2*1 + 8 = 10. Neutrons: (0 for H) + (8 for O) =8. 10≠8. Doesn't fit. What about CH4? Protons: 6 +4*1=10. Neutrons: 6 (C) +4*(0)=6. Not equal. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a molecule with a single atom, so protons equal neutrons. Like, for example, He (helium), but that's a noble gas and might not fit. Alternatively, maybe a diatomic molecule where each atom has the same number of protons and neutrons. Wait, maybe CO? Let's see: C has 6 protons, O has 8. So CO has 14 protons. Neutrons: C has 6 neutrons (if C-12), O has 8, so total 14. So 14=14. That fits. So CO is a possibility.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the reaction. Substance X reacts with Y violently to produce gas W. Maybe Y is water, but no, maybe another liquid. Alternatively, maybe Y is an acid.

Wait, the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. Hmm, what compounds have a melting point around there. Maybe something like ammonium chloride? No, that's lower. Or maybe something else. Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid that's just above room temperature. Wait, water freezes at 273 K, so 277 is just a bit higher. So maybe B is a compound that's solid near that temperature. Or perhaps B is something like sodium chloride? No, that's way higher.

Wait, perhaps B is a metal. Iron's melting point is way higher. Maybe something else. Alternatively, perhaps B is a basic oxide. Wait, maybe when G is heated, it decomposes into B and something else. Let's think about the reaction.

Wait, the initial reaction: X reacts with Y (liquid) to produce gas W and precipitate G. Then, heating G gives B. So perhaps X is a metal, Y is an acid, producing a salt (G) and gas W. For example, metals reacting with acids produce hydrogen gas and a salt. But the gas W in this case would be H2, which has 2 H atoms. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so total protons would be 2, neutrons 0. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, but earlier I thought the gas could be CO or CO2. Let me see. If the reaction between X and Y produces CO gas, that would imply some kind of reaction where carbon monoxide is formed. So perhaps Y is a carbonate, and X is something that reacts to release CO2? Or maybe X is a metal reacting with a carbonate.

Wait, but the problem says the gas is W, and it's produced in the reaction. So, let me think about another approach. The gas W's molecule must have equal protons and neutrons. So for each molecule, protons = neutrons.

So, possible molecules:

- CO (molecular weight 28): for each molecule, 6 (C) + 8 (O) =14 protons; 6 (C) + 8 (O) =14 neutrons. So 14=14. That fits.

- N2: 14 protons (each N has 7), so 14. Neutrons: 14 (each N has 7 neutrons in N-14). So 14=14. So N2 is another possibility.

Wait, but is N2 a gas produced in such a reaction? Maybe, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the gas is CO2, like I thought earlier, but that wouldn't fit because protons and neutrons wouldn't match.

Wait, another possibility is O2. Each O has 8 protons. O2 has 16 protons. Neutrons: if O is O-16, each has 8 neutrons, so O2 has 16. So 16=16. That fits. So O2 is another possibility. But O2 is a diatomic oxygen gas, which is a product in some reactions, like decomposition of peroxides.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is CH4. But wait, CH4: 6+4=10 protons, and 6 (C) + 4*(0)=6 neutrons. Doesn't match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the gas is C. No, carbon as a gas isn't likely in such a reaction, and it's not a molecule. So perhaps CO is the gas.

So, if the gas is CO, then the reaction would be something like X reacting with Y to produce CO. What reactions produce CO? Maybe the reduction of a metal oxide with a carbon-containing substance.

Wait, but in this case, X is the reacting substance. So perhaps X is a metal (like iron), and Y is a carbonate. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me think about the precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. So G is perhaps a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into B and CO2. But earlier, I thought the gas might be CO. Hmm, maybe that's not right.

Wait, another angle: the product of X reacting with a keto acid gives a compound with two oxygen atoms. A keto acid is an acid with a ketone group. For example, acetoacetic acid. When such an acid reacts with a strong base, perhaps it forms a salt. If the product has two oxygen atoms, maybe it's something like a carbonate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Maybe the reaction is a neutralization, producing a salt. For example, if X is a base (like NaOH) reacting with a keto acid (like acetoacetic acid), the product would be a sodium salt, such as sodium acetoacetate. Sodium salts have the formula NaA, where A is the anion. Sodium acetoacetate is (CH3COCH2COO^- Na^+). Wait, the formula is C4H5O4Na. That has four oxygen atoms, but the problem says the product has two oxygen atoms. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track here.

Wait, maybe the keto acid is something else. Let's think of another keto acid. Like, for example, pyruvic acid has a keto group and a carboxylic acid group. Its formula is C3H4O3. If X reacts with pyruvic acid, perhaps it's a neutralization reaction, producing a salt. But again, maybe I'm getting off track.

Wait, stepping back. Let's think about the main question: What is Substance X? The question also says that X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X has an element with a heavier isotope. That suggests that one element in X has a higher atomic mass, perhaps with a higher atomic number, like chlorine (has isotopes Cl-35 and Cl-37), or maybe something else.

Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Hmm, common reagents in organic chemistry include things like NaOH, KOH, H2SO4, etc. But more specifically, X's analog is a reagent. Maybe X is something like NaOH, but if it's a heavier isotope, perhaps it's a different isotope of sodium or oxygen.

Wait, let's think about the melting point of B. It's around 277 K, which is about 4°C. That's just above the freezing point of water. What substances have a melting point near there? Perhaps ammonium chloride? Wait, no, I think ammonium chloride's melting point is lower. Or maybe something like sodium bicarbonate? Or perhaps something else.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a base. For example, if B is sodium hydroxide, but NaOH has a higher melting point. Or maybe B is something like ammonium hydroxide, but that's not a solid. Hmm, this is getting tricky.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G is formed when X reacts with Y. If Y is an acid, perhaps G is a salt. When heated, the salt decomposes. For instance, if G is a carbonate, heating it would produce CO2 and the metal oxide. But in that case, the gas would be CO2, which has 22 protons (12 from C, 16 from O) and 12 (C) + 16 (O) = 28 neutrons. 22 ≠28, so that doesn't fit the gas W condition.

Wait, but earlier I thought gas W could be CO. So perhaps G is a bicarbonate. Wait, but when a bicarbonate is heated, it decomposes into CO2 and the metal oxide. So again, the gas would be CO2, which doesn't fit W's condition.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the initial reaction again.

Substance X reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W and precipitate G. G, when heated, produces B. So the reaction sequence is: X + Y → W↑ + G. Then, G → B + something when heated.

Another possibility: X is a carbonate, Y is an acid. Then, reaction would produce CO2 gas and salt Y. But as before, CO2 doesn't fit the W condition.

Wait, maybe Y is a metal oxide. If X is a strong base, and Y is an acid, perhaps the reaction produces a salt and water. But then the gas wouldn't be produced. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the gas W has equal protons and neutrons per molecule. Let's list possible molecules.

Possible options where protons = neutrons:

- CO: 14 each.
- N2: 14 each.
- O2: 16 each.
- He: 4 each (but He is a noble gas, maybe not as a reaction product).
- CH3NH2 (methylamine) but that's probably not a gas in such reactions.
- Maybe H2O: protons 10, neutrons 8. Doesn't fit.
- Maybe NO: 14 each. Oh, wait, NO has 14 protons (7 from N, 8 from O) and 14 neutrons: N has 7 (assuming N-14), O has 8, so 7+8=15? Wait, NO's molecular formula is NO. So protons: 7 (N) +8 (O) =15. Neutrons: 7 (N) +8 (O) =15. So protons=neutrons=15. So that fits. So gas W could be NO.

Wait, that's a possibility. So, gas W is NO. Now, what reaction produces NO gas? It's typically formed during the reduction of nitrate ions or in certain redox reactions. For example, the reaction of metals with nitric acid can produce NO, depending on the conditions.

So, if X is a metal that reacts with liquid Y (maybe nitric acid) to produce NO gas. Then, the precipitate G would be the corresponding nitrate salt.

Wait, but then when G is heated, maybe it decomposes. If G is a nitrate salt, heating it might decompose into something else. For example, heating a nitrate can produce a metal oxide, nitrogen dioxide, and oxygen. But in this case, the heating of G produces B. So, perhaps, if G is a nitrate, heating could produce a metal oxide and other gases, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide, and heating it gives a metal oxide and water. But I'm not certain.

Wait, the product of X with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So, maybe X is a base, and the reaction with a keto acid produces a salt with two oxygen atoms. For example, if X is NaOH, and the keto acid is something like acetic acid (CH3COOH), the product would be sodium acetate (CH3COO-Na+). Sodium acetate has formula NaC2H3O2. That has two oxygen atoms from the acetate ion. So yes, two oxygen atoms. That fits. So, this suggests that X could be a base like NaOH.

But wait, the question says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So if X is NaOH, perhaps the sodium has a heavier isotope, like Na-23 (most common), but 23 is about 100% for Na. Wait, no, Na has isotopes. Wait, sodium is Na-23 (100% natural abundance?), but wait, I thought sodium has a small amount of Na-24 and others, but maybe that's negligible. Hmm, but the question says X incorporates a heavier isotope, so perhaps instead, X is something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is LiCl. Because LiCl is used as a reagent in some organic reactions, like the synthesis of alkanes via the Birch reduction. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but the product of X with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Let's think: if X is a metal, and the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (a keto acid), the product would be a salt. The structure would be M(C4H4O3). Wait, but I'm not sure about the formula.

Alternatively, if X is a base like NaOH, and the keto acid is something like pyruvic acid (C3H4O3), then the product would be the sodium salt, NaC3H3O3. That has three oxygen atoms, but the problem says two. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Wait, maybe X is a different base, like KOH. Let's see: if X is KOH and the keto acid is, say, propanoic acid (which is not a keto acid, though), but wait, the product would be the potassium salt. But the product needs two oxygen atoms, so perhaps it's a carbonate?

Wait, perhaps the product is a carbonate. Wait, but a carbonate has three oxygen atoms. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a bicarbonate. No, bicarbonate also has three oxygen atoms. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the product has two oxygen atoms, which might suggest something like a peroxide, but those are O-O bonds. Or maybe the product is a hydroxide, with one O from OH and another elsewhere. Wait, perhaps it's something like Mg(OH)2, which has two OH groups, so two O atoms. But in that case, X would be a base reacting with a keto acid. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is something like Na2CO3, but that has three O atoms. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a metal oxide. For example, if X is sodium metal and the keto acid is something that upon reaction forms Na2O. But Na2O has one O atom. Hmm. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonyl compound. Wait, no, the question says it's a product of the reaction between X and the keto acid. So perhaps X is a base, and the product is a salt of the keto acid, which has two oxygen atoms in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the keto acid is formic acid (HCOOH), which is a carboxylic acid but not a keto acid. Wait, no, formic acid is a keto acid because it has a carbonyl group. So, formic acid (HCOOH) reacts with a base like NaOH to form sodium formate (HCOO^- Na^+). The formula is HCOONa, which has two oxygen atoms in the formate ion (HCOO^-). So yes, two oxygen atoms. That fits.

So, if X is NaOH, then the product with formic acid would be sodium formate, which has two O atoms. That makes sense.

So, if X is NaOH, what about the initial reaction?

NaOH reacts with Y (a liquid) to produce gas W and precipitate G. Wait, but NaOH is a strong base. What liquid would react with it violently? Maybe an acid. But that would produce a salt and water, no gas.

Wait, unless Y is a carbonate. For example, if Y is carbonated water, but that's not a liquid in the sense of a pure substance. Alternatively, Y could be a metal carbonate. Wait, but then the reaction would produce CO2 gas. But earlier, we thought the gas might be NO or CO.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an ammonium salt. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps Y is a nitride. For example, reacting NaOH with a nitride might produce ammonia gas. Let me think: Mg3N2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 + NH3↑. But ammonia has 14 protons (1 from N, 3 H each?), wait, no. NH3 has 14 protons? Wait, NH3 is NH3: N has 7, each H has 1. So 7 +3(1) =10 protons. Neutrons: N has 7 neutrons (assuming N-14), H has 0. So 7=10? No, that's not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, another approach. Let's think about the fact that X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. NaOH is a common reagent, but perhaps X is something else. Like, maybe it's a heavier isotope of sodium, but sodium's isotopes are Na-23 (100% natural abundance), Na-24, etc. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is KCl. KCl is used in some reactions, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about the initial reaction producing a precipitate. What if X is a metal, and Y is an aqueous solution of a salt, leading to a precipitation reaction. For example, if X is AgNO3 and Y is NaCl, but that would produce AgCl precipitate. But in that case, the gas would be HCl, which doesn't fit the W condition.

Wait, but perhaps the gas is something else. Let me think again.

Wait, let's go back to the gas W. If W is CO, then the reaction must be producing CO. Let me think: perhaps X is a metal reacting with a carbonate. For example, Fe + Na2CO3 → FeCO3 + Na. But I'm not sure if that reaction produces gas. Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal that reacts with a carbonate to produce CO gas. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a reducing agent, like carbon, reacting with a metal oxide to produce CO. For example, carbon monoxide is produced in the reduction of metal oxides. So if X is carbon, and Y is a metal oxide, the reaction would produce CO, metal, and perhaps water. So, the precipitate G would be the metal, which when heated, doesn't change. Hmm, but then B would be the metal, which has a high melting point, which doesn't fit the 277 K melting point.

Wait, but the precipitate G is formed. If the reaction produces the metal, it would precipitate. But then heating the metal wouldn't release B; perhaps it's the other way around. Maybe I'm getting tangled here.

Wait, another possibility: if X is a carbonate, and Y is a strong acid, the reaction would produce CO2 gas. But CO2 doesn't fit the protons equal neutrons condition. So that's no good.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think about the options given for the cumulative atomic masses. The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

So, the question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. If X has multiple elements, sum all their lightest and heaviest isotopes.

Wait, but what if X is a compound containing two elements, each with isotopes. For example, NaOH has Na, O, H. Let's see:

Na has isotopes: Na-23 (100% natural), and heavier ones like Na-24, etc. But the lightest is Na-23 (mass 23).

O has isotopes: O-16 (most abundant), O-17, O-18. The lightest is 16, the heaviest is 18.

H has isotopes: H-1 (protium, 1), H-2 (deuterium, 2), H-3. Lightest is 1, heaviest is 3.

So, for NaOH, the lightest elements would be Na-23 (23), O-16 (16), H-1 (1). The heaviest would be Na-24 (24?), O-18 (18), H-3 (3). Wait, but it depends on what isotopes are present in X.

But wait, the problem states that X incorporates a heavier isotope, so perhaps X has an element with a heavier isotope. So, perhaps X is something like Cl-35 and Cl-37.

Wait, another approach: think about the cumulative atomic masses. The options are all in the teens and 20s.

If X is NaOH, the elements are Na, O, H. Their lightest isotopes sum: 23 (Na) + 16 (O) + 1 (H) = 40. Heaviest isotopes: 24 (Na) + 18 (O) + 3 (H) = 45. But the options don't have 40 or 45. So maybe X isn't NaOH.

Wait, what if X is KCl? K has isotopes, like K-39, K-41. Cl has Cl-35, Cl-37. So the lightest isotopes would be K-39 (39) and Cl-35 (35). Sum is 39+35=74. The heaviest isotopes would be K-41 (41) and Cl-37 (37), sum=78. Doesn't fit the options.

Wait, perhaps X is NH3. Wait, but that's not a reagent I'm familiar with as a primary reagent. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: X is a halogen. For example, Cl2. But Cl2 is diatomic, and the reaction conditions don't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is Hg, but that's a heavy metal and I'm not sure about the reactions.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule. Let me think about the possibilities.

Wait, the product of X with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So if X is a base, the product's formula would have two O's. Wait, maybe X is LiOH, which is a strong base. Let's see: reacting LiOH with a keto acid like acetic acid would produce Li acetate, which has two O's in the acetate ion. So that fits.

So, if X is LiOH, the elements are Li, O, H. Their isotopes: Li has Li-7 (7) and Li-6 (6), but the heavier isotope is Li-7. O has O-16 (16) and heavier as 17, 18. H has H-1 (1), H-2 (2), H-3 (3).

So, the lightest isotopes: Li-6 (6), O-16 (16), H-1 (1). Sum: 6+16+1=23.

The heaviest isotopes: Li-7 (7), O-18 (18), H-3 (3). Sum: 7+18+3=28.

So cumulative atomic masses would be 23 and 28. Their sum is 23+28=51, which isn't an option here. Hmm.

Wait, but the question says to sum all the heavier and lighter isotopes. Wait, no, the question says the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within X. So perhaps for each element in X, take the lightest and heaviest isotopes and sum their masses across all elements in X.

Wait, but that might be more complicated. Let's suppose X is LiOH. So elements Li, O, H. Lightest isotopes: Li-6 (6), O-16 (16), H-1 (1). Sum: 6+16+1=23. Heaviest isotopes: Li-7 (7), O-18 (18), H-3 (3). Sum:7+18+3=28. So the total is 23 +28=51. Not matching any options.

Hmm. Maybe X is something else. Let's think about the options again.

The options are 25, 29, 31,35. These are all in the range of small atomic mass sums.

Wait, another approach: perhaps X is a diatomic molecule with two atoms, each contributing to the sum. For example, if X is Cl2, then the elements are Cl and Cl. Heavier isotope would be Cl-37. So the lightest isotopes would be Cl-35 and Cl-35 (sum 70), but that's not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a single element with isotopes. Like Cl, which has Cl-35 and Cl-37. So the lightest is 35, the heaviest is 37. Sum is 35 +37=72. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound with two elements. For example, NaCl.

Na has lightest isotope Na-23, heaviest Na-25 (but natural abundance is low). Cl has lightest Cl-35, heaviest Cl-37.

So lightest isotopes: 23 (Na) +35 (Cl) =58. Heaviest: 25 (Na) +37 (Cl)=62. Sum is 58+62=120. Not matching.

Hmm, maybe X is something else. Let's think about the options again.

The options are 25, 29,31,35. So the total sum is around 30.

So, what combination of lightest and heaviest isotopes from elements would sum to 25 or 29, etc.

Wait, let's think of elements with light and heavy isotopes.

For example, consider O and H. O has O-16 (16) and O-18 (18). H has H-1 (1) and H-3 (3).

If X contains O and H, perhaps in a molecule like H2O. Then, lightest isotopes: O-16 (16) and H-1 (2 atoms, 1 each) → sum=18. Heaviest: O-18 (18) and H-3 (2 atoms, 3 each) → sum= 18 +6=24. So total sum is 18+24=42. Doesn't fit.

Wait, if X is a diatomic molecule like H2, which doesn't fit the other conditions. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a single element with two isotopes. For example, chlorine (Cl-35 and Cl-37). The lightest is 35, heaviest 37. Sum is 72. No.

Wait, perhaps X is carbon, which has C-12 and C-14. But C-14 is rare. So sum would be 12 +14=26. Hmm, but 26 isn't an option. Wait, the options are 25,29,31,35. So 26 isn't there. But 25 is. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, but the question says to sum the lightest and heaviest elements present in X. So if X is a compound with multiple elements, each contributing their lightest and heaviest isotopes.

Wait, perhaps X is HCl. Then, H (lightest 1, heaviest 3) and Cl (35, 37). So lightest:1+35=36. Heaviest:3+37=40. Sum is 36+40=76. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps X is NH3. N has N-14 (14) and N-15 (15), H has H-1 (1) and H-2 (2). So lightest:14 +3*(1)=17. Heaviest:15 +3*(2)=21. Sum:17+21=38. Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe X is something like CH4. C has 12 and 13? Or 12 and 14. H has 1 and 2. So lightest:12 +4*1=16. Heaviest:14 +4*2=22. Sum:16+22=38. Still not matching.

Wait, another angle: perhaps X is a noble gas. For example, Argon. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look at the options again.

The options are 25,29,31,35. These are all small numbers, so perhaps the elements in X are light.

Another thought: perhaps X is a diatomic molecule like O2. Then, each O is O-16 and O-18. So lightest:16*2=32. Heaviest:18*2=36. Sum is 32+36=68. No match.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is a molecule like CO, which we thought earlier.

CO: C-12 and C-14, O-16 and O-18.

Lightest:12 +16=28. Heaviest:14 +18=32. Sum:28+32=60. Not matching.

Wait, maybe the problem is simpler. The question asks for the sum of the lightest and heaviest atomic masses present in X. So for each element in X, take the lightest and heaviest isotope, then sum all those across all elements in X.

So, let's think of X as containing elements A and B. For A, lightest is a, heaviest is b. For B, lightest c, heaviest d. The sum would be (a + c) + (b + d). Or maybe it's (a + b) + (c + d). Not sure.

Wait, the question says "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X".

Ah, perhaps it's the sum of the lightest and heaviest element's atomic masses. For example, if X has elements with atomic numbers Z1, Z2, etc., the lightest element would have the smallest Z, heaviest the largest Z. Then, sum their atomic masses.

But that might not directly involve isotopes. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem says "considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

So, for each element in X, sum the lightest and heaviest isotopic masses, and then add all those sums for all elements in X.

Wait, perhaps X is a molecule with two different elements. Let's say X is CO. So for C: lightest is 12, heaviest (say 14), sum 26. For O: lightest 16, heaviest 18, sum 34. Total sum 26+34=60. Not matching.

Wait, if X is H2O. H: lightest 1, heaviest 3, sum 4. O:16 and 18, sum 34. So total 4+34=38. Still no.

Hmm, perhaps X is a compound with three elements. For example, NH4NO3. But that's a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a simple diatomic molecule with two isotopes. Like H2. Then, H's lightest is 1, heaviest 3. Sum is 4. But the options don't have 4.

Wait, another approach: I'm probably overcomplicating this. Let's think about the possible answers and see which makes sense.

Option C is 31. Maybe the elements are O and Cl. O's lightest is 16, heaviest 18, sum 34. Cl:35 and 37, sum 72. 16+35=51, 18+37=55. So 51+55=106. Not 31.

Wait, perhaps X is a molecule with two elements, each contributing a light and heavy isotope. For example, O and F.

O:16 (light) + 18 (heavy) → 34.

F:19 (light) +21 (heavy, but natural abundance is low) → 40.

Sum:34+40=74. No.

Wait, perhaps X is a molecule with elements that have light isotopes only.

Wait, let's think of elements with only one isotope. Such as fluorine (has two, but F-19 is the main), but maybe some elements have only one isotope. For example, lithium has Li-7 and Li-6. No, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains hydrogen and oxygen. Wait, H2O again.

Hmm, this is getting me nowhere. Maybe I should think about what element would have a cumulative sum matching the options.

Option D is 29. That's close to 16 (O) +13 (Al?), but not sure.

Wait, another angle: The product of X with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So, maybe the product is something like Na2O2, but that's a peroxide with two O's, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, the product could be a carbonate, but that's three O's.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. No, because the product is a reaction between X and the keto acid, which would likely form a salt.

Wait, another thought: Maybe X is a base like Mg(OH)2. Then, when it reacts with a keto acid, it forms a magnesium salt. The formula would be Mg salt, which might have two oxygen atoms. Not sure.

Alternatively, X could be a metal like Li, which when reacted with a keto acid forms a lithium salt with two oxygen atoms. For example, Li2O. But Li2O has one O atom, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should try to think about each part of the problem step by step again.

1. X reacts with Y violently to produce gas W and precipitate G.

2. W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. So, W is CO, N2, O2, NO, etc.

3. G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K.

4. The product of X and a keto acid has two O atoms.

5. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.

6. X has a heavier isotope incorporated.

From earlier, I think X could be NaOH. Let's revisit that.

If X is NaOH, Y could be an acid. But that would produce a salt and water, no gas. Unless Y is a carbonate, which would produce CO2. But CO2 doesn't fit W's condition.

Wait, but if Y is a carbonate, then the reaction would be NaOH + Na2CO3 → 2NaOH + NaCO3 (but not sure). Alternatively, perhaps Y is a nitride, leading to NH3 gas, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a sulfide. NaOH + H2S → Na2S + H2O. No gas produced.

Hmm. Maybe Y is a peroxide. For example, NaOH reacting with H2O2. But I don't think that produces a gas.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an ammonium salt. For example, NaOH + NH4NO3 → NaNO3 + NH3 + H2O. So, gas would be NH3. But as before, NH3 has 10 protons and 7 neutrons (if N is N-14), so 10≠7.

Wait, earlier I thought CO is a possibility. So, perhaps X is a metal that reacts with a carbonate to produce CO. For example, Mg + Na2CO3 → MgCO3 + Na + CO↑. But I'm not sure about that reaction.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to focus on the product with the keto acid. It has two O atoms. So perhaps X is a base, and the product is a salt with two O atoms. Like, if X is NaOH and the keto acid is HCOOH (formic acid), the product is NaHCOO, which has two O atoms in the bicarbonate ion. Wait, but HCOO^- has two O atoms? No, HCOO- has two O's? Let me think: HCOO^- is the bicarbonate ion? No, wait, bicarbonate is HCO3^-.

Wait, no, formate is HCOO^- (from formic acid, HCOOH). So sodium formate is NaHCOO. That has two O's in the formate ion. So yes, two O's.

So, X is NaOH. Then, the initial reaction: NaOH reacts with Y (a liquid) to produce CO gas and precipitate G.

Wait, but NaOH is a strong base; reacting it with a liquid to produce CO gas would require a carbonate. For example, NaOH + H2CO3 → Na2CO3 + H2O. But that produces CO3^2- and water, no gas.

Wait, perhaps Y is a weak acid, like acetic acid. NaOH + CH3COOH → CH3COO^-Na^+ + H2O. No gas produced.

Hmm, perhaps Y is a metal carbonate. For example, NaOH + MgCO3 → Na2CO3 + Mg(OH)2↓. But Mg(OH)2 is a precipitate. The gas produced would be none, as it's a neutralization reaction.

Wait, but earlier we thought the gas might be CO, which suggests a reaction that produces CO. So perhaps Y is a carbonate and X is a metal like Fe. Fe + Na2CO3 → FeCO3 + Na + CO↑. But I'm not certain about that reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal that reacts with a carbonate to produce CO gas. For example, Zn + Na2CO3 → ZnCO3 + Na + CO↑. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

In any case, perhaps I should proceed to the final part: calculating the cumulative atomic masses.

Assuming X is NaOH, the elements are Na, O, H.

Lightest isotopes: Na-23 (23), O-16 (16), H-1 (1). Sum: 23+16+1=40.

Heaviest isotopes: Na-24 (24), O-18 (18), H-3 (3). Sum:24+18+3=45.

Cumulative sum:40+45=85. Not an option.

Hmm. Maybe X is another compound.

Wait, another approach: if the sum is 31 (option C), perhaps the elements are O and Cl. O has 16 and 18, sum 34. Cl has 35 and 37, sum 72. 34+72=106. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains only two elements, each contributing light and heavy isotopes.

For example, if X is Cl2, then lightest:35*2=70, heaviest 37*2=74. Sum 70+74=144. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps X is a molecule with one O and one H. Like H2O. Lightest:1 +16=17, heaviest:2 +18=20. Sum 17+20=37. Not matching.

Wait, another possibility: X is a molecule with elements having light isotopes only. For example, H and C.

H:1, C:12. Sum light:13, heavy:2 and 14 → sum 16. Total 13+16=29. That's option D)29.

Wait, that might fit. Let me think: if X is CH4. Then, C has isotopes 12 and 14, H has 1 and 2.

Lightest isotopes: C-12 (12) + 4*(H-1) (4) → sum 16.

Heaviest isotopes: C-14 (14) +4*(H-2) (8) → sum 22.

Total sum:16 +22=38. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps X is CO.

Lightest: C-12 (12) + O-16 (16) → sum 28.

Heaviest: C-14 (14) + O-18 (18) → sum 32.

Total:28+32=60. Not matching.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again. Option C is 31. How can I get 31?

Wait, 16 (O) + 15 (P) =31. But that would require X to have both O and P. Alternatively, 12 (C) +19 (F)=31. Or 14 (N) +17 (Cl)=31, but that's 31.

Wait, 14+17=31. So if X has N and Cl, then the sum of the lightest isotopes (N-14, Cl-35) is 14+35=49. The heaviest (N-15, Cl-37)=15+37=52. Sum 49+52=101. Not matching.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X has two elements, each with only one isotope. For example, H and O. H only has H-1, O has O-16 and O-18.

Lightest:1 +16=17.

Heaviest:1 +18=19.

Sum:17+19=36. Not matching.

Alternatively, X is a diatomic molecule like O2. Lightest:32, heaviest:36. Sum 68.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps X is a single element with two isotopes. For example, Cl: sum 35+37=72. Not matching.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent, maybe I should make an educated guess.

Given that the product with the keto
