--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. Alright, the question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X =8 GeV, mass m_X =1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X =320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! The product of the energy uncertainty (which is the width Γ) and the time uncertainty (which is the lifetime τ) is on the order of ħ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I should get the units right. And then, once I have the lifetime, the decay distance would be the velocity times the lifetime, right?

So, decay distance L ≈ v * τ. But wait, L is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So first, I need to find the velocity of the meson X. To find velocity, I should use its energy and mass. Since the meson is a resonance, probably it's moving relativistically. So maybe I can use the relativistic energy formula: E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

Wait, E is given as 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. Let's compute the momentum p. E² = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. Let me rearrange that: (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2. So,

p = sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4) ) / c²? Wait, no, let's get the units straight. E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c² perhaps? Wait, when dealing with units, I think in natural units where c=1, so E and m have the same dimensions (GeV). But when calculating p, which has units GeV/c, maybe.

Wait, let me write it correctly. E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) → (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2 → p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c.

Wait, but in terms of units, perhaps it's easier to use E and m in the same unit, but we have to handle the factors of c correctly. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the velocity beta first.

Beta is v/c, so beta = p c / E. Because p = gamma m v, and E = gamma m c^2. So p c = gamma m v c^2 → E = gamma m c^2. So p c = (gamma m v c^2) → p c = (E) (v / c). So beta = v/c = (p c)/ E.

So yeah, beta = (p c) / E.

But wait, p can be found from E and m using E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So rearranging, (pc)^2 = E² - (m c^2)^2 → pc = sqrt(E² - (m c^2)^2) → p = sqrt( (E)^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c.

Wait, maybe I should plug in the numbers to get p. Let me compute E in GeV, m in GeV/c²? Wait, m_X is given as 1.2 GeV. Hmm, but usually, mass is in GeV/c², so perhaps m = 1.2 GeV/c². So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c².

So let's compute (pc)^2 = E² - (m c^2)^2. E is in GeV, m c^2 is (1.2 GeV/c²) * c^2 = 1.2 GeV. So E² = (8)^2 =64 (GeV)^2, (m c^2)^2 = (1.2)^2 = 1.44 (GeV)^2. So (pc)^2 =64 - 1.44 =62.56 (GeV)^2. So pc = sqrt(62.56) GeV. Sqrt(62.56) is about 7.91 GeV.

So p c =7.91 GeV → p =7.91 GeV / c.

Wait, but that would make beta = (p c)/ E = (7.91 GeV) / 8 GeV = 0.98875. So beta is approximately 0.98875, so v is about 0.98875 c.

So v ≈ 0.98875 * c.

Now, compute the lifetime tau. The width Γ is given as 320 MeV. The relation is Γ = ħ / tau → tau = ħ / Γ. But wait, units here are crucial. Let me think in terms of units.

Gamma (Γ) is the energy width, which is 320 MeV. So Γ = ħ / tau → tau = ħ / Γ.

But ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s.

So tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (320 MeV) → Wait, units: I need to make sure they're consistent. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So,

tau = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32 ) s ≈ 2.056e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, compute the decay distance: L = v * tau.

v is approximately 0.98875 c. c is 3e8 m/s.

So,

v = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.96625e8 m/s.

So,

L = (2.96625e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) ≈ ?

Multiplying 2.96625e8 by 2.056875e-24:

First, 2.96625 * 2.056875 ≈ let's compute that: 2 * 2.056875 is about 4.11375; 0.96625 *2.056875 → approx 2. So total around 6.11375e-16? Wait wait, no:

Wait, 2.96625e8 is 2.96625 * 1e8.

2.056875e-24 is 2.056875 * 1e-24.

Multiplying gives 2.96625 * 2.056875 * 1e-16.

Let me compute 2.96625 * 2.056875.

Hmm, 3 * 2 is 6, but let's do it accurately:

2.96625 * 2.056875: let's compute 2 * 2.96625 =5.9325, 0.056875 *2.96625= approx 0.168 (since 0.05 *2.96625=0.1483125, 0.006875 *2.96625=0.020359375; total 0.16867). So total is about 5.9325 +0.16867=6.10117.

So, 6.10117e-16 meters. So approximately 6.1e-16 m.

Wait, the options are about 4e-15, 5e-15, 4e-16, 5e-16. Hmm, I'm getting around 6e-16, which isn't exactly matching any option. Wait, maybe I did a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let's recheck the calculations step by step.

First, E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV, so (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2 = 64 - (1.44) =62.56 → pc=7.91 GeV → p=7.91 GeV/c.

Beta = (p c)/E =7.91 /8 =0.98875. Correct.

Gamma (Γ) is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So tau = ħ / Γ =6.582e-25 GeV·s /0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.

v =beta c =0.98875 *3e8 m/s= 2.96625e8 m/s.

L =v tau= 2.96625e8 *2.056875e-24.

Wait, 2.96625e8 is 2.96625 *1e8, and 2.056875e-24 is 2.056875 *1e-24.

Multiplying 2.96625 *2.056875: let's compute it more accurately.

2.96625 *2.056875.

Let me break it down:

2 * 2.056875 =4.11375.

0.96625 *2.056875:

Calculate 0.96625 * 2 =1.9325.

0.96625 *0.056875 = ?

Wait, 0.96625 *0.05 =0.0483125.

0.96625 *0.006875 = approx 0.006633.

So total is 0.0483125 +0.006633 ≈0.054945.

So 0.96625 *2.056875 ≈1.9325 +0.054945 =1.987445.

So total 2 *2.056875 is 4.11375, plus 0.96625 *2.056875≈1.987445. So total is 4.11375 +1.987445=6.101195.

So 6.101195e-16 meters.

Wait, but the options are A)5.0223e-16, B)4.0655e-15, C)5.0223e-15, D)4.0655e-16.

Hmm, none of these match 6.1e-16. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of beta. Let me double-check the calculation of beta.

Wait, beta = (p c)/E.

p c =7.91 GeV, E=8 GeV. So 7.91/8=0.98875. That's correct.

But wait, perhaps I should use relativistic gamma instead. Because lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. But wait, the proper lifetime is tau_0 = ħ / (m_X Γ), or is it based on the width?

Wait, the width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime as Γ = ħ / tau. So tau is the mean lifetime in the particle's rest frame, right? So if the particle is moving, we have to use time dilation.

Wait, that's a mistake. Because the lifetime observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. So tau_lab = gamma * tau_rest.

Ah, right! So I forgot to account for the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2).

So beta is 0.98875, so beta^2 is approximately (0.98875)^2. Let's compute that: 0.98^2 is 0.9604. 0.00875^2 is negligible. 2 * 0.98 *0.00875 is about 0.01715. So approx 0.9604 +0.01715 ≈0.9775. So 1 - beta^2 ≈ 0.0225. So sqrt(1 - beta^2 )=sqrt(0.0225)=0.15. So gamma is 1/0.15≈6.6667.

Wait, let's compute it more accurately.

Beta is 0.98875. So beta squared is (0.98875)^2 = let's calculate:

0.98875 *0.98875.

= (1 - 0.01125)^2

=1 - 2*0.01125 + (0.01125)^2

≈1 - 0.0225 + 0.00012656

≈0.97762656.

So 1 - beta^2 =1 -0.97762656=0.02237344.

sqrt(0.02237344)= let's compute.

0.1496^2=0.02238, which is about 0.02238, very close.

So sqrt(0.02237344)≈0.14958.

So gamma = 1/0.14958≈6.684.

So tau_lab = gamma * tau_rest. tau_rest is ħ / Γ.

Wait, earlier I calculated tau as 2.056875e-24 s, which was tau_rest? Because tau_rest is the proper lifetime, the time in the particle's rest frame.

So in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau_rest.

So tau_lab = gamma * (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) )

= gamma * (2.056875e-24 s )

Wait, earlier I had tau_rest = 2.056875e-24 s. So tau_lab = 6.684 * 2.056875e-24 ≈?

6.684 *2.056875e-24.

Let me compute 6 *2.056875e-24 =1.234125e-23.

0.684 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ approx 0.684 *2e-24=1.368e-24.

So total approx 1.234e-23 +1.368e-24=1.3708e-23 s.

Wait, more accurately: 6.684 *2.056875e-24.

Let me compute 6 *2.056875=12.34125.

0.684 *2.056875= approx 1.402.

So 6.684 *2.056875e-24= (12.34125 +1.402) *1e-24 =13.74325e-24 s =1.374325e-23 s.

So tau_lab≈1.3743e-23 s.

Now, decay distance L = v * tau_lab.

v is 0.98875 c =0.98875 *3e8 m/s ≈ 2.96625e8 m/s.

So L =2.96625e8 m/s * 1.3743e-23 s.

Multiply 2.96625e8 by 1.3743e-23.

The exponents: 1e8 *1e-23 =1e-15.

So 2.96625 *1.3743 ≈ ?

Let me compute 3 *1.3743=4.1229, but since it's 2.96625, which is 3*(0.98875), so 4.1229 *0.98875.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 2.96625*1.3743.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 2.96625e8 *1.3743e-23 = (2.96625 *1.3743) *1e-15.

Compute 2.96625 *1.3743.

Approximating:

2 *1.3743 =2.7486.

0.96625 *1.3743 = let's compute this.

0.96625 *1.3 = 1.256125.

0.96625 *0.0743 = 0.0718.

So total ≈1.256125 +0.0718 =1.3279.

So 2.7486 +1.3279 ≈4.0765.

So L≈4.0765e-15 meters.

Looking back at the options, option C is 5.0223e-15, B is 4.0655e-15. Hmm, my calculation got approximately 4.076e-15, which is very close to option B (4.0655e-15). So probably, considering rounding in calculations, the correct option would be B.

Wait, but why the slight discrepancy? Let me check calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute beta^2 precisely.

Beta is 7.91 /8 =0.98875.

Beta squared: 0.98875^2.

Calculating 0.98875 *0.98875:

= (0.98 + 0.00875) * (0.98 +0.00875 )

=0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.00875 + (0.00875)^2

=0.9604 + 0.01715 + 0.0000765625

=0.9604 +0.01715=0.97755 +0.0000765625=0.9776265625.

So 1 - beta^2=1-0.9776265625=0.0223734375.

sqrt(0.0223734375)= let's compute:

We can compute sqrt(0.0223734375) using a calculator approach.

0.149^2 =0.022201, 0.1495^2=0.02235025, which is very close to 0.0223734375.

So 0.1495^2=0.02235025 → 0.0223734375-0.02235025=0.0000231875.

The difference is 0.0000231875. Let's find the next decimal:

Let me compute (0.1495 + x)^2 =0.0223734375.

Expanding: 0.1495^2 + 2*0.1495 *x +x² =0.02235025 +0.299 x +x².

Set equal to 0.0223734375:

0.02235025 +0.299 x +x² =0.0223734375.

0.299 x ≈0.0000231875.

x≈0.0000231875 / 0.299 ≈ 7.75e-5.

So sqrt is approximately 0.1495 +0.0000775≈0.1495775.

So gamma=1/0.1495775≈6.684.

Which is the same as before.

So tau_lab=gamma * tau_rest=6.684 *2.056875e-24≈1.3743e-23 s.

v=0.98875 *3e8=2.96625e8 m/s.

L=2.96625e8 *1.3743e-23 = ?

Compute 2.96625 *1.3743.

Let me compute more accurately:

2.96625 *1.3743.

Break it down:

2.96625 *1.3 =3.856125.

2.96625 *0.0743= ?

Calculate 2.96625 *0.07 =0.2076375.

2.96625 *0.0043 = approx 0.012794875.

So sum is 0.2076375 +0.012794875=0.220432375.

So total 3.856125 +0.220432375=4.076557375.

So 4.076557375e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So perhaps in the exact calculation, it's about 4.07e-15, but the option is 4.0655e-15, which is about 4.07e-15 when rounded. So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but why the slight discrepancy? Maybe because I approximated gamma as 6.684, but perhaps a more precise calculation would yield gamma closer to 6.683, leading to a slightly lower L.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using more precise values for the constants.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for decay length without approximating beta.

Another approach: The decay length L is given by L = c * (tau_lab) * beta.

Wait, but tau_lab = gamma tau_rest.

And beta = v/c.

So L = beta c tau_lab = beta c gamma tau_rest.

But tau_rest is ħ/(Gamma c^2) ?

Wait, no. Tau_rest is ħ/(Gamma) ?

Wait, let me get the units right. Gamma is in GeV, ħ is in GeV·s.

So tau_rest = ħ/(Gamma) → which is (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) )= 2.056875e-24 s.

So, L = beta * c * gamma * tau_rest.

Beta is 7.91/8 =0.98875.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2)=6.684 as before.

So,

L = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s * 6.684 *2.056875e-24 s.

Compute step by step.

First, 0.98875 *3e8 =2.96625e8 m/s.

2.96625e8 *6.684 = let's compute first 2.96625e8 *6 =1.77975e9.

2.96625e8 *0.684 = approx 2.96625e8 *0.6=1.77975e8; 2.96625e8 *0.084=2.5044e7. So total 1.77975e8 +2.5044e7=2.02919e8.

So sum 1.77975e9 + 2.02919e8 = approximately 1.98266e9.

Wait, perhaps more accurately:

Wait, 2.96625e8 *6.684 = ?

6.684 =6 + 0.684.

2.96625e8 *6 =1.77975e9.

2.96625e8 *0.684 = ?

0.684 is 684e-3.

2.96625e8 *684e-3 = (2.96625 *684) *1e5.

Compute 2.96625 *684.

2 *684=1368.

0.96625 *684: 0.96625 *600=579.75, 0.96625*84=81.405 → total 579.75 +81.405=661.155.

So 2.96625 *684 =1368 +661.155=2029.155 → 2029.155e5 =2.029155e8.

So,

2.96625e8 *6.684 =1.77975e9 +2.029155e8 = 1.9826615e9.

So,

L = (2.96625e8 *6.684 ) * (2.056875e-24 s) ?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, I think I messed up the steps.

Wait, the initial expression was:

L = beta * c * gamma * tau_rest.

Which is:

beta =0.98875,

c=3e8 m/s,

gamma=6.684,

tau_rest=2.056875e-24 s.

So,

L =0.98875 *3e8 *6.684 *2.056875e-24.

Wait, but that's 0.98875 *3e8 =2.96625e8,

Multiply by 6.684: 2.96625e8 *6.684 → as before, approximately 1.98266e9.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24: 1.98266e9 *2.056875e-24 = (1.98266 *2.056875 )e-15.

Compute 1.98266 *2.056875.

Let me compute 2 *2.056875=4.11375.

Subtract 0.01734 *2.056875.

Wait, 1.98266 is 2 - 0.01734.

So,

1.98266 *2.056875 =2 *2.056875 - 0.01734 *2.056875.

=4.11375 - (0.01734 *2.056875).

Compute 0.01734 *2.056875 = approx 0.03566.

So,

4.11375 -0.03566 ≈4.07809.

So L≈4.078e-15 meters.

So 4.078e-15 m. So looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, which is close. So perhaps the slight discrepancy is because of more precise calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial calculation should use exact expressions without approximations.

Alternatively, another approach: The mean decay length L is given by L = c * beta * gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime.

Tau_0 = ħ / Gamma.

So let me compute each step exactly.

Gamma_X =320 MeV =0.32 GeV.

Tau_0 = ħ / Gamma_X =6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.

Beta = (p c)/E.

E=8 GeV,

p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) = sqrt(64 - (1.2)^2 ) GeV = sqrt(62.56) GeV =7.91 GeV.

So beta =7.91 /8 =0.98875.

Gamma factor: gamma=1/ sqrt(1 - beta^2).

Beta^2= (0.98875)^2 =0.9776265625.

So 1 - beta^2=0.0223734375.

sqrt(0.0223734375)=0.149586.

Gamma=1/0.149586≈6.6839.

So,

L= c * beta * gamma * tau_0.

c=3e8 m/s,

beta=0.98875,

gamma=6.6839,

tau_0=2.056875e-24 s.

So,

L=3e8 * 0.98875 *6.6839 *2.056875e-24.

Compute each multiplication step:

First, 3e8 *0.98875 =2.96625e8 m/s.

Multiply by 6.6839:

2.96625e8 *6.6839 = ?

2.96625e8 *6 =1.77975e9.

2.96625e8 *0.6839 = let's compute 2.96625e8 *0.6=1.77975e8.

2.96625e8 *0.0839= approximately 2.96625e8 *0.08=2.373e7; 2.96625e8 *0.0039=1.156e6. So total approx 2.373e7 +1.156e6=2.4886e7.

So 0.6839 gives 1.77975e8 +2.4886e7=2.02861e8.

So, 2.96625e8 *6.6839 =1.77975e9 +2.02861e8=1.98261e9.

Now multiply by tau_0=2.056875e-24 s.

So,

1.98261e9 *2.056875e-24 = (1.98261 *2.056875) *1e-15.

Compute 1.98261 *2.056875.

1.98261 *2 =3.96522.

1.98261 *0.056875= approx 0.1124.

So total≈3.96522 +0.1124 =4.0776.

So L≈4.0776e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.0776e-15 m. The option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close. So perhaps the correct answer is option B.

But why the slight difference? Maybe because the exact calculation of gamma is a little different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Beta=0.98875.

Beta^2= (0.98875)^2 =0.9776265625.

1-beta^2=0.0223734375.

sqrt(0.0223734375)= let's compute it more accurately.

0.149586^2 =0.0223734.

So gamma=1/0.149586 ≈6.6839.

So, perhaps the calculations are correct. The slight difference might be due to rounding in the calculation steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact values without any intermediate rounding.

Let me try to compute L with more precise steps.

Compute L = c * beta * gamma * tau_0.

c=3e8 m/s,

beta=7.91/8=0.98875,

gamma=1/sqrt(0.0223734375)=6.6839,

tau_0=6.582e-25 /0.32 =2.056875e-24 s.

So,

L=3e8 *0.98875 *6.6839 *2.056875e-24.

Compute 3e8 *0.98875 =2.96625e8.

2.96625e8 *6.6839 =?

2.96625e8 *6=1.77975e9.

2.96625e8 *0.6839=?

0.6839=0.6 +0.08 +0.0039.

2.96625e8 *0.6=1.77975e8.

2.96625e8 *0.08=2.373e7.

2.96625e8 *0.0039=1.156e6.

So sum:1.77975e8 +2.373e7 +1.156e6=1.77975e8 + 0.2373e8 +0.01156e8= (1.77975 +0.2373 +0.01156)e8=2.02861e8.

So total 2.96625e8 *6.6839=1.77975e9 +2.02861e8=1.982611e9.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24:

1.982611e9 *2.056875e-24 = (1.982611 *2.056875) *1e-15.

Compute 1.982611 *2.056875.

1.982611 *2=3.965222.

1.982611 *0.056875=0.112397.

Total=3.965222 +0.112397=4.077619.

So L=4.077619e-15 m.

Looking at the options:

Option B:4.0655e-15,

Option C:5.0223e-15.

So, 4.0776e-15 is closer to option B, but perhaps there's a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, wait a second—another thought. Tau_rest is ħ/(Gamma), but wait, the total decay width Gamma is related to the mean lifetime as tau = ħ/(Gamma). But wait, in particle physics, when using the natural unit system (ħ=6.582e-25 GeV·s), the relation is Gamma (in GeV) = ħ c / tau (in s), but I'm a bit confused about the units here.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The decay width Γ is given in MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

The natural unit for ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So tau = ħ / Gamma = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.

This part is correct.

Now, the velocity is beta c, which is 0.98875 *3e8 m/s.

The Lorentz factor gamma is 6.6839 as calculated.

So the mean lifetime in lab frame is gamma * tau_rest=6.6839 * 2.056875e-24=1.3743e-23 s.

So, L=beta c * tau_lab = 0.98875 *3e8 m/s *1.3743e-23 s.

Compute 0.98875 *3e8 =2.96625e8 m/s.

Multiply by 1.3743e-23 s: 2.96625e8 *1.3743e-23 = (2.96625 *1.3743) *1e-15.

Compute 2.96625 *1.3743.

Let me compute it accurately.

2.96625 *1.3743.

Break it down:

= (2 + 0.96625) * (1 + 0.3743)

= 2*1 + 2*0.3743 + 0.96625*1 +0.96625*0.3743.

= 2 + 0.7486 +0.96625 +0.3616.

Sum these:

2 +0.7486=2.7486.

2.7486 +0.96625=3.71485.

3.71485 +0.3616=4.07645.

So 4.07645e-15 m.

So L≈4.07645e-15 m.

Looking again at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, and option C is 5.0223e-15.

The calculated value is approximately 4.076e-15, which is very close to option B. The difference might be due to more precise calculation steps or rounding in the options.

But wait, the options have more precise numbers. Let me see if I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use more decimal places in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the initial calculation of beta is 7.91/8 =0.98875, but 7.91 is actually sqrt(62.56) GeV.

Wait, 62.56 is 62.56 GeV².

Wait, sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV.

But perhaps I should compute sqrt(62.56) more accurately. Let me compute 7.91^2:7.9^2=62.41, 7.91^2= (7.9 +0.01)^2=62.41 + 0.158 +0.0001=62.5681. Wait, but 7.91^2=62.5681, which is a bit higher than 62.56.

Wait, wait the initial calculation was (p c)^2 =64 -1.44=62.56 GeV².

So p c =sqrt(62.56) GeV.

Compute sqrt(62.56):

We know that 7.9^2=62.41.

7.91^2=62.5681.

We need sqrt(62.56).

So between 7.9 and 7.91.

Compute 7.9^2=62.41.

At 7.9 + delta, (7.9 + delta)^2=7.9^2 + 2*7.9*delta + delta^2=62.41 +15.8 delta + delta^2.

Set equal to 62.56:

62.41 +15.8 delta + delta^2=62.56 →15.8 delta ≈0.15 → delta≈0.15/15.8≈0.00949367.

So sqrt(62.56) ≈7.9 +0.00949367≈7.90949367 GeV.

So p c=7.90949367 GeV →p=7.90949367 GeV/c.

Beta = p c /E =7.90949367 /8 =0.988686709.

So beta=0.988686709.

Now, compute gamma.

Beta squared: (0.988686709)^2.

0.988686709 *0.988686709.

Compute:

0.988686709 × 0.988686709.

Compute:

First compute 0.98 × 0.98 = 0.9604.

0.98 ×0.008686709= approx 0.008512975.

0.008686709 ×0.98= same as above.

0.008686709 ×0.008686709≈0.00007543.

So,

(0.98 +0.008686709)^2 =0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.008686709 + (0.008686709)^2.

=0.9604 + 2*(0.008512975) +0.00007543.

=0.9604 +0.01702595 +0.00007543 =0.97750138.

So 1 - beta^2=1-0.97750138=0.02249862.

sqrt(0.02249862)= ?

We can compute this precisely.

0.1496^2=0.02238016.

0.1497^2= (0.1496 +0.0001)^2=0.02238016 +2*0.1496*0.0001 +0.00000001=0.02238016 +0.00002992 +0.00000001≈0.02241009.

0.02249862 is between 0.1497^2 and 0.1498^2.

Compute 0.1497^2=0.02241009.

To reach 0.02249862, the difference is 0.02249862 -0.02241009=0.00008853.

So, the increment x such that (0.1497 +x)^2=0.02249862.

(0.1497 +x)^2≈0.1497^2 + 2*0.1497 x = 0.02241009 +0.2994 x.

Set equal to 0.02249862 → 0.2994 x=0.00008853 → x=0.00008853 /0.2994 ≈0.0002955.

So, sqrt≈0.1497 +0.0002955≈0.150, but wait, 0.1497+0.0002955=0.1499955≈0.15.

Wait, wait no—0.1497 +0.0002955=0.1499955, which is approximately 0.15.

Wait, but 0.15^2=0.0225, which is larger than 0.02249862. So perhaps x is a bit less.

Wait, 0.1497 +0.0002955=0.1499955.

So, sqrt(0.02249862)=0.1499955.

So gamma=1/0.1499955≈6.6668.

Wait, 1/0.15=6.666666..., so 1/0.1499955≈6.6668.

So gamma≈6.6668.

Now, recompute L with these more precise values.

Beta=0.988686709,

Gamma=6.6668,

Tau_0=2.056875e-24 s,

c=3e8 m/s.

L= c * beta * gamma * tau_0.

So,

L=3e8 * 0.988686709 *6.6668 *2.056875e-24.

Compute step by step:

3e8 *0.988686709=2.966060127e8 m/s.

Multiply by 6.6668:

2.966060127e8 *6.6668 = ?

Compute 2.966060127e8 *6 =1.779636076e9.

2.966060127e8 *0.6668 ≈ compute 2.96606e8 * (2/3) =1.97737e8.

Wait, wait, 0.6668 is approximately 2/3, so 2.96606e8 *0.6668≈1.97737e8.

So sum:1.779636e9 +1.97737e8=1.97736e9.

Wait, more accurately:

Compute 2.966060127e8 *0.6668:

2.966060127e8 *0.6=1.779636076e8.

2.966060127e8 *0.0668=?

0.06 *2.96606e8=1.779636e7.

0.0068 *2.96606e8=1.99996e6.

So sum:1.779636e7 +1.99996e6=1.979632e7.

So total 1.779636e8 +1.979632e7=1.9775992e8.

So,

2.966060127e8 *6.6668=1.779636e9 +1.9775992e8=1.9773959e9.

Now multiply by tau_0=2.056875e-24 s.

So,

1.9773959e9 *2.056875e-24 = (1.9773959 *2.056875) *1e-15.

Compute 1.9773959 *2.056875.

Break it down:

1.9773959 *2 =3.9547918.

1.9773959 *0.056875= approx 0.11199.

Total≈3.9547918 +0.11199≈4.06678.

So L≈4.06678e-15 meters.

Which is very close to option B:4.0655e-15.

The slight difference is due to the precise gamma calculation.

So, the correct answer must be option B:4.0655e-15 m.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the given parameters: production energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \), and width \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). The decay distance \( L \) is calculated using the relativistic lifetime and velocity of the particle.

### Step 1: Relating width to lifetime
The mean lifetime in the particle's rest frame is given by:
\[
\tau_{\text{rest}} = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X}
\]
where \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \). Substituting \( \Gamma_X = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
\tau_{\text{rest}} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Time dilation and lab-frame lifetime
The particle's velocity \( v \) is determined using the relativistic relation:
\[
\beta = \frac{p c}{E},
\]
where \( p c = \sqrt{E^2 - (m_X c^2)^2} \). Substituting \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
p c = \sqrt{8^2 - 1.2^2} = \sqrt{64 - 1.44} = \sqrt{62.56} \approx 7.91 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\beta = \frac{7.91}{8} \approx 0.98875.
\]
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.98875)^2}}.
\]
Calculating \( \beta^2 \):
\[
\beta^2 = (0.98875)^2 \approx 0.9776265625,
\]
so:
\[
1 - \beta^2 \approx 0.0223734375, \quad \sqrt{1 - \beta^2} \approx 0.149586, \quad \gamma \approx \frac{1}{0.149586} \approx 6.6839.
\]
The lifetime in the lab frame is:
\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau_{\text{rest}} = 6.6839 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.3743 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 3: Decay distance
The decay distance is:
\[
L = v \tau_{\text{lab}} = \beta c \tau_{\text{lab}}.
\]
Substituting \( \beta = 0.98875 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau_{\text{lab}} = 1.3743 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \):
\[
L = 0.98875 \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 1.3743 \times 10^{-23}.
\]
First, calculate \( 0.98875 \times 3 \times 10^8 \):
\[
0.98875 \times 3 \times 10^8 = 2.96625 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]
Then, multiply by \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \):
\[
L = (2.96625 \times 10^8) \times (1.3743 \times 10^{-23}) = (2.96625 \times 1.3743) \times 10^{-15}.
\]
Calculating \( 2.96625 \times 1.3743 \):
\[
2.96625 \times 1.3743 \approx 4.0776.
\]
Thus:
\[
L \approx 4.0776 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 4: Comparing with options
The calculated value \( L \approx 4.0776 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B: \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**, with the slight discrepancy due to rounding in intermediate steps.

**Answer: B**
