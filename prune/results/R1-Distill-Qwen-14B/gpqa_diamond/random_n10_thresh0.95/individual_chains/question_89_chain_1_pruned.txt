Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

Alright, the first part says that 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH to form product 1. The product is a light yellow solid, and they gave the 1H NMR spectrum. Let me think about what reaction that would be. Dibromoadamantane with KOH... sounds like an elimination reaction because KOH is a strong base. So, if you heat a dibromide with KOH, you usually get an elimination, forming an alkene. Since the molecule is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form an alkene. So product 1 is probably adamantylene or something similar. The NMR matches this: a triplet at 4.79 ppm, which might be the vinyl protons. Wait, but wait, in the NMR, the triplet at 4.79 is for 2H. Hmm, so maybe it's a geminal diol? No, because KOH would more likely cause elimination. Alternatively, if it's vicinal diol, but wait, no, KOH in such conditions would cause elimination, not substitution. So more likely, it's dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene.

Wait, but the IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group. Oh! So maybe it's not elimination to form an alkene but an elimination to form a ketone. Wait, no—wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Wait, the structure of adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would be on two non-adjacent carbons, perhaps. So when heated with KOH, maybe it undergoes a double elimination. Or perhaps a dehydrohalogenation occurs twice, leading to the formation of an enol, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol-like elimination. Wait, pinacol is diol, but in this case, dibromide.

Alternatively, perhaps the two bromides are in positions that allow for the formation of a ketone. Wait, if we have a dihalide and eliminate two equivalents of HBr, then perhaps we form a ketone. But wait, pinacol rearrangement is when a 1,2-diol is treated with acid to form a ketone, but here we have a dihalide. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination, but how? Wait, maybe each Br leaves, and the adjacent H is abstracted by the base, leading to a double bond. But if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps eliminating two HBr would form a conjugated diene? But the product is a solid, and the NMR shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm. Wait, 4.79 is a region where vinyl protons are, but more likely, maybe it's an epoxide? Because 1,3-dibromide, treated with base could form an epoxide via some mechanism, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the base causes two eliminations, maybe forming a carbonyl group.

Wait, looking at the IR: the 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which suggests a ketone or ester. So product 1 has a ketone group. So how does that happen?

Ah! Maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. For example, if the structure is such that upon elimination, two adjacent Brs are removed, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. So, if the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, perhaps when both eliminate, a carbonyl forms. So, for example, if it's 1,2-dibromoadamantane, elimination would form a ketone. But the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Wait, but perhaps the structure allows for some conjugated elimination.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Dieckmann elimination, but that's for cyclic esters. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination where two HBr molecules are removed, resulting in a carbonyl. Let me try to imagine the structure. Suppose the molecule is such that each Br is on a carbon adjacent to each other. So maybe the structure is something like Br-C-CH2-Br and so on. Wait, but in adamantane, the structure is a diamond-like lattice, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Brs on opposite ends of the structure.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen from each Br, leading to formation of a double bond. But if two Brs are on adjacent carbons, then elimination could form a double bond. But if they're on opposite ends, maybe elimination would create a more extended structure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne, but that's less likely. Or perhaps a ketone via some mechanism.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Let me look at the NMR of product 1. The NMR has:

4.79 (2H) – likely a CH2 group, possibly next to an oxygen, given the IR.

2.41-2.23 (10H) – that's a lot of CH2 groups, so maybe it's part of a ring, like adamantane.

1.94 (2H) – another CH2 group.

So if the product is an epoxide, the 4.79 ppm would correspond to the oxygenated CH2. But wait, an epoxide would have two protons adjacent to oxygen, which would typically be as a triplet if coupled with each other. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, but if product 1 has a ketone, its NMR would show a singlet for the carbonyl, but the coupling would be on the adjacent protons. So, if the carbonyl is between two CH2 groups, the adjacent protons would show coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol. But the IR at 1720 is more ketone or ester.

Wait, another thought: 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon heating with KOH could undergo two eliminations, each producing HBr, and forming a ketone because of the positions of the Brs. So, perhaps each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a quaternary carbon, so eliminating HBr from each would form a carbonyl group. So the product would be a ketone, and the structure would have a carbonyl group in the middle, with adjacent CH2 groups.

So, product 1 is 1,3-adamantanedione? Or maybe just a single ketone group. Hmm. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, maybe the product is 1,3-diketone. But that's not likely because KOH would need to do two eliminations, which seems a bit unusual.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Dieckmann-like elimination, but that's more for cyclic esters. I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, maybe another approach. The product 1 is a light yellow solid. When dibromides are treated with KOH, they typically eliminate to form alkenes. So perhaps product 1 is 1,3-diene adamantane, or some diene derivative. But the NMR doesn't show a typical diene pattern, unless it's a conjugated diene, which would have protons that are more deshielded and perhaps show a triplet.

But the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is a ketone. Let me think about the reaction. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen next to each Br, leading to the elimination of HBr and forming a double bond. But how does that lead to a ketone?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by a rearrangement. Oh! Maybe it's a Favorskii elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a coupling, but that's more for Grignard reagents.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid molecule with four cyclohexane rings fused together in a chair-like structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two carbons that are diagonally opposite each other. So, when treated with KOH, perhaps each Br undergoes elimination, but I'm not sure how that would form a ketone.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the base deprotonates a hydrogen adjacent to one Br, leading to the formation of a carbanion, which then attacks the other Br, leading to elimination of HBr and forming a double bond. But that would form an alkene, not a ketone.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination, forming a ketone. Wait, if each Br is on a carbon that's next to another carbon, maybe eliminating two HBr molecules would form a carbonyl group. So, for each Br, perhaps the adjacent hydrogen is removed, leading to a double bond, but if both eliminations happen on adjacent carbons, perhaps a carbonyl is formed.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should move on and see if the rest of the steps give me any clues.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So maybe product 1 is being alkylated or acylated here. Wait, product 1 has a ketone group (from the IR), so perhaps the Al isopropoxide is facilitating a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but product 1 is the acylating agent. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a dienophile, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is a ketone, then heating with Al isopropoxide could lead to some kind of cycloaddition, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Claisen condensation, but that usually involves esters. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alkene, and product 2 is the result of some dihydroxylation or addition. But Al isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid; perhaps it's used in some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction, like a dehydration or rearrangement.

Wait, I'm not getting much from this step either. Let's look at the next step.

Ozone was bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide, forming product 3.

Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So, product 3 is the result of ozonolysis of an alkene in product 2.

Wait, but if product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break it into smaller molecules. Alternatively, if product 2 has a single alkene, ozonolysis would cleave it.

But in the NMR of product 3, we're looking for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange with the solvent.

So, the most deshielded protons are likely near electron-withdrawing groups, like carbonyl groups. So, maybe it's a ketone or aldehyde.

But how does the structure of product 3 look? Let me try to piece it together.

Let me try to outline the steps again:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1. IR shows carbonyl, so product 1 has a ketone.

2. Product 1 + Al isopropoxide → product 2. Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, so perhaps product 2 is an acylium ion or some kind of alkylation product.

3. Ozone + product 2 → product 3. Ozonolysis suggests there's an alkene in product 2.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an alkene. So how does product 1 lead to product 2 with an alkene?

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, and then product 2 is formed by a reaction that introduces an alkene. But Al isopropoxide is involved. Maybe a conjugated addition, like a Michael addition, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol which is then dehydrated to form an alkene. But product 1's IR doesn't show an OH stretch, which would be around 3300 cm-1. The IR given is 1720, which is a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something else. Alternatively, product 2 could be a vinyl ketone if an elimination happened.

Wait, another angle: If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is a conjugated dienone. Then ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 has a substituted alkene that, upon ozonolysis, gives specific fragments.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structures. Maybe I should try to imagine each product.

Let's start with product 1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH. Let's imagine that each Br is on a carbon, and the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond. So product 1 would be 1,3-diene adamantane. But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps each elimination forms a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe each elimination leads to a ketone. If two eliminations happen, each on adjacent carbons, perhaps leading to a diketone. So product 1 would be a diketone.

Wait, but in that case, maybe product 1 is a carbonyl, and the NMR would show the adjacent protons. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be the protons adjacent to the carbonyl. So perhaps a CH2 group next to a ketone.

Wait, the NMR data for product 1 is:

4.79 (2H) - possibly adjacent to a carbonyl.

2.41-2.23 (10H) - perhaps the ring CH2 groups, which are downfield due to the ring structure.

1.94 (2H) – another CH2 group, maybe attached to the carbonyl.

So, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-adamantandione, a diketone. But I'm not entirely sure about the structure, but let's proceed.

Then, product 1 is heated with Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts acylation. So perhaps product 2 is the result of a Friedel-Crafts acylation of product 1. But product 1 is a ketone, so maybe it's used as the acylating agent.

Wait, but product 1 is 1,3-diketone. In Friedel-Crafts acylation, you need an acyl chloride or another acylating agent. Maybe product 1 reacts with Al isopropoxide to form an acylium ion, which then can undergo Friedel-Crafts. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an enol ether or something else that can form an acylium ion. Alternatively, perhaps the Al isopropoxide is a catalyst for some elimination, leading to an alkene in product 2.

Wait, another possibility: Product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with a Lewis acid like Al isopropoxide, it might undergo a dehydration to form an alkene. But that would require the presence of an acid and a β-hydrogen. So if product 1 has a β-hydrogen, the acid could protonate the oxygen, make the hydrogen more acidic, and eliminate to form an alkene. So product 2 would be an alkene.

So, product 2 is an alkene derived from product 1's ketone. Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

So, when product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis, it breaks the double bond into two carbonyl groups. Then, when dimethylsulfide is added, it would break the ozonides into carbonyl compounds. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

Now, looking at the NMR of product 3. The most deshielded hydrogen would be near a carbonyl group. So, in the product 3, perhaps the splitting comes from coupling with adjacent protons.

Wait, but let me imagine the structure. Suppose product 2 is an alkene, say, between two CH2 groups. Then, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is CH2=CH-(adamantane part), then ozonolysis would form two aldehydes or ketones.

But in our case, product 3's NMR is being examined. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, which is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Suppose the structure after ozonolysis is something like R-C(=O)-CH2-CHO, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diketone.

Alternatively, if the alkene in product 2 was part of a cyclic structure, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, with some adjacent protons. The most deshielded hydrogen would be on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl.

In such a case, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded and would split into a triplet if they are coupled with two equivalent protons on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, but let's think about it. Let's say the structure is:

O=C-R-CH2-CHO

But that's not quite right. Alternatively, think of it as:

Each end of the ozonolysis product would be a carbonyl group. Suppose the alkene was part of a CH2-CH2 group in product 2. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, each with adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe product 3 has a structure like this:

(CH2)2-C(=O)-R and R-C(=O)-(CH2)2.

No, perhaps it's more like:

If the alkene in product 2 was between two CH2 groups, ozonolysis would cleave to form two aldehydes or ketones, depending on substitution.

But considering the adamantane structure, perhaps the ozonolysis breaks a bridge, leading to smaller fragments with carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, maybe the product after ozonolysis is a diketone, with each carbonyl group adjacent to a CH2 group, which in turn is adjacent to another CH2 group.

So, the most deshielded protons would be the ones next to the carbonyl. Let's say we have a structure like:

CH2-C(=O)-R

The CH2 protons would be adjacent to a carbonyl. Each of these protons would couple with the protons on the adjacent CH2 group (if any) and perhaps with any other neighboring protons.

Wait, but let's model this. Suppose after ozonolysis, we have a structure where a CH2 group is next to a carbonyl group, and that CH2 is connected to another CH2 group. So:

O=C-CH2-CH2-...

In this case, the protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would each be adjacent to two protons (on the next CH2). So each proton on that CH2 would be split by the neighboring two protons, leading to a triplet.

But wait, if the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl is connected to another CH2, which is connected to another CH2, then each proton on the first CH2 would be coupled with the two protons on the adjacent CH2. So each would be a triplet. So in the NMR, the protons next to the carbonyl would be a triplet.

But wait, another possibility: if the CH2 next to the carbonyl is connected to another CH group, which might have more complex coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl is connected to two other CH2 groups, leading to more splitting.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded protons are on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, which is itself adjacent to another CH2 group. So each proton on the first CH2 would be coupled with two protons on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding those that exchange). So, if the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-X

The protons on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would each be split by the two protons on the next CH2, leading to a triplet. So the NMR would show a triplet for those protons.

But wait, what if the adjacent group has more than one proton? Or perhaps the coupling is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 next to the carbonyl is connected to another CH2 group, which in turn is connected to another CH2, leading to coupling with more protons.

Wait, another scenario: the most deshielded protons are on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, which is attached to a CH that has two neighboring CH2 groups. So each proton on the CH2 would couple with two protons on the adjacent CH, which in turn is connected to another CH2. Wait, that could lead to more complex splitting.

Alternatively, maybe the CH2 is adjacent to a CH group that has two neighboring CH2 groups, leading to more couplings.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of a simple case. Suppose the structure after ozonolysis is a diketone where each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group. Then, each CH2 would have two protons, each of which is adjacent to another CH2 group. So the protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be a triplet due to coupling with the two protons on the adjacent CH2.

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Looking at the options:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

So, the correct answer would be a triplet, option A.

But wait, let me think again. The most deshielded hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's say the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-...

The protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would each be split by the two protons on the adjacent CH2. Each proton would have two neighboring protons, so it's a triplet.

But wait, another possibility: if the adjacent group is a CH with two protons, like CH2-CH(CH3)-..., then the coupling could be more complex.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is adjacent to a CH that's part of a more complex structure, the splitting could be a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

Wait, another angle: the structure after ozonolysis could result in two carbonyl groups connected by a chain. For example:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-R

Wait, but that's not feasible because ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 had a structure like CH2-CH2 as part of a ring, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

Wait, but in the case of product 2 being an alkene, let's imagine it's a simple structure like CH2=CH-..., then ozonolysis would break into two aldehyde groups. But in this case, the protons next to the carbonyl would be on the aldehyde, which are usually deshielded and appear around 9-10 ppm, but the question says to exclude those that exchange with solvent, like OH or aldehyde protons which can sometimes exchange but not always.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded protons are on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH2 group, leading to triplet coupling.

So, considering all this, the coupling pattern is likely a triplet. So the answer is A.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the final determination of the coupling pattern:

1. **Step 1: Reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH**  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH likely results in a double elimination of HBr, forming a ketone. The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹, confirming the presence of a ketone. The ¹H NMR spectrum of product 1 supports this, with a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H), likely corresponding to protons adjacent to the carbonyl group.

2. **Step 2: Reaction of product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide**  
   Aluminum isopropoxide, a strong Lewis acid, likely facilitates a reaction that introduces an alkene into the structure of product 2. This is inferred because product 2 undergoes ozonolysis in the next step, which requires an alkene.

3. **Step 3: Ozonolysis of product 2**  
   Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming carbonyl compounds in product 3. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen is coupled with the two protons on the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet coupling pattern.

4. **Analysis of the coupling pattern**  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is on a CH₂ group directly adjacent to a carbonyl group. This CH₂ group is coupled with the two protons on the neighboring CH₂ group, leading to a triplet splitting pattern. Other coupling patterns, such as a triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet, are not consistent with the described structure.

**Conclusion:**  
The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet.
