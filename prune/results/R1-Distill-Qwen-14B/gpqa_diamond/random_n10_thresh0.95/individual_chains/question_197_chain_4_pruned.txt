Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. The question is about identifying the product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. But wait, HI is also involved. Oh right, sometimes when you have a carbonyl group, using HX (like HI) can lead to other reactions, like acid-catalyzed addition. But I think in this case, since it's red phosphorus, it's more likely a reduction.

First, let me look at the spectral data provided for Compound X. The IR and NMR data will help me figure out what the structure of X is. Once I know X, I can predict what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Starting with the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which suggests an O-H stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Wait, but the presence of a peak around 1720 cm-1 is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. Since 1720 is a bit lower than a ketone (which is usually around 1715) or a carboxylic acid (which is around 1700). But wait, the other peaks: 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those might be aromatic C=C stretching vibrations, which could mean that the compound has a benzene ring.

So putting that together, maybe Compound X has a benzene ring, a carbonyl group, and an O-H group. But wait, wait. Alternatively, the 3400-2500 could be due to an -OH stretch from an alcohol or maybe an alkyne. No, the 1720 would probably rule out an alkyne. So let's think: a carbonyl and an O-H elsewhere.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several signals. Let's list them:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is a strong indicator of an -OH proton, like in a carboxylic acid. Because in carboxylic acids, the -OH proton is usually around 10-12 ppm and broad because it's exchangeable.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is typical of aromatic protons, probably ortho to a substituent. So it's likely two protons in a para-substituted benzene ring.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another set of aromatic protons, probably para to something else. Wait, but if the ring is para-disubstituted, then the two protons would be as two doublets. For example, in a para-substituted benzene, you might have two doublets for the two sets of protons.

So the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents. Let's think about that. The protons at 8.0 ppm are probably more deshielded than the ones at 7.2, which would suggest that the substituent at position 4 is an electron-withdrawing group. Because if the substituent is EWG, it would cause the adjacent protons to be deshielded and appear upfield or downfield? Wait, para substituents: in a para-substituted benzene, each substituent affects the ring. So if we have a substituent that is an EWG, like a carbonyl, the protons ortho to it would be deshielded and appear downfield.

Wait, but let me think. Let's say the substituents are in the para positions: one is a carbonyl (like a ketone or acid) and another group. Or maybe one substituent is a carbonyl and another is a methyl group, but that doesn't fit all the data. Wait, maybe it's a benzene ring with two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and an alkoxy group? Or perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl and another is an aromatic group? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl and another group like a methyl.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid derivative. Let me think. Benzoic acid would have a COOH group. The IR would show a strong peak around 1700 cm-1, which aligns with the 1720 in the data. The O-H stretch in the IR is around 3400–2500, which is for a carboxylic acid. So that fits.

In the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is the COOH proton. Then the aromatic protons would be in a para-substituted position. Let's say the benzoic acid has another substituent in the para position. For example, maybe there's a substituent at the para position to the COOH group.

Looking at the other NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is around where a methylene (CH2) group adjacent to an oxygen might be, but it's a multiplet, so maybe it's part of a substituent attached to the ring.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, perhaps a CH2 group, maybe part of an isopropyl or similar.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A singlet for a CH3 group, maybe attached to a quaternary carbon, like in an isopropyl group.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A terminal CH3, so maybe from an ethyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps there's a substituent on the benzene ring that is an ethyl group with some branching. Let me think: maybe a propyl group? Or perhaps a butyl group.

Wait, the substituent would be an alkyl chain. The signals at 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm suggest a chain. Let's see:

The 0.9 ppm triplet (t) is a CH3 at the end of a chain. The 1.4 ppm is a singlet (d) for a CH3 attached to a CH. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (m) for two H's, perhaps a CH2 group. The 2.9 ppm multiplet for one H, maybe a CH attached to another group.

Wait, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group. Let me think: a sec-butyl group would have the structure CH2CH(CH2CH3). The NMR would show:

- The CH(CH2CH3) group would have a triplet around 2.9 ppm for the two H's on CH2 attached to the CH.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So the central CH has two CH2 groups attached. Wait, no, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the benzene. So the CH2 next to the benzene would have two H's, and the next group is a CH(CH2CH3). Let me think about the NMR:

- The CH2 adjacent to the benzene (let's say it's attached to the ring as CH2-) would have two H's. But wait, in a sec-butyl group, the CH2 is between the ring and the CH. So, maybe the H's on the CH2 (attached to the ring) would be split into a triplet if the neighboring CH has two H's. Alternatively, perhaps the 1.7 ppm is the CH2 attached to the ring, and the 2.9 ppm is the CH next to that.

Wait, perhaps the peaks at 1.7 (m, 2H) are from a CH2 group next to another CH2. The 2.9 (m, 1H) could be the CH connected to that CH2 and another CH2. Hmm, maybe it's a propyl group? No, because propyl would have a triplet at the end and so on.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a isobutyl group. Let me think about the isobutyl group structure: CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. So the group is CH2CH(CH3)2. The H's on the CH2 next to the ring would be a triplet, and the CH(CH3) would have a septet? Or perhaps it's a different substitution.

Alternatively, maybe it's a neopentyl group, but that's not matching the NMR.

Another approach: let's draw possible structures based on the spectral data.

The aromatic protons are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So the benzene ring is para-substituted with two groups. One of them is a carbonyl group (like COOH) and the other is an alkyl substituent.

So, the substituents are para to each other on the benzene ring. One substituent is COOH, and the other is an alkyl group.

Looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets. In a para-substituted benzene with two different substituents, the two sets of protons would be in two doublets. For example, if substituent A is in position 1 and substituent B in position 3 (but no, wait, para would be positions 1 and 4), but I'm getting confused. Let me think: in a para-disubstituted benzene, the substituents are on positions 1 and 4. The protons in positions 2 and 6 would be one set, and those in positions 3 and 5 would be another set.

If substituent A is a strong electron-withdrawing group (like COOH) in position 4, then the protons in positions 2 and 6 would be deshielded and appear downfield, while the protons in positions 3 and 5 would be less deshielded, appearing upfield. Wait, no, actually, the substituent in position 4 (para) would cause the ortho (positions 3 and 5) and para (position 1) protons to be affected.

Wait, let me take a specific example. Let's say the substituent is a COOH group at position 4. Then the protons at positions 3 and 5 would be ortho to COOH, and would be deshielded, appearing downfield. The protons at positions 2 and 6 would be meta to COOH, and perhaps more shielded, but wait, in para-substituted, the substituent's effect is felt in the ortho and para positions. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a COOH group and a substituent that's an electron-donating group (like methyl), which would cause the adjacent protons to be more shielded. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group or a propyl group, but I need to tie it into the NMR signals.

Wait, the substituent on the benzene (other than the COOH) is probably an alkyl chain. The NMR signals suggest that this alkyl group has a terminal CH3 (0.9 ppm, triplet), a CH2 group (1.7 ppm, multiplet), and a CH group (2.9 ppm, multiplet), and a CH3 attached to a CH (1.4 ppm, singlet). That makes me think of a sec-butyl group.

Here's why: the substituent would be a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the benzene. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no. Let me think: the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the substituent being an isobutyl group.

Wait, the isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. So the substituent attached to benzene would be a CH2 connected to a CH(CH3)2. Now, looking at the NMR, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) corresponds to the two CH3 groups attached to the central CH. Wait, no, in isobutyl, there are two CH3 groups attached to the same carbon. So that central CH has two CH3 groups attached. So the NMR would show a singlet for those CH3's because they are equivalent. But in the data, the singlet is at 1.4 ppm for 3H. Wait, but in isobutyl, two CH3 groups would be attached to a central CH. So each CH3 would give a singlet, but since they're equivalent, it would be a singlet integrating to 6H. But in the given data, the 1.4 ppm is 3H, so that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a neopentyl group, but that has a central carbon connected to four CH3 groups. Probably not, because the NMR wouldn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but I don't think the NMR matches that either.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a butyl group with a branch. Let me think: if the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH(CH3) group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's recount the NMR data:

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A singlet for a CH3 group. This suggests that the CH3 is attached to a CH which isn't split, perhaps because it's a central CH with two CH3 groups, but that would give 6H, not 3H. So perhaps it's a CH3 attached to a CH2, but that doesn't fit with the triplet at 0.9.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a pentyl group, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 3-pentyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH2CH3 group (a straight chain). But then the NMR would show a triplet at 0.9 (CH3), a quartet at 1.7 (CH2 next to CH2), a triplet at 2.9 (CH2 next to CH), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Let me think about that. That structure would have a central CH connected to a CH2 and a CH2CH3. The CH would have neighboring CH2 groups, so the signal for that CH would be a multiplet around 2.9 ppm, which matches the data. The CH2 next to the benzene (attached to the central CH) would have a triplet around 1.7 ppm, but wait, the 1.7 is a multiplet (m, 2H). That could fit a CH2 group adjacent to a CH with two H's. Then the next CH2 (the CH2CH3) would have a triplet at 1.4 ppm? Or perhaps not. Alternatively, the CH2CH3 would have a triplet around 0.9 ppm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 2-methylpropyl group, which is an isobutyl group. But as I thought earlier, the isobutyl group would have two CH3 groups, which would give a singlet for 6H. But given that the NMR has a singlet for 3H at 1.4 ppm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a tert-butyl group. The tert-butyl group is (CH3)3C-. In that case, the three CH3 groups would all be equivalent, giving a singlet for 9H, but that's not the case here either. Our NMR only shows 3H as a singlet.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. But then the CH(CH3)2 would have a singlet for the two CH3 groups, which adds up to 6H, but our data shows 3H. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH(CH3) group. Then the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-. The CH(CH3) would have a neighboring CH2, which would split its signal into a multiplet. The CH2 next to the ring would be a triplet, and the CH2 adjacent to CH(CH3) would be a quartet. But I'm not sure if the data matches this.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group. The propyl group would have a triplet at 0.9, a quartet at 1.6, and a triplet at 2.9. But in our data, the triplet is at 0.9, but the 1.7 is a multiplet (maybe two different CH2 groups), and the 2.9 is a multiplet.

Wait, maybe it's a 3-pentyl group. No, that's getting too complicated.

Let me think of the substituent as a chain of CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-. So the substituent is attached as benzene-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-. Then the NMR:

- The terminal CH3 would be a triplet at ~0.9 ppm.

- The CH2 next to the CH(CH3) would be a quartet at ~1.7 ppm.

- The CH2 next to the benzene would be a triplet at ~2.9 ppm (but the data shows a multiplet at 2.9; perhaps because it's next to a CH group).

Wait, but the data shows:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H) → perhaps this is the CH group, which is connected to two CH2 groups. So the CH would have two neighboring H's, leading to a multiplet.

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the CH2 next to the benzene, which is attached to another CH2. So each H in that CH2 would be split by the neighboring CH2, so perhaps a triplet or a quartet, but as a multiplet, it's observed as a m.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be a CH3 attached to a CH that's connected to the rest of the chain. Wait, but that doesn't fit with a straight chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Let me see:

The substituent is attached to benzene as -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Then:

- The CH2CH(CH2CH3) would have the CH(CH2CH3) group. The CH2 next to the benzene is CH2-, the next CH is attached to CH2CH3.

The CH2 next to the benzene (CH2-) would have two H's, which would be split into a triplet by the neighboring CH. The CH would have two H's from the adjacent CH2 and two H's from the CH2CH3 group, leading to a multiplet around 2.9 ppm.

The CH2CH3 group would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm (the terminal CH3), a quartet at 1.4 ppm (the CH2 next to the CH), and perhaps another signal elsewhere.

Wait, in this structure, the CH2CH3 group would have its own CH2, which would be adjacent to the CH. So the CH2 in the CH2CH3 would be next to a CH with two H's, so that CH2 would have a quartet. That quartet would be around 1.4 ppm, which matches the data.

The CH2 next to the benzene would have a triplet at 1.7 ppm (since it's next to a CH with two H's). The CH would be a multiplet at 2.9 ppm.

So putting this together, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So the substituent is an ethyl group attached to a CH group which is attached to a CH2CH3.

Wait, but the substituent is attached to the benzene as -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So the structure would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, but then the substituent is an ethyl group with a CH2CH3 branch. Hmm, but that would make the substituent a 3-pentyl group or something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene. So the structure is benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). Let's see:

- The CH2 attached to benzene would have two H's, which would be split into a triplet by the adjacent CH. So that's 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).

- The CH would have two H's from the adjacent CH2 and two H's from the CH2CH3, leading to a multiplet at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H).

- The CH2CH3 group would have a CH2 next to the CH. The H's on that CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH, leading to a quartet at 1.4 ppm (d for each H, but integrated as a quartet). Wait, no, the CH2 in CH2CH3 would be next to a CH, so each H on that CH2 would be split into a quartet. But the actual signal would be a quartet at around 1.4 ppm. But in the data, there's a 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which is a singlet, not a quartet. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. But that's getting too long.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2
