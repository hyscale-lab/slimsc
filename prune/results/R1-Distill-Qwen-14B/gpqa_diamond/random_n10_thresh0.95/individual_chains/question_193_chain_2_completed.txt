Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is saying. It says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, parallax is usually denoted as 'plx' in some contexts, right? Yeah, I think that's right.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Hmm. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So I need to relate parallax to distance.

I remember that parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. Oh wait, wait, more accurately, parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx (in arcsec) = 1/d (where d is in parsecs). So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

So if plx is 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Let's think about that. So plx is inversely proportional to distance.

Now, the number of stars is given as proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let's write that as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

But since plx = 1/d, substituting that in. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If plx = 1/d, then 1/(plx) is d. So 1/(plx)^5 would be d^5. Because (1/plx)^5 is (d)^5.

So substituting, N ∝ d^5. So N is proportional to the fifth power of distance. Wait, but wait, N is the number of stars in that region. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So perhaps it's about the density or the rate of change of N with distance.

Wait, the question says: How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?

Hmm. So maybe it's about the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r, with thickness dr. So it's the differential number, dN, with respect to r.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of stars as a function of distance. Let me think again.

Wait, the given relation is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

But since plx is 1/d, that's N ∝ (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So the number of stars increases rapidly as distance increases.

Wait, but that can't make sense. Because as you go further away, the number of stars shouldn't keep increasing indefinitely. Wait, but maybe in this specific region, the stars are spread in a certain way, so this relation holds. But that's another issue; perhaps the problem is more about the mathematical relation than physical intuition.

So the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number increases as the fifth power of distance. But wait, the options are in terms of r, which is distance. Let me look at the options.

The options are about how N changes with r. So if N is proportional to r^5, that would be option B. But wait, the question says "per unit range of distance, r". Hmm, perhaps I need to think about the differential. Let me think again.

Wait, the number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5. So N = k / (plx)^5, where k is some constant.

Expressed in terms of d, since plx = 1/d, this becomes N = k * d^5.

Now, the number of stars as a function of distance is N(d) = k d^5.

But the question is about how the number changes with distance, which implies the derivative of N with respect to d. Because if you're looking at per unit distance, it's the rate of change.

Wait, the question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Oh, wait, perhaps it's asking about the density of stars as a function of distance. So the number per unit volume, but perhaps in a thin shell, so it's the surface density as a function of r.

Alternatively, maybe it's the number of stars per unit distance. So, if you have a region, and you move a distance dr, how many stars are there in that dr. That would be the derivative dN/dr.

So if N = k d^5, then dN/dr = 5 k d^4.

So the change in number per unit distance is proportional to d^4. So the number is changing as r^4. Looking at the options, option C is r^4.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a thin shell (like a spherical shell) at radius r is proportional to r^4. Because surface area is 4π r², and if the number per unit area is proportional to r^something, maybe.

Wait, let's think differently. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance r is the number of stars between r and r+dr. So dN = N(r + dr) - N(r). If N(r) is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr = 5 r^4.

So the number of stars per unit distance (r) is proportional to r^4.

So the change in number per unit distance (the rate of change) is 5 r^4, so proportional to r^4. So the correct option would be option C, r^4.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The initial relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is N ∝ d^5. So N increases rapidly with distance.

But when you take the derivative dN/dr, you get 5 d^4, which is r^4. So the change in number per unit distance is proportional to r^4.

So the correct option is C, ~ r^4.


The question states that the number of stars \( N \) in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)) in parsecs, i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting this into the given relation, \( N \propto d^5 \), meaning the number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance "per unit range of distance, \( r \)." This implies the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which is the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Starting from \( N \propto d^5 \), the derivative is \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5d^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars changes with distance as \( r^4 \).

Among the options provided:
- \( \sim r^3 \) (Option A) is incorrect because the change is proportional to \( r^4 \), not \( r^3 \).
- \( \sim r^5 \) (Option B) is incorrect because \( r^5 \) describes the total number of stars, not the rate of change.
- \( \sim r^4 \) (Option C) is correct, as shown by the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4 \).
- \( \sim r^2 \) (Option D) is incorrect because it does not match the derived relation.

Thus, the correct answer is \( \sim r^4 \).

Answer: C
