Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major outcome of the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's break it down.

First, I need to understand what the starting material looks like. The compound is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. Wait, cyclopentenol? So the structure is a cyclopentene ring with an alcohol group. Let me visualize it. The cyclopentene has five members, and the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2 (since it's 1-enol). The hydroxyl group (-OH) is on carbon 1 because the numbering would place it there when the double bond is between 1 and 2. Also, there are two methyl groups on carbon 4. So the ring looks like it has substituents at positions 1 (OH), 4 (two methyl), and the double bond is between 1 and 2. So, the structure is a five-membered ring with the double bond from C1 to C2, an -OH on C1, and two methyl groups on C4.

Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, the IUPAC name is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. The "enol" part indicates that the double bond is adjacent to the hydroxyl group. So in enols, the structure is an alkene and an alcohol on adjacent carbons. So for cyclopentenol, the double bond is between C1 and C2 (as that's the position for 1-enol), and the -OH is on C1. So the structure would have the OH on C1, a double bond between C1 and C2, and two methyl groups on C4. So the ring looks something like this: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. At 1: OH and double bond to 2. At 2: double bond to 1. At 4: two methyl groups attached.

Now, the reaction is with bromine. Bromine in organic reactions is often involved in addition reactions, especially with alkenes. So I'm thinking this is about bromine adding across the double bond.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is an enol. Enols are alpha hydroxy ketones or aldehydes. Wait, no — enol is a structure where an alcohol group is next to a double bond, which is the case here. Enol is often involved in keto-enol tautomerism, but in this reaction, perhaps it's undergoing addition.

So the reaction between an enol and bromine (Br2) would typically lead to a diaddition across the double bond. So the double bond (C1-C2) would open up, and bromine would add across it. But wait, bromine in such reactions usually adds as Br-Br, so each Br would attach to each carbon in the double bond.

But wait, in enol systems, sometimes the addition can be more complex. Alternatively, another possibility is that the enol could undergo bromination via an electrophilic attack, but that's more in aromatic systems. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dihydroxybromination or something else. Or maybe it's a ring-opening if the ring is strained.

Wait, the starting material is a cyclopentene. Strained rings can undergo certain reactions more readily. But in this case, I think the main reaction is the addition of bromine across the double bond. So bromine (Br2) would add across the double bond in a diaddition, leading to a dibromide.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is an enol, so the molecule is in an enol form, which is more reactive towards electrophilic addition. So that would make the addition of Br2 across the double bond more feasible.

So when Br2 adds to a double bond, it usually does so in a concerted mechanism, adding one Br to each carbon, with the formation of a cyclic bromonium ion intermediate. But wait, in the case of enols, maybe the addition leads to a vicinal dihalide. So the product would have two Br atoms added across the former double bond.

Wait, but let me think about the stereochemistry. The starting compound is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, which is a cyclopentene ring. When Br2 adds across the double bond, it would form a dibromide. The ring would remain cyclopentane, but with two Br atoms on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but the starting material is an enol, which is a conjugated dienol? Or is it just a simple enol with a double bond next to the OH group. So the structure is cyclopentene with an OH on C1, and two methyl groups on C4.

So when Br2 adds to the double bond between C1 and C2, the product would have Br atoms on C1 and C2. But wait, the OH is on C1. So the structure would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol? Because after addition, the OH is still present.

Wait, but wait, when Br2 adds to a double bond adjacent to an OH group, could there be any possibility of a rearrangement or a different reaction pathway? Like, for example, if the enol tautomerizes to a ketone, but that's under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is more about epoxidation, but the reagent here is Br2, not an oxidizing agent that forms epoxides.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromohydrination. Wait, bromohydrin formation occurs when a bromine and a hydroxyl group are added across a double bond in a specific way. But that process usually requires a catalyst, like H2O and a catalyst, or perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed addition. Alternatively, in some cases, when enol reacts with a bromine, it might form a bromohydrin.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material already has an OH group on C1. So adding Br2 across the double bond (C1-C2) would place Br on C1 and C2. But wait, C1 already has an OH group. So perhaps the reaction is more about diaddition, leading to vicinal dibromide, but with the OH still attached.

Alternatively, maybe the OH is involved in some way. Wait, maybe the reaction isn't a simple addition. Enols can undergo bromination at the alpha position. Wait, but alpha to what? The carbonyl, but in this case, is the starting material a ketone or an enol?

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol — so what is the structure? The enol form means that the molecule is an alcohol adjacent to a double bond. So perhaps the structure is a cyclopentane ring with an OH on C1, a double bond between C1 and C2, and two methyl groups on C4. So the structure is:

C1: OH, double bond to C2.

C2: double bond to C1, single to C3.

C3: single to C2 and C4.

C4: two methyl groups and single to C3 and C5.

C5: single to C4 and C1.

Wait, wait, no. Let me draw the structure. The ring has five carbons. The numbering is such that the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C1. So the structure is:

C1 is connected to C2 (double bond) and C5 (single bond). C1 also has the OH group. C2 is connected to C1, C3, and has a single bond to C3. C3 connected to C2 and C4. C4 has two methyl groups and is connected to C3 and C5. C5 is connected to C4 and C1.

So, when Br2 adds to the double bond, it would add across C1-C2. So the product would have Br on C1 and Br on C2. But wait, C1 already has an OH group. So the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

But looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo..., and option D is (1R,2R)-... So these are stereoisomers.

Now, since the starting material is a cyclopentene, which is a cyclic, conjugated diene? No, wait, it's a cyclopentene with a double bond. When Br2 adds to a cyclopentene, the ring may open, but in this case, perhaps the ring remains intact. So the addition would be across C1 and C2, leading to a vicinal dibromide, with the OH still attached to C1.

But wait, the addition of Br2 to a double bond is a stereospecific reaction. So the bromines can add in either a cis or trans fashion, but in the case of a cyclic system, the ring's structure might influence the outcome.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So the enol is in a ring. When Br2 adds, it could add in a way that the Brs are added in a certain configuration. But in a ring, adding Brs across the double bond would lead to a trans addition because the ring's structure would enforce that.

Wait, no, the addition of Br2 is not stereospecific in terms of the final product's stereochemistry unless the starting molecule has some constraints. The starting molecule is a cyclopentene, which is a five-membered ring with a double bond. The addition of Br2 to a double bond is typically a syn addition, but in a cyclic system, which is more constrained, the addition might proceed differently.

Wait, another thought: in cyclic systems, the addition of Br2 can lead to ring opening. For example, in cyclopentene, adding Br2 can open the ring. Alternatively, perhaps in this case, the ring remains, and the Brs are added to adjacent carbons.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the ring opening. Let me think about the possible products.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Option D: (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

So these are diastereomers. The question is, when Br2 adds to the double bond, what would the configuration of the Brs be?

In a cyclopentene, when Br2 adds, the two Br atoms would add across the double bond. Since the ring is cyclic, the approach of Br2 would be such that the two Brs are added on opposite sides (anti addition), leading to a trans-dibromide. But wait, the ring's structure might influence this.

Wait, for cyclopropane, opening with Br2 is a possibility, but cyclopentene is more stable. Adding Br2 to cyclopentene would likely result in a vicinal dihalide without ring opening. So the product would have Br on C1 and Br on C2, each with a certain configuration.

But since the starting molecule is an enol, perhaps the addition would be accompanied by some kind of rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more of an epoxidation, but no, the reagent is Br2, not something like a peracid.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an oxidation. Wait, but the starting material is an enol, and oxidation of enols can lead to ketones. But that's more under certain conditions, like with KMnO4, H2O, and heat. But in this case, the reagent is Br2, which is more about addition.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the mechanism. When enols react with bromine, does the addition happen at the alpha position? Or is it a 1,2-addition?

Wait, in the case of conjugated dienes, Br2 can add in a 1,2 or 1,4 fashion, but in this case, it's a simple enol with a single double bond. So the addition is across the double bond.

So, the product would have Br on C1 and C2. But C1 already has an OH group. So the structure would be 1,2-dibromide with the OH on C1.

Now, considering the stereochemistry. When bromine adds to a double bond, the two Brs add on opposite sides (trans addition) because it forms a bromonium ion intermediate. So for a cyclopentene, the addition would lead to a trans-dibromide. So the two Brs would be on opposite sides of the ring.

But wait, the starting molecule is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So how would the addition of Br2 affect the stereochemistry?

Wait, in the starting molecule, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents are:

C1: OH, and connected to C2 (double bond) and C5.

C2: connected to C1 (double bond), C3, and perhaps a hydrogen (since it's part of the ring).

But the ring structure is such that the substituents on C1 and C2 would have a certain arrangement. When Br2 adds, the Brs would add on opposite sides, leading to a trans configuration.

But wait, in a cyclopentene, the ring is puckered. So the addition would lead to a trans-die addition, but in a ring, the two Brs would end up on adjacent positions but in a certain configuration.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the product structure. After addition, the two Brs would be on C1 and C2, each with a certain configuration relative to the OH group on C1.

But the options given are about the configuration of the Brs. Let's say the addition leads to Brs on C1 and C2 in a trans configuration relative to each other. So if we have the OH on C1 in a certain configuration (say, R), then the Br on C1 would be on the opposite face. Similarly, the Br on C2 would be on the same face as the OH, leading to a specific diastereomer.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should consider the possibility of the product being a vicinal dibromide with specific stereochemistry.

Looking at the options, options A and D are both 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, with different configurations.

Another possibility is that the reaction doesn't proceed via simple addition. Maybe the OH group participates in some way, such as forming a hemiacetal or undergoing oxidation, but I think that's less likely with Br2.

Alternatively, perhaps the OH group is involved in stabilizing a certain transition state during the addition of Br2. For example, the OH could form a hydrogen bond with a Br atom, affecting where the Brs add.

Wait, but without specific reaction conditions, I'm not entirely sure. The reaction is between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. So, Br2 in which solvent? Probably in a non-polar solvent, but without that info, I have to assume it's a typical diaddition.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't involve the double bond but the OH group. So, bromine could react with the alcohol to form a bromohydrin. But then, that would be a substitution or addition at the OH's position, but the starting material doesn't have a good leaving group unless it's protonated.

Wait, but in aqueous conditions, the OH could be protonated, making it a better leaving group. Then, Br- could attack, leading to substitution. But Br2 is a dihalogen and usually doesn't act as a nucleophile in that way.

Alternatively, perhaps the OH group is a good nucleophile and attacks Br2, but I don't think that's a common reaction.

So, going back. The main reaction is likely the addition of Br2 across the double bond, leading to 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Now, the question is about the stereochemistry. So the addition of Br2 to the double bond would produce a specific diastereomer. Since the starting material is a cyclopentene, which is a small ring, the addition would have to proceed in a way that fits into the ring's structure.

In the bromonium ion intermediate, the two Brs add across the double bond in a trans fashion. So, the two Brs would be on opposite sides of the ring. Therefore, the resulting 1,2-dibromide would have the Brs trans to each other.

But the OH is on C1, so when the Br adds to C1, where does it go relative to the OH?

Wait, in the starting material, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The OH is on C1, and the ring is such that the substituents on C1 and C2 are in a certain position.

When Br2 adds, the Brs would add to opposite faces of the double bond, leading to a trans-dibromide. So, if the OH is on the same face as one Br, the other Br would be on the opposite face.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit challenging, but perhaps the product has the two Brs on opposite sides, leading to a specific configuration.

Looking at the options, options A and D are both 1,2-dibromo... with different configurations.

Wait, another approach: when adding Br2 to a double bond, the two Brs add with anti stereochemistry. So, the initial double bond is between C1 and C2. Let's imagine the double bond is in a certain configuration. After addition, the Brs are on opposite sides.

But in this case, the starting material is a cyclopentene. So the two Brs would end up on adjacent carbons but on opposite sides, leading to a trans-dibromide.

So, if the two Brs are on opposite sides, the molecule would have a certain configuration. Now, the starting material's OH is on C1, which is part of the double bond. So, after addition, the OH is still on C1, and the Br is on C1 as well.

Wait, no. Wait, the OH is on C1, and the Br adds to C1 and C2. So, C1 has both OH and Br? That can't be. Wait, no, no. No, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The OH is on C1. So when Br2 adds, C1 gets a Br, and C2 gets a Br.

So, the product would have Br on C1 and Br on C2, with the OH on C1. So the structure would be 1-bromo-2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, but wait, that's 1,2-dibromo.

Now, the configurations at C1 and C2.

Assuming that the addition is trans, the Br on C1 and the Br on C2 would be on opposite sides. But considering the ring's structure, this would lead to a specific diastereomer.

But without knowing the exact starting geometry, it's a bit tricky. However, looking at the options, options A and D are possibilities.

Another possible factor is the ring's chair-like transition state during addition, but in a cyclopentane, it's more puckered. Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to a cis or trans configuration.

Wait, perhaps the initial double bond is in a certain configuration. Let me imagine the cyclopentene with the double bond between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 are OH and two ring bonds. On C2, it's a ring bond and a CH (since it's part of the ring).

When Br2 adds, each Br adds to C1 and C2, with the two Brs on opposite sides.

So, the Br on C1 would be on one face, and the Br on C2 on the opposite face. The OH is on C1, so perhaps the OH is on the same face as one Br, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to the Brs being on adjacent positions but with a certain configuration, leading to either A or D as the product.

But without more information, perhaps I should consider the possibility of the product being a vicinal dibromide with specific stereochemistry, and thus the correct option is either A or D.

Wait, but how to decide between R and S configurations?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't result in a vicinal dibromide but instead forms a bromohydrin. Wait, but that's when one Br and one OH are added across the double bond. But in this case, the starting material already has an OH group, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the OH group is involved in some way, leading to a different product. For example, maybe the OH group is oxidized, but bromine isn't typically an oxidizing agent for that. Alternatively, maybe the OH is a good leaving group, but I don't think Br2 would substitute in that way.

So, going back, the most likely product is a 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol with a specific configuration.

Now, looking at the options, options A and D have this structure. The difference is the configuration at C1 and C2: A is (1R,2S), D is (1R,2R).

Wait, perhaps the addition of Br2 leads to the Brs being added in a way that their configurations are opposite. For example, if the Br on C1 is R, the Br on C2 would be S, or vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to both Brs being R configuration, but that would require a certain transition state.

But without knowing the exact starting geometry, perhaps the correct answer is either A or D.

Wait, another thought: in the addition of Br2 to an asymmetric double bond, the resulting dibromide can have two possible configurations: either erythro or threo. Erythro would have the same configuration on both carbons, while threo has opposite.

Wait, but in a cyclic system, perhaps the addition leads to a specific diastereomer.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a certain configuration. Let me imagine the double bond between C1 and C2. The OH is on C1, and the two methyl groups are on C4. So, the substituents on C1 are OH, C2 (double bond), and C5. On C2, substituents are C1 (double bond), C3, and perhaps a hydrogen.

When Br2 adds, the Brs would add on opposite sides. So, if the OH is on the same face as C5, then the Br on C1 would be on the opposite face, and the Br on C2 would be on the same face as the OH.

But I'm not entirely certain about that. Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to the Brs being on the same face, but that would be more like a cis addition, which is not typical for Br2.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the chair conformation in a cyclopentane, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a trans-dibromide, leading to a specific configuration.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the correct answer is option B or C, which are ketones with bromine.

Wait, wait, that's another possibility. Maybe the reaction isn't an addition but a substitution or oxidation. If the starting material is an enol, perhaps the reaction involves the oxidation of the enol to a ketone and bromination.

Wait, enols can be oxidized to ketones. For example, ozonolysis would break the double bond and form carbonyl groups. But in this case, the reagent is Br2, not something that would oxidize the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dihydroxylation, but with Br2, that's not typical. Alternatively, epoxidation, but again, that's not with Br2.

Wait, but perhaps the reaction is a bromination at the alpha position. Enols are alpha to carbonyl groups, so perhaps the Br adds to the alpha carbon.

But wait, the starting material is an enol, not a ketone. So the alpha position would be adjacent to the carbonyl, but in this case, the carbonyl isn't present. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I got the structure wrong. Let me think again: 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So, the enol is a cyclopentene with the OH on C1. So the structure is a five-membered ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, an OH on C1, and two methyl groups on C4.

If the reaction is addition of Br2, the product is 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. So looking at the options, options A and D fit this.

Now, considering the stereochemistry, when Br2 adds to a double bond, it adds in a trans fashion. So the Brs will be on opposite sides of the ring.

But in a cyclopentane ring, the trans addition would lead to a certain configuration. Let's imagine the starting double bond is in a certain geometry. For example, if the OH on C1 is on the same side as the methyl groups on C4, then adding Br to C1 and C2 would result in the Brs being on opposite sides.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture, but the options don't suggest that.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to the Brs being on the same face, leading to a cis-dibromide, but that's not typical for Br2.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Options:

A) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol

B) 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone

C) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone

D) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol

Option B and C are ketones with bromine. So perhaps the starting material is oxidized to a ketone, and then bromination occurs.

Wait, could the reaction be an oxidation of the enol to a ketone, followed by bromination? Let me think: enols are oxidized to ketones, but that typically requires strong oxidizing agents like KMnO4 under acidic conditions. In this case, the reagent is Br2, so I'm not sure that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromination of the ketone formed. But without oxidation, how would that happen?

Wait, another angle: the starting material is an enol, which can tautomerize to a ketone. If the reaction conditions promote that, then the enol would become a ketone. But Br2's reaction with ketones is typically not an issue unless there's an alpha hydrogen.

Wait, but if the enol tautomerizes to a ketone, then under certain conditions, perhaps the reaction could proceed via a different pathway. For example, the ketone could undergo bromination at the alpha position, but that usually requires a good leaving group or some activation.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol form undergoes bromination at the alpha position. But I'm not sure about that either.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves the opening of the enol to form a carbonyl group. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromohydrination, adding Br and OH across the double bond. But the starting material already has an OH, so that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the OH group is deprotonated, making the enol more reactive, and then Br2 adds across the double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to look for the product structures and see which makes sense.

The options for diaddition are A and D. For ketones, B and C.

If the reaction is a simple diaddition, the product is A or D.

But how do I decide between them?

Another thought: when Br2 adds to a double bond, the Brs add in a trans configuration. So, in the product, the Brs would be on opposite sides. So, if C1 has Br and OH on the same face, the Br on C2 would be on the opposite face. That would lead to a certain configuration.

But perhaps it's easier to think about the specific configurations in the options.

Option A: (1R,2S)

Option D: (1R,2R)

So, the configurations are either (R,S) or (R,R).

Wait, perhaps the addition leads to the Brs being on opposite faces, leading to (R,S) configuration if the starting material has a certain configuration.

But without knowing the starting material's configuration, perhaps the answer is either A or D.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's configuration is such that the addition leads to A or D.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't happen as I thought. Maybe the starting material is a bicyclic compound or something else, but I think that's unlikely.

Wait, another approach: the reaction of 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol with bromine could lead to the formation of a bromide at a specific position. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the major outcome. The question is about the major product. If the reaction is addition across the double bond, the product is 1,2-dibromo... as in options A and D. If not, then perhaps a ketone with a Br substitution.

But considering the reagent is Br2, which is more about addition than substitution or oxidation, the major product is likely a dibromide.

So, the answer is either A or D.

But how to decide between A and D?

In enol systems, the addition of Br2 could lead to a specific diastereomer due to the ring's constraints.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's double bond is in a certain configuration, leading to a specific product.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine adds in such a way that the product has the Brs on the same face, leading to a cis-dibromide. But that's not typical for Br2.

Wait, another thought: in a small ring like cyclopentane, the addition of Br2 may lead to a trans-dibromide because of the ring's strain. So, the Brs would be on opposite sides, leading to a trans configuration.

So, if the Brs are on opposite sides, the product would have the Brs in a trans configuration, leading to a specific stereochemistry.

In that case, the configurations at C1 and C2 would be opposite (R and S or S and R), but looking at the options, only option A has R and S.

Wait, no. Option A is (1R,2S), and option D is (1R,2R).

So if the addition leads to Brs on opposite sides, then the configurations would be opposite. So, if C1 is R, C2 would be S. So the product would be option A.

Alternatively, if the addition leads to the same configuration, it would be D.

But I'm not entirely certain, but based on the addition of Br2 leading to trans addition, the product would have opposite configurations, making option A the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the same configuration, making option D correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. The addition of Br2 to a double bond leads to the Brs adding on opposite faces, but in a cyclopentane ring, the positions are such that the resulting configurations would be erythro or threo.

Wait, perhaps the product is a trans-dibromide, which would correspond to threo diastereomer. Threo has opposite configurations, erythro has same.

So, if the product is threo, then the configurations are R and S, which is option A.

So, putting it all together, the major product is (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, which is option A.


The reaction involves 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine (Br₂). The starting material is an enol, which is a cyclic compound with a hydroxyl group (-OH) on carbon 1 (C1) and a double bond between C1 and C2. Additionally, there are two methyl groups on C4. The reaction with Br₂ typically results in the addition of bromine across the double bond, forming a vicinal dibromide.

When Br₂ adds to a double bond, it does so in a stereospecific manner, with the bromine atoms adding to opposite sides of the double bond (anti addition). This leads to a trans-dibromide product. In the case of the cyclic enol, the addition of Br₂ across the double bond between C1 and C2 results in a 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. The stereochemistry of the product depends on the relative configurations of the bromine atoms after addition.

Considering the options:

- **Option A**: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol  
- **Option D**: (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol  

The stereochemistry of the product is determined by the anti addition of Br₂. Since the bromine atoms add to opposite sides of the double bond, the resulting configurations at C1 and C2 are opposite (R and S). This corresponds to **Option A**. 

Options B and C, which involve ketones with bromine, are unlikely because the reaction conditions (Br₂) favor addition across the double bond rather than oxidation or substitution.

Thus, the major product of the reaction is (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.
