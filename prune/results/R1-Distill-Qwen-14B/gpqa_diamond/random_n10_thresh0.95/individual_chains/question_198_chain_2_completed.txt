Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see what I can remember.

The question says that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, what's a stability constant again? Oh right, it's a measure of the stability of a complex. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. The β for each complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation of that complex from the ions.

The complexes would be Co(SCN)n^2-n, where n is the number of SCN- ligands. So n can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. The problem mentions the "blue dithiocyanato" complexes. Dithiocyanato probably means two SCN ligands. So we're looking for the percentage of Co(SCN)2^0 (assuming charge balance) in the solution.

Wait, but how do the charges work? Co^2+ with two SCN^- would be Co(SCN)_2^0: charge 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. So that's the neutral complex.

But wait, I also need to remember that each β is the formation constant for the nth complex from the (n-1)th. Like, β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+ from Co^2+ and SCN^-.

Wait, actually, the formation of each complex is a stepwise process. The overall β for the complex with n ligands is the product of β1*β2*…*βn. Or wait, no, each β represents the step from the (n-1)th to the nth complex. For example:

Co^2+ + SCN^- <-> Co(SCN)^+ (β1=9)
Co(SCN)^+ + SCN^- <-> Co(SCN)_2 (β2=40)
Co(SCN)_2 + SCN^- <-> Co(SCN)_3^- (β3=63)
Co(SCN)_3^- + SCN^- <-> Co(SCN)_4^2- (β4=16)

Wait, no, I think the β's are for the overall formation. Or are they stepwise? I should clarify.

Wait, in the problem statement, the stability constants are given as β1, β2, β3, β4. So I think that refers to the stepwise formation constants. So β1 is the first step, β2 the second, etc.

So the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_n would be the product of β1 to βn. For example:

For Co(SCN)_1^+ (n=1), the formation constant is β1 =9.

For Co(SCN)_2 (n=2), the formation constant would be β1 * β2 =9*40=360.

Similarly, for Co(SCN)_3^-, it's β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=22680.

And for Co(SCN)_4^2-, it's 9*40*63*16= which is 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16= 362880.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, sometimes the overall formation constant K for the complex is given, not the stepwise. But in this problem, it says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So which is it? The way it's phrased, each β is for each complex. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps each βn is the formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So, for example, β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, but that can't be, because the formation constants are different. Because the β values are 9,40,63,16. So perhaps each β is for the nth step. So the overall K for the n-th complex is product of β1 to βn.

Alternatively, another approach: the distribution of the various complexes depends on their formation constants. The higher K (or β) complexes will dominate, but all contribute.

But the key is to calculate the fraction of Co in each complex and then find the percentage of the dithiocyanato (n=2) complex.

So let's model this. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the species: [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)^+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-] = c(Co) =1e-2 M.

But wait, the problem gives [SCN^-] as 0.1 M, which is relatively high. So the tendency would be to form higher complexes.

But since the β values vary, it's not clear which is the most stable. Let's compute the overall K for each complex.

Wait, but I think that each β is the stepwise formation constant. So to form the first complex (n=1), K1=β1=9.

To form the second (n=2), K2=β1*β2=9*40=360.

K3=9*40*63=22680.

K4=9*40*63*16=362880.

So each subsequent complex has a higher K, which means they are more stable.

Wait, but wait a second. K4 is 362,880, which is much larger than K3, K2, etc. So the highest complex, [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, would be the most stable.

But wait, let me think about the actual problem. The question is about dithiocyanato complexes, which is n=2. So [Co(SCN)_2].

So I need to compute the fraction of Co that is in the [Co(SCN)_2] form.

Let me think about how to model the distribution. The general approach for such equilibria is to express each species in terms of the free Co^2+ and the ligand (SCN^-) concentration.

Each species can be represented as:

[Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) = K_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n

Where K_n is the formation constant for the nth complex.

So the total concentration of all Co species is the sum of each species:

Total Co = [Co^2+] + K1 [Co^2+][SCN^-] + K2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + K3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + K4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4

So,

Total = [Co^2+](1 + K1 [SCN^-] + K2 [SCN^-]^2 + K3 [SCN^-]^3 + K4 [SCN^-]^4 )

We can factor [Co^2+] out.

So,

[Co^2+] = Total / (1 + K1 [SCN^-] + K2 [SCN^-]^2 + K3 [SCN^-]^3 + K4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Once we have [Co^2+], we can compute the concentration of each complex.

Wait, but each K is the product up to that β. So K1=β1=9, K2=β1β2=360, K3=β1β2β3=22680, K4=β1β2β3β4=362880.

So let's compute each term:

Compute each term: Co^2+ term, and each K_i multiplied by [SCN^-]^i.

[SCN^-] is given as 0.1 M.

Compute each term:

Term 0: 1

Term 1: K1 * [SCN]^1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term 2: K2 * [SCN]^2 = 360 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6

Term 3: K3 * [SCN]^3 = 22680 * (0.1)^3 = 22680 * 0.001= 22.68

Term4: K4 * [SCN]^4 = 362880 * (0.1)^4 = 362880 * 0.0001=36.288

Wait, let me compute each step.

SCN is 0.1 M.

Term1: 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term2: 360 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6

Term3: 22680 * (0.1)^3 = 22680 * 0.001 = 22.68

Term4: 362880 * (0.1)^4 = 362880 * 0.0001=36.288

So the denominator becomes:

1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 + 36.288

Let me sum these:

1 +0.9=1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468

So denominator is 64.468.

Total Co is 1e-2 M.

So [Co^2+] = 1e-2 / 64.468 ≈ 1.551e-4 M.

Now, the concentration of each complex is K_i [Co^2+] [SCN]^i.

Wait, but the [Co(SCN)_n] = K_n [Co^2+] [SCN]^n.

Wait, no. Wait, the way I wrote earlier, [Co(SCN)_n] = K_n [Co^2+] [SCN]^n.

So each [Co(SCN)_n] can be computed as K_n * [Co^2+] [SCN]^n.

But wait, remember that [Co^2+] is the free ion, so once [Co^2+] is known, each complex can be found.

So, for the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2, [Co(SCN)_2] = K2 [Co^2+] [SCN]^2.

But wait, K2 is 360, [Co^2+] is 1.551e-4, [SCN]^2 is (0.1)^2=0.01.

So [Co(SCN)_2] = 360 * 1.551e-4 * 0.01.

Let me compute that:

360 * 1.551e-4 = approx 360 * 0.0001551 = 0.055836.

Then multiply by 0.01: 0.055836 * 0.01=5.5836e-4.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

360 * 1.551e-4 = (360 * 1.551) *1e-4.

360 *1.551: 360 * 1.5 is 540, 360 *0.051 is 18.36. So 540 +18.36 = 558.36. So 558.36e-4 = 0.055836.

Multiply by 0.01: 0.055836 * 0.01=0.00055836.

So [Co(SCN)_2] = 0.00055836 M.

But wait, the total [Co] is 1e-2 M. So the fraction is [Co(SCN)_2]/Total_Co.

Wait, no. Let me think. The [Co(SCN)_2] is the concentration of that complex. The total Co is 1e-2 M, which is the sum of all [Co species].

So to find the percentage, I need to compute ( [Co(SCN)_2] / Total_Co ) * 100.

Wait, but wait. No. Because [Co(SCN)_2] is the concentration of that species, which is a part of the total. So the fraction is [Co(SCN)_2] divided by Total_Co.

But the [Co(SCN)_2] is 0.00055836 M.

Total_Co is 0.01 M.

So the fraction is 0.00055836 / 0.01 = 0.055836, which is 5.5836%.

Wait, but the options are in the 16-42% range. So that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator calculation. Let me double-check.

Denominator terms:

Term0:1

Term1: 9*0.1=0.9

Term2:360*(0.1)^2=3.6

Term3:22680*(0.1)^3=22.68

Term4:362880*(0.1)^4=36.288

Adding all: 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

Hmm, that's correct.

So [Co^2+] is 1e-2 / 64.468 ≈ 1.551e-4 M.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute each complex's concentration and sum their contributions.

Wait, another approach: each complex's concentration is [Co^2+] multiplied by K_n [SCN]^n.

So for each n, [Co(SCN)_n] = K_n [Co^2+] [SCN]^n.

But since [Co^2+] is known, each [Co(SCN)_n] can be calculated.

So for n=0 (free Co^2+): [Co^2+] = 1.551e-4.

n=1: K1=9, [SCN]=0.1

[Co(SCN)^+] =9 * 1.551e-4 * 0.1 = 9 *1.551e-5 = 1.3959e-4.

n=2: K2=360.

[Co(SCN)_2] =360 *1.551e-4 * (0.1)^2 =360 *1.551e-4 *0.01= same as before, 5.5836e-4.

n=3: K3=22680.

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = 22680 * 1.551e-4 * (0.1)^3 = 22680 * 1.551e-4 * 0.001.

Compute 22680 *1.551e-4: 22680 * 1.551e-4 = 22680 *0.0001551 ≈ 3.516.

Then multiply by (0.1)^3=0.001: 3.516 *0.001= 0.003516.

n=4: K4=362880.

[Co(SCN)_4^2-] =362880 *1.551e-4 * (0.1)^4.

Compute 362880 *1.551e-4 = 362880 *0.0001551 ≈ ?

362880 * 0.0001 =36.288, 362880 *0.0000551= around 362880 *0.00005=18.144, and 362880*0.0000051=1.851.

So 36.288 +18.144=54.432 +1.851=56.283.

Multiply by (0.1)^4=0.0001: 56.283 *0.0001=0.0056283.

Wait, let me do it step by step.

362880 * 1.551e-4 = ?

1.551e-4 = 0.0001551.

362880 * 0.0001551.

Calculate 362880 * 0.0001 =36.288.

362880 * 0.00005 =18.144.

362880 *0.0000051 ≈362880 *0.000005=1.8144, and 362880 *0.0000001=0.036288. So 1.8144 +0.036288=1.850688.

So total is 36.288 +18.144=54.432 +1.850688=56.282688.

Multiply by (0.1)^4=0.0001: 56.282688 *0.0001=0.0056282688.

So [Co(SCN)_4^2-] is approximately 0.005628 M.

Now, let's list all the concentrations:

n=0: 1.551e-4 ≈0.0001551 M.

n=1: 1.3959e-4 ≈0.0001396 M.

n=2:5.5836e-4 ≈0.0005584 M.

n=3:0.003516 M.

n=4:0.005628 M.

Let me sum all these to check if they add up to 0.01 M.

Compute each:

n=0: 0.0001551

n=1:0.0001396

n=2:0.0005584

n=3:0.003516

n=4:0.005628

Sum:

0.0001551 +0.0001396=0.0002947.

+0.0005584=0.0008531.

+0.003516=0.0043691.

+0.005628=0.0099971.

Hmm, that's about 0.009997, which is about 0.01 M. Good, the sum checks out.

So the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2] is 0.0005584 M.

The total Co concentration is 0.01 M.

So the fraction is 0.0005584 / 0.01 = 0.05584, or 5.584%.

But wait, the options are way higher: the choices are 16.9%, 25.6%, 38.1%, 42.3%.

Hmm, that's a problem. So something's wrong with my approach.

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the β values. Maybe each β is the formation constant for the complex with n ligands, rather than being stepwise.

Wait, that would change things. Let's try that approach.

So if β1 is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

In that case, the formation constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, but then the overall K for each complex would be β_n, not the product.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the formation of each complex is a stepwise process. Let me think.

If the problem states that β1 is the stability constant for Co(SCN)^+, β2 for Co(SCN)_2, etc., then the distribution would be calculated using each β as the K for their respective complex.

So each complex [Co(SCN)_n] has a formation constant K_n = βn.

So for n=1, K1=9.

n=2: K2=40.

n=3:63.

n=4:16.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because n=4 would have a lower K than n=3. Which would mean the 4-ligand complex is less stable than the 3-ligand, which seems unlikely. So perhaps this is not the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the β's are given as the overall formation constants, not stepwise.

In that case, the [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+][SCN]^n.

But that would imply that each βn is the overall K for that complex, regardless of the steps. So in that scenario:

[Co(SCN)_1] = β1 [Co][SCN]^1.

[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 [Co][SCN]^2.

And so on.

But that would mean that the order of stability depends on each β. So for example, for n=3, K=63, which is higher than n=2 (40), lower than n=4 (16? No, 16 is lower than 63). Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the convention where βn is the stepwise formation constant. So β1 is the first step (to form [CoSCN]^+), β2 is the second step (to form [CoSCN2], etc.

In that case, the overall K for [CoSCN2] is β1*β2.

Which brings us back to the initial approach, which gives a [CoSCN2] fraction of about 5.5%, but the options don't have that.

So perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, let me recheck the denominator.

Denominator is 1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4.

With K1=9, K2=360, K3=22680, K4=362880.

SCN =0.1.

So:

Term0:1.

Term1:9*0.1=0.9.

Term2:360*(0.1)^2=360*0.01=3.6.

Term3:22680*(0.1)^3=22680*0.001=22.68.

Term4:362880*(0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum of terms: 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So that seems correct.

So [Co^2+] = (1e-2) /64.468 = approx 1.551e-4 M.

Now, compute [Co(SCN)_2] = K2 [Co][SCN]^2.

Which is 360 * (1.551e-4) * (0.1)^2.

Wait, 360*(1.551e-4) is 360 * 0.0001551= approx 0.055836.

Multiply by (0.1)^2=0.01: 0.055836 *0.01=0.00055836.

So [Co(SCN)_2]=0.00055836 M.

Total Co is 0.01 M.

So the fraction is 0.00055836 / 0.01= 0.055836, or 5.58%.

But options are much higher. So I must have made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps I have the [SCN^-] wrong. Wait, the problem says [SCN-] is 0.1 M. I used 0.1 M correctly.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps the question asks for the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2, but maybe it's [Co(NCS)_2]^+? Or another charge state?

Wait, the problem mentions "dithiocyanato" which implies two SCN ligands. So [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

Wait, but according to the calculation, it's about 5.5% which isn't in the options.

So perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the way the stability constants are used. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants given are for each complex, not the stepwise. So each βn is K for the nth complex, not the stepwise.

So for n=1, K=β1=9.

n=2, K=β2=40.

n=3, K=β3=63.

n=4, K=β4=16.

Wait, but then that would imply that the 4th complex is less stable than the third, which might not make sense, but let's proceed.

In that case, the calculation for each [Co(SCN)_n] is K_n [Co^2+] [SCN]^n.

So [Co(SCN)_1] =9 [Co][SCN]^1.

[Co(SCN)_2]=40 [Co][SCN]^2.

[Co(SCN)_3]=63 [Co][SCN]^3.

[Co(SCN)_4]=16 [Co][SCN]^4.

So denominator becomes:

1 + 9*(0.1) +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4.

Compute each term:

1:1

9*0.1=0.9

40*(0.01)=0.4

63*(0.001)=0.063.

16*(0.0001)=0.0016.

Sum: 1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646.

[Co^2+] = 1e-2 /2.3646 ≈4.227e-3 M.

Now, compute each [Co(SCN)_n]:

[Co(SCN)_2]=40 * [Co^2+] * (0.1)^2.

[Co^2+] is 0.004227 M.

So 40 *0.004227 *0.01.

Compute 40 *0.004227=0.16908.

Multiply by 0.01:0.0016908 M.

So [Co(SCN)_2]=0.0016908 M.

Total Co is 0.01 M.

Fraction is 0.0016908 / 0.01 = 0.16908, which is 16.908%.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%.

So that would be the answer.

Wait, but why did this approach give a different result? Because the initial assumption about the β being stepwise or overall K was incorrect.

Ah, so the key was to realize that βn are the formation constants for each complex, not the stepwise. So each βn is K_n for the complex [Co(SCN)_n].

So in this scenario, the denominator is much smaller because the individual K's are lower. So this leads to a higher concentration of the dithiocyanate complex.

So the correct fraction is 16.9%, which is option D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the given stability constants (β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16) and the equilibrium concentrations of the species involved.

### Key Assumptions and Approach:
1. **Stability Constants as Overall Formation Constants**: The problem specifies that β₁, β₂, β₃, and β₄ are the stability constants for the complexes [Co(SCN)], [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃], and [Co(SCN)₄], respectively. These are treated as overall formation constants, not stepwise formation constants.

2. **Equilibrium Expression**: The total cobalt concentration is distributed among all species:
   \[
   [\text{Co}]_{\text{total}} = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{Co(SCN)}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_2] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_3^-] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_4^{2-}]
   \]
   Each complex can be expressed as:
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_n] = \beta_n [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^n
   \]

3. **Denominator Calculation**: The denominator in the equilibrium expression is:
   \[
   1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4
   \]
   Substituting β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16, and [\text{SCN}^-]=0.1 M:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   \text{Term}_0 &= 1, \\
   \text{Term}_1 &= \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9, \\
   \text{Term}_2 &= \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4, \\
   \text{Term}_3 &= \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063, \\
   \text{Term}_4 &= \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016.
   \end{align*}
   \]
   Summing these terms:
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

4. **Free [\text{Co}^{2+}]**: Using the total cobalt concentration, [\text{Co}]_{\text{total}} = 10^{-2} M:
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] = \frac{[\text{Co}]_{\text{total}}}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 4.227 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
   \]

5. **Concentration of [Co(SCN)₂]**: Using the expression for [Co(SCN)₂]:
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_2] = \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (4.227 \times 10^{-3}) \cdot (0.1)^2
   \]
   Compute step-by-step:
   \[
   \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] = 40 \cdot 4.227 \times 10^{-3} = 0.16908, \quad [\text{Co(SCN)}_2] = 0.16908 \cdot 0.01 = 0.0016908 \, \text{M}.
   \]

6. **Percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]**: The percentage of [Co(SCN)₂] in the total cobalt species is:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_2]}{[\text{Co}]_{\text{total}}} \right) \cdot 100 = \left( \frac{0.0016908}{0.01} \right) \cdot 100 \approx 16.9\%.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]) among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.
