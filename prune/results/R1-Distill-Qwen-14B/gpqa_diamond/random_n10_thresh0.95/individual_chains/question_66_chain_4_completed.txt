Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, what do I remember about SMEFT? I think it's an effective theory that describes the Standard Model particles with higher-dimensional operators, right? These operators are classified based on certain symmetries.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these four.

Wait, I remember that effective theories usually try to respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory. The Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, right? So SMEFT should also respect Lorentz symmetry. That means option 1 must be correct.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. I think in SMEFT, the operators are classified by their Lorentz structures, and they should also be local, so I guess Poincare symmetry is respected as well. So options 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, what about CP and CPT? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I remember that the Standard Model is CPT symmetric, but does SMEFT require all operators to preserve CP? Or can they violate it? Wait, SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimension operators that are consistent with the Standard Model symmetries. So the SMEFT includes both CP-conserving and CP-violating operators, depending on the basis you choose. So the operators don't all have to respect CP symmetry; it's not a must. So option 3 isn't a required symmetry for all operators.

What about CPT? The Standard Model is CPT symmetric, and I think effective theories should also respect CPT. Because CPT is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. If the underlying theory is CPT, then the effective theory should include operators that are also CPT invariant. So option 4 must be respected.

Putting it all together. The symmetries that all operators must respect are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the correct options are 1, 2, and 4. Looking at the options, option C says 1,2,4. So the answer should be C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an effective theory that describes the Standard Model particles using higher-dimensional operators. These operators are classified based on the symmetries they respect. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry because it is derived from the Standard Model, which also respects Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT is a local effective theory, it respects Poincaré symmetry as well.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model is not necessarily CP-symmetric, and SMEFT includes both CP-conserving and CP-violating operators depending on the basis. Thus, CP symmetry is not a symmetry that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The Standard Model is CPT-symmetric, and SMEFT, as an effective theory, must respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct option is **C) 1,2,4**.

Answer: C
