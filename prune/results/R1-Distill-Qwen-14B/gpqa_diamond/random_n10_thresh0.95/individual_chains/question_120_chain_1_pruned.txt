Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think.

So, parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that the distance d in parsecs is the reciprocal of the parallax plx, so d = 1/plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Now the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Wait, I think this has to do with the distribution of stars in space. Remember that the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume itself. Oh right, the volume of a sphere increases with the cube of the radius. So, if you consider a spherical shell at a distance d with thickness dd, the volume would be something like 4πd² dd, right?

But the question is about how the number of stars per unit parallax changes. So, I need to relate the number of stars to the parallax. Since d = 1/plx, as plx increases, d decreases. So, the number of stars within a certain range of parallax would depend on the number of stars in that corresponding range of distance.

Wait, let me break it down. The number of stars in a volume element is proportional to the volume. So, the number of stars per unit distance (d) would be proportional to d squared, because the volume element is 4πd² dd. But wait, we're dealing with parallax here, not distance.

So, since d = 1/plx, let's substitute that into the expression. The number of stars per unit distance is proportional to (1/plx)^2. But we need the number per unit parallax. Hmm, so perhaps I should express the volume in terms of plx.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look at the number of stars in a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx. The corresponding distance ranges would be d = 1/plx and d + dd = 1/(plx + dplx). Wait, that might get complicated. Alternatively, since d = 1/plx, then dd = -d² dplx (wait, taking derivative? Let me think: d = 1/plx → dd/dplx = -1/(plx²). So, dd = -(1/plx²) dplx.)

The volume of the shell is 4π d² dd. Substituting d = 1/plx and dd = -(1/plx²) dplx, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, but we're interested in the number of stars per unit parallax. So, the number of stars N in the shell would be proportional to the volume, which is proportional to (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx? Wait, that would be (1/plx^4) dplx. But that can't be right because the number of stars in each shell at larger plx (smaller d) would be fewer, which makes sense, but the exponent here is 4, which isn't one of the options.

Wait, maybe I messed up the approach. Let's think differently. Maybe the number density of stars in space is uniform. So, for a given volume, the number of stars is proportional to the volume. The volume between d and d + dd is 4π d² dd. So, the number of stars per unit distance (d) is proportional to d².

But since d = 1/plx, substituting: number of stars per unit d is proportional to (1/plx)^2. Now, but what is the number of stars per unit parallax? Hmm. So, if you have a change in plx, dplx, corresponding to a change in d, dd. From earlier, dd = -d² dplx.

So, the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is N = (number density) * volume = (n) * 4π d² dd.

But number per unit plx would be N / dplx. Wait, no: the question is how the number per unit plx range (like per dplx) changes with plx. So, the number per unit plx is N per dplx. So, N per dplx = n * 4π d² dd / dplx.

But dd = -d² dplx, so substituting, N per dplx = n * 4π d² * (-d² dplx) ) / dplx → n * 4π d^4 * (-1). Wait, that can't be right. The negative sign just indicates direction, but we're dealing with magnitudes here.

Wait, maybe I should express it in terms of plx directly. Let me try again.

The number of stars in a shell between d and d + dd is N = n * 4π d² dd. But dd is the change in d, which is related to the change in plx, dplx. Since d =1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting, N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/(plx^2)) dplx.

So, N = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit plx. That would be N per dplx, so N/(dplx) = 4π n (1/plx^4).

So the number of stars per unit plx range is proportional to 1/(plx^4). Hmm, but that's option A. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer was something else.

Wait, let me think of another way. The number of stars in a volume element is proportional to the volume, which is proportional to d² dd. But since d = 1/plx, so dd = -d² dplx. So, the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is proportional to (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/(plx)^2 dplx) ), which gives proportional to 1/plx^4 dplx.

So, the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So, the answer would be option A.

But wait, I thought earlier
