Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Oh wait, but when they measure the position, all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So none are found outside that range.

The question is asking for the value of 'a'. The options are A to D.

Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalizable. That means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Because the probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 100%.

So the wave function is given as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but that doesn't look quite right. Because wave functions are usually complex, but I think the real part and the imaginary part are added, not subtracted. Or wait, maybe it's a complex function, with real and imaginary components. So ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - i*(0.5). So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. 

But wait, that would make ψ an odd function if the imaginary part is a constant. But when you take the absolute square, the real and imaginary parts are multiplied by their conjugates. Let me think: |ψ(x)|² = [Re(ψ)]² + [Im(ψ)]². Because when you compute ψ times its complex conjugate, the cross terms (which are 2*Re(ψ)*Im(ψ)) might not average out, but for normalization, we're integrating the square of the absolute value.

Wait, but in this case, the wave function has a real part that depends on x and an imaginary part that is a constant. So |ψ(x)|² would be [a²/(1 + x)] + (0.5)^2. Because [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 is a²/(1+x), and [0.5]^2 is 0.25. So the total probability density is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the wave function must be square-integrable. Because the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx must be 1. Or is that correct?

Wait, but I think I might be making a mistake here. Let me re-express ψ(x). So ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + (-i * 0.5). So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5.

So when you compute |ψ|², it's (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2, because the imaginary part's square is (0.5)^2. Oh, and because the cross terms (2 * real * imaginary) would be 2*(a/sqrt(1+x))*(-0.5i), but when you multiply by the conjugate, the cross terms become 2*(a/sqrt(1+x))*(-0.5i) * (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the cross terms (from Re*Im and Im*Re) would be 2*Re(ψ)*Im(ψ) times i. But since we're integrating the absolute square, which is a real positive function, the cross terms would involve the product of real and imaginary parts, but when you integrate, those terms might not necessarily vanish. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, let me double-check. The absolute square is ψ*(x) * ψ(x), where ψ*(x) is the complex conjugate. So ψ*(x) = a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i. So when we multiply ψ* by ψ, we get:

(a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (a/sqrt(1+x))*0.5i + 0.5i*(a/sqrt(1+x)) + (0.5i)^2.

Simplify each term:

First term: a²/(1+x)
Second term: 0.5a i / sqrt(1+x)
Third term: 0.5a i / sqrt(1+x)
Fourth term: (0.5i)^2 = 0.25 * i² = 0.25*(-1) = -0.25.

So adding all together:

a²/(1+x) + (0.5a i / sqrt(1+x) + 0.5a i / sqrt(1+x)) ) + (-0.25)

The middle terms add up to (a i * 0.5 / sqrt(1+x) ) + same again, so total  a i * 0.5 *2 / sqrt(1+x) = a i *1 / sqrt(1+x).

Wait, but when we square the wave function, the result should be a real function, because probability is real. Wait, but that cross term is imaginary. So does that mean that |ψ|² is not real? That can't be right. Because the absolute square must be real and positive.

Ah, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the wave function. The given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So perhaps it's a real function plus an imaginary constant. Or wait, perhaps the wave function should be normalized as a real function plus an imaginary function. But the absolute square would have to be real.

Wait a minute, I might be getting confused here. Let me think again. The wave function is ψ(x) = real part + imaginary part. The absolute square is ψ* ψ, which would be (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2 plus some cross terms. But for the absolute square to be real, the cross terms must be imaginary, and when you integrate, perhaps their integral would be zero? Or maybe not, because the cross terms are functions of x.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross terms would have to be zero for the wave function to be real, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the given wave function is not correctly written. Because usually, wave functions can be written as real functions multiplied by e^{iθ}, but in this case, it's given as a sum of a real function and a constant imaginary term. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i). But that's not what the question says. It says (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the normalization condition. The integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. Because the particle is found only between 1 and 3, the wave function is zero outside this region. So let's compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² from 1 to 3.

But wait, earlier I thought that |ψ(x)|² would be [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25. But wait, earlier calculation suggested that |ψ(x)|² = (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25 + (a i / sqrt(1+x)). Hmm, that can't be right because that would have an imaginary component, which can't be correct for a probability density. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the absolute square.

Wait, maybe I should just compute ψ*(x) multiplied by ψ(x). Let me do that again.

ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i
ψ*(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i

Multiplying them:

ψ*(x) * ψ(x) = [a/sqrt(1+x)]^2 + (a/sqrt(1+x))*0.5i + (a/sqrt(1+x))*(-0.5i) + ( -0.5i )*(0.5i )

Wait, let's compute each term:

First term: (a^2)/(1+x)

Second term: (a/sqrt(1+x)) * 0.5i

Third term: (a/sqrt(1+x)) * (-0.5i)

Fourth term: (-0.5i) * (0.5i) = (-0.25) * (i^2) = (-0.25)(-1) = 0.25

Now, adding all together:

First term: a²/(1+x)
Second and third terms: 0.5a i / sqrt(1+x) - 0.5a i / sqrt(1+x) = 0. So those cancel out.
Fourth term: 0.25

So |ψ(x)|² is a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Ah, that's better. So the cross terms canceled out. So the absolute square is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Now, the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

So let's compute this integral.

Integral of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx from 1 to 3.

We can split this into two integrals:

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 + Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3.

First integral: a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x).

Evaluated from 1 to3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So first integral is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So equation:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1

Subtract 0.5 from both sides:

a² * ln(2) = 0.5

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2)

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Take square root: a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close.

So the answer should be option B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

and the probability density is the absolute square of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Since the particle is confined to the region \( x \in [1, 3] \), the normalization condition is:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This can be split into two separate integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + 0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 1.
\]

1. **First integral**:  
The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
\]

Thus, the first term becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2).
\]

2. **Second integral**:  
The integral of \( 0.25 \) over \( [1, 3] \) is:

\[
0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 (3 - 1) = 0.5.
\]

Combining both terms, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Simplify:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

The closest option to this value is **0.85**, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
