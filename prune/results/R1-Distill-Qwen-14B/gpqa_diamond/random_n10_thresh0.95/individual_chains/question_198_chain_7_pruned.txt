Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So the question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and SCN- is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, dithiocyanato would be [Co(SCN)_2] or something? I think the blue one is the [Co(SCN)_2]^3+ complex. Oh wait, I'm not sure. But the problem mentions dithiocyanato, so maybe it's the [Co(SCN)_2]^n+ complex. Let me think, the stability constants are for different complexes.

Stability constants, right. The beta value is the formation constant for each complex. So the higher the beta, the more stable the complex. So for each complex, the higher the beta, the more it will form.

The problem is about finding the percentage of a particular complex (the blue one). I think the blue one is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex, which is the second one? Or wait, maybe the fourth one? Hmm, not sure about the exact number of SCN- ligands. Alternatively, maybe the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^3- or something else. Wait, wait. Let me think about the possible complexes.

The stability constants are given for β1, β2, β3, β4. I think each β corresponds to the complex with that number of thiocyanate ions. For example, β1 is CoSCN^+, β2 is Co(SCN)_2^(?), and so on. So the complexes would be:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n+? )

Wait, maybe the charge is 2+ plus n times -1, so overall charge is 2−n. Hmm, but the actual charge of each complex isn't given, but the stability constants are. So for each step, βn is the formation constant for the nth complex.

But maybe I don't need to get into the charge details because the problem is about the distribution of the species based on the stability constants.

The approach here is to calculate the fraction of each complex in the solution, and then sum them up and find the percentage for the blue one.

Wait, but which complex is the blue one? I'm a bit confused. Let me see. I remember that [Co(SCN)_4]^3− is a blue complex. So that's the fourth complex, which would correspond to β4. Oh wait, but β4 is 16, which is lower than β3 which is 63. So that's interesting because higher beta is more stable, but the blue complex has lower beta? Hmm, but maybe I should just proceed with the calculations, and see what comes out. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the number of SCN- ions. Let me clarify.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^+, which is the second complex, with β2=40. Wait, but if β3 is 63, then that's a higher value, so the third complex would be more stable than the second. But regardless, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think refers to the [Co(SCN)_2]^(something) complex.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me proceed to the calculations and see.

The general approach for this type of problem is to use the stability constants to find the fraction of each complex. The total concentration of Co is the sum of all the species present: Co^2+, [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^(?), [Co(SCN)_3]^(?), [Co(SCN)_4]^(?), etc., depending on the number of complexes considered.

But in this problem, the stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So four complexes. So the species are:

1. Co^2+ (free ion)
2. Co(SCN)^+ (n=1)
3. Co(SCN)_2^? (n=2)
4. Co(SCN)_3^? (n=3)
5. Co(SCN)_4^? (n=4)

Wait, but wait, the stability constants are for each step. So the formation constants are β1 for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc.

Alternatively, the overall stability constant for each complex is the product of the stepwise βs. But wait, no. Wait, each βn is the stepwise formation constant for the nth ligand. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+ → Co^2+ + SCN^-; β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^(charge) → [Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN^-; and so on.

Wait, but the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n] would be the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn. So for [Co(SCN)_2]^+, the overall K would be β1 * β2.

Wait, no. Let me think. The formation of [Co(SCN)_n] can be considered as a stepwise process. The first step is Co^2+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)]^+, with K=β1=9. The second step is [Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2]^0, with K=β2=40. So the overall K for [Co(SCN)_2] is β1 * β2 = 9*40=360.

Similarly, the third complex [Co(SCN)_3]^- would have K=β1*β2*β3 = 9*40*63=22680. And the fourth [Co(SCN)_4]^2- would have K=β1*β2*β3*β4= 9*40*63*16=362880.

Wait, but in the solution, the total concentration of Co is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. So the concentration is 0.1 M, which is quite high, so the ligand is in excess. Therefore, the complexes with higher n will tend to form more, because the ligand is abundant.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Let me think about the distribution.

The distribution of the species can be found using the formation constants and the concentrations of the ligand. The fraction of each species is given by the product of the stepwise βs and the ligand concentrations raised to the appropriate power, divided by the sum of all such terms plus the free Co^2+.

Wait, but when the ligand is in excess, the higher complexes will dominate.

But in this problem, [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, and the Co concentration is 1e-2 M. So the ligand is 0.1 / 0.01 = 10 times more concentrated. Hmm, that's not super high, but maybe enough that higher complexes form.

But perhaps I should model each possible complex and find their fractions.

The general approach is to calculate the fraction f_n of each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(charge), where n=0,1,2,3,4. But wait, n=0 is Co^2+.

The fraction f_n is given by:

f_n = (K_n * [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + sum_{k=1}^4 (K_k * [SCN^-]^k) )

where K_n is the overall stability constant for the nth complex, which is the product of β1 to βn.

Wait, no. Let me think. The general formula for the distribution is:

f_0 = 1 / (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 (β1*β2*...*βn * [SCN^-]^n) )

f_1 = (β1 [SCN^-]) / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + ... + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Similarly, f_2 = (β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 ) / denominator,

and so on.

So the denominator D is 1 + β1 [S] + β1 β2 [S]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4.

Wait, but wait, in this approach, each f_n is the fraction of the nth complex. Because the formation is stepwise, each β adds a layer.

Wait, but let me confirm: for the first complex, it's Co^2+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+, K = β1 =9.

The second complex is [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2]^0, K=β2=40. So the overall K for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is β1 * β2 = 360.

Third complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_3]^-; K=β3=63. So overall K for [Co(SCN)_3]^- is 9*40*63=22680.

Fourth complex: [Co(SCN)_3]^- + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_4]^2-; K=β4=16. So overall K is 9*40*63*16=362880.

So the denominator D is 1 + (β1 [S]) + (β1 β2 [S]^2) + (β1 β2 β3 [S]^3) + (β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4 )

But wait, no. Because the step-wise approach, each β adds another layer. So the terms in the denominator for each species are:

- For Co^2+ (n=0): 1
- For [CoSCN]^+ (n=1): β1 [S]
- For [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (n=2): β1 β2 [S]^2
- For [Co(SCN)_3]^- (n=3): β1 β2 β3 [S]^3
- For [Co(SCN)_4]^2- (n=4): β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4

So each term is (product of β1 to βn) multiplied by [S]^n.

So D = 1 + β1 [S] + β1 β2 [S]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4

Given that [S] is 0.1 M.

So let's compute each term.

Compute each term:

Term 0: 1.

Term 1: β1 [S] =9 * 0.1 =0.9.

Term2: β1*β2 [S]^2 =9 *40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 =3.6.

Term3: β1*β2*β3 [S]^3 =9*40*63 * (0.1)^3 = 22680 * 0.001=22.68.

Term4: β1*β2*β3*β4 [S]^4 =9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4 = 362880 * 1e-4 = 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

Wait, 9 *40=360; 360 *63=22680; 22680 *16=362880. Then times (0.1)^4= 0.0001. 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

So the terms are:

Term0:1,

Term1: 0.9,

Term2:3.6,

Term3:22.68,

Term4:36.288.

Now, sum all these terms to get D.

Sum =1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So D=64.468.

Now, the fraction of each species is term_n / D.

So the fraction for each species:

f0 = 1 / D = 1 /64.468 ≈0.01551 (≈1.55%).

f1 = 0.9 /64.468 ≈0.01396 (≈1.396%).

f2=3.6 /64.468≈0.05556 (≈5.556%).

f3=22.68 /64.468≈0.3518 (≈35.18%).

f4=36.288/64.468≈0.5629 (≈56.29%).

Wait, but wait, let's do the exact calculations.

D=64.468.

f0=1/64.468≈0.01551, so 1.551%.

f1=0.9/64.468=0.01396, 1.396%.

f2=3.6/64.468 ≈0.05556, 5.556%.

f3=22.68 /64.468 ≈0.3517, 35.17%.

f4=36.288 /64.468 ≈0.5629, 56.29%.

Wait, but adding all these fractions: 1.55 +1.4 +5.56 +35.17 +56.29 ≈ 100% (since 1.55+1.4=2.95; +5.56=8.51; +35.17=43.68; +56.29=99.97, which is roughly 100% when considering rounding errors. So that's correct.

But the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. So, I need to find which complex is the blue one.

I think the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-. Because I remember that the tetrahedral thiocyanate complexes with Co(II) are blue. Alternatively, it's [Co(SCN)_4]^3-.

Wait, but [Co(SCN)_4]^3- would have a charge of 3- since Co is Co^2+ and four SCN^- contribute 4*(-1) = -4. So 2+ -4 = -2? No, wait, 2+ +4*(-1) = -2. So [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

So the fourth complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

So the fraction of the fourth complex is approximately 56.29%. But the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, dithiocyanato means two SCN- ligands. So the [Co(SCN)2] complex, which is the second term, f2 is 5.556%.

Wait, but wait, the problem states "the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." Dithiocyanato implies two SCN- ligands. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. Which is the second complex, with fraction f2=5.556%.

But wait, looking at the options, the closest is option D) 16.9%, which is nowhere near 5.5%. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, in the denominator D, are we including all possible complexes, including higher order ones? Yes, because the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 M, and the total Co is 0.01 M.

Wait, but in the denominator, I'm adding all terms, including higher order complexes. So the calculation seems correct.

But wait, according to the fractions, the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is 56%, and the [Co(SCN)_2] is about 5.5%, which is the second complex. Then, the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, which is the fourth complex, f4=56.29%.

But the options given are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%. None of these match 56%.

Hmm, that suggests I might have made a mistake in which complex has the blue color. Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is the third one, [Co(SCN)_3]^-, which has a fraction of 35.17%.

Wait no, that would be the third complex. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ complex (n=1), but that fraction is about 1.4%. Hmm, no.

Wait, perhaps I got the stability constants wrong. The problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, that's a bit confusing because β4 is lower than β3. So the fourth complex is less stable than the third? That seems odd. So perhaps the formation of the third complex is more favored than the fourth.

But that's okay. Let's proceed.

Wait, perhaps the blue complex is the third one, [Co(SCN)_3]^-. Because sometimes, [Co(SCN)_3]^− is a blue complex. So if that's the case, f3 is 35.17%, which is about 35%, but the options don't have 35%.

Wait, looking at the options: A)42.3%, C)38.1% are close. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the denominator D. Let me re-calculate each term step by step.

[S] = 0.1 M.

Compute each term:

Term1: β1 [S] =9 *0.1=0.9.

Term2: β1 β2 [S]^2 = 9*40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 =3.6.

Term3: β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 =9*40*63*(0.1)^3.

9*40=360; 360*63=22680.

(0.1)^3=0.001.

22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4 =9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4.

9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16=362880.

(0.1)^4=0.0001.

362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So terms are:

Term0: 1.

Term1: 0.9.

Term2:3.6.

Term3:22.68.

Term4:36.288.

Sum D=1 +0.9=1.9 +3.6=5.5 +22.68=28.18 +36.288=64.468.

Yes, that's correct.

So the fractions are:

f0 ≈ 1.55%

f1 ≈1.4%

f2≈5.56%

f3≈35.17%

f4≈56.29%.

So the highest is the fourth complex, which is 56%. But the options don't have that.

Wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato is two SCN- ligands. So that would be the second complex [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which has fraction 5.56%. But that's not one of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about which complex is the blue one. Maybe the blue complex is the [Co(SCN)_3]^−, which has a higher fraction, 35.17%. But none of the options match that either. The closest is option C) 38.1%.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the sum of the first and second complexes, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the denominator. Because wait, the denominator should be the sum of all possible terms, including those for all n. But with four complexes, perhaps the possible n is up to 4.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers only up to three ligands. But I don't think so because the stability constants are given up to β4=16.

Wait,
