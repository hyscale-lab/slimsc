Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the answer. Hmm, the question is about the decay of a boson, X, which has a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, and I need to determine which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Let me start by understanding the problem. The Lagrangian is L(y) = -λff(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I think this is a Yukawa-type interaction. The Yukawa interaction typically couples a fermion-antifermion pair to a boson. So, the boson X can decay into a fermion-antifermion pair if the mass allows it.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So, when considering the decay X → f f̄, the rest mass of the fermion f must be less than half of X's mass because in the center-of-mass frame, each fermion would need energy at least equal to their rest mass energy. So, for each decay channel, the mass of the fermion must satisfy m_f < M_X / 2.

Wait, let me compute M_X /2: 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than 3 GeV can be produced.

But wait, which fermions have masses less than 3 GeV? Let me think about the known fermion masses. 

Quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), top (t). 

But wait, the top quark is way too heavy. Its mass is around 173 GeV, so definitely more than 3. So u, d, s, c quarks. Also, the bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV, so it's out. Wait wait, no: M_X is 6 GeV, so half is 3. So any fermion with mass less than 3 GeV is allowed.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Because in reality, quarks can't exist freely because of confinement, but in the context of particle decays, the Lagrangian would allow the decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, provided their rest masses are less than M_X/2. But wait, maybe I should think about the possible particles that can be produced, considering their masses.

Wait, but wait— I think I should consider the standard model particles. Let me list the fermion masses:

- Up quark (u): around 2.2 MeV (much less than 3 GeV)
- Down quark (d): ~4.7 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~95 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.3 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): ~173 GeV
- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos are even lighter, but since the problem doesn't talk about neutrinos, maybe we can ignore them for this question.

Wait, but wait, in the Lagrangian, it's written as λff(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps the interaction is with some fermion f. Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the notation. The term f and ψ_f— perhaps it's a typo or maybe I should think it as the fermion field. Alternatively, maybe the interaction is with a fermion ψ_f, so that the X boson couples to ψ and ψ̄.

Wait, let me parse the Lagrangian again: L(y) = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps the f is a typo, and it's supposed to be something else. Or maybe it's a typo, and the correct Lagrangian is L = -λ (v + X) ψ_f ψ_f. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think that X couples to a fermion ψ_f, so the interaction is X ψ_f ψ_f.

Alternatively, perhaps the fermion is a lepton, like electron or muon, but the question is about the possible decay channels.

Wait, but the problem states that the interaction is between X and fermions, so the decay would be X → f f̄ for some fermion f. So, the possible fermions f are those where 2 m_f < M_X. Since M_X is 6 GeV, 2 m_f must be less than 6 GeV, so m_f < 3 GeV.

So looking at the fermion masses:

- e: 0.511 MeV → way less than 3 GeV → allowed.
- μ: 105.7 MeV → allowed.
- τ: 1.78 GeV → 1.78 < 3 → allowed.
- u: ~2.2 MeV → allowed.
- d: ~4.7 MeV → allowed.
- s: ~95 MeV → allowed.
- c: ~1.3 GeV → allowed.
- b: ~4.5 GeV → 4.5 > 3 → not allowed.
- t: ~173 GeV → no.
- Neutrinos: negligible, so allowed, but not in the options.

So the possible fermions are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but the options don't include all of these. Let me look at the options.

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, e+ e-.

Wait, but b's mass is 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3. So the decay into b b̄ is not allowed. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

Wait, c has 1.3 GeV, which is allowed. So yes, these are all under 3 GeV.

Option C: includes t t̄, which is impossible. So option C is out.

Option D: includes b b̄, which is not allowed. So option D is incorrect.

So the correct options are B, because it includes c, s, u, d, τ, μ, e. All their masses are under 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait, the interaction given in the question: the Lagrangian is -λ f \bar{ψ}f (y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something about the fermions involved.

Wait, perhaps the interaction is only with a specific type of fermion, like only leptons or only quarks. But the problem statement says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by...", so it's general. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the mass allows.

So the possible decay products are all fermion pairs where each fermion's mass is less than 3 GeV. So that includes up, down, strange, charm quarks, and electron, muon, tau leptons. So the options should include all these.

Looking back, option B includes c, s, u, d, which are quarks, and τ, μ, e, which are leptons.

Option A includes b which is too heavy, so it's out.

Option B includes c, which is 1.3 GeV, allowed. So why is there an option D which includes b?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck the fermion masses.

Wait, bottom quark mass is about 4.5 GeV, which is above 3 GeV, so X (6 GeV) can't decay into b b̄ because 2 *4.5=9 >6. So option A and D are out.

So the possible decay channels are into any fermion where m_f < 3 GeV. So the allowed fermions are:

- e (0.511 MeV)
- μ (105.7 MeV)
- τ (1.78 GeV)
- u (2.2 MeV)
- d (4.7 MeV)
- s (95 MeV)
- c (1.3 GeV)

So the decay products can be any of these fermion pairs. Let me check the options.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

Yes, includes all except b. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait the problem statement says the interaction is given by L(y) = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps the ψ is a specific fermion field, but the problem states that the interaction is between X and "fermions", so perhaps X can decay into any fermion that the interaction allows.

Wait, perhaps the interaction term is actually L = -λ (v + X) ψ_f ψ_f. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that the interaction allows. So the decay X → f f̄ is allowed for any f where m_f < 3 GeV.

So the allowed options are all the fermions with m_f <3 GeV. So the correct decay products are all of the ones in option B.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because option D includes b, which is not allowed. So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the given interaction Lagrangian. The interaction allows \( X \) to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, \( X \to f \bar{f} \), provided the fermion mass \( m_f \) satisfies \( m_f < M_X / 2 \). Since \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), the condition becomes \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 1: Identify fermion masses
The masses of standard model fermions are as follows:
- \( e \): \( 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( \mu \): \( 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( \tau \): \( 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( u \): \( 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( d \): \( 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( s \): \( 95 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( c \): \( 1.3 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( b \): \( 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( t \): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

From this, the fermions with \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are:
- \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \).

### Step 2: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), but \( m_b = 4.5 \, \text{GeV} > 3 \, \text{GeV} \), so this decay is not allowed. Hence, Option A is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \). All these fermions have \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \), so this option is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), but \( m_t = 173 \, \text{GeV} > 3 \, \text{GeV} \), so this decay is not allowed. Hence, Option C is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), but \( m_b = 4.5 \, \text{GeV} > 3 \, \text{GeV} \), so this decay is not allowed. Hence, Option D is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The only kinematically allowed decay channels are those listed in **Option B**, as all included fermions satisfy \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

Answer: B
