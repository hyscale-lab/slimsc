--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with all the concepts involved. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. There are these stability constants given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. The complexes here are Co with different numbers of SCN- ions attached. So, the complexes are probably Co(SCN)n^something.

Wait, the question mentions the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the blue one is the Co(SCN)₂²+ complex. So, that's the third complex, maybe? Or wait, looking at the β values: β1 is 9, which is the formation constant for the first complex, maybe CoSCN+. Then β2=40, so Co(SCN)₂^2+? Or wait, maybe I got the order wrong. Let me think. The formation constants are for each step, so each β corresponds to adding another SCN- ion.

Wait, the stability constant (β) for a complex like Co(SCN)n is the equilibrium constant for the reaction:

Co²+ + n SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)_n²−(n− charge? Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, each SCN- is a -1 charge. So, Co²+ plus n SCN- would give Co(SCN)_n^2−n+? Wait, no. Let me correct that. Co²+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN- is -1. So, for a complex with m SCN- ions, the charge would be 2 - m. Because (SCN)⁻ * m gives a total of -m, and Co²+ gives +2. So total charge is 2 - m.

Wait, but the complexes are neutral or something else? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The exact charge might not matter for the calculation, but the key is to find the fraction of each possible complex.

The problem is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is the Co(SCN)₂²+ complex. So that's the n=2 structure. Wait, no, wait: Co(SCN)_n^(2−n). For n=2, the charge is 0? Because 2−2=0. So the complex would be neutral. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps each SCN is a -1, so for Co(SCN)_n, the charge is 2 - n. So for n=1, it's +1; n=2, it's 0; n=3, -1; n=4, -2. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's right. Maybe I should just proceed with the given β values and the problem.

So, the first step is to find out the distribution of Co species in solution. The possible complexes are Co²+, CoSCN+, Co(SCN)₂, Co(SCN)₃⁻, and Co(SCN)₄^2−. Each has its own stability constant.

The stability constants β1 to β4 represent the equilibrium for each step. So, β1 is the formation constant for CoSCN+ from Co²+ and SCN⁻. β2 is the formation of Co(SCN)₂²+ from CoSCN+ and another SCN⁻, and so on.

Wait, no, actually, the stability constants are cumulative. Wait, no, wait. The stability constant β for a complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the ions. So, for Co(SCN)_n, the βn is the constant for the overall reaction:

Co²+ + n SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)_n^2−n.

So, the first β1 is for the reaction Co²+ + SCN⁻ ⇌ CoSCN+ (β1=9).

The second β2 is for the reaction Co²+ + 2 SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)₂²+ (β2=40). Wait, but that can't be right because the overall β would be different. Or is each β the stepwise formation constant? Oh, right, stepwise vs overall. So, β1 is the first step: Co²+ + SCN⁻ → CoSCN+.

Then, β2 is the second step: CoSCN+ + SCN⁻ → Co(SCN)₂²+.

Similarly, β3 is the third step: Co(SCN)₂^2+ + SCN⁻ → Co(SCN)_3^-.

And β4 is the fourth step: Co(SCN)_3^- + SCN⁻ → Co(SCN)_4^{2-}.

So, each β is the formation constant for adding one more SCN⁻ to the existing complex.

Wait, but sometimes people use overall formation constants. So, the overall β for Co(SCN)_2^2+ would be β1 * β2.

Similarly, the overall β for Co(SCN)_3^- would be β1 * β2 * β3.

And for Co(SCN)_4^{2-}, it's β1 * β2 * β3 * β4.

Wait, so perhaps the problem gives the stepwise β's, and we need to calculate the overall β for each complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the β's given are the overall stability constants for each complex. Hmm, the question says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16." So each β is the overall stability constant for the respective complex.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, it's a bit ambiguous. I need to clarify.

If β1 is the stability constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^{2+}, etc., then each β represents the overall formation of that complex from Co²+ and n SCN⁻.

Wait, no. Let me think: the overall β for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−(n−1)}? Or perhaps each β is the stepwise formation constant. I think in most cases, when they list β1, β2, etc., it's the stepwise constants. So, β1 is the first addition, β2 the second, etc. So, the overall K for [Co(SCN)_n] is the product of β1 to βn.

But wait, in the problem statement, the β values are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. So, probably, each β is the stepwise formation constant. So, to find the concentration of each complex, we can model the distribution using these βs.

But wait, another approach is to model the fraction of each possible complex. The total cobalt is in the form of Co²+ plus all the possible complexes.

The approach is to calculate the fraction of each species (Co²+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^{2+}, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}) and then find the percentage for the dithiocyanato complex, which is the [Co(SCN)₂]^{2+}.

But wait, the problem says "the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." I think the blue one is [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, but wait, no. Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused about the colors of the different complexes. I remember that in the formation of cobalt thiocyanate complexes, the color changes with the number of SCN⁻ ligands. For example, [Co(SCN)]+ is pink, [Co(SCN)₂]^{2+} is blue, [Co(SCN)_3]^- is green, and [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} is brown or something. Wait, but maybe I should just focus on the problem and not get stuck on the colors.

Wait, but the problem says "dithiocyanato," which would be two SCN groups. So, that's [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}. Because di- means two.

Wait, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} would have charge 2+. Because Co²+ plus two SCN- (each -1) would give 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. Oh wait, that would be neutral. So perhaps the charge is neutral. Hmm, maybe that's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps each SCN is a -1, so two SCN would contribute -2. So Co²+ plus two SCN- gives 0 charge. Hmm, but then the complex is neutral.

Wait, okay, regardless of the charge, the main point is to calculate the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^{something} in the solution.

So, the approach is to model the distribution of Co species using the given β's and the concentrations of Co²+ and SCN⁻.

But wait, the solution is that the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M.

So, the starting point is Co²+ and SCN⁻ in solution. The Co²+ can form complexes with varying numbers of SCN- ions. The question is to find the fraction of the species that is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} (or whatever the correct complex is for n=2).

So, let me think about the general approach.

The distribution of the complexes can be determined using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions. The fraction of each complex is given by the product of the stability constants up to that complex, divided by the sum of all possible such products plus 1 (for the free Co²+).

Wait, no, the general approach is to calculate the fraction of each species using the formation constants and the concentrations.

The formation of each complex is a stepwise process, so the fraction of each complex is given by:

f_n = (β1 * β2 * ... * βn) * [SCN^-]^n / (1 + [SCN^-] β1 + [SCN^-]^2 β1 β2 + ... + [SCN^-]^4 (β1 β2 β3 β4) )

Wait, but wait, the maximum n is 4, since β4 is given. So, n can be 0 to 4. So, the total is 1 (n=0, Co²+) plus each term for n=1 to 4.

Wait, but wait, for each n, the term is [SCN^-]^n multiplied by the product of β1 to βn, divided by (some denominator). Hmm, I think the fraction f_n is given by (β1 β2 ... βn) [SCN]^{n} / D, where D is the sum over all m=0 to 4 of (β1 β2 ... βm) [SCN]^m.

Wait, but wait, for n=0, the term is 1 (since β product is 1 for m=0, [SCN]^0 is 1). So, D is the sum from m=0 to 4 of (β1 β2 ... βm) [SCN]^m.

Wait, but wait, actually, for each species [Co(SCN)_m], the formation constant K_m is the product of β1 through βm. So, the fraction f_m is K_m [SCN]^m / (sum over m=0 to 4 of K_m [SCN]^m} )

Wait, but in this case, the species are:

m=0: Co²+ → K=1.

m=1: [CoSCN]^+ → K=β1=9.

m=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} → K=β1*β2=9*40=360.

m=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^- → K=β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=22680.

m=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} → K=β1*β2*β3*β4= 9*40*63*16= 362880.

Then, the denominator D is 1 + [SCN] * K1 + [SCN]^2 * K2 + [SCN]^3 * K3 + [SCN]^4 * K4.

Wait, but wait, in terms of units, [SCN] is 0.1 M. So, let's compute each term.

Compute each term for m=0 to 4:

Term_0 = 1 * (0.1)^0 = 1

Term_1 = K1 * (0.1)^1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term_2 = K2 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6

Term_3 = K3 * (0.1)^3 = 22680 * 0.001 = 22.68

Term_4 = K4 * (0.1)^4 = 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288

Wait, let's compute each:

Term_0: 1.

Term_1: 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

Term_2: 360 * 0.01 = 3.6.

Term_3: 22680 * 0.001 = 22.68.

Term_4: 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

Now sum all terms: 1 + 0.9 = 1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So D = 64.468.

Now, the fraction f_2 is term_2 / D = 3.6 / 64.468 ≈ 0.05555 or 5.555%.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are 16.9%, 25.6%, etc. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the K values. Because if each β is the overall stability constant for each complex, not the stepwise. Oh, wait, that's a possibility. Let me think again.

If β1 is the overall stability constant for [CoSCN]^+ → K1=β1=9.

β2 is the overall K for [Co(SCN)_2]^something → K2=40.

β3 is K for [Co(SCN)_3]^something → K3=63.

β4 is K for [Co(SCN)_4]^something → K4=16.

Wait, that would change things. Because in that case, the K for each complex is given, and we don't multiply all β's up to that point.

In that case, the terms would be:

Term_0: 1.

Term_1: β1 * [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

Term_2: β2 * [SCN]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4.

Term_3: β3 * [SCN]^3 =63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001= 0.063.

Term_4: β4 * [SCN]^4 =16 * (0.1)^4 =16 * 0.0001=0.0016.

Then, the denominator D is 1 + 0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 = 2.3646.

So, the fraction for the second complex (terms for m=2) is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169 or 16.9%. That would correspond to option D, which is 16.9%.

But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ or something. So according to this calculation, the fraction is about 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, I'm confused because the initial assumption that each β is the stepwise formation constant gives a much smaller fraction (around 5.5%). But when I take each β as the overall K for that complex, I get around 16.9%, which is one of the options. So maybe I should proceed with this approach.

But wait, why would the problem give β2=40? If β2 is the overall K for [Co(SCN)_2], that would make sense. So, perhaps the correct approach is to use each β as the K for each respective complex, not the product of stepwise βs.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again about what β represents. The stability constant (β) is typically the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So, for [CoSCN]^+, β1 is K1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co²+][SCN-]).

Similarly, for [Co(SCN)_2], the stability constant β2 is K2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/([Co²+][SCN-]^2).

Wait, but in that case, each β is the overall K for the corresponding complex. So, when calculating the fraction of each complex, you use each β as the K for that particular step, not multiplying all previous βs.

In that case, the fraction for each complex is given by:

f_m = (βm * [SCN]^m) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, but wait, if each β is the K for each m, then for m=2, the term is β2 [SCN]^2.

Wait, let me recompute with this approach.

Compute each term:

Term_0: 1.

Term_1: β1 [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

Term_2: β2 [SCN]^2 =40 * 0.01=0.4.

Term_3: β3 [SCN]^3=63 * 0.001=0.063.

Term_4: β4 [SCN]^4=16 * 0.0001=0.0016.

Sum these:1 + 0.9=1.9 → +0.4=2.3 → +0.063=2.363 → +0.0016=2.3646.

So, denominator D=2.3646.

The fraction for m=2 is 0.4/2.3646 ≈ 0.169, which is about 16.9%, option D.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes, which would be the [Co(SCN)_2] species. So according to this, the answer would be D) 16.9%.

But wait, I'm not so sure because I might be mixing the stepwise and overall formation constants. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the formation step by step.

The first step is Co²+ + SCN⁻ → CoSCN+ with K1=9.

The second step is CoSCN+ + SCN⁻ → Co(SCN)_2^2+ with K2=40.

So the overall K for [Co(SCN)_2] is K1*K2 = 9 *40=360.

Similarly, the third step K3=63, so K for [Co(SCN)_3] is 9*40*63=22680.

And K4=16, so K for [Co(SCN)_4] is 9*40*63*16=362880.

In that case, the terms are:

Term_0: 1.

Term_1: K1 * [SCN]^1 =9 *0.1=0.9.

Term_2: K1*K2 * [SCN]^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

Term_3: K1*K2*K3 * [SCN]^3=22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term_4: K1*K2*K3*K4 * [SCN]^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Denominator D=1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 = 64.468.

Now, the fraction for m=2 is 3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05555, which is about 5.55%. But that's not one of the options. So something's wrong.

Wait, but the options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Hmm, so none of the options match 5.5%, so perhaps I've made a mistake in assuming that the β's are stepwise.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is modeled using the overall K for each complex, not the stepwise ones. So, in that case, the fractions are calculated as I did earlier, giving 16.9%, which is option D.

But why is the β4=16 smaller than β3=63? That would imply that the fourth complex is less stable than the third, which is possible because sometimes the stability can decrease when adding more ligands due to steric hindrance or other factors.

So, given the two approaches, I'm getting two different answers. But the options include 16.9%, which is from the second approach where each β is the overall K for each complex.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again: the problem gives four β values, probably as the stepwise formation constants. So, the K for each complex is the product of βs up to that point.

In that case, the fractions are as follows:

Term_0: 1.

Term_1: K1 * [SCN] = 9 *0.1=0.9.

Term_2: K1*K2 * [SCN]^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

Term_3: K1*K2*K3 * [SCN]^3=22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term_4: K1*K2*K3*K4 * [SCN]^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum D=1 +0.9=1.9 +3.6=5.5 +22.68=28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So, the fraction for the [Co(SCN)_2] complex is 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 5.55%.

But that's not one of the options. So, perhaps my initial approach was wrong, and the β's are the overall K's for each complex.

Wait, but why would β4=16 be the K for [Co(SCN)_4], since [Co(SCN)_4] would have a higher K than [Co(SCN)_3], which has K=63. So, β4=16 is lower than β3=63, which would imply that [Co(SCN)_4] is less stable than [Co(SCN)_3], which might make sense, but the K for [Co(SCN)_4] would be β1*β2*β3*β4, which is 9*40*63*16 = 362880, which is higher than β3's K of 22680.

Wait, no, in the stepwise approach, the overall K for [Co(SCN)_4] is 362880, which is much larger than the K for [Co(SCN)_3], which is 22680. So, in that case, the [Co(SCN)_4] would be the dominant species, which would contribute more to the denominator.

Wait, but in our earlier calculation, when each β is stepwise, the terms are:

Term_4=36.288, Term_3=22.68, Term_2=3.6, Term_1=0.9, Term_0=1.

And D=64.468.

So, [Co(SCN)_4] has the highest term, so the largest fraction.

So, the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is 3.6/64.468≈5.55%, which is not an option. So, that's conflicting.

Hmm, perhaps the question is using the stepwise formation constants, but the fraction is not computed as I thought.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the fraction of each complex using the conditional formation constants, taking into account the concentrations.

Wait, another approach is to consider the distribution of the species as a function of [SCN^-]. The fraction of each species depends on the stability constants and the ligand concentration.

The general formula for the fraction of the m-th complex is:

f_m = (β1 β2 ... βm [SCN^-]^m) / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + ... + β1 β2 ... βm [SCN^-]^m )

But in this case, the β's are given as stepwise, so each subsequent β is for adding another ligand.

In that case, the denominator would be the sum from m=0 to 4 of the product of β1 to βm multiplied by [SCN^-]^m.

Wait, but I think I've already done that.

Wait, but if the β's are stepwise, then the fractions would be as I calculated before: 5.55% for m=2.

But since that's not one of the options, perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the question refers to the maximum possible complex, but that doesn't seem likely.

Wait, perhaps the question is about [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ (which is m=2), but perhaps the denominator includes the cumulative terms correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the terms.

Let me recheck the calculations.

Given [SCN] = 0.1 M.

Compute each term for m=0 to 4:

m=0: 1 * (0.1)^0 = 1.

m=1: β1 * (0.1)^1 =9 *0.1=0.9.

m=2: β1 * β2 * (0.1)^2 =9*40=360; 360 * 0.01=3.6.

m=3: 9*40*63=22680; 22680 * (0.1)^3=0.001 → 22.68.

m=4: 9*40*63*16=362880; * (0.1)^4=0.0001 →36.288.

So D=1 +0.9=1.9 +3.6=5.5 +22.68=28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So, f2=3.6/64.468≈0.055555 or 5.55%.

But that's not one of the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the overall formation constants, not stepwise. So, each β is the overall K for the corresponding complex. So, for [CoSCN]^+, K1=9; for [Co(SCN)_2], K2=40; [Co(SCN)_3], K3=63; [Co(SCN)_4], K4=16.

But that would mean that K4=16 is lower than K3=63, which is possible. So, with this approach, the terms are:

m=0:1.

m=1:9*0.1=0.9.

m=2:40*(0.1)^2=0.4.

m=3:63*(0.1)^3=0.063.

m=4:16*(0.1)^4=0.0016.

D=1+0.9=1.9+0.4=2.3+0.063=2.363+0.0016=2.3646.

So, f2=0.4/2.3646≈0.169, which is 16.9%, option D.

But why would the stability constants decrease for higher m? Because K4=16 is lower than K3=63.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is structured that way, and the answer is D.

So, considering all this, I think the correct answer is D) 16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants (β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16) and the concentrations of Co²⁺ (10⁻² M) and SCN⁻ (0.1 M). The stability constants represent the stepwise formation of complexes, and the fraction of each species is calculated as:

\[
f_m = \frac{\beta_1 \beta_2 \dots \beta_m [\text{SCN}^-]^m}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \dots + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4}
\]

### Step 1: Compute the terms for each species
The terms for \( m = 0 \) to \( m = 4 \) are calculated as follows:
- \( m = 0 \): \( 1 \cdot (0.1)^0 = 1 \)
- \( m = 1 \): \( \beta_1 \cdot (0.1)^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)
- \( m = 2 \): \( \beta_1 \beta_2 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 9 \cdot 40 \cdot 0.01 = 3.6 \)
- \( m = 3 \): \( \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 9 \cdot 40 \cdot 63 \cdot 0.001 = 22.68 \)
- \( m = 4 \): \( \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 9 \cdot 40 \cdot 63 \cdot 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 36.288 \)

### Step 2: Compute the denominator
The denominator is the sum of all terms:
\[
D = 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 + 36.288 = 64.468
\]

### Step 3: Compute the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺
The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (\( m = 2 \)) is:
\[
f_2 = \frac{\text{Term}_2}{D} = \frac{3.6}{64.468} \approx 0.05555 \, \text{or} \, 5.55\%
\]

### Step 4: Reassess the interpretation of β values
If the β values are interpreted as the overall stability constants for each complex (not stepwise), the terms are recalculated:
- \( m = 0 \): \( 1 \)
- \( m = 1 \): \( \beta_1 \cdot (0.1)^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)
- \( m = 2 \): \( \beta_2 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4 \)
- \( m = 3 \): \( \beta_3 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063 \)
- \( m = 4 \): \( \beta_4 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016 \)

The new denominator is:
\[
D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

The fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺ is now:
\[
f_2 = \frac{\text{Term}_2}{D} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169 \, \text{or} \, 16.9\%
\]

### Conclusion
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.
