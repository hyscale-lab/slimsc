--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let's see what the question says. The scenario is that I've prepared an unknown compound and used some characterization techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I need to determine the chemical formula based on the data provided.

Let me start by going through each piece of data step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around that region usually indicate OH groups because O-H stretching in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait, wait. The peak is very broad. Oh, right, carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch because of hydrogen bonding. Alcohols also have a broad peak, but sometimes it can be less so than carboxylic acids, but I'm not entirely sure. Hmm.

Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm. 1700 is a typical carbonyl region. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl group like in an acid or amide. The 1650 peak is a bit lower than 1700. That might suggest conjugation or perhaps an aromatic ring nearby. For instance, in an aromatic ketone, the carbonyl might be around 1680-1650. Alternatively, an ester's carbonyl is usually around 1740, so this 1700 would be more like a ketone or maybe an aldehyde. But wait, the 1650 could be an aromatic ring's C=C stretch, but that's usually around 1600. Oh wait, maybe it's conjugated to something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl like in an enol or something.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests the compound has a double bond somewhere. Maybe in an ester group or an aromatic ring. Wait, but if it's an ester, the carbonyl is in the 1700 region, but the IR would show that. But wait, the 1700 might be an ester. Alternatively, if this is an aromatic compound, like a substituted benzene with a ketone or maybe an ester group.

The mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm. I need to think about what fragment corresponds to 45. Common fragments at 45 could be something like (CH3)2CO, which would be acetone. Wait, acetone's molecular ion is at 58, but maybe a fragment. Wait, 45 could be a CH2CH2O group or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3O)2, but wait, molecular weight of CH3O is 32, but 45 is higher. Another possibility is C3H7O, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the methyl ester group or something else. Or perhaps it's a COCH2CH3 fragment, which would be 58 (molecular weight of acetone is 58), but that's higher than 45. Hmm. Let me think again. Another way: 45 is 45. So, possible formulas that sum to 45. Let's see: C3H7O2 would be 3*12 +7 +16*2=36+7+32=75? No. Wait, 45 is the m/z, so possible combinations.

Wait, 45 could be C3H3O. 3*12=36 +3=39 +16=55. No, that's too high. Alternatively, C2H3O2: 24 +3 +32=59. No. Or C3H7O: 36 +7 +16=60. Hmm. Maybe it's a different approach. Maybe the molecular formula of the compound is one of the options provided, and the fragment at 45 is part of that. Let's think about the options.

The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

So molecular formulas:

A) C6H12O2: molecular weight would be (6*12) +12 + (2*16) =72 +12 +32= 116.

B) C6H10O: 72 +10 +16=98.

C) C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32=114.

D) C6H12O:72 +12 +16=100.

The problem is that the mass spec shows m/z=45. Let's think about possible fragments. Maybe the molecular ion is at 45? No, because the molecular weight of the compounds are all higher than that. So it's a fragment.

Wait, another approach: common fragments. What gives a mass of 45? Well, maybe (CH2)2O (ethoxy group). Let's calculate: C2H5O is 2*12 +5 +16=24 +5=29 +16=45. Oh, yes! So C2H5O has a molecular weight of 45. So perhaps there's an ethoxy group in the molecule, which breaks off as a fragment in the mass spec.

Alternatively, another fragment that's 45 could be CH3CO (acetate). Let's calculate: CH3CO is C2H3O2. Wait, molecular weight: 12*2 +3 +16*2=24+3+32=59. That's higher than 45, so no. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is CH2CH2O as a group, but CH2CH2O is C2H4O. Molecular weight: 24 +4 +16=44. Close but not 45. Maybe a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl group (15) plus something else. Not sure.

But the ethoxy group fragment (C2H5O) is 45. So that suggests the compound has an ethoxy group. So looking at the options, which compounds have an ethoxy group? Well, an ethoxy group would imply an ether (R-O-CH2CH3) or an ester (RCO-OCH2CH3), or similar.

Looking at the options:

Option C is C6H10O2. That's 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, 2 oxygens. That could be an ester, maybe. For example, methyl benzoate is C7H6O2, but that's 7 carbons. Alternatively, maybe it's something like ethyl propionate, but I'm not sure about the molecular formula.

Option A is C6H12O2. That's 6 carbons, 12 hydrogens, 2 oxygens. That could be something like ethyl something. Wait, let's think about molecular formulas. Let's see, if the compound has an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3), which is 2 carbons, then the remaining part would be C4H9O. Because 6 -2 =4 carbons. So the remaining part would be C4H9O.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option C is C6H10O2. So if it's an ester, it would be (R-O-CO-R'). For example, ethyl (something) ester. Wait, no, wait. The ester functional group is R-O-CO-R', where R and R' are alkyl or aryl groups. So the formula would be (R' is an alkyl, say, ethyl), then the ester group would be O-CO-OCH2CH3? No, wait, the ester is R-O-CO-R', so the formula would include the carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the possible structures. Let's consider the given data.

The FTIR shows an O-H stretch (broad around 3000), and two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is likely a carbonyl (C=O). But wait, two carbonyl peaks? That's a bit unusual. Alternatively, maybe one is a carbonyl and another is an aromatic ring. Because the 1650 could be an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. So perhaps the compound has both a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring.

Wait, but if the compound has a conjugated carbonyl, like in a benzene ring with a ketone group, that would explain the 1650 cm^-1 peak. The 1700 would be the carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ester, where the carbonyl is around 1700, but the ring's C=C is around 1650.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. So let's think about possible functional groups.

The presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests there's a double bond, either as an alkene or as part of a ring (like aromatic). So maybe the compound is an aromatic ester, like phenyl acetate or something similar. Or perhaps a substituted acetophenone.

Wait, let's think about the IR again. The broad peak at 3000 could be an -OH group. If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad. Alternatively, if it's an alcohol, it's broad too. But for a carboxylic acid, the O-H is usually around 2500-3300 cm^-1 and very broad, which fits the 3000 peak. But also, carboxylic acids have a strong absorption around 1700 cm^-1 for the carbonyl. So that would fit the 1700 peak. The 1650 could be the C=C in an aromatic ring. So perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid derivative. But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which are the ones attached to a double bond. If it's a benzoic acid, the ring would have C=C, and the NMR would show aromatic protons, not vinyl. Unless it's something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe the compound is an ester with an aromatic ring. For example, methyl benzoate. Its IR would show ester carbonyl around 1700, and the aromatic C=C around 1600, but the peak is at 1650, which might be a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, but methyl benzoate's structure is PhCOOCH3. The IR would have a strong peak around 1700 for the ester carbonyl, and then around 1500-1600 for the aromatic ring. So the 1650 peak might fit that. The O-H in the ester is not present; but wait, the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an O-H group. So maybe the ester isn't the right functional group, because esters don't have O-H unless it's an acid or alcohol.

Wait, but in the options, some have two oxygens. Let's see:

Option C is C6H10O2. So that could be an ester with two oxygens (RCOOR') which would fit. But in that case, the O-H in the ester is absent unless it's a different structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone and an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound has an ether and a ketone? But I'm not sure.

Wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So perhaps the molecule has a conjugated diene or an isolated double bond. Let's think about possible structures.

Another point: the presence of an O-H group suggests either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. If it's a carboxylic acid, the formula would have at least two O's (as in the COOH group), which is present in options A and C.

So if the compound is a carboxylic acid, its formula would be something like CnH2nO2. Wait, let's see: a carboxylic acid is RCOOH, which is (n-1) carbons in R, so molecular formula would be CnH2n-1COOH → Cn+1 H2n+1 O2.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think. For example, acetic acid is CH3COOH, which is C2H4O2. So a two-carbon acid would be C2H4O2. So if the compound is a four-carbon acid, the formula would be C4H8O2.

But the options provided are C6H12O2, C6H10O, etc. So maybe if it's a benzoic acid derivative, which would have more carbons. But the molecular formula for benzoic acid is C7H6O2. So perhaps the compound is a substituted benzoic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from an alcohol group, not a carboxylic acid. For example, a phenol or a secondary alcohol.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to approach the problem again, step by step.

1. FTIR:
   - Broad peak at ~3000 cm^-1 → O-H group (probably in an alcohol or carboxylic acid)
   - Peaks at 1700 and 1650 → Carbonyl (C=O) at 1700, and another peak perhaps from conjugated C=C or another carbonyl.

2. 1H NMR:
   - Peaks for vinyl hydrogens (like CH2=CH groups or aromatic protons; but vinyl is more about double bond CH2 groups)

3. Mass Spec:
   - Fragment at m/z=45 → Possibly an ethoxy group (C2H5O, which is 45), or another fragment.

So putting this together:

If the mass spec shows a fragment of 45, which is C2H5O, then the compound might have an ethoxy group. So the compound could be an ester with an ethoxy group. For example, ethyl something ester.

But wait, if it's an ester, then the carbonyl would be present, which the IR shows at 1700. So that makes sense.

Wait, but where's the O-H coming from? Esters don't have O-H groups. So if the O-H is present, maybe it's not an ester.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a ketone with an alcohol group. But then the O-H would be from the alcohol.

Wait, but the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, so it's a strong O-H. So perhaps it's a phenol, which has a broad O-H stretch. But phenols have aromatic protons in the NMR, which may not explain the vinyl hydrogens. Unless the structure is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a β-keto acid. For example, something like acetoacetic acid. It has two carbonyl groups. But then the IR would have two peaks, which it does. The 1700 could be the carboxylic acid, and the 1650 could be the ketone. But wait, the O-H from the carboxylic acid would be very broad, which fits. And the NMR would have vinyl hydrogens? Hmm, acetoacetic acid is CH3COCH2COOH. It has a ketone and a carboxylic acid. The NMR would show protons adjacent to the ketone, but not necessarily vinyl hydrogens. Unless there's a double bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, the compound could be an aromatic ring with a ketone and an ester group. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the molecular formulas.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2 → Degree of unsaturation: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming X=0, N=0.

So (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 2/2 =1. So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring and a double bond, or two rings, or one double bond.

B) C6H10O → (12*2 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. Two degrees: maybe a ring and a double bond.

C) C6H10O2 → (14 -10)/2 = 2, plus two oxygens don't affect it.

D) C6H12O → (14-12)/2=1.

So, the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests a double bond. So the compound must have at least one double bond, which would account for one degree of unsaturation.

Looking back, the FTIR shows a strong peak at 1700, which is a carbonyl. So that's another degree. So for the structure, each carbonyl (C=O) is a double bond (one degree). So if there's a carbonyl, that's one degree, and a double bond (vinyl H) is another. So total of two degrees of unsaturation. So the molecular formula must have two degrees.

Which options have two degrees?

Option B: C6H10O → 2 degrees. Option C: C6H10O2 → 2 degrees. Option A: 1 degree. Option D: 1 degree.

So the compound must be either B or C.

But wait, the presence of O-H (from FTIR) implies that either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid is present. So let's see:

Option B: C6H10O → Could be an alcohol (with a carbonyl group and a double bond).

Option C: C6H10O2 → Could be a carboxylic acid (with a carbonyl, and another carbonyl, but that may not fit). Alternatively, maybe an ester and an alcohol, but that would require more oxygens.

Wait, if the compound is an ester, it's RCOOR', which has two oxygens. So option C is C6H10O2. So for example, ethyl propionate would be C5H10O2. But our options are C6, so perhaps it's a larger ester.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a ketone with an ester group. Or a cyclic ester, but that's a lactone, which would have a carbonyl and a ring. But then the vinyl hydrogens would come from the ring?

Wait, maybe the structure is something like benzaldehyde with an ester group, but I'm not sure.

Another angle: the mass spec fragment at 45 is likely the ethoxy group (C2H5O). So if the compound has an ethoxy group, then it's either an ether or an ester.

If it's an ether, the formula would be R-O-CH2CH3. So the R part would be C4H9O (since 6-2=4 carbons). So the formula would be C6H12O (since R-O-CH2CH3 would be C4H9-O-CH2CH3 → C6H14O, but wait, no. Let me recalculate. R is C4H9, so the ether would be C4H9-O-CH2CH3 → which would be C6H14O. But none of the options have C6H14O. So that suggests it's not an ether.

Alternatively, if it's an ester, the formula would be RCO-O-CH2CH3. RCO- would be C3H5O (since the ester is RCO-O-R', where R' is ethyl). Wait, RCO-O-CH2CH3 would be (R is C3H5). But let me think:

E.g., RCO-O-R' → R is C3H5, R' is C2H5.

So the formula would be (C3H5 O2) + (C2H5) → Wait, no. The ester formula is RCOOR'. R is C3H7 (if RCOOR' is C3H7COOCH2CH3, that's C5H10O2. But our options are C6H10O2. So perhaps R is C4H9. So RCOOCH2CH3 → (C4H9COO)CH2CH3 → C6H12O2. But none of the options for C6H12O2 is C6H12O2, which is option A.

Wait, but option C is C6H10O2. So if the ester is RCOOCH2CH3, and R is C3H5, then the formula is (C3H5)(COO)CH2CH3 → C4H7O2 + C2H5 → Wait, total would be C4+ C2= C6, H:7 (from RCOO) +5 (from ethyl) → 7+5=12 H. So formula would be C6H12O2, which matches option A. But option A is C6H12O2, which has a molecular formula that would have one degree of unsaturation. Because (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So that's one degree of unsaturation.

But earlier, based on NMR, we thought the compound has two degrees (from the double bond and the carbonyl). So that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is not an ester but something else with an ethoxy group.

Wait, maybe the compound is a cyclic ether with a double bond and a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound has an ethoxy group and another functional group. Let's think about the IR again.

The IR has a strong peak at 1700, which could be a carbonyl. Then a peak at 1650, which could be a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring. Also, the O-H peak is at 3000.

If the compound is an ester with an alcohol group, like an ester and an -OH group, that would require three oxygens. But the options don't have that. So perhaps it's not that.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a β-keto ester. For example, ethyl acetoacetate. Its structure is CH3COCH2COOCH2CH3. Let's see the formula: C5H8O3. But our options don't have O3. So that's probably not it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an aromatic ester with an alcohol group. Hmm, that's getting complicated.

Wait, let's go back to the mass spec fragment. If it's 45, which is C2H5O, the ethoxy group, then the compound might have an ethoxy group. So which of the options have an ethoxy group?

Option A: C6H12O2. So, if it's an ester, RCOOCH2CH3. Then R would be C4H9. But wait, what's the formula of RCOOCH2CH3?

R is C4H9, so RCOO is C5H10O2. Then plus ethyl (C2H5) would make C7H15O2. Wait, no, that doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the molecular formula for ethyl something ester would be RCOOCH2CH3. The formula would be (R: CnH2n+1) → RCOOCH2CH3 is (n+2 carbons, n+3 H, and 3 O’s... wait, no. Wait, RCOOCH2CH3 → R is CnH2n+1, so RCOO is Cn+1 H2n+3 O2, and CH2CH3 is C2H5. So total formula is Cn+3 H2n+8 O2. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try with an example.

Ethyl acetate is CH3COOCH2CH3. Its formula is C4H8O2. So for ethyl acetate, n is 2 (the acetyl group). So R is CH3, which is C1H3.

So in our case, the compound is C6H10O2 or C6H12O2. Let me see if it's an ester.

For ethyl propionate, the formula is CH2CH2COOCH2CH3 → C5H10O2. But our options have C6H10O2 and C6H12O2. So maybe the ester is ethyl hexanoate? No, that would be longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure isn't an ester but a ketone with an ethyl group and an O-H.

Wait, maybe the compound is an allyl alcohol derivative, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is part of a hemiacetal or something else, but that's probably more complicated.

Let me think about the possible functional groups again. The IR shows a broad O-H, which could be an alcohol. Then a carbonyl at 1700, perhaps a ketone. But then where does the ethoxy group come from in the mass spec?

Hmm, maybe the compound is a cyclic ether with a ketone. Like tetrahydropyran derivative? I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is not from an alcohol. Let me think about an alternative: maybe it's a phenol. Phenols have a broad O-H stretch in IR. Then the 1700 peak could be a carbonyl attached to the aromatic ring. So, for example, acetophenone, which is a ketone attached to benzene. But acetophenone's molecular formula is C8H8O, which doesn't match the options. But if it's a substituted acetophenone, perhaps with an ethoxy group?

Wait, but then the formula would have more than 6 carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a benzaldehyde derivative with an ethoxy group. But benzaldehyde is C7H6O, which again doesn't match the options.

Wait, maybe the compound is an aromatic ester. For example, methyl benzoate is C8H8O2. But again, the options don't have that many carbons.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another way.

Wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So vinyl groups are CH2=CH-. So perhaps the compound has an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group, like an enone. So the structure would have a conjugated double bond next to a carbonyl. That would explain the IR peaks: the carbonyl at 1700, and the conjugated double bond around 1650. The O-H could be from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

So if the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone with an O-H group, what would be the formula?

For example, something like CH2=CH-CO-OH (but that's a smaller molecule). Or maybe a substituted version with an ethoxy group.

But the molecular formula options are six carbons. So, perhaps:

Structure: CH2=CH-CO-O-R, where R is an ethyl group. So R is CH2CH3. So the formula would be:

CH2=CH-CO-O-CH2CH3 → which is C5H8O2. But our options are C6H10O2 or other.

Alternatively, if R is a propyl group, but that would make more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OH (which is acrylic acid), but that's only 3 carbons.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option.

Option A: C6H12O2.

Degrees of unsaturation: 1. So one ring or one double bond.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So it must have a double bond. How?

If there's a double bond and a carbonyl, that would be two degrees. But the formula A has only one. So that's conflicting.

Option B: C6H10O.

Degrees of unsaturation: 2. So possible combinations: one ring and one double bond, or two rings, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2.

Degrees of unsaturation: 2. So similar possibilities as B.

Option D: C6H12O.

Degrees of unsaturation: 1. So maybe one ring or one double bond.

Now, considering the IR, the presence of a carbonyl (1700) and an O-H (broad at 3000). So the compound likely has a carbonyl and an O-H group. So the formula must have at least one O from the O-H and one O from the carbonyl. So, which options have at least two O's?

Options A and C have two O's. So B and D have one O. So B and D can be eliminated because they have only one O. Because the O-H and carbonyl require two O's.

Wait, that's a good point. So the FTIR shows O-H (so at least one O) and a carbonyl (another O). So the compound must have at least two O's. So options B (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O) have only one O each. So they can be eliminated.

So only options A and C are left: A is C6H12O2 and C is C6H10O2.

Now, the degrees of unsaturation:

Option A: C6H12O2 → (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1.

So one degree. But we have a carbonyl (one degree) and a double bond (from vinyl H's) which is another, so that's two degrees. So the formula A has only one, which is a problem.

Option C: C6H10O2 → (14 -10)/2=2 degrees. That fits with the two required (carbonyl and double bond).

So option C is more likely.

Additionally, the mass spec shows a fragment at 45 (C2H5O), which suggests an ethoxy group. So the compound would have an ethoxy group. For option C: C6H10O2, which would be an ester, since it has two O's and the ethoxy group.

If it's an ester, then the NMR would show the ethoxy protons, but the question says it shows vinyl hydrogens. Wait, but in an ester, the ethoxy group's protons are typically split into a quartet (if next to a CH2), but that's separate from the vinyl hydrogens in the molecule. So the NMR could have both types of signals.

Alternatively, the vinyl hydrogens could be from an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or a conjugated system.

Putting it all together:

FTIR: O-H (broad), C=O (1700), and possibly another peak (1650) from a conjugated group (maybe the double bond or aromatic ring).

1H NMR: vinyl H's present.

Mass Spec: ethoxy fragment at 45.

So the compound is likely an ester with an ethoxy group and a conjugated double bond or aromatic ring. But since option C is C6H10O2, which has two degrees of unsaturation, it fits.

So the answer should be option C: C6H10O2.


The question involves identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on FTIR, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometry data. Here's the analysis:

### FTIR Analysis:
- A broad absorption peak at **3000 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
- Strong absorption peaks at **1700 cm⁻¹** and **1650 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated system (e.g., an aromatic ring or an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group).

### 1H NMR Analysis:
- The presence of peaks corresponding to **vinyl hydrogens** indicates the compound contains a double bond (either isolated or conjugated).

### Mass Spectrometry:
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** suggests the presence of an ethoxy group (C₂H₅O), as this fragment matches the molecular weight of an ethoxy group.

### Molecular Formula Options:
The options provided are:
- **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**
- **B) C₆H₁₀O**
- **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**
- **D) C₆H₁₂O**

#### Degrees of Unsaturation:
1. **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂):**  
   Degrees of unsaturation = $\frac{(2 \cdot 6 + 2 - 12 - 0)}{2} = 1$.  
   This indicates either one ring or one double bond. However, the presence of both a carbonyl group (C=O) and vinyl hydrogens (C=C) requires two degrees of unsaturation, making this option inconsistent.

2. **Option B (C₆H₁₀O):**  
   Degrees of unsaturation = $\frac{(2 \cdot 6 + 2 - 10 - 0)}{2} = 2$.  
   While this satisfies the degrees of unsaturation, the compound has only one oxygen atom, which is insufficient to account for both the O-H group and the carbonyl group observed in the FTIR spectrum. Thus, this option is eliminated.

3. **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂):**  
   Degrees of unsaturation = $\frac{(2 \cdot 6 + 2 - 10 - 0)}{2} = 2$.  
   This matches the requirement for two degrees of unsaturation (one from the carbonyl group and one from the double bond). Additionally, the two oxygen atoms account for both the O-H group and the carbonyl group. The mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45 aligns with the presence of an ethoxy group, making this option consistent with all data.

4. **Option D (C₆H₁₂O):**  
   Degrees of unsaturation = $\frac{(2 \cdot 6 + 2 - 12 - 0)}{2} = 1$.  
   Similar to Option A, this indicates only one degree of unsaturation, which is insufficient to explain the presence of both a carbonyl group and vinyl hydrogens. This option is also eliminated.

### Conclusion:
The compound must have two oxygen atoms to account for the O-H and carbonyl groups, and two degrees of unsaturation to explain the carbonyl and double bond. Among the options, **C₆H₁₀O₂** satisfies all the given data, including the mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45, which corresponds to an ethoxy group.
