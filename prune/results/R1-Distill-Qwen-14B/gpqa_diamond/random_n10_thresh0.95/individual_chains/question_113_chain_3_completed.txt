--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about identifying an unknown compound using different spectroscopy techniques. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question says that the compound was analyzed with FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The given data points are:

- FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that a broad peak around there usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait, a very broad one might be a carboxylic acid because those O-H stretches are usually broader and around 2500-3300. Alternatively, if it's an alcohol, the peak might be less broad but still in that region. Hmm, but given it's a broad peak at 3000, maybe a carbonyl group? No, carbonyl is usually higher, like around 1700 or so. Oh wait, the question says there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Those are likely carbonyls. 1700 is probably a ketone or aldehyde, but 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, maybe an ester or something with conjugation, like an aromatic ring. So maybe it's a compound with two carbonyl groups? Or perhaps one is an ester and another is something else.

Wait, but the options are limited to C6H12O, C6H10O, etc. Let me think about the molecular formulas. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation for each option. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here.

Option A: C6H12O2. C=6, H=12, O=2. DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So one DoU could be a ring and a double bond, or two rings, etc.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU = (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2 = 2. So two degrees of unsaturation, maybe a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or two rings.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU = (2*6+2-10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2 = 2.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU = (14 -12)/2 = 1.

So looking at the NMR, the question says there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests a double bond is present. So the compound has at least one double bond.

The IR data: The broad peak at 3000 is probably O-H. But wait, if it's a broad peak, that's more indicative of an -OH group, like an alcohol. But wait, I thought the 1700 and 1650 are carbonyls. So maybe the compound has an ester group or a ketone and an alcohol?

Wait, another thought: Maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl like an ester or ketone, and 1650 could be an aromatic ring (like conjugated carbonyl in an aromatic system). But the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests an alkene, not necessarily an aromatic ring (since aromatic rings are usually more substituted and might not show as sharp peaks in NMR for vinyl Hs). So perhaps it's an ester with an alkene.

Let me get back to the IR. The broad peak at 3000 is O-H. But in an ester, the O-H from the carboxylic acid is usually not present because esters are formed from acids and alcohols. Wait, unless it's a hemiacetal or something else. Hmm, maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the O-H is from an alcohol. But if the compound has an ester group, the O-H would be from, say, a hydroxyl group elsewhere. But that's possible.

Wait, but the presence of two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650. So that's two carbonyl groups? Maybe. Alternatively, perhaps one is a carbonyl and the other is another functional group. Wait, but 1650 is lower than 1700. Maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, such as in an aromatic ester or something. Alternatively, it could be a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

Let me think about the possible functional groups. For a compound with an ester group, the carbonyl is around 1700-1750. An aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds (like in a carbonyl) might have a peak lower, like 1650. So maybe the structure is something like an acrylate ester, which would have a conjugated system.

Alternatively, the 1650 peak could be an aromatic ring, but that's usually around 1450-1600. Wait, but if it's an aromatic ring with conjugation, maybe it's a carbonyl adjacent to the ring, like in a ketone or ester attached to benzene, which would lower the carbonyl peak. Hmm, but 1650 is more like a carbonyl involved in conjugation, such as an alpha,beta-unsaturated system.

Now, the H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So the compound must have an alkene. Let's think about possible structures. For example, an ester with a double bond nearby, like perhaps methyl vinyl acetate or something similar. Or maybe a cyclic ester with a double bond.

The mass spec shows a fragment at m/z=45. That's a key point. Let's think what fragment would correspond to m/z 45. 45 is the molecular weight of several possibilities. For example, CH3COOH has a molecular weight of 60, but wait, 45 is smaller. Let me think: 45 could be (CH3)2O (which is 45, but that's an ether, but I'm not sure how that would fragment). Alternatively, maybe it's an acylium ion or another fragment. Another possibility is that the fragment is CH3COO- (which would be 60, but maybe not). Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a butyric acid or another group.

Wait, let me calculate the possible molecular weights. Let's consider the options again:

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight is (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16) = 72 +12 +32= 116. 

Option B: C6H10O. 6*12 +10 +16=72+10+16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2. 72 +10 +32=114.

Option D: C6H12O. 72 +12 +16=100.

The mass spec shows a fragment at m/z=45. So which of these compounds can lose a fragment of 45?

Wait, 45 is a key fragment. Let me think about what could have a 45 mass. Let's see, for example, (CH3)2CO is 58, but that's not 45. Maybe a fragment like (CH2)2O would be 44, but the closest is 45. Alternatively, perhaps a (CH3)CO- group. Let's see, CH3CO is 43 (12+1*3 +12 +16 +1*O). Wait, wait, CH3CO is 43 (C=12, H=3, O=16, so 12*2 +3 +16=? No, CH3CO is two carbons: 2*(12) =24, 3 H (CH3) + 2 H (CO) =5 H (but in a fragment, the H may not all be present, but the molecular formula would be C2H5O. Wait, 2 carbons, 5 H, and O. So 12*2 +5 +16 = 48. Hmm, not 45.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the fragment is C3H7O. Let's see, C3H7O would be (3*12) +7 +16 = 36 +7 +16=60, which is too high. Alternatively, maybe C2H5O2. 2*12 +5 +32=24+5+32=61, nope.

Wait, what about CH3OCH2? No, that's 31 (12+16 +12 +2*1=32? No, I'm getting confused. Let's think of the possible fragment that's 45.

Another approach: The molecular formulas of the options.

Option C: C6H10O2. Let's see, possible fragments. Maybe losing a COOCH2CH3 group or something. Wait, but 45 is a smaller fragment. Wait, wait, let's think about common fragment ions. The tropylium ion (C7H7+) is 91, which is higher than 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a methyl ester group. For example, if the compound is an ester like methyl acrylate, which is CH2=CHCOOCH3. The molecular formula would be C5H8O2. But the options here are for C6, so maybe similar but with a larger chain.

Wait, but the options have C6. Let me think about another possibility: maybe (CH2)2COOCH3. No, but that's for a different formula.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a ketene ion or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a methyl group attached to an oxygen, which would lose a fragment.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is (CH3COO), which would be 60, but that's higher than 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is (CH2)2O, which is 44. But the peak is at 45. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the molecular formulas. Let's calculate possible fragments.

Looking at the molecular formula of each option:

Option A: C6H12O2. So the molecular weight is 6*12=72, 12 H=12, O=32. Total 116.

If during fragmentation, the molecule loses a portion of 45, what's left would be 116 -45=71. But 71 doesn't correspond to anything common, unless it's a different fragment.

Option B: C6H10O. Molecular weight is 72 +10 +16=98. If a fragment of 45 is lost, the remaining would be 53. Not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight 72 +10 +32=114. 114-45=69. Not sure.

Option D: C6H12O. Molecular weight 72 +12 +16=100. 100-45=55. Hmm, 55 could be something like C3H7O, but not sure.

Wait, another approach: The fragment at m/z 45 is likely to be a prominent one, maybe a characteristic group. Let's think about the possible functional groups.

If the compound has an ester group, the ester group (O-CO-O-) could fragment. For example, in an ester like RCOOR', the fragment could break between the carbonyl and the oxygen, giving a carboxylic acid ion (RCOO+) and an alcohol (R'OH). But I'm not sure about the exact masses.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketene (O=C=O), but that's more about the structure.

Wait, another thought: The fragment could be a CH3COO- group, which is 60. But that's not 45.

Wait, what's the molecular weight of (COOCH2CH3)? No, that's 74. Hmm.

Let me think about possible fragments from the given formulas. For example, for option C: C6H10O2. If the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, that's a possibility, but wait, that would be C6H10O2. The molecular formula fits.

But how would it fragment? Maybe the ester group breaks down. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule loses an ethylene group (C2H4), but not sure about the mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the acylium ion. The acylium ion for a two-carbon acid would be 43 (CH3CO+ is 43). But the fragment is at 45, which is two more than that. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility is that the fragment is C3H7O+. The molecular weight would be (3*12) +7 +16= 36 +7 +16=60. No, too high.

Wait, wait, think about the molecular formula of the fragment.

If the fragment is 45, what could that be? Let me think about possible combinations.

45 can be:

- C3H7O: (3*12) +7 +16=36+7+16=60 → nope.

- C2H5O2: (2*12) +5 +32=24+5+32=61 → nope.

- C4H9O: 4*12 +9 +16=48+9+16=73 → no.

Alternatively, maybe it's a tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91, which is too high.

Another thought: 45 could be (CH2)2CO, which is 58. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the fragment includes an oxygen and a double bond. For example, formaldehyde (H2CO) is 30, which is too low.

Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, perhaps the fragment is a methyl ester group. For example, CH3COO- would be 60. But I'm not getting 45.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me look at the options and see which one can have a fragment of 45.

Option A: C6H12O2. What's the possible fragment? Maybe losing a C3H6O2 group? Let's see, 3*12=36, 6 H=6, 2 O=32. 36+6 +32=74. But then the remaining would be C3H6O, which is 3*12 +6 +16= 36+6+16=58. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the ester group breaks into a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. For example, if the ester is RCOOR', then the fragment could be RCOO+ which would have a molecular weight of (R's formula plus COO). Let me think about R being CH2CH2... Wait, maybe for a simple ester like ethyl acetate (CH3COOCH2CH3), the fragments can be CH3COO+ (60) or CH2CH3O+ (45). Oh! Wait, CH2CH3O would be C2H5O, which has a molecular weight of (2*12)+(5*1)+16=24+5+16=45. Yes! So if the ester is something like RCOOCH2CH3, then upon fragmentation, the ethyl group (C2H5O) would come off as a fragment with m/z 45.

So in that case, the ester group could lose the ethyl group, leaving the acylium ion. So if the compound is an ester with an ethyl group, then the mass spectrum would show m/z 45 as the fragment from the ethyl group.

So looking back at the options, which ones are esters with ethyl groups?

Wait, the options are about the molecular formula, not the structure. Let's see:

If the compound is an ester, the general formula would be RCOOR', so the formula would be (for R and R' being alkyl groups). So for example, if R is C3H7 and R' is C3H7, the formula would be C6H12O2 (since RCOO would be C4H8O2, R' is C2H5, combined as C6H12O2). Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests an alkene. So the compound likely has a double bond, perhaps conjugated with a carbonyl group, as in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

So for example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. The molecular formula would be C5H8O2. But our options have C6, so perhaps the structure is longer.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. Let's count the carbons: CH2=CH (2 carbons), CH2COO (3 carbons), CH2CH3 (2 carbons) → total 2+3+2=7. No, that's more than 6.

Wait, perhaps the ester is something else. Maybe the ester is a methyl ester, but with a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, which would be C6H10O2 (CH2=CHCOO is 4 carbons, and CH2CH2CH3 is 3 carbons. Wait, no, that's 7 carbons again. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is cyclohexene-based. But I'm not sure.

But going back to the mass spec. If the fragment is 45, which is C2H5O, then perhaps the ester group is ethyl, like OCH2CH3. So the molecular formula would have an ethyl ester group, which implies that the formula includes an ethyl group attached to the oxygen.

Looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. If the structure is RCOOCH2CH3, then R would be C4H9. Because RCOO is C5H10O2. Wait, but 5 carbons in RCOO and 2 in the ethyl would make RCOOCH2CH3 have 5+2=7, which is more than 6. Hmm.

Wait, that's not possible. So maybe the ester is something else. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ethyl propionate, but that would have 5 carbons as well.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a methyl ester. Let's see, if R is C4H7, then RCOOCH3 would be C5H10O2. Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diester or something else.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about all the clues again.

1. IR: Broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 → likely O-H (maybe alcohol or carboxylic acid, but considering the other peaks, perhaps an ester with an O-H elsewhere, but that's less likely). Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, but that's not matching.

Wait, wait. Another possibility: the broad peak at 3000 could be an amide N-H, but the options don't have nitrogen, so that's out.

Wait, another possibility: the broad peak is from an alcohol (O-H). If the compound is an alcohol with a carbonyl, like a ketone. But then the NMR would show O-H peaks, but the question says the NMR has vinyl hydrogens. So maybe it's an alcohol with a carbonyl and a double bond.

But then, the IR has two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650, which are carbonyl stretches. So that suggests two carbonyl groups. So perhaps the compound has two carbonyl groups, like an anhydride or a diketone. But an anhydride would have a higher molecular weight, but looking at the options, some have two oxygen atoms.

Wait, let me think about the options again.

Option C is C6H10O2. That's 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, two oxygen. If it's an ester (which has one oxygen), then perhaps it's a diester or another structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone and another group.

Wait, but the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond. Let's think about possible structures for each option.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation are 2. So two rings or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Suppose it's a cyclic ester (lactone), which would have a ring and an ester group. But then, would it have a double bond? The vinyl hydrogens suggest a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a structure like methyl cyclohexene carboxylate. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the mass spec again. If the fragment is 45, which is C2H5O, perhaps the molecule has an ethyl group attached to an oxygen. So the formula would include an ethyl ester group. So the molecular formula would have O from the ester. Looking at the options, option A and C have two oxygen atoms.

If the ester is ethyl, then the formula of the ester would be RCOOCH2CH3. The formula would be (R: CnH2n+1) COO (CH2CH3). So the molecular formula would be (n+3) carbons, (2n+3 + 2*2 +3?) Wait, maybe a better way is to think:

The ester RCOOR' has molecular formula Cn+1+m H2(n+m)O2.

Wait, for example, ethyl acetate is CH3COOCH2CH3, which is C4H8O2. So for a general RCOOCH2CH3, R is C3H7, making the ester C5H10O2.

But our options have C6, so perhaps R is C4H9.

Wait, R is C4H9. Then RCOO is C5H11O2? Hmm, not sure. Wait, R is C4H9, so RCOO would be C5H10O2. But the ester is RCOOCH2CH3, which is C5+2=7 carbons. So the molecular formula would be C7H14O2.

But our options only go up to C6. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the ester is not ethyl. Maybe it's a methyl ester. So the R' is CH3. Then the formula would be RCOOCH3. The molecular formula for that would be (n+1) C, (2n+3) H, O2.

If the overall formula is C6H10O2 (option C), then RCOOCH3 would be (n+1=6 → n=5). So R would be C5H11. So RCOOCH3 would be C5+1=6 carbons. The H would be 2*5 +3 =13 H? Wait, but the formula is C6H10O2.

Hmm, that doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is something else.

Maybe I'm stuck here. Let me think about another angle.

The IR has two strong carbonyl peaks. So maybe the compound has two carbonyl groups, like a ketone and an ester, or two conjugated carbonyls.

If it's an ester and a ketone, the formula would have at least two oxygen atoms. So looking at the options, options A and C have two oxygen atoms.

The presence of an O-H (broad peak at 3000) suggests an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids have a broad O-H, but in the presence of a carbonyl, which would be around 1700. But the question says two peaks at 1700 and 1650. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid and another carbonyl group. But then the formula would need at least three oxygen atoms, which is not in the options. So perhaps it's an alcohol with an ester and another carbonyl.

Wait, but the options don't have more than two oxygen atoms. So maybe the O-H is from an alcohol group and the compound has an ester and another carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the 3000 cm^-1 peak is not O-H. Could it be an N-H? No, because the options don't include nitrogen.

Wait, another possibility: the broad peak is from a carbonyl group, but that's usually around 1700. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the 3000 peak is from an aromatic C-H stretch, but that's usually around 3000-3100 and more as a set of peaks rather than a broad one. And the presence of vinyl H's in NMR suggests an alkene, not an aromatic ring.

Wait, another thought: maybe the compound is a cyclic ketone with an ester group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diester, but that would require more oxygen atoms.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to summarize the clues:

1. FTIR: Broad peak at 3000 (O-H?), two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 (two carbonyls, possibly conjugated or different types).

2. 1H NMR: Vinyl H's present → double bond.

3. Mass spec: fragment at 45 → likely C2H5O.

Looking at the options, which have two oxygen atoms and can have an ester group.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation 2. Possible structures: a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

If the structure is an ester with a double bond, perhaps something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, that would be more than six carbons. Alternatively, maybe the ester is part of a six-membered ring.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is cyclohexene with an ester substituent. For example, cyclohexene with an ester group attached, like cyclohexene carboxylic acid ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, which would explain the conjugated carbonyl peak at 1650.

If the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, then the IR peaks would correspond to the carbonyl groups. The conjugated carbonyl would be lower in wavenumber, around 1650, and the other carbonyl (like an ester) around 1700.

So, for example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. The molecular formula would be C5H8O2. But our options are for C6. So perhaps the structure is longer.

Wait, what if the ester is attached to a longer chain with a double bond? For example, CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3. Let me count the carbons: CH2CH2COO is 4 carbons, and CH2CH2CH3 is 3, so total 7. No, that's too much.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester with a vinyl group nearby. For example, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. That would be 4 carbons in the ester part (CH2=CHCOO) and 4 in the ethyl group, but that's 8 carbons. No, our option is C6.

Hmm. I think I'm not getting closer. Let me think about the possible answers again.

Option C is C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation is 2. So perhaps a ring and a double bond. For example, a cyclohexene ring with an ester substituent. That would fit the vinyl H's (from the cyclohexene double bond), the two carbonyls (the ester carbonyl and perhaps another from somewhere else, but wait, an ester has only one carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated lactone. That would have a conjugated carbonyl. So the IR would show the carbonyl around 1650 and another near 1700, but wait, a lactone has only one carbonyl. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester with a conjugated double bond, so two carbonyl peaks? No, that wouldn't make sense.

Wait, another angle: the presence of two carbonyl peaks suggests two different types of carbonyl groups. Maybe a ketone and an ester. So the compound has both a ketone and an ester group.

For example, a molecule with both groups, like CH3COOCH2CH2COCH3. But that would be a diester or something else. Let me count the carbons: that structure is 2 (from the first acetate) + 2 (the ethyl) + 2 (the second acetate) + 1 (the central CH2) → 7 carbons. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an ester with a ketone substituent. For example, (CH3)CO-O-CH2-CO-CH3. But that's again more than six carbons.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the mass spec again. If the fragment is 45, which is C2H5O, that's 45. So the parent compound must have an ethyl group attached to an oxygen.

Looking at the options, the molecular formula that includes an ethyl ester group would have the ethyl (C2H5O) as part of the structure, which would contribute to the fragment.

So which options have C2H5O as a part of their structure?

Option A: C6H12O2. If it's an ester, perhaps the ethyl group is part of it. So if the ester is ethyl, then the formula would be RCOOCH2CH3. If R is C4H9, then RCOO would be C5H11O2. So the entire ester would be C5+2=7 carbons, which is more than 6. So that's not possible.

Wait, but if the ester is methyl, then RCOOCH3. So R would be C5H11. Then the ester would be C6H12O2. That matches option A. Because RCOOCH3 would be (C5H11)COOCH3 → C6H12O2.

So if the ester is methyl, then the structure could be something like CH2=CHCOOCH3, but that's C4H6O2. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps another structure. For example, if the ester is ethyl, and the R group is C3H5 (so that RCOOCH2CH3 is C5H8O2. But that's still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the ethyl group is part of a larger structure. Maybe the compound is an ester with an ethyl group and a double bond.

Let me consider option C: C6H10O2. If it's an ester, then RCOOR'. Let's say R is CH2CH2COO and R' is CH2CH3. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester with a vinyl group. For example, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Molecular formula: C5H8O2. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH3. No, that's C6H12O2, which is option A. But then the double bond would be somewhere else.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2COOCH3. That would be C6H10O2 (since CH2=CHCH2COO is 5 carbons, and CH3 is 1, but wait: CH2=CHCH2COO is 4 carbons plus the methyl ester makes 5? Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's count the carbons in CH2=CHCH2COOCH3. CH2=CH (2), CH2COO (3), and CH3 (1) → total 6. So molecular formula would be C6H10O2.

Yes! Because CH2=CHCH2COOCH3 has 6 carbons. The hydrogen count: CH2=CH (4 H), CH2 (2 H), COO (no H), CH3 (3 H). Wait, but wait, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-COOCH3. Let's count all H:

- CH2=CH: each CH2 has 2 H, but in the double bond, it's CH2-CH2 → no, wait, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-COOCH3.

Breaking it down:

CH2=CH- : each CH2 has 2 H, but the double bond reduces the H. So for CH2=CH-, the structure is CH2-CH2, but with a double bond. So each CH in the double bond has one H. So CH2=CH- would have 3 H (two from CH2 and one from CH).

Wait, no. Let me think: CH2=CH-CH2-COOCH3.

The structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-COOCH3.

Each group:

- CH2=CH-: 3 H (each CH has one H, CH2 has two H, but with the double bond, the two CH groups each have one H. So total 2 H on CH2 and 1 H on CH, but perhaps I'm not counting correctly. Alternatively, the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) has two H on the double bond (each CH has one H), and the CH2 group has two H.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think of the formula. The entire molecule is CH2=CHCH2COOCH3.

The formula would be C6H10O2.

Because:

CH2=CHCH2COOCH3 → 6 carbons: 2 (from CH2=CH) + 2 (from CH2) + 2 (from COOCH3)= 6.

Hydrogens: CH2=CH has 4 H (each CH2 has 2 H), but wait, no. The structure is CH2=CH-CH2-COOCH3.

The double bond is between the first and second carbon. So the first CH2 group has 2 H, the second CH has 1 H, the third CH2 has 2 H, the COO has no H, and the CH3 has 3 H. Let me add them up: 2 (CH2) + 1 (CH) + 2 (CH2) + 3 (CH3) = 8 H. But wait, that's only 8. The molecular formula for the structure would be C6H8O2, but option C is C6H10O2.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:

CH2=CH-CH2-COOCH3.

Each CH2 group has 2 H.

CH2=CH- has 3 H: the CH2 has 2 H, the CH has 1 H.

CH2- has another 2 H.

COOCH3 has no H on the carbonyl, but the CH3 has 3 H.

So total H: 2 (CH2=CH) + 1 (CH) + 2 (CH2) + 3 (CH3) → 8 H. Plus any from the COO?

Wait, the COO group has an oxygen but no H. So total 8 H. But the molecular formula for this structure would be C6H8O2, but option C is C6H10O2. So that's a discrepancy.

Hmm, maybe the structure isn't that. Alternatively, perhaps there are more H's.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. Let's count:

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3 → 6 carbons.

Hydrogens: CH2=CH (3 H), COO (no H), CH2CH3 (5 H). Total 3+5=8 H. Again, C6H8O2. Not matching option C (C6H10O2).

Wait, maybe the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated gamma-lactone. But I'm not sure about the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is not an ester but a ketone with another functional group. But that complicates things.

Wait, going back to the IR, the two carbonyl peaks: maybe one is an ester (around 1700) and the other is a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl, which would be lower, around 1650. That fits with the data.

So the structure likely has an ester and a conjugated carbonyl group. The conjugated carbonyl is from a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl, making it an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

So the structure would be something like CH2=CHCOO-R, where R is an alkyl group. Let's say R is methyl, making the formula C4H6O2. Not matching the options.

If R is ethyl, then the formula would be C5H8O2. Still not matching.

Wait, but our options have C6H10O2 (option C). So perhaps the structure is something like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH3. No, that's too many carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's more than six carbons.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating. Let me try a different approach.

The mass spec shows a fragment at m/z=45, which is C2H5O. So the compound must have an ethyl group somewhere. Let's look at the options:

Which options have an ethyl group (C2H5O) as part of their structure?

Option A: C6H12O2. If it's an ethyl ester, then the formula would have (ethyl ester group) and the rest. So the rest would be C4H9O. But the molecular formula would be C6H12O2, which matches option A.

But then, the structure would be RCOOCH2CH3. R would be C4H9, so RCOO would be C5H11O2. Then the ester would be C5+2=7, but that's more than 6. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the ester is not ethyl. Maybe it's a methyl group. Then the fragment would not be 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound isn't an ester but something else that can lose an ethyl group. For example, a tertiary alcohol or some other structure.

Wait, another angle: The molecular formula of the compound is one of the options, and the fragment is 45 (C2H5O). So the molecular formula must be such that when subtracting (C2H5O), the remaining part is possible.

For option C: C6H10O2 - C2H5O = C4H5O. The formula C4H5O would have a molecular weight of (4*12)+(5*1)+16=48+5+16=69. I'm not sure if that makes sense.

Option A: C6H12O2 - C2H5O → C4H7O. MW is 4*12+7+16=48+7+16=71.

Option B: C6H10O - C2H5O → C4H5O. MW 4*12+5+16=69.

Option D: C6H12O - C2H5O → C4H7O. MW 71.

Not sure if that helps.

Another thought: Maybe the fragment is from the loss of a water molecule. But water is 18, which is much lower than 45. So that's probably not it.

Wait, the fragment could be from a ketene ion, which is O=C=O with a positive charge. But the mass would be 44 (O=16, C=12, another O=16 → 44). But the observed fragment is 45. So that's close but not exactly.

Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment that includes an OH group. But I don't see how that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a (CH2)2CO group, which is 44 (but it's 12*3 +2*2 +16= 36 +4 +16=56). No, that's higher.

Wait, another approach: Let me look up the possible fragments that give m/z=45. I might recall that the fragment at 45 is the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but no. Alternatively, it's the CH3COO- group which is 60, but that's higher.

Wait, I think I'm stuck, so I'll try to make an educated guess based on the data.

The presence of vinyl H's suggests an alkene. The IR suggests two carbonyl groups, perhaps an ester and a conjugated carbonyl. The mass spec suggests a fragment of C2H5O (45), which could be an ethyl group.

So the compound is likely an ester with an ethyl group and a conjugated carbonyl (like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester). The molecular formula with six carbons, 10 H, and two O's would be option C.

So the answer is option C.


The unknown compound was analyzed using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The key observations and deductions are as follows:

1. **FTIR Analysis**:  
   - A broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.  
   - Two strong absorption peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ indicate the presence of two carbonyl groups. The peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is consistent with an ester or ketone, while the peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ suggests a conjugated carbonyl group, possibly an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl.

2. **¹H NMR Analysis**:  
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens (H attached to a double bond) indicate the presence of an alkene in the compound.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:  
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 was observed. This corresponds to the molecular formula C₂H₅O, suggesting the presence of an ethyl group (CH₂CH₃) attached to an oxygen atom.

4. **Molecular Formula and Degrees of Unsaturation**:  
   - The molecular formula of the compound must account for the observed data.  
   - Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂): Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 1. This would correspond to a single ring or a single double bond, which does not match the presence of two carbonyl groups and a double bond.  
   - Option B (C₆H₁₀O): DoU = 2. This could correspond to a ring and a double bond but does not match the two carbonyl groups observed in the IR spectrum.  
   - Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂): DoU = 2. This could correspond to a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. It aligns with the presence of two carbonyl groups (e.g., an ester and a conjugated carbonyl) and the ethyl group indicated by the mass spectrometry fragment.  
   - Option D (C₆H₁₂O): DoU = 1. This does not match the presence of two carbonyl groups and a double bond.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The compound is most consistent with option C (C₆H₁₀O₂). It accounts for the two carbonyl groups (one from an ester and one from a conjugated carbonyl), the vinyl hydrogens (indicating a double bond), and the ethyl group (C₂H₅O) observed in the mass spectrometry fragment.
