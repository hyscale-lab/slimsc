Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required to make a specific nucleus reach a speed of 0.96c. Hmm, I need to find the energy, right? Let me think.

Wait, the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Oh, right, Li is lithium, and the common isotopes are like Li-6 and Li-7. Wait, if it's Li with 3 neutrons, the atomic number is 3 for Li, so the mass number would be 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6. So it's Li-6. Got it.

So the nucleus in question is Li-6. I need to calculate its energy when moving at 0.96c. But wait, since it's heavy ions, I think relativistic effects are significant here. So I can't use classical mechanics; I need to use special relativity.

The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Right. So I need to compute gamma for v=0.96c.

Let me compute gamma first. So v is 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me calculate that. Oh wait, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So 1 / 0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, no, wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784? Let me double-check. 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784? Yes. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

But wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. So 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute it with more precision. Let me think: 0.28 squared is 0.0784, correct. So yeah, gamma is about 3.5714.

But to get the energy, I also need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus.

Wait, the mass of a Li-6 nucleus. The nucleus consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton has a mass of about 938.272 MeV/c², but wait, the actual mass of the nucleus is a little less than
