Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question is asking for the relative speed between the astronauts and the total energy of the system. 

So, the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, wait, wait. I think the problem is asking for two things: the relative speed as seen by one astronaut and the total energy of the system. Oh right, because in relativity, adding speeds isn't as straightforward as classical mechanics. 

First, let me tackle the relative speed. I remember that when you're trying to find the relative velocity between two objects moving at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them like in classical physics. Instead, you use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is u' = (u - v) / (1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, which way are we subtracting here? Because relative velocity is from the perspective of one observer. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, what's their relative speed as seen from A's frame?

Wait, no, because both are moving in the same direction. So if A is moving at 0.6c and B is at 0.5c, from A's perspective, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) but that's negative, but in relativity, the formula is a bit more involved. 

So let me set it up properly. The velocity of B as seen from A's frame. Let me denote u as the velocity of B in the original frame, which is 0.5c. The velocity of A (the frame we're moving to) is v = 0.6c. So u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Plugging in the numbers: u = 0.5c, v=0.6c. 

Calculating numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So u' = (-0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ -0.142857c. Since speed is positive, the magnitude is approximately 0.143c. So relative speed is about 0.14c. 

Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's a clue. Now, the total energy of the system. Hmm, total energy in relativity is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So astronaut A: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Let's compute gamma for A: v = 0.6c. So v²/c² = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E_A = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut B: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. So v²/c² is 0.25. 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is approx 0.8660. Gamma is 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So E_B = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 1.1547 *3 is about 3.4641. So E_A is 2.5 and E_B is about 3.4641. Adding them together: 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c². So that's approximately 5.96 m c². 

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc². So the correct total energy is around 5.96, so option C. 

Wait, but wait a second. The question says "the total energy of the system" — does that mean the sum of their energies as observed in the same frame? Like, perhaps the rest frame where both are moving? Or is it each in their own frame? No, the system's total energy would be the sum from the same frame's perspective. But wait, the problem doesn't specify the frame for the energy. Oh, probably, it's the sum in the original frame where both are moving. Hmm, because the problem states that the speeds are in the positive x-direction, so I think the frame is the lab frame where both are moving. So calculating each's energy in that frame and adding them gives the total.

Wait, but alternative approach: sometimes in relativity, when you have multiple objects moving, their energies are added in the same frame. So yes, adding them as I did. So the total energy is 5.96 mc², and relative speed is 0.14c. So that matches option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is determined using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.5c \) (velocity of astronaut B) and \( v = 0.6c \) (velocity of astronaut A). Substituting these values:

\[
u' = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}}
\]

\[
u' = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.143c
\]

The magnitude of the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut A
Mass \( 2m \), velocity \( 0.6c \):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut B
Mass \( 3m \), velocity \( 0.5c \):
\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is \( 5.96mc^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c, E = 5.96mc^2 \)**
