Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 divided by parallax to the fifth power. So the formula is number of stars N proportional to 1/(parallax^5), which I can write as N ∝ 1/plx^5.

Wait, but parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is measured in arcseconds, and the distance r (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of parallax, right? So r = 1/plx. That means plx = 1/r. Hmm, that's a key point.

So the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. Specifically, it's per unit range of distance, so it's about how N depends on r.

Wait, the number of stars in a region... I think this relates to the concept of stellar density and how many stars you can see at different distances. But the way it's phrased, it's about the number varying with parallax. So perhaps we're looking at how the number of stars (N) relates to parallax, and then converting that to a relationship with distance.

Let me think. If N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/r, then substituting plx in terms of r would give us N proportional to (1/( (1/r) )^5 ), right? Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that.

Wait, no, plx is 1/r, so 1/plx is r. So 1/plx^5 would be r^5. So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, that would be N ∝ r^5.

Wait, let me double-check. Because plx = 1/r, so plx^5 = (1/r)^5 = 1/r^5. So taking the reciprocal, 1/(plx^5) would be (r^5).

So N is proportional to r^5. So as the distance r increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of r. That would mean that the number of stars grows rapidly with distance. But wait, that seems counterintuitive because as you look farther away, you're looking into more of the universe, but stars might be more spread out. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused between the number density and the total number in a shell. Let me think about this again. If N is the number of stars in a given region of the sky, perhaps it's the number within a certain volume as a function of distance.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this with an equation. Let's say the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/r, then N ∝ r^5.

But wait, why would the number of stars increase with the fifth power of distance? That seems very steep. Let me think about the factors involved. The number of stars you can observe in a region might depend on how much of the sky you're covering and how deep you look.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a differential number of stars per unit volume, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the relation between parallax and distance. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so as distance r increases, parallax decreases.

So the problem states N varies with 1/plx^5. So N is inversely proportional to plx^5. Since plx is 1/r, that makes N proportional to r^5. So as r increases, N increases as r^5.

So the number of stars in that region would increase with the fifth power of the distance. Looking at the options, option B is ~ r^5. Is that correct?

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Let me think again. Let's model this using calculus. The number of stars per unit volume might depend on distance. But I think the way it's phrased is that N varies with 1/plx^5. So perhaps for a given solid angle, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r is proportional to r^2 (for the surface area) times some function of r.

Wait, maybe I should model it as a differential. Let's say the number of stars in a thin shell at radius r, with thickness dr, is 4π r^2 dr multiplied by some function f(r). So N = 4π r^2 dr * f(r).

But according to the question, N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/r, then 1/plx^5 = r^5. So N ∝ r^5, but wait, N is the number in a region. So perhaps the function f(r) is proportional to r^5. But that doesn't quite fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So if N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx = 1/r, then N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars increases with r^5.

Looking at the options, option B is r^5. So the answer should be B.


The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( r \)) as \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \) into the given relationship, we find:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5
\]

This means the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. Among the options provided, \( r^5 \) corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
