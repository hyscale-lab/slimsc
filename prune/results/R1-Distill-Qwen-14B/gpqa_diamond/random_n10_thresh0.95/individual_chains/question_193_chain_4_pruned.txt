Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, that is, 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are various power laws, like r cubed, r to the fifth, etc.

Hmm, right, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. Wait, no, wait, actually, it's plx (in arcseconds) equals 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So d (parsecs) = 1/plx.

So if the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, substituting d into that, let's see. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 → since plx = 1/d, that would make plx^5 = (1/d)^5 = 1/(d^5). So 1/(plx^5) is d^5. Therefore, N is proportional to d^5? Wait no, because N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, which is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So maybe it's about the differential number of stars with distance. Or perhaps it's about the number density, the number per unit volume or something like that.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the relationship between the number of stars and distance. Let's say you have a region of the sky, and you're looking at stars at different distances. The number of stars in that region as a function of distance would depend on how many stars lie in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr.

Wait, but in this problem, the variation is given as a function of parallax. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Let me think about how to relate this to the number of stars per unit distance.

Wait, maybe I should express N as a function of d. Since plx = 1/d, then 1/(plx^5) is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, that would mean that as d increases, the number of stars increases like d^5. But that doesn't seem right because more distant regions are larger in volume. Wait, but stars are more spread out. So perhaps the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is proportional to d^2 (the surface area of the shell) multiplied by the volume density of stars. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to approach it differently.

The number of stars N is given as proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is a constant. Since plx = 1/d, substituting gives N = k * (d)^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, wait. Wait, N is the total number of stars in the region. But when you consider how many stars are present as you move away from us (the observer), the number of stars at a particular distance depends on the volume of the space you're looking at. So, for example, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with a small thickness dr would be approximately the surface area of the shell (4πd² dr) multiplied by the volume density of stars (n), assuming uniform density. So dN = 4πd² dr * n. But if the density isn't uniform, it changes.

Wait, but in this problem, the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is N ∝ d^5. So for the entire region, the total number of stars up to a distance d is proportional to d^5. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So perhaps it's about the differential number of stars, which would be dN/dr.

If N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr = 5d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance r would increase as r^4. So the correct option would be C, which is r^4.

Wait, but wait again. Let me make sure. So N = k d^5 → dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4, which would correspond to option C.

But wait, another angle: perhaps the relation given is for the number of stars per unit volume, or per unit area? Or perhaps the question is about the number of stars in a given volume as a function of distance.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of flux or surface density. Wait, but the problem says the number varies with parallax as
