Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about symmetries in the SMEFT. I remember SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, which is a framework that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the Standard Model (SM) symmetries. The question is about which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect.

The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these, and I need to pick the correct combination.

Hmm, I think Lorentz symmetry is definitely one because the SM is Lorentz invariant, and SMEFT is an effective theory built on that. So all operators should preserve Lorentz symmetry. That would include Poincare symmetry too because Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. Wait, but sometimes people talk about them separately. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. But does SMEFT require both to be respected?

Wait, SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators should transform covariantly under Lorentz transformations. Poincare symmetry is a broader symmetry that includes translations too. So if the theory is Lorentz-invariant, does that automatically make it Poincare-invariant? I think Poincare symmetry is more about the full spacetime symmetries, including translations, so the effective theory would respect that as well. So both 1 and 2 are required.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because the effective operators in SMEFT are built from SM fields, which transform under Lorentz, and the operators are constructed to be Lorentz scalars. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely respected. Poincare symmetry—since the theory is built in a way that includes all spacetime symmetries, I think that's also respected. So 1 and 2 are correct.

What about CP and CPT symmetry? I remember that the SM is CP-conserving, except for certain processes, but in general, the SM doesn't enforce CP symmetry in all cases. Wait, but in the SMEFT, do the operators have to respect CP? I think they don't necessarily. Because the SMEFT can include terms that violate CP, like operators that break it. So if some operators violate CP, then the whole theory doesn't have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3, CP symmetry, isn't something all operators must respect. So 3 is out.

But what about CPT symmetry? I remember that in quantum field theory, the CPT theorem states that all theories must be CPT symmetric if they are Lorentz-invariant and have a Hermitian Hamiltonian. Because SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry (as we established earlier), it must also respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. So 4 is correct.

So putting it all together: the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait—Poincare includes Lorentz, so if the SMEFT respects Poincare, it must automatically respect Lorentz. So does the question ask which are musts, or which are included?

Wait, the options have 1 and 2 as a pair. So the correct musts would include Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2), but since Poincare includes Lorentz, perhaps the operators must respect Poincare, which in turn ensures Lorentz. So in that case, options 1 and 2 are both required.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "must be respected by all operators." So if an operator respects Poincare, it also respects Lorentz. But could an operator respect Lorentz but not Poincare? I don't think so because Poincare includes both Lorentz and translation invariance. But SMEFT operators are constructed in a way that respects the SM's symmetries, including translation invariance. So Poincare is indeed a symmetry that must be respected.

So the required symmetries are 1, 2, and 4. Wait, but the options don't have all three. Wait, looking at the options again: option C is 1,2,4. Option D is 1,3,4.

Wait, but earlier I thought that CP isn't necessarily required. So the correct ones are 1,2,4. So that would be option C.

But wait, wait—does SMEFT require all operators to respect CPT? Because if the theory is built in a Lorentz-invariant way, then CPT must be respected. Because in any Lorentz-invariant theory, the CPT theorem applies, requiring CPT symmetry.

So then the symmetries that must be respected are 1, 2, and 4. So the correct options would be 1, 2,4. Looking at the options, option C says 1,2,4. So the answer would be C.

But wait, the initial thought was that all operators must respect Lorentz, which is part of Poincare. So Poincare requires both Lorentz and translation symmetry. Since the operators are built with terms that are translationally invariant (as they're part of a local field theory), they must respect Poincare. So yes, 1 and 2 are both correct.

Wait, but the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So all operators must satisfy Lorentz symmetry, which is part of Poincare. So 1 and 2 are both correct.

So the correct options are 1,2,4. So option C is correct.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework built on the Standard Model (SM) symmetries, and operators in SMEFT must respect certain symmetries. Here's the analysis of the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, meaning all operators must transform covariantly under Lorentz transformations. This is a fundamental requirement.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since SMEFT is constructed as a local field theory, it inherently respects translation invariance. Therefore, Poincaré symmetry must also be respected by all operators.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM is generally CP-conserving, but SMEFT allows for operators that explicitly violate CP symmetry. Thus, CP symmetry is not a symmetry that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: In quantum field theory, the CPT theorem ensures that any Lorentz-invariant theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must respect CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
