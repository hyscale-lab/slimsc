Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again.

The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Hmm, I remember that in molecular spectroscopy, molecules can absorb energy in the form of photons, which can cause transitions between different rotational and vibrational states. But wait, the question specifies the 'fundamental state' switching to the next state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. So the molecule is in its ground state, and a photon is absorbed, moving it to the next state. But what's the next state?

I recall that in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized. The energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant and J is the rotational quantum number. But wait, the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model, which probably includes both rotational and vibrational energy states. Oh right, the vibration is another degree of freedom, so the molecule's energy has contributions from both rotation and vibration.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state in vibrational terms is the lowest vibrational state, which is the ground state for vibration (n=0), and for rotation, it's the lowest possible J value (like J=0 or J=1, depending on the selection rules). So in the rigid rotor-vibrator model, the total energy is a combination of rotational and vibrational parts.

But when a photon is absorbed, it's usually a transition where the molecule can either change its rotational state, its vibrational state, or both. But the problem says it's switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think that implies the lowest energy transition possible, which would be the first allowed transition. So the molecule would be in the next higher energy state, which could be either a change in vibrational state or a change in rotational state.

Wait, the photon's energy has to match the energy difference between the initial and final states. So the energy of the photon should be equal to the energy difference between the next state and the fundamental state.

But wait, what's the initial state? The fundamental state is the state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the first excited state, which could be either a higher vibrational state (n=1) or a higher rotational state (like J=1 if J=0 was the initial state).

But which transition is lower in energy? Because the absorption of a photon can cause a transition to either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. Which requires less energy?

I remember that vibrational transitions are usually more energetic because the vibrational energy levels are spaced more closely compared to rotational levels, but wait, no, actually, the spacing between vibrational levels is larger than that of rotational levels. Because the vibrational constant (omega) is higher.

Wait no, the vibrational energy levels have a spacing of h omega, whereas rotational energy levels have a spacing proportional to B, which is much smaller. So a vibrational transition would require a higher energy photon than a rotational transition. So the lower energy transition would be a rotational one.

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule is in its ground state. The next state would be the one with the next higher energy. But if the molecule can undergo a transition to a higher rotational state or a higher vibrational state, which is lower in energy? 

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is in the ground vibrational state, n=0, and the ground rotational state, J=0. The next possible state could be either J=1 or n=1. Which has a lower energy difference?

Let me compute the energies.

The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vibr = (n + 1/2) h w, where w is the angular frequency of vibration. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant. 

Wait, but B is given by (h²)/(8 π² I c²), where I is the moment of inertia. Alternatively, sometimes B is written in terms of the rotational constant, which is (ℏ²)/(2 I).

Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant. And the vibrational energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is h w. The rotational energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2B (since E_rot for J=1 is 2B, and for J=0 is 0).

So, the energy difference for a vibrational transition is h w, and for a rotational transition it's 2B.

So if the molecule is in the ground state (n=0, J=0), the next possible states would be either n=1, J=0 (vibrational transition) or n=0, J=1 (rotational transition). The energy required for the vibrational transition is h w, which is (6.626e-34 Js)(4e14 rad/s) = 2.65e-19 J. For the rotational transition, the energy is 2B.

So the question is, which is smaller: 2B or h w? Because the photon needs to have the momentum corresponding to the lower energy difference.

So to find which transition requires less energy, I need to calculate B.

The rotational constant B is given by B = (h^2)/(8 π² I c²), but wait, no, perhaps it's better expressed as B = (ℏ²)/(2 I), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get the formulas right.

Moment of inertia I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

The rotational energy levels are E_rot = (ℏ²)/(2 I) * J (J + 1), so B = (ℏ²)/(2 I) = (h²)/(8 π² I). So yeah, B is (h²)/(8 π² I).

So let's compute B.

Given:

Mass of X (Mx) = 20 amu

Mass of Y (My) = 2 amu

Bond length r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

Angular frequency w = 4e14 rad/s. Wait, but w is for vibration, not rotation. So we need to compute B, the rotational constant, which depends on the moment of inertia.

Wait, but the question says it's modeled using the rotation-vibration model. So for the non-rigid rotor, the rotational constant might vary with vibration, but I think for this problem, we can treat B as a constant, perhaps, or maybe it's given via the vibrational parameters.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the rotational constant using the given data. Because I have the masses and the bond length.

Yes, so first, calculate the reduced mass μ.

μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 amu * 2 amu)/(22 amu) )= (40)/(22) amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, 20 * 2 =40, 20+2=22, so 40/22 is 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But I need to convert amu to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's compute that.

1.818 *1.6605 is approximately 3.017. So 3.017e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute accurately:

1.818 * 1.6605 = ?

Well, 1.8 *1.6605 = approx 2.989, and 0.018 *1.6605 = approx 0.0299. So total is about 3.0189. So 3.0189e-27 kg.

So μ = 3.0189e-27 kg.

Now, the moment of inertia I is μ r².

r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = (3.0189e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0189e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2075e-46 kg m².

Now, B is (h²)/(8 π² I).

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

So h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

Compute denominator: 8 π² * I.

8 * (pi^2) ≈ 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

Multiply by I: 78.9568 * 1.2075e-46 kg m² = approx 78.9568 *1.2075 is about 95.34. So 95.34e-46 = 9.534e-45 kg m².

So B = (4.39e-67) / (9.534e-45) = approx 4.39e-67 / 9.534e-45.

Divide 4.39 by 9.534: approximately 0.46.

Then exponents: 1e-67 / 1e-45 = 1e-22.

So B ≈ 0.46e-22 = 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let's calculate more accurately.

Wait, wait. Wait, 8 π² I = 8 * (π^2) * I.

Let me compute 8 * π²:

pi ≈ 3.1416, pi² ≈9.8696, 8*9.8696 ≈78.9568.

So 78.9568 * I = 78.9568 * 1.2075e-46 = let's compute 78.9568 *1.2075.

78.9568 * 1 =78.9568

78.9568 *0.2 =15.79136

78.9568 *0.0075= approx 0.592176.

Adding up: 78.9568 +15.79136=94.74816 + 0.592176=95.340336.

So 95.340336e-46 = 9.5340336e-45 kg m².

h² is (6.626e-34)^2 = (6.626)^2 * 1e-68.

6.626^2 is approx 43.904.

So h²=43.904e-68 = 4.3904e-67 J² s².

So B = (4.3904e-67) / (9.5340336e-45) = ?

Calculating 4.3904e-67 /9.534e-45 = (4.3904/9.534) * 1e-22.

4.3904 /9.534 ≈0.4604.

So B ≈0.4604e-22 J.

Wait, but what's the unit of B? It's in Joules. But I think the rotational energy levels are usually expressed in terms of cm^-1 or wavenumbers. Maybe I should double-check.

Wait, no, B is in Joules. So B = approximately 4.604e-23 J? Wait, no, because 0.4604e-22 is 4.604e-23.

So B ≈4.604e-23 J.

So the energy difference for a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is 2B, which is 2 *4.604e-23 = 9.208e-23 J.

Compare that to the vibrational energy difference, which is h w.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s, w=4e14 rad/s.

So h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

So 9.2e-23 J is much less than 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy.

Thus, the molecule would first undergo a rotational transition, moving from J=0 to J=1, requiring a photon with energy E_photon = 2B = 9.208e-23 J.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the momentum of the photon. So the momentum p is related to the energy by E = p c, where c is the speed of light.

Wait, because the energy of a photon is E = p c, so p = E / c.

So the momentum p is E_photon divided by c.

So p = (2B) / c.

Wait, but wait, the energy for the transition is 2B, so p = (2B)/c.

So let's compute that.

Given B =4.604e-23 J, 2B=9.208e-23 J.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.208e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = (9.208 /3) * 1e-31 kg·m/s.

9.208 /3 is approx 3.069. So 3.069e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, wait, kg·m/s is the same as N·s because N = kg·m/s². So kg·m/s = N·s.

So p ≈3.069e-31 N·s.

But looking at the options, none of them are close to 1e-31. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) 1.9e-28 Ns
B) 2.3e-27 Ns
C)1.1e-27 Ns
D)1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, all options are about 1e-27 or 1e-28. My calculation gives about 3e-31, which is way off. So I must have made a mistake.

Hmm, where did I go wrong? Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units somewhere. Let's go back.

Compute μ:

Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 *2 )/(20+2) =40/22 ≈1.818 amu.

1 amu =1.6605e-27 kg. So μ=1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg.

Calculating that: 1.818 *1.6605 = let's compute it accurately.

1.818 * 1.6605:

1.818 *1 =1.818

1.818 *0.6 =1.0908

1.818 *0.06 =0.10908

1.818 *0.0005=0.000909.

Adding them up: 1.818 +1.0908=2.9088; 2.9088 +0.10908=3.01788; 3.01788 +0.000909≈3.01879.

So μ ≈3.01879e-27 kg.

Then I = μ r² = 3.01879e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 is 4e-20 m².

So I=3.01879e-27 *4e-20 =1.2075e-46 kg m².

Then B = h²/(8 π² I) = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 π² *1.2075e-46).

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = (6.626)^2 = 43.904, so 43.904e-68 =4.3904e-67 J² s².

Denominator: 8 π² * I = 8*9.8696 *1.2075e-46.

8 *9.8696 =78.9568. 78.9568 *1.2075e-46 = let's compute 78.9568 *1.2075.

78.9568 *1 =78.9568

78.9568 *0.2 =15.79136

78.9568 *0.0075 = approximately 0.592176.

Adding: 78.9568 +15.79136 =94.74816 +0.592176=95.340336.

So 95.340336e-46 =9.5340336e-45 kg m².

So B =4.3904e-67 /9.5340336e-45 = (4.3904 /9.5340336) * 1e-22.

4.3904 /9.5340336 ≈0.4604.

So B ≈0.4604e-22 J =4.604e-23 J.

So that's correct.

So 2B is 9.208e-23 J.

Now, photon's energy E_photon = 2B =9.208e-23 J.

Photon's momentum p = E_photon / c.

c is 3e8 m/s.

p =9.208e-23 /3e8 =3.069e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but kg m/s is N s, since N = kg m/s².

So p =3.069e-31 N s.

Looking at the options, the smallest option is D) 1.4e-28 Ns, which is about 1.4e-28, or 1400e-31.

Wait, my calculation gives about 3e-31, which is way smaller than any of the given options. So something is wrong.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the selection of which transition is being considered. Because the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and it's switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the next state is the first vibrational state, not the first rotational state.

Wait, but earlier analysis said that the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational one. So why would the answer be so much higher?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can't have a rotational transition because it's in the ground state, and the first transition would be a vibrational one, but that doesn't make sense because I just computed that the vibrational transition requires much higher energy.

Wait, perhaps the question is mixing up the rigid rotor and the non-rigid rotor. Wait, in the rigid rotor, the rotational energy levels are quantized, but in the non-rigid rotor, the bond length can change, which affects the moment of inertia. Hmm, but I don't think that's affecting this calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the photon's momentum is being considered for a vibrational transition. Let me recalculate, assuming the energy difference is the vibrational transition.

So E_photon = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p = E_photon / c =2.6504e-19 /3e8 = approx 8.835e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28. My calculation gives about 8.8e-28, which is close to these options but not exactly matching. But perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 26.504e-20 =2.6504e-19 J. Yes.

Then p =2.6504e-19 /3e8 = 8.8347e-28 kg m/s =8.8347e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A (1.9e-28), option B (2.3e-27), option C (1.1e-27), option D (1.4e-28). 8.8e-28 is not exactly matching any, but perhaps I should recheck.

Wait, maybe the question is about the transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the first excited vibrational state (n=1, J=0), which requires a photon of energy h w. Alternatively, it could be a transition that changes both n and J, but in that case, the energy would be the sum of the vibrational and rotational transitions, which would be higher.

Wait, but according to selection rules, for a vibrational transition, the rotational state can change by ±1 in J. But for the purposes of the lowest energy transition, the molecule would preferentially make the transition that requires the least energy, which would be the rotational one if possible. But if the rotational transition isn't allowed, then it would go for the vibrational.

Wait, perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational transitions are allowed when J changes by ±1, but the vibrational transitions may also have J changing. But regardless, the energy for the vibrational transition is much higher.

But according to the earlier calculation, the rotational transition requires less energy. So why am I getting a p of 3e-31 N s, which isn't among the options?

Wait, perhaps the model includes both rotation and vibration, and so the energy difference is the sum of the rotational and vibrational parts.

Wait, but that can't be because 2B is much smaller than h w. So the total energy difference would be h w + 2B. But that would make the photon's energy larger, which doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is implying that the molecule is in a state where both vibrational and rotational transitions are possible, but the next state is the first possible, so perhaps the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational and lowest rotational state.

Wait, if the molecule is in n=0 (vibrational ground state), J=0 (rotational ground state), the next state could be either n=1, J=0 or n=0, J=1.

Which transition requires less energy? As computed earlier, 2B is 9.2e-23 J (for J=0→1) is less than h w (2.65e-19 J) for n=0→1.

Therefore, the molecule will absorb a photon with energy 2B, causing a rotational transition.

But as I calculated, that gives p=3e-31 Ns, which isn't any of the options. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the vibrational transition. Let me compute p for h w.

p = (h w)/c = (6.626e-34 *4e14) /3e8.

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

Divide by 3e8: 2.6504e-19 /3e8 ≈8.8347e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, none match exactly, but option A is 1.9e-28, which is about half of that, and option D is 1.4e-28. So why am I getting a factor of about 3 off?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for B.

Wait, another formula for the rotational constant is B = (h^2)/(8 π² I c²), but wait, no, that's not right. Because B is in energy units, so perhaps I have an error in the formula.

Wait, let me double-check the formula for the rotational energy levels. The rotational energy is E_rot = (h²/(8 π² I)) J (J+1). So B = h²/(8 π² I).

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, h is 6.626e-34 J s.

So h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = (6.626)^2 * 1e-68.

6.626 squared is approximately 43.90, so h² =43.90e-68 J² s².

Wait, no, 6.626e-34 squared is (6.626)^2 * (1e-34)^2 =43.90 * 1e-68 =4.390e-67 J² s².

Yes, that's correct.

Denominator is 8 π² I = 8*(9.8696)*1.2075e-46 kg m².

8 *9.8696 =78.9568.

78.9568 *1.2075e-46 =95.34e-46 kg m² =9.534e-45 kg m².

So B =4.390e-67 /9.534e-45 =4.390e-67 /9.534e-45 = (4.390/9.534) *1e-22.

4.390 /9.534 ≈0.4604.

So B=0.4604e-22 J =4.604e-23 J.

So that's correct.

So 2B =9.208e-23 J.

Then p=9.208e-23 /3e8=3.069e-31 kg m/s.

Which is 3.069e-31 N s.

Which is nowhere near the options given. Therefore, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.

Alternative approach: Maybe the question is considering a transition that includes both a vibrational and rotational change, but that would require a higher energy, which doesn't make sense as the next state with the lowest energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the model here is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor, but in reality, the question states non-rigid rotor, which complicates things because the bond length can change.

Wait, but in the non-rigid rotor model, the vibrational energy levels are considered, and the bond length can change, which affects the moment of inertia. So perhaps the rotational constant varies with the vibrational state. However, for the fundamental state (n=0), the bond length is approximately r0, the equilibrium bond length.

So for the fundamental state, the rotational constant is based on r0, which is given as 2 angstroms.

Hmm, perhaps I didn't make a mistake in the calculation, but perhaps the problem is asking about the transition where both rotation and vibration change, but that would require higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition is a combination of vibration and rotation. For example, a photon causes a vibrational transition from n=0 to n=1, but also a change in rotational state, say from J=0 to J=1. But that would require more energy than just the vibrational transition.

Wait, but in that case, the energy would be E = h w + 2B, which is much larger than h w. So the photon's energy would be higher, which would lead to a higher momentum, but again, that doesn't match the options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the correct transition. The question says, "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So perhaps the next state is the first excited state, which could be a combination of both vibrational and rotational changes, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the next state refers to the next higher energy state, regardless of whether it's rotational or vibrational. If the molecule is in the ground state (n=0, J=0), the next higher state would be either n=1, J=0 (E=h w) or n=0, J=1 (E=2B). Since 2B is smaller (as we calculated 9.2e-23 J is much smaller than 2.65e-19 J), the next state would be n=0, J=1. So the photon's energy is 2B, leading to p=3e-31 N s.

But the options don't have that. So I'm stuck. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the rotational constant B in terms of wavenumbers, but that might not apply here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires using the vibrational energy, and I missed something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state in the vibrational mode. So the energy difference is h w, leading to p=8.8e-28 Ns, which is close to option A (1.9e-28) but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the reduced mass. Let me recalculate the reduced mass.

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

μ = (20 *2 ) / (20 +2 )=40/22=20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should express the mass in kilograms correctly.

1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 * 2)/(22) * 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

20*2=40, 40/22=1.81818...

So μ=1.81818 *1.66053906660e-27 kg.

Let me compute that:

1.81818 *1.66053906660e-27.

1.81818 *1.66053906660 = ?

Let me compute 1.8 *1.660539 = approximately 2.989.

But let me compute more accurately.

1.81818 * 1.66053906660:

Compute as:

1.81818 *1 =1.81818

1.81818 *0.6 =1.090908

1.81818 *0.06=0.1090908

1.81818 *0.000539066 =approx 0.000979.

Adding all up:

1.81818 +1.090908=2.909088

2.909088 +0.1090908=3.0181788

3.0181788 +0.000979≈3.0191578.

So μ≈3.0191578e-27 kg.

Wait, that's very close to the earlier calculation of 3.018e-27. So no mistake there.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me check the formula for the rotational energy levels again.

E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant.

Ah, wait, perhaps I should have used B = h/(8 π² c I), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, because B is in energy units.

Wait, another formula for B is B = (h²)/(8 π² I c²), but I'm not certain. Wait, perhaps I confused the formula with the rotational partition function or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps B is expressed in terms of angular frequency. Because sometimes B is written as ħ²/(2 I), where ħ is h/(2 π).

So ħ = h/(2 π).

So B = ħ²/(2 I) = (h²)/(4 π² * 2 I) )= (h²)/(8 π² I).

Yes, that's correct. So the earlier calculation for B is correct.

So I'm not seeing an error in the calculation. Therefore, perhaps the question is about a vibrational transition, and I should proceed with that.

So let's compute p for the vibrational transition.

E_photon = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p = E_photon / c =2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 kg m/s =8.8347e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about twice smaller than this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h w.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *4e14 =?

6.626 *4 =26.504.

e-34 *e14 =e-20.

So 26.504e-20 J =2.6504e-19 J. Correct.

So perhaps the answer is not among the options, but that's impossible because it's a multiple-choice question. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: Maybe the problem is asking for the transition that causes a change in both vibrational and rotational state. For example, the molecule goes from (n=0, J=0) to (n=1, J=1). The energy difference would be E_vibrational + E_rotational.

E_vibrational = h w (from n=0 to n=1).

E_rotational = B (J=1) - B (J=0) = 2B.

So total E = h w + 2B.

Then p = (h w + 2B) / c.

But that would make the energy much larger than either case. Let's compute p.

h w is 2.6504e-19 J.

2B is 9.208e-23 J. So adding them gives 2.6504e-19 +9.208e-23 ≈2.6504e-19 J (since the second term is negligible).

Thus, p would be ≈8.8e-28 Ns, same as before.

So that's not matching the options either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor, but in that case, the energy differences would be the same as calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm not considering the correct selection rules. For a diatomic molecule, the selection rule for vibration is Δn=±1, and for rotation ΔJ=±1. So a photon can cause a transition that changes both n and J.

But in that case, the energy would be the sum. However, for the next state with the lowest energy, it's more likely to be a single transition.

Hmm, another possibility: perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next available state, which may be a rotational transition. But according to the calculation, that would require a momentum of approximately 3e-31 Ns, which is not an option.

This is confusing. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 1.9e-28

B)2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

The only option close to what I calculated for the vibrational transition is A and D.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the vibrational energy. Let me recheck.

h w =6.626e-34 J·s *4e14 rad/s =?

Yes, 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p =E/c =2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 Ns.

But that's not an option. The closest is option A (1.9e-28) and option D (1.4e-28). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the given angular frequency w is not the vibrational frequency but the rotational frequency. Or perhaps I mixed up the rotational and vibrational constants.

Wait, no, the problem says w is the angular frequency of vibration.

Wait, maybe the problem is expecting the photon to have energy corresponding to the rotational transition, but for some reason, I'm getting a value that doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the rigid rotor, not the non-rigid one. Let's see.

But no, the question states it's the non-rigid rotor model, which includes both rotation and vibration.

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate the ratio of the two possible p values.

p_rot =3.069e-31 Ns.

p_vibr=8.8347e-28 Ns.

So the ratio is approx 1e-4. So p_rot is much smaller than p_vibr. The options are all around 1e-27, which is about 1e4 times larger than p_vibr.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion somewhere. Let me recheck the calculation for B.

Wait, another way to compute B is:

B = (h²)/(8 π² I).

I is the moment of inertia.

I = μ r².

μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) in kg.

Mx=20 amu =20 *1.6605e-27 kg =3.321e-26 kg.

My=2 amu =3.321e-27 kg.

So μ = (3.321e-26 kg *3.321e-27 kg)/(3.321e-26 +3.321e-27 ) = (1.102e-52)/(3.653e-26) )=3.017e-27 kg.

r=2e-10 m.

I=3.017e-27 * (2e-10)^2 =3.017e-27 *4e-20 =1.2068e-46 kg m².

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

So B = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 π² *1.2068e-46).

6.626e-34 squared is 4.39e-67.

Denominator:8 *9.8696=78.9568.

78.9568 *1.2068e-46 =95.33e-46 =9.533e-45.

So B =4.39e-67 /9.533e-45 =4.39/9.533 *1e-22.

4.39/9.533 ≈0.46.

So B=4.6e-23 J.

So 2B=9.2e-23 J.

p_rot=9.2e-23/3e8=3.066e-31 Ns.

Again, same result.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the transition that involves both vibrational and rotational changes, but I don't think that's the case because the energy would be higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from the fundamental vibrational state to the next vibrational state, but that would be a much higher energy photon.

I'm stuck. Let me think about the options. Only option D is in the 1e-28 range, but my vibrational calculation gives 8.8e-28, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for p?

Wait, the photon's energy is E = h f = p c. So p = E / c.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is not considering the rotational transitions, and the next state is the first vibrational state. So the correct p is 8.8e-28 Ns, but that's not an option. So perhaps the given options are wrong, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational transition's energy, and the correct p is 2.3e-27 Ns (option B). But how?

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula for B. Let me check if B is given in terms of wavenumbers (cm^-1) instead of Joules. Because sometimes B is expressed in wavenumbers.

Wait, wavenumbers (tilde{B}) are in cm^-1 and are related to energy by E = h c tilde{B}.

So perhaps I should calculate tilde{B} in cm^-1 and then compute the energy.

Wait, but I think that's complicating things. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of wavenumbers and then find the corresponding photon energy.

But I'm not sure. Let me try.

The rotational constant B in wavenumbers (tilde{B}) is given by:

tilde{B} = B/(h c) = (h²/(8 π² I)) / (h c) )= h/(8 π² I c).

Wait, no, let's compute that correctly.

tilde{B} = B * (1/(h c)).

Because B is in Joules, and h c has units of J m, so tilde{B} would be in m^{-1}.

But wavenumbers are typically in cm^{-1}, so tilde{B}= B/(h c) * 1e2 cm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute tilde{B} in cm^{-1}.

Compute tilde{B} = (h c)/(8 π² I c^2) )= h/(8 π² I c).

Wait, no, let me get the correct formula.

The energy for rotational levels is E_rot = tilde{B} h c J (J+1), where tilde{B} is in cm^-1.

So B (in J) = tilde{B} h c.

Wait, that's correct. So tilde{B} = B/(h c).

So B in J is B = tilde{B} h c.

So let's compute tilde{B}.

B is 4.604e-23 J.

h c =6.626e-34 J·s *3e8 m/s =1.9878e-25 J·m.

So tilde{B} =4.604e-23 /1.9878e-25 ≈23.16 cm^-1.

So each rotational transition would involve a photon with energy corresponding to 2 tilde{B}.

But wait, the energy for the rotational transition is 2B = 2 *4.604e-23 J =9.208e-23 J.

Which in wavenumbers would be 9.208e-23 J / (h c) )= (9.208e-23)/(6.626e-34 *3e8) )= (9.208e-23)/(1.9878e-25) )= approx 463.3 cm^-1.

Wait, but how does that help me with the momentum?

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just accept that the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the transition that leads to the next state in the vibrational mode, but considering the moment of inertia in the non-rigid rotor model, which depends on the vibrational state. But that complicates things, and I'm not sure how to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the photon's momentum is calculated using the reduced mass, but I'm not seeing how.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of μ. Let me recompute μ.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22 ≈1.81818 amu.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, maybe the problem expects the mass to be in atomic mass units without converting to kg. But that would be incorrect because the formula for B requires kg.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the rotational constant is different. Let me look up the formula again.

The moment of inertia I = μ r².

Rotational energy levels: E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) J (J+1).

Where ħ = h/(2 π).

So E_rot = (h²/(8 π² I)) J (J+1).

So B = h²/(8 π² I).

Which is what I used.

Hmm, so I'm not seeing the mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the bond length in a different unit. Wait, the bond length is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. Did I use that correctly?

Yes, I used 2e-10 m.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute the rotational constant in terms of the vibrational frequency. But I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the harmonic oscillator model for vibration and the rigid rotor model for rotation, and calculate the energy difference for the transition to the next state, which could be a combination of both.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about possible mistakes.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to multiply by 2 for the rotational transition. No, because 2B is already the energy for J=0→1.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the photon's energy as the sum of the vibrational and rotational energy differences, but that would make the momentum higher, not lower.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the transition from the fundamental vibrational state to the first excited vibrational state, which requires a photon of energy h w, and the momentum is p = h w / c.

As computed earlier, that gives p=8.8e-28 Ns, which is close to option A (1.9e-28) but not exactly matching. But perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, let me compute 6.626e-34 *4e14 = ?

6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) *1e-34+14 = 26.504e-20 =2.6504e-19 J.

p=2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.83466666667e-28 Ns.

So approximately 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A (1.9e-28) and D (1.4e-28), but neither is close.

Wait, perhaps the given options are incorrect, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question, and the correct answer is the rotational transition, which would be much smaller, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the first state with a higher energy, which could be a vibrational transition, and I should proceed with that.

But then why is the calculated p not matching any option?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the vibrational energy. Let me recompute it.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E_photon = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p = E_photon /c =2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 Ns.

So that's correct.

Wait, the options don't have this value, but perhaps option A is the intended answer, perhaps due to a miscalculation elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to a higher rotational state and I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is modeled as a non-rigid rotor, so the moment of inertia varies with vibration. But for the fundamental state, the bond length is at its equilibrium value, so I is based on r0=2 angstroms.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the speed of light. Let me check.

In some calculations, c is taken as 3e8 m/s, but sometimes more precise values like 2.9979e8 m/s are used. Let me try using c=3e8 m/s for the calculations.

No, that doesn't change much.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Planck's constant. Let me see.

h=6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value).

Using that, E_photon=6.62607015e-34 *4e14=2.65042806e-19 J.

p=2.65042806e-19 /3e8 =8.83476e-28 Ns.

Same as before.

Hmm.

Given that none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I don't see why. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the first rotational state to the next, but that would require E=2B, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the question is not considering the fundamental state as the ground state for rotation. For example, perhaps the fundamental state is J=1, and the next state is J=2. But that would require E=6B, which would make p even smaller.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial state is J=0 and the next state is J=2, but that would require E=6B, which makes the p even smaller.

I'm stuck. Based on the calculation, the correct p for the vibrational transition is 8.8e-28 Ns, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I can't see why.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule absorbs a photon to transition to the next allowed vibrational state, which requires E=h w, and the p is 8.8e-28 Ns, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to have a different value for w.

Wait, perhaps the given w is in terms of wavenumbers, but that's not likely.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different value for the reduced mass, but I've double-checked that.

Given all this, I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is not among the options provided, but that's unlikely. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the problem using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule's energy is a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. The fundamental state corresponds to the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state with the lowest energy could either be a vibrational transition (n=1, J=0) or a rotational transition (n=0, J=1). 

### Key Calculations:
1. **Reduced Mass (μ):**
   The reduced mass is calculated as:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} \, \text{amu} = 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
   \]
   Converting to kilograms:
   \[
   \mu = 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.019 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
   \]

2. **Moment of Inertia (I):**
   The moment of inertia is given by:
   \[
   I = \mu r^2 = (3.019 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2076 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
   \]

3. **Rotational Constant (B):**
   The rotational constant is:
   \[
   B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \pi^2 \cdot 1.2076 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.604 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   The energy difference for a rotational transition (J=0 → J=1) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \cdot 4.604 \times 10^{-23} = 9.208 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

4. **Photon Momentum for Rotational Transition:**
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by:
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E}{c} = \frac{9.208 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.069 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}.
   \]
   This value is orders of magnitude smaller than any of the provided options, indicating that the rotational transition is not relevant here.

5. **Photon Momentum for Vibrational Transition:**
   The vibrational energy difference is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.6504 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   The corresponding photon momentum is:
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E}{c} = \frac{2.6504 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.835 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (1.9 × 10⁻²⁸ Ns):** This is approximately half the calculated value for the vibrational transition.
- **Option B (2.3 × 10⁻²⁷ Ns):** This is much larger than the calculated vibrational transition momentum.
- **Option C (1.1 × 10⁻²⁷ Ns):** This is also much larger than the calculated vibrational transition momentum.
- **Option D (1.4 × 10⁻²⁸ Ns):** This is smaller than the calculated vibrational transition momentum.

The calculated momentum for the vibrational transition (8.835 × 10⁻²⁸ Ns) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **A (1.9 × 10⁻²⁸ Ns)**, which may reflect an approximation or rounding in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations, the most reasonable choice, despite discrepancies, is **Option A**.

Answer: A
