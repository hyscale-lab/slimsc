Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the problem is asking.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz, each represented by 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. I need to find the normalized eigenvector's elements from the given options.

First, I remember that for a quantum mechanical operator, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are found by solving the eigenvalue equation: P |ψ> = λ |ψ>, where λ is the eigenvalue. But here, the operator is along an arbitrary direction, which suggests that we need to consider the operator in that direction. 

Wait, the operator isn't directly given as P, but as its components along x, y, and z. Oh right, the operator along a direction n (which lies in the x-z plane) can be written as P = (P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z). So first, I need to express P in terms of these components.

But wait, since n is in the x-z plane, its y-component must be zero. So n = (n_x, 0, n_z). But that's a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. Hmm, but the problem says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so perhaps I can parametrize it using an angle. Let's see, maybe n_x = cosθ and n_z = sinθ, but wait, that depends on the convention. Or wait, sometimes in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle, so maybe it's more natural to have n_x = cosθ and n_z = sinθ, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, sometimes θ is measured from the z-axis, so cosθ would be along z. Hmm, maybe it's better to think of it as n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ, because the direction is in the x-z plane, so the angle is from the x-axis towards z. Not sure, but perhaps that's a detail I can handle as I go.

But wait, the operator P is along n, so P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). But since n has no y-component, the Py term will be zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Each component (P_x, P_y, P_z) is (ħ/2) multiplied by their respective matrices. So I'll need to write out each matrix and then form the operator P.

Let me write down the matrices:

P_x matrix: [[0, 1],[1, 0]]
P_y matrix: [[0, -i],[i, 0]]
P_z matrix: [[1, 0],[0, -1]]

Each multiplied by ħ/2.

So, substituting these into P:

P = (n_x * ħ/2 * [[0,1],[1,0]]) + (n_z * ħ/2 * [[1,0],[0,-1]])

Wait, but wait. Since n is a unit vector in x-z plane, n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ, perhaps. Or maybe n_z is positive, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can express it as n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), which would make sense if θ is the angle from the z-axis. Wait, no, in the x-z plane, the angle from the z-axis would have θ as the polar angle, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm overcomplicating that part. Let me just proceed.

So, P = (ħ/2)(n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]])

Let me compute this matrix. Let me denote n_x and n_z as cosθ and sinθ, respectively, perhaps. So:

P = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Is that right? Because when you add the matrices:

n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] gives [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]]
n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] gives [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]

Adding them together:

Top-left: 0 + n_z = n_z
Top-right: n_x + 0 = n_x
Bottom-left: n_x + 0 = n_x
Bottom-right: 0 + (-n_z) = -n_z

So the matrix becomes [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]], multiplied by ħ/2.

So the operator P is (ħ/2) times this matrix.

Now, the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ħ/2)|v>, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the equation becomes:

(ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Wait, no. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so the equation is:

P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

So substituting P:

(ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

We can factor out ħ/2:

(ħ/2) [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

So if I multiply both sides by 2/ħ, I get:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] |v> = |v>

So the matrix equation is:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

Wait, no. The vector is |v> = [a; b], a column vector. So the equation is:

n_z a + n_x b = a
n_x a - n_z b = b

So, let me write these two equations:

1) n_z a + n_x b = a
2) n_x a - n_z b = b

Let me rearrange each equation:

Equation 1: (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
Equation 2: n_x a - (n_z + 1) b = 0

So, we have a system of two equations:

(n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
n_x a - (n_z + 1) b = 0

This system must have a non-trivial solution (since eigenvectors are non-zero), so the determinant of the coefficients must be zero. Alternatively, we can solve for a and b.

Let me try to solve equation 1 and equation 2.

From equation 1: (n_z - 1) a = -n_x b => a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b

But let me see if I can find a relation between a and b.

Alternatively, let's express equation 2 in terms of a and b.

Equation 2: n_x a = (n_z + 1) b => a = [ (n_z + 1) / n_x ] b

Wait, but from equation 1, a is also equal to [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

So setting them equal:

(n_z + 1)/n_x * b = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b

Assuming b ≠ 0, we can cancel it:

(n_z + 1)/n_x = -n_x/(n_z -1)

Cross-multiplying:

(n_z +1)(n_z -1) = -n_x^2

Left side: (n_z^2 - 1) = -n_x^2

So n_z^2 -1 = -n_x^2 => n_z^2 + n_x^2 = 1

Which is correct because n is a unit vector. So this doesn't give any new information, which makes sense because the equations are consistent.

So, from equation 2, a = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b

So the eigenvector can be expressed in terms of b as:

a = [ (n_z +1) / n_x ] b

So the vector is proportional to [ (n_z +1)/n_x , 1 ]^T.

But wait, that's modulo a scalar multiple. Alternatively, perhaps I can express this in terms of θ, since n_x and n_z are cosθ and sinθ. Let me assume n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ. Then:

a = [ (sinθ + 1) / cosθ ] b

So the vector becomes [ (sinθ +1)/cosθ, 1 ]^T multiplied by b.

To make it normalized, I'll have to find the normalization condition.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to parameterize the vector as (a, b) = [ ... ].

Wait, let me write the normalized eigenvector. Let me denote b as a parameter. Then a = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b.

So the vector is [ (n_z +1)/n_x , 1 ] multiplied by b. But to normalize, I need to compute the normalization factor.

Wait, the vector is |v> = [ (n_z +1)/n_x * b, b ].

The inner product is |v|² = | (n_z +1)/n_x |² |b|² + |b|² = [ ( (n_z +1)^2 )/(n_x^2) + 1 ] |b|² 

But since n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, perhaps I can write this in terms of θ.

Wait, let's substitute n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ.

So, a = (sinθ + 1)/cosθ * b

Then the vector is [ (sinθ +1)/cosθ * b, b ]

The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

So:

| (sinθ +1)/cosθ * b |² + |b|² = 1

= [ (sinθ +1)^2 / cos²θ ) + 1 ] |b|² = 1

Simplify the term inside:

(sinθ +1)^2 / cos²θ + 1 = [ (sin²θ + 2 sinθ +1 ) + cos²θ ] / cos²θ

Because when you multiply numerator and denominator by 1, it's (sinθ +1)^2 / cos²θ + (cos²θ)/cos²θ.

So numerator: sin²θ + 2 sinθ +1 + cos²θ.

But sin²θ + cos²θ =1, so numerator becomes 1 + 2 sinθ +1 = 2(1 + sinθ)

Denominator: cos²θ.

So the entire term is [2(1 + sinθ)] / cos²θ.

So:

[2(1 + sinθ) / cos²θ ] |b|² =1

So |b|² = cos²θ/( 2(1 + sinθ) )

But 1 + sinθ = (sin(θ/2) + cos(θ/2))², and cosθ = cos²(θ/2) - sin²(θ/2) = (cos(θ/2) - sin(θ/2))(cos(theta/2)+sin(theta/2)).

Alternatively, I can write 1 + sinθ = 2 sin²(theta/2 + pi/4), but perhaps it's easier to take square roots.

Let me compute |b|:

|b| = sqrt( cos²θ / [ 2(1 + sinθ) ] )

= [ cosθ ] / sqrt( 2(1 + sinθ) )

But wait, cosθ can be positive or negative, but in the x-z plane, the direction is arbitrary, so perhaps we can choose theta in a range where cosθ is positive, like from -pi/2 to pi/2. So cosθ is positive, so we can write |b| = cosθ / sqrt( 2(1 + sinθ) )

Hmm, but perhaps I can simplify this expression.

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(2) sqrt(1 + sinθ):

Wait, but perhaps I can rationalize the denominator.

Let me write 1 + sinθ as [sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2)]^2, but not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, let's use the identity 1 + sinθ = 2 cos^2(theta/2 - pi/4), but maybe another approach.

Let me consider multiplying numerator and denominator inside the square root by (1 - sinθ):

So denominator becomes 2(1 + sinθ)(1 - sinθ) ) = 2(1 - sin²θ) )= 2 cos²θ.

So |b| = [ cosθ ] / sqrt( 2(1 + sinθ) )

= cosθ / sqrt( [2(1 + sinθ)] )

Alternatively, if I multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(1 - sinθ), the denominator becomes sqrt(2(1 + sinθ)(1 - sinθ)) ) = sqrt(2(1 - sin²θ)) )= sqrt(2 cos²θ) )= sqrt(2) |cosθ|.

Since we're taking theta in a range where cosθ is positive, this simplifies to sqrt(2) cosθ.

So |b| = [ cosθ * sqrt(1 - sinθ) ] / sqrt(2) )

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, let's compute the square of |b|:

|b|² = cos²θ / [ 2 (1 + sinθ) ]

We can write cos²θ as (1 - sin²θ) = (1 - sinθ)(1 + sinθ)

So |b|² = (1 - sinθ)(1 + sinθ) / [2(1 + sinθ)] ]

Simplify: (1 - sinθ) / 2

So |b| = sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 )

Which is a familiar expression. Because (1 - sinθ)/2 = sin^2(theta/2 - pi/4), but perhaps more importantly, this is the same as [ cos(theta/2 + pi/4) ]^2, but perhaps it's easier to write it as sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 )

Wait, but wait. Let me compute (1 - sinθ)/2 = [ sin(pi/2) - sinθ ] / 2 = using the identity sin A - sin B.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of 1 - sinθ as 2 sin(pi/4 - theta/2)^2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the half-angle identities.

I know that cos(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 + cos theta)/2 )

And sin(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 - cos theta)/2 )

But here we have 1 - sinθ. Hmm.

Wait, another identity: 1 - sinθ = [sin(pi/2) - sinθ], which can be expressed using sum to product formula:

sin A - sin B = 2 cos( (A+B)/2 ) sin( (A-B)/2 )

So A=pi/2, B=theta.

So 1 - sinθ = 2 cos( (pi/2 + theta)/2 ) sin( (pi/2 - theta)/2 )

= 2 cos( (pi + 2 theta)/4 ) sin( (pi - 2 theta)/4 )

But that's getting a bit messy. Perhaps another approach: Let me note that 1 - sinθ can be written as 2 sin²( pi/4 - theta/2 )

Because sin(pi/4 - theta/2) = [sqrt(2)/2 (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)) ]

So sin²(pi/4 - theta/2 ) = [ (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2))² ] / 2 
= [ cos²(theta/2) - 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) ] /2 
= [ (cos² + sin²) - sin(2 theta/2) ] /2 
= [1 - sin theta ] / 2.

So, 1 - sin theta = 2 sin^2( pi/4 - theta/2 )

So, sqrt( (1 - sin theta)/2 ) = sin( pi/4 - theta/2 )

Wait, but sin(pi/4 - theta/2) is positive when pi/4 - theta/2 is between 0 and pi/2, which depends on theta. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to leave it as sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 )

But perhaps I can write this as cos(theta/2 + pi/4), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the components of the eigenvector.

The vector is [ (sinθ +1)/cosθ * b , b ]

Substituting |b| = sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 )

So, the vector components are:

a = (sinθ +1)/cosθ * sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 )

b = sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 )

Let me compute a:

a = ( (1 + sinθ) / cosθ ) * sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 )

Let me compute (1 + sinθ)(1 - sinθ) = 1 - sin²θ = cos²θ.

So sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 ) = sqrt( cos²θ/(2 (1 + sinθ)) )

So, a = (1 + sinθ)/(cosθ) * sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 )

= [ (1 + sinθ) * sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 ) ] / cosθ

But (1 + sinθ)(1 - sinθ) = cos²θ, so sqrt( (1 + sinθ)(1 - sinθ) ) = cos theta.

So, sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 ) = sqrt( cos² theta / [2 (1 + sin theta)] )

But perhaps this isn't helping much. Maybe a better approach is to compute a and b numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a trigonometric identity that can simplify this.

Let me compute the ratio a/b:

a/b = [ (1 + sinθ) / cosθ ]

So, a = (1 + sinθ)/cosθ * b 

Which can be written as a = tan(theta/2 + pi/4) * b, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, let me factor out some terms.

Wait, (1 + sinθ) = 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4)^2. Or perhaps more accurately, using the identity:

sin(theta/2 + pi/4) = [sin(theta/2) cos(pi/4) + cos(theta/2) sin(pi/4) ]

= [ sin(theta/2) * sqrt(2)/2 + cos(theta/2) * sqrt(2)/2 ]

= sqrt(2)/2 [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ]

Hmm, but not sure. Alternatively, I can write (1 + sinθ) = 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4)^2.

Wait, let me compute sin(theta/2 + pi/4):

= sin(theta/2) cos(pi/4) + cos(theta/2) sin(pi/4)
= (sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2)) * sqrt(2)/2

So, [ sin(theta/2 + pi/4) ]^2 = [ (sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2))^2 ] / 2

= [ sin^2(theta/2) + 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) + cos^2(theta/2) ] / 2

= [ (sin^2 + cos^2) (theta/2) ) + sin theta ] / 2

= [ 1 + sin theta ] / 2

So, 2 sin^2(theta/2 + pi/4) = 1 + sin theta

So, (1 + sin theta) = 2 sin^2(theta/2 + pi/4 )

So, the ratio a/b = (1 + sin theta)/cos theta = [ 2 sin^2(theta/2 + pi/4) ] / cos theta

Hmm, but perhaps this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of spherical coordinates.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting stuck in the algebra. Let's think of the eigenvector for the spin operator along an arbitrary direction. In quantum mechanics, the eigenstates of the spin along a direction are the spin-up and spin-down states, which can be written in terms of the eigenstates of the z-component.

Alternatively, for spin-1/2 particles, the eigenstates for spin along a direction (n_x, 0, n_z) can be written as:

|+> = cos(theta/2) | ↑z > + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) | ↓z >

But wait, in this case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is zero because the direction is purely in x-z, so phi=0. So the state simplifies to:

|+> = cos(theta/2) | ↑z > + sin(theta/2) | ↓z >

Which in vector form would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, is this the case? Let me think about the standard spin states.

The general expression for the eigenstate of S·n (where n is a unit vector) is:

|+> = e^{-i phi/2} [ cos(theta/2) |↑> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |↓> ]

But in our case, since phi is zero (n lies in x-z plane, so phi=0), this simplifies to:

|+> = cos(theta/2) |↑> + sin(theta/2) |↓>

Which is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but wait. That's the standard result for the eigenstate with eigenvalue +ħ/2, right? Because when you measure spin along n, you get +ħ/2 in this direction.

Wait, but in the problem, the operator P is the spin operator along n, so perhaps the eigenvectors are as I just described.

Wait, but the options given have various forms. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

But wait, the options may include factors of ħ, but in our case, the eigenvector is a unit vector, so the entries are just the cos and sin terms, without any ħ factors.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I just wrote. But wait, option D is (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)), which has factors of sqrt(2/3) ħ and sqrt(1/3) ħ. Why would that be?

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the direction. Because in the x-z plane, the angle theta might be measured from the z-axis, not the x-axis. So the standard parametrization is n = (sin theta cos phi, sin theta sin phi, cos theta) but since phi is zero in our case, n = (sin theta, 0, cos theta).

Wait, no, wait. If the direction is in the x-z plane, then the polar angle theta is measured from the z-axis, so n_x = sin theta, n_z = cos theta.

Wait, that's a bit different. So n_x = sin theta, n_z = cos theta.

In that case, the previous approach would have to adjust for this. Let me try.

So if n_x = sin theta, n_z = cos theta.

Then the matrix P is:

(ħ/2) [ [cos theta, sin theta], [sin theta, -cos theta] ]

Wait, earlier I had P = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

With n_z = cos theta, n_x = sin theta.

So, the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) [ [ cos theta, sin theta ], [ sin theta, -cos theta ] ]

The eigenvalue equation is then:

[ [ cos theta, sin theta ],
  [ sin theta, -cos theta ] ] * [a; b] = (1/ (ħ/2)) * (ħ/2) [a; b]

Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so the equation is:

P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Which, substituting P, becomes:

(ħ/2) [ [ cos theta, sin theta ], [ sin theta, -cos theta ] ] [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Divide both sides by ħ/2:

[ [ cos theta, sin theta ], [ sin theta, -cos theta ] ] [a; b] = [a; b]

So the equations are:

cos theta a + sin theta b = a
sin theta a - cos theta b = b

Rearranging:

(cos theta - 1) a + sin theta b = 0
sin theta a - (cos theta +1 ) b = 0

From the first equation: a = [ sin theta / (1 - cos theta) ] b

But 1 - cos theta = 2 sin^2(theta/2), and sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So, a = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / (2 sin^2(theta/2)) ) ] b = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b = cot(theta/2) b

So, a = cot(theta/2) b.

So the vector is [ cot(theta/2) b, b ]^T.

To normalize, we compute |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

So:

[ cot^2(theta/2) |b|^2 ] + |b|^2 =1

Factor |b|^2:

|b|^2 ( cot^2(theta/2) + 1 ) =1

But cot^2 +1 = csc^2, so |b|^2 * csc^2(theta/2) =1

So |b|^2 = sin^2(theta/2), so |b|= sin(theta/2)

Thus, a = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)

So the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Which matches option C.

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is exactly what we found.

Wait, but the question states "the operator P for a muon" but I think that's just the spin-1/2 system, so the same formalism applies.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option B is (cos theta, e^{i phi} sin theta), which is a spherical coordinate representation, but without the 1/2 angles, so that's likely for a different scenario, perhaps spin-1.

Option D has a sqrt(2/3) ħ and sqrt(1/3) ħ, which might be related to some specific direction, perhaps with theta such that cos(theta) is sqrt(1/3), but I'm not sure. But our general solution doesn't have any such factors, so it's more likely option C.

Wait, but wait a minute. Another approach: the eigenvector for spin up along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. For a spin-½ system, the eigenvector can be written as:

|+n> = cos(theta/2) |↑> + sin(theta/2) |↓>

Which is exactly option C.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed as $\vec{P} = \vec{n} \cdot (\vec{P}_x, \vec{P}_y, \vec{P}_z)$, where $\vec{n} = (n_x, 0, n_z)$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane, and $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as:

- $\vec{P}_x = \hbar/2 \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $\vec{P}_y = \hbar/2 \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $\vec{P}_z = \hbar/2 \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$  

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the $P_y$ term vanishes, and the operator $\vec{P}$ simplifies to:

\[
\vec{P} = \hbar/2 \left( n_x \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} + n_z \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right).
\]

Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$ (parametrizing $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane), the matrix representation of $\vec{P}$ becomes:

\[
\vec{P} = \hbar/2 \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, the system of equations becomes:

\[
\begin{cases}
\cos\theta \, a + \sin\theta \, b = a \\
\sin\theta \, a - \cos\theta \, b = b
\end{cases}.
\]

Rearranging the first equation gives:

\[
(\cos\theta - 1) a + \sin\theta \, b = 0,
\]

and the second equation gives:

\[
\sin\theta \, a - (\cos\theta + 1) b = 0.
\]

From the first equation, solving for $a$ in terms of $b$:

\[
a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b.
\]

Using trigonometric identities, $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, this simplifies to:

\[
a = \cot(\theta/2) b.
\]

The eigenvector is then proportional to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we compute the normalization condition:

\[
|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.
\]

Substituting $a = \cot(\theta/2) b$:

\[
\cot^2(\theta/2) |b|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.
\]

Factoring out $|b|^2$:

\[
|b|^2 (\cot^2(\theta/2) + 1) = 1.
\]

Using the identity $\cot^2(\theta/2) + 1 = \csc^2(\theta/2)$, we find:

\[
|b|^2 = \sin^2(\theta/2), \quad |b| = \sin(\theta/2).
\]

Thus, $a = \cos(\theta/2)$, and the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches **Option C**. The other options are inconsistent with the derived eigenvector:

- **Option A** introduces unnecessary factors of $\hbar$ and does not match the trigonometric form.  
- **Option B** corresponds to a spherical coordinate representation without the $1/2$ angle, which is not applicable here.  
- **Option D** introduces additional normalization factors (e.g., $\sqrt{2/3}\hbar$ and $\sqrt{1/3}\hbar$) that are not supported by the derivation.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
