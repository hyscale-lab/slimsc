Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a meson resonance and I need to find the mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters, so it's about really tiny distances, which makes sense because particles decay quickly.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle. The longer the lifetime, the further it can travel before decaying. So first, I need to find the lifetime of the meson.

The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Specifically, Γ ≈ ħ/τ. So τ is approximately ħ divided by Γ. But wait, Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is usually in units of GeV·s or something like that. I need to make sure the units are consistent.

Let me recall the values. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh, right, because ħc is about 197 MeV·fm, but maybe that's for another calculation. 

So, Γ is 320 MeV. I should convert this to GeV because ħ is in GeV·s. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

Now, τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging the numbers in: τ ≈ (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV). Let me compute that. 

6.582e-25 / 0.32 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. So τ ≈ 2.057e-24 s.

But wait, is that the correct formula? Hmm, I think the relation Γ ≈ ħ/τ holds when Γ is the total decay width. Yes, that's correct. I remember that the natural linewidth is related to the uncertainty in energy due to the finite lifetime.

Next, I need to find the velocity of the meson. Because the decay distance is velocity multiplied by lifetime. So the mean decay length L is v * τ.

But how do I find the velocity? I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The production energy E_X is given as 8 GeV, but wait, the rest mass is 1.2 GeV. So the meson is moving with some kinetic energy, but perhaps it's better to compute the total energy and momentum.

The total energy E is 8 GeV. The rest mass energy is m_X c², but since we're using units where c=1 (as in particle physics), E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. Again, since c=1, E^2 = p^2 + m^2.

So, E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV. Let me compute p: p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2). Let me calculate that.

E^2 = (8)^2 = 64 (GeV)^2
m^2 = (1.2)^2 = 1.44 (GeV)^2
So p^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 → p = sqrt(62.56) ≈7.91 GeV.

Wait, sqrt(62.56) is 7.91 because 7.9^2 is about 62.41, and 7.91^2 would be 62.5681. Yeah, that's correct.

So momentum p is approximately 7.91 GeV/c. Now, the velocity can be found using the relation p = gamma m v, but in natural units, since c=1, p = gamma m v. Let's express v in terms of beta (β = v/c). Then, p = gamma m β.

But gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c²) → since E = 8 GeV and m c² is 1.2 GeV, gamma = 8 / 1.2 ≈6.6667. So gamma ≈6.6667.

So p = gamma m β → β = p/(gamma m).

Plugging in the numbers: p=7.91 GeV, gamma=6.6667, m=1.2 GeV.

So β = 7.91 / (6.6667 * 1.2) → Let's compute the denominator: 6.6667 *1.2 = 8. So β ≈7.91 /8 ≈0.98875. So β is approximately 0.98875. So v ≈ 0.98875c.

So velocity v is about 0.98875 times the speed of light. The speed of light is 3e8 meters per second, so v ≈0.98875 *3e8 m/s ≈2.966e8 m/s.

Now, the mean decay length L is v * τ. Let's compute that.

v is approximately 2.966e8 m/s.
τ is 2.057e-24 s.

Multiply them: 2.966e8 * 2.057e-24 = let's compute that.

2.966 *2.057 ≈ (3 * 2=6) but more precisely: 2.966 *2.057. Let's compute:

2.966 *2=5.932
2.966 *0.057 ≈0.167 (because 0.05 is 0.1483, 0.007 is ~0.02076, sum ~0.169)
So total approx 5.932 + 0.169 ≈6.101.

Wait, wait, actually, I should multiply 2.966 *2.057.

Let me compute it more accurately.

2.966 * 2 = 5.932.

2.966 * 0.05 = 0.1483.

2.966 *0.007 = 0.020762.

Adding those: 5.932 +0.1483=6.0803; plus 0.020762→6.101.

So 6.101e(8 -24) = 6.101e-16 meters.

Wait, wait, 8 and -24, so 8-24 =-16. So 6.101e-16 meters.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.0223e-16 and D is 4.0655e-16. Not matching exactly. Did I make a miscalculation?

Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of the velocity. Let me double-check that part.

Wait, beta was calculated as p/(gamma m). Oh wait, let me re-express that. Beta is v/c, and in natural units, beta = p c/(E), because E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So another way to find beta is (pc)/E.

Wait, that's a simpler way. Because E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ), so (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2 → pc = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2). So beta = (pc)/(E) → which is sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4)/(E) → but since E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c², I think units would cancel.

Wait, let me see. E is given as 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c² (assuming units where c=1, but when using E and m in GeV and GeV/c², respectively, then beta would be (p c)/(E). So beta= (p c)/ E.

Wait, but earlier I found p=7.91 GeV/c. So p c is 7.91 GeV/c * c =7.91 GeV. So beta is (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) )= 7.91/8 ≈0.98875. Same result as before. So that's correct.

So beta is correct. So v is approximately 0.98875c.

So going back to the decay length: L = v * τ = beta c * tau.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it as L = beta * c * tau.

So let me compute beta c tau.

Beta is 0.98875, c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.057e-24 s.

So:

beta * c * tau = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.

Multiply 3e8 and 2.057e-24: 3e8 *2.057e-24 = 6.171e-16.

Multiply by beta: 0.98875 *6.171e-16 ≈6.101e-16 meters.

Wait, but the options don't have that. The options are approximately 4e-15, 5e-15, etc. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the lifetime?

Wait, let me recheck the initial calculation of tau.

Tau is ħ /Γ. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 /0.32 → 6.582 /0.32 is approximately 20.56875 → so 20.56875e-25 s → which is 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.

So that part is correct.

Hmm, so the computed L is approximately 6.1e-16 m. But the options are A:5.02e-16 and D:4.06e-16, which are lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the lifetime. Let's think again. The formula is tau = ħ / (Γ). But is Γ in GeV? Because the units must match.

Yes, because ħ is in GeV·s and Γ is in GeV. So units would be (GeV·s)/(GeV) → seconds. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I used the wrong expression for the width. Some sources say that the width is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / (2 τ) or Γ = ħ/(τ/2). Wait, actually, the uncertainty principle is ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2, but I think the correct relation is Γ ≈ ħ/τ, but perhaps I should clarify.

Wait, the natural linewidth is given by the uncertainty principle. The width Γ is the uncertainty in energy, and the lifetime τ is the uncertainty in time. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2. So Γ ≈ ΔE ≈ ħ/(2 τ) → τ ≈ ħ/(2 Γ).

Ah, I think that's where I went wrong! I forgot the factor of 2. So earlier I computed tau as ħ/Γ, but actually, it's tau = ħ/(2 Γ).

So let me recalculate tau. So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (2 * 0.32 GeV) ) → 6.582e-25 /0.64 = approximately 1.0284e-24 seconds.

Hmm, so that's a smaller tau. Let me compute L again.

L = beta c tau = 0.98875 *3e8 m/s *1.0284e-24 s.

Compute 3e8 *1.0284e-24 =3.0852e-16.

Multiply by 0.98875: 3.0852e-16 *0.98875 ≈3.055e-16 m.

Still, not matching the options. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula for the width. Let me think again about the relation between Γ and tau.

Another approach: the decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by τ = ħ / Γ. But that's only when the particle is at rest, right? Or wait, perhaps the relation is τ = ħ/(Γ c^2), but I'm getting confused with units here.

Wait, I'm getting myself into a tangle. Let me think about the units.

Γ is given in MeV, which is energy. The uncertainty principle says ΔE Δt ≈ ħ (with ħ in J·s), but when using units where ħ is in energy·time, like GeV·s, then ΔE Δt ≈ ħ. So Γ is ΔE, so Δt ≈ τ ≈ ħ/(Γ).

So yes, the initial calculation was correct without the 2. So earlier calculation without the 2 was correct. So tau is about 2.05e-24 s.

Wait, but then why do I get a decay length of ~6e-16, which is not an option. The options are all around 4e-15 to 5e-16. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of velocity?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the velocity more accurately.

We have E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV. So beta is p/E.

Wait, p is sqrt(E² - m²) → which is sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV/c.

So beta = p c / E → because p c = 7.91 GeV (since p is GeV/c and c is in m/s, but in natural units, p c is GeV).

So beta = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) = 7.91/8 = 0.98875. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate the lifetime more accurately. Let me compute ħ exactly.

The value of ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

Tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 → 6.582 /0.32 is 20.56875 → so 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s.

So that's correct.

So the mean decay length is 0.98875 *3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Calculating that:

0.98875 *3e8 = 2.96625e8 m/s.

2.96625e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Multiply 2.96625 *2.056875 ≈ let me compute:

2.96625 *2 = 5.9325.

2.96625 *0.056875 ≈0.1692.

Adding: 5.9325 +0.1692 ≈6.1017.

So 6.1017e(8-24) → 6.1017e-16 meters.

Still, none of the options match this. So perhaps I made an error in the approach.

Wait another thought: perhaps the decay length is calculated using c times tau, multiplied by beta, but considering relativistic gamma factors. Because the lifetime measured in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime.

Wait, the lifetime as calculated is the proper lifetime (tau_0). The mean lifetime observed in the lab frame is gamma * tau_0. Oh wait! I think I forgot that.

Ah, yes! Because the lifetime measured in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. So the decay length is gamma * beta c * tau_0.

So I think I missed the gamma factor in the decay length.

Wait, let me clarify. The proper lifetime is tau_0 = ħ/(Γ m), wait no, the proper lifetime is tau_0 = ħ/(Γ) → No, wait again. The width is Γ, and tau_0 is the proper lifetime: tau_0 = ħ/(Γ).

But when the particle is moving, the observed lifetime is longer: tau = gamma * tau_0.

So the decay length is L = v tau = beta c * gamma tau_0.

So earlier, I used L= beta c tau_0, but that's wrong because tau observed is gamma tau_0.

Wait, so the correct formula is L = beta c * gamma tau_0.

So tau_0 is ħ / Γ = 2.056875e-24 s.

gamma is E/(m c²) → E is 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8/1.2 = 6.6667.

So now, let's compute L:

L = beta * c * gamma * tau_0.

beta is 0.98875, c=3e8 m/s, gamma=6.6667, tau_0=2.056875e-24 s.

So L= 0.98875 * 3e8 * 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24.

Compute step by step.

First, multiply 0.98875 * 6.6667 ≈6.5917.

Then, 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.1706e-16.

Then, 6.5917 * 6.1706e-16 → 6.5917 *6.1706 ≈40.713 (because 6*6=36, 6*0.17=1.02, 0.59 *6=3.54, 0.59 *0.17≈0.1003 → summing up all would be a bit more than 40). Wait, let's compute more accurately.

6.5917 *6.1706:

6 *6 =36.

6 *0.1706 =1.0236.

0.5917 *6 =3.5502.

0.5917 *0.1706≈0.1009.

Adding them up:

36 +1.0236=37.0236

37.0236 +3.5502=40.5738

40.5738 +0.1009≈40.6747.

So 40.6747e-16 meters.

Wait, 40.6747e-16 is 4.06747e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close. So the correct answer should be option B.

Ah, there we go. So I had forgotten to include gamma in the decay length. So that was the mistake. Including gamma gives a much longer decay length, which brings it into line with the options.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance, we start by calculating the proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \), which is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}.
\]

The reduced Planck constant \( \hbar \) is approximately \( 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), and the decay width \( \Gamma \) is given as \( 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

Next, the mean decay distance \( L \) is given by:

\[
L = \beta c \tau,
\]

where \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle in units of the speed of light, \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau \) is the lifetime observed in the lab frame. The lab-frame lifetime is related to the proper lifetime by the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \):

\[
\tau = \gamma \tau_0,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \). The total energy \( E \) is \( 8 \, \text{GeV} \), and the rest mass energy \( m c^2 \) is \( 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Thus:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

The momentum \( p \) of the meson is calculated using the relativistic relation:

\[
p = \sqrt{E^2 - m^2} = \sqrt{8^2 - 1.2^2} = \sqrt{64 - 1.44} = \sqrt{62.56} \approx 7.91 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

The velocity \( \beta \) is then:

\[
\beta = \frac{p}{\gamma m} = \frac{7.91}{6.6667 \times 1.2} = \frac{7.91}{8} \approx 0.98875.
\]

Now, substituting into the formula for \( L \):

\[
L = \beta c \tau = \beta c \gamma \tau_0.
\]

Substituting \( \beta = 0.98875 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), \( \gamma = 6.6667 \), and \( \tau_0 = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 0.98875 \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 6.6667 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24}.
\]

First, calculate \( 0.98875 \times 6.6667 \approx 6.5917 \). Then, calculate \( 3 \times 10^8 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 6.1706 \times 10^{-16} \). Finally, multiply:

\[
L = 6.5917 \times 6.1706 \times 10^{-16} \approx 40.6747 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m} = 4.06747 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

This matches closely with option **B**, which is \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \). The slight discrepancy is due to rounding during intermediate calculations.

Answer: B
