Okay, so I have this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I've studied a bit about particle physics before, but I'm a bit rusty. Let me try to think this through.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters, some in 1e-15 and others in 1e-16, so I need to calculate it accurately.

I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle. The longer the lifetime, the farther it can travel before decaying. But wait, how do I find the lifetime from the given parameters?

Oh right, the width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime τ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ ≈ ħ / τ. So τ is approximately ħ / Γ. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula. Let me think again. The natural linewidth is Γ, and the uncertainty in energy ΔE is Γ, so the uncertainty in time Δt is ħ/(ΔE). So τ is roughly ħ/Γ. Yeah, that sounds right.

But wait, another thought: particles that are moving quickly can travel further before decaying. So I think the mean decay distance (L) is the product of the particle's velocity (v) and its lifetime (τ). So L = v * τ.

But how do I find v? The particle is produced with energy E_X, which is much larger than its rest mass (m_X), so relativistic effects are important. I can use the relation between energy, mass, and velocity.

The total energy E is related to the rest mass and momentum via E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So I can solve for p, the momentum.

Wait, E_X is given as 8 GeV, and m_X is 1.2 GeV. Let's compute p. Let's write the equation:

E_X² = (p c)² + (m_X c²)²

So (p c)² = E_X² - (m_X c²)²

Let me compute that. Let's factor out c² from both terms:

p² c² = (E_X² - m_X² c^4) / c^4? Wait, no, I think I need to compute E_X in units where c is accounted for. Maybe it's better to convert everything into appropriate units.

Wait, perhaps it's better to divide both sides by c^4:

(E_X / c²)² = p² + (m_X / c²)²

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of natural units where c=1. But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, since E is in GeV and mass is in GeV/c², perhaps I can compute p in units of GeV/c.

Wait, let's compute (p c)² = E_X² - (m_X c²)^2. Wait, no, E_X is in GeV, which is energy. So the equation is:

E_X^2 = (p c)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2

So, solving for p:

p = sqrt( (E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2) ) / (c^2) ?

Wait, perhaps I should write it as:

p c = sqrt( E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2 )^(1/2) )

Wait, no. Let me rearrange the equation:

p c = sqrt( E_X^2 - (m_X c^2 )^2 )

But wait, the units get a bit tricky. Maybe I should compute the value step by step.

Let me plug in the numbers. E_X is 8 GeV, and m_X is 1.2 GeV. Let's compute each term.

E_X^2 = (8 GeV)^2 = 64 (GeV)^2

m_X^2 c^4 = (1.2 GeV)^2 c^4. Hmm, but when using E^2 = (pc)^2 c^2 + (m c^2)^2, perhaps it's better to compute everything in terms of GeV and c=1 units. Wait, maybe I should ignore c for the calculation because when using natural units (where c=1), the equations simplify. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: the energy E is the total energy, which is gamma * m c². So gamma is E/(m c²). But wait, E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c², so when I compute E/(m c^2), let's see:

E/(m c^2) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV/c² * c²) ) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666..., so gamma is 6.666...

Because E = gamma m c².

Then, gamma = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) = 6.666... (since the GeV cancels, and the c² cancels because m is in GeV/c², so m c² is GeV.)

Then, gamma = 6.666..., which is 20/3.

Then, the velocity v can be found from gamma. The relation between gamma and velocity is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, let's compute v.

gamma = 20/3 ≈6.6667

So,

gamma^2 = (1 - v²/c²)^-1

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(gamma^2) = 1/(400/9) ) = 9/400 = 0.0225.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775

So,

v = c * sqrt(0.9775) ≈ c * 0.9887

So, v ≈ 0.9887 c.

That's the velocity. Now, the lifetime tau is given by tau = ħ / (Γ c^5) ?

Wait, no. Wait, the width Γ is in MeV, which is an energy. So, the relation is tau = ħ / Γ.

But wait, ħ has units of GeV·s when using GeV. Wait, let me check the units.

Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

Wait, no, I think ħ is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds. Because 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, and Planck's constant is approximately h = 6.626e-34 J·s. Since 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, so 1 GeV is 1.6e-10 J.

Let me compute ħ in GeV·s:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s.

But 1 J = 6.242e18 eV.

Wait, 1 J = 6.242e18 eV because 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So,

ħ in GeV·s: 1.05457e-34 J·s * (1 GeV / 1.602e-10 J) ) = 1.05457e-34 / 1.602e-10 GeV·s.

Wait, no. Wait, 1 GeV = 1e9 eV. So 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, and 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So, 1 GeV = 1e9 * 1.602e-19 J = 1.602e-10 J.

So,

ħ in GeV·s: 1.05457e-34 J·s / (1.602e-10 J/GeV) ) = (1.05457e-34) / (1.602e-10) GeV·s ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Yes, so ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So, tau = ħ / Γ.

But Γ is given as 320 MeV. Oh wait, we need to convert that to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.320 GeV.

So,

tau = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.320 GeV = (6.582e-25) / 0.320 s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute 6.582e
