Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. It's about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution, and I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all the cobalt-containing species. Oh right, those are the Co(SCN)_n complexes.

Alright, the question gives me the stability constants for the different complexes. Stability constants, β, right. So the values are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, wait, I should make sure I understand what these β values represent. Oh right, the stability constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex ion. So for each step, the formation of the next complex.

So the complexes would be Co(SCN)_1, Co(SCN)_2, etc. Each β corresponds to the formation of a higher complex from the previous one. So β1 is for Co(SCN)^+, β2 is for Co(SCN)_2, and so on.

The problem states that the total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. I need to find the percentage of the blue ones, which I think are the dithiocyanato complexes, so Co(SCN)_2^− and Co(SCN)_3. Wait, wait, no. Wait, dithiocyanato would be two SCN- per Co. So that would be the Co(SCN)_2 complex. But the question says "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes"—I think that refers to Co(SCN)_2^−, which is blue. But I'm not sure if all the dithiocyanato are considered, but I think the problem refers specifically to Co(SCN)_2^−, the second complex.

Wait, no. Wait, the complexes for Co(II) with thiocyanate are known. Co(II) can form various complexes: [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^−, [Co(SCN)_3]^−, [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, etc. But the given βs are for β1 to β4, so four complexes in series.

Wait, maybe I should clarify. The first complex is Co(SCN), which would be [Co(SCN)]^+ because Co^2+ plus SCN^- makes [Co(SCN)]^+ (charge 2+ + (-1) = +1). Then the next would be [Co(SCN)_2]^{n}, where n is 0? Wait, but wait, each time adding SCN-, which is -1. So Co^2+ plus n SCN^- would give a charge of 2+ + (-n) = (2-n)+. So for each complex:

n=1: charge +1 → β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+.
n=2: charge 0 → β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2].
n=3: charge -1 → β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^-
n=4: charge -2 → β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

But wait, wait, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β is the formation constant for each subsequent complex.

But how does that work? The overall process is stepwise. So β1 = [ [Co(SCN)]+ ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-] )

β2 = [ [Co(SCN)_2] ] / ( [Co(SCN)]+ [SCN^-] )

β3 = [ [Co(SCN)_3^- ] ] / ( [Co(SCN)_2] [SCN^-] )

β4 = [ [Co(SCN)_4^2- ] ] / ( [Co(SCN)_3^- ] [SCN^-] )

So each β is the stepwise formation constant for adding another SCN^-.

The problem is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think are the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (neutral) and [Co(SCN)_3]^− (maybe another color?), wait, but the question is about the dithiocyanato, which is two SCN groups. So the [Co(SCN)_2] complex, which is neutral, right? Because Co^2+ plus two SCN^- makes a neutral complex.

Wait, but the question says "dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes", so two SCN groups. So that would be the [Co(SCN)_2] complex. So if that's the blue one, we need to find the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2] relative to all cobalt species.

Wait, but the problem says "the blue dithiocyanato", which I think is a specific complex. So maybe just [Co(SCN)_2], the neutral one. So I need to find the fraction of all Co species that are in the [Co(SCN)_2] form.

So first, I think I need to model the system with the given β's and concentrations to find the distribution of Co among all possible complexes.

The species present are:

1. Free Co^2+ (let's call this C0)
2. [Co(SCN)]^+ (C1)
3. [Co(SCN)_2] (C2)
4. [Co(SCN)_3]^- (C3)
5. [Co(SCN)_4]^2- (C4)

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The Co can form complexes with 1, 2, 3, 4 SCN- ions. So the species are C0, C1, C2, C3, C4. Each step forms the next complex.

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these species: C0 + C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

The thiocyanate concentration is [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

But wait, the overall concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M, but in the complexes, some SCN- is bound. But considering that the solution is very dilute in Co and SCN is 0.1 M, which is probably in excess. So [SCN^-] remains approximately 0.1 M because the amount bound is negligible compared to the total. So in this case, we can treat [SCN^-] as a constant, 0.1 M.

So, the first step is to express each C in terms of C0, using the β's.

From the formation constants:

C1 = β1 * C0 * [SCN^-]

C2 = β2 * C1 * [SCN^-] = β2 * β1 * C0 * [SCN^-]^2

C3 = β3 * C2 * [SCN^-] = β3 * β2 * β1 * C0 * [SCN^-]^3

C4 = β4 * C3 * [SCN^-] = β4 * β3 * β2 * β1 * C0 * [SCN^-]^4

So, each subsequent C is the product of the previous β and [SCN^-].

But I can write Cn as:

C1 = β1 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]

C2 = β2 C1 [SCN^-] = β2 β1 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^2

C3 = β3 C2 [SCN^-] = β3 β2 β1 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^3

C4 = β4 C3 [SCN^-] = β4 β3 β2 β1 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^4

But since [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is a constant, we can factor that into each term.

Let me compute each term in terms of C0.

Let me write each Cn as a coefficient multiplied by C0.

So,

C1 = β1 * [SCN^-] * C0

C2 = β2 * [SCN^-]^2 * C0

Wait, wait, no. Wait, C1 = β1 * C0 * [SCN^-], correct.

C2 = β2 * C1 * [SCN^-] = β2 * β1 * C0 * [SCN^-]^2.

Similarly,

C3 = β3 * C2 * [SCN^-} = β3 * β2 * β1 * C0 * [SCN^-]^3.

C4 = β4 * C3 * [SCN^-} = β4 * β3 * β2 * β1 * C0 * [SCN^-]^4.

Wait, but that can't be right because each step multiplies by the next β and another [SCN^-]. So each Cn is the product of all β's up to n, times [SCN^-]^n, times C0.

So, for n=1,2,3,4:

Cn = (β1 β2 ... βn) * C0 * [SCN^-]^n.

Wait, no, that's not accurate. Because C1 = β1 * C0 * [S]

C2 = β2 * C1 * [S] = β2 * β1 * C0 [S]^2

C3 = β3 * C2 * [S} = β3 β2 β1 C0 [S]^3

Etc.

So, yes, each Cn is the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn multiplied by C0 * [S]^n.

So, I can compute each Cn as:

Cn = (product of β1 to βn) * C0 * [S]^n

But wait, wait. Wait no, wait. For C2, it's product of β1 and β2, times [S]^2. So for each Cn, it's the product of β1 to βn multiplied by [S]^n times C0.

Wait, C1 is β1 * C0 * [S]

C2 is β2 * (β1 C0 [S]) [S] = β1 β2 C0 [S]^2

C3 = β3 * (β1 β2 C0 [S]^2) [S] )= β1 β2 β3 C0 [S]^3.

So yes, each Cn is product of β1 to βn multiplied by [S]^n.

Therefore, the relative concentrations can be found by looking at each Cn as a function of C0.

So, the total Co is C0 + C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 = 1e-2 M.

Let me compute each coefficient for C0.

Compute each term:

[S] = 0.1 M.

C0 = C0

C1 = β1 [S] C0

C2 = β1 β2 [S]^2 C0

C3 = β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 C0

C4 = β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4 C0

So,

C1 = 9 * 0.1 * C0 = 0.9 C0.

C2 = 9 *40 * (0.1)^2 * C0 = 360 * 0.01 * C0 = 3.6 C0.

Wait, wait, let me compute again:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Compute for each Cn:

C0: coefficient = 1

C1: coeff = β1 * [S] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

C2: coeff = β1*β2 * [S]^2 = 9 *40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6

C3: coeff = β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 = 9 *40 *63 * (0.1)^3.

Compute 9 *40 = 360; 360 *63 = 22680. (0.1)^3= 0.001. So 22680 * 0.001 = 22.68.

So C3 coeff =22.68.

C4: coeff = β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4 = 9 *40 *63 *16 * (0.1)^4.

Compute step by step:

9 *40 = 360.

360 *63 = 22680.

22680 *16= 362,880.

(0.1)^4= 0.0001.

So 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

So, the coefficients for each Cn are:

C0: 1

C1: 0.9

C2:3.6

C3:22.68

C4:36.288

Now, the sum of all coefficients is:

1 + 0.9 + 3.6 +22.68 +36.288 = let's compute:

1 +0.9=1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468

So total is 64.468.

This sum equals (C0 + C1 + C2 + C3 + C4)/C0.

But since C0 + C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 = 1e-2 M,

then 64.468 * C0 = 1e-2,

so C0 = (1e-2)/64.468 ≈ 1.55e-4 M.

Wait, but wait, no. Because each Cn is (coeff) * C0.

So the sum of all Cn is (sum of coefficients) * C0 = 1e-2.

So, 64.468 * C0 = 1e-2 → C0 = (1e-2)/64.468 ≈ 1.55e-4 M.

So now, each Cn can be calculated as:

C0 = 1.55e-4 M

C1 =0.9 * 1.55e-4 ≈ 1.395e-4 M

C2=3.6 *1.55e-4 ≈5.58e-4 M

C3=22.68 *1.55e-4 ≈0.035148 M? Wait, wait, no. 22.68 * 1.55e-4 = 22.68 * 1.55e-4.

Wait, let me compute step by step.

Wait, 22.68 * 1.55e-4 = (22.68 * 1.55) * 1e-4.

22.68 *1.55:

22 * 1.55 = 34.1

0.68 *1.55=1.054

Total: 34.1 +1.054 =35.154 → 35.154e-4 → 3.5154e-3 M.

Wait, no, wait: 22.68 *1.55e-4 = (22.68 *1.55) *1e-4.

22.68 *1.55 = 22.68 *1.5 +22.68 *0.05.

22.68 *1.5=34.02; 22.68 *0.05=1.134 → total 35.154.

So 35.154 *1e-4 = 0.0035154 M, which is 3.5154e-3 M.

Wait that's higher than the total Co concentration, which is 1e-2 M. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, wait, wait, no. Because the sum of all Cn is 1e-2 M, but when I compute each Cn, their sum must equal 1e-2.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a miscalculation. Let me re-calculate the coefficients.

Wait, let me re-calculate each coefficient:

C0: 1

C1: β1 * [S] =9 * 0.1 = 0.9

C2: β1 * β2 * [S]^2 =9 *40 * (0.1)^2= 360 * 0.01=3.6

C3: β1 *β2 *β3 * [S]^3=9 *40 *63 * 0.001.

Compute 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *0.001=22.68.

So C3 coeff is22.68.

C4: β1*β2*β3*β4 * [S]^4=9 *40 *63 *16 * 0.0001.

Compute 9*40=360; 360 *63=22680; 22680 *16=362880; 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So C4 coeff is36.288.

Sum is 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6→5.5; +22.68→28.18; +36.288 →64.468.

So the sum is 64.468.

So C0 = 1e-2 / 64.468 ≈ 1.55e-4 M.

Then,

C0=1.55e-4

C1=0.9 *1.55e-4≈1.395e-4

C2=3.6 *1.55e-4≈5.58e-4

C3=22.68 *1.55e-4≈3.5154e-3

C4=36.288 *1.55e-4≈5.6286e-3.

Wait, let's check the sum:

1.55e-4 +1.395e-4=2.945e-4

+5.58e-4 →8.525e-4

+3.5154e-3 →4.367e-3

+5.6286e-3 →1.0e-2 (since 4.367 +5.6286 ≈9.9956e-3 ≈1.0e-2). Phew, correct.

So the concentrations are as computed.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Assuming that the blue is [Co(SCN)_2], which is C2.

So C2 is5.58e-4 M.

The total Co is1e-2 M.

The percentage is (C2 / total Co) *100.

So (5.58e-4 / 1e-2) *100 = (0.0558) *100=5.58%.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the options are 16.9%, 25.6%, etc.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in identifying which complex is dithiocyanato.

Wait, perhaps the blue is a different complex. Wait, I might have gotten the complexes wrong. Let me think.

Wait, Co(SCN)_2 is the dithiocyanato complex. But what about [Co(SCN)_3]? I think [Co(SCN)_2] is a different color. Let me check.

Wait, in my notes, I remember that the different Co(SCN)_n complexes have different colors. Co(SCN) is pink, Co(SCN)_2 is blue, Co(SCN)_3 is green, and Co(SCN)_4 is violet. So the blue is [Co(SCN)_2], which is C2.

So the percentage is (C2 / 1e-2) *100 = (5.58e-4 / 1e-2)*100=5.58%.

But that's not one of the options. Hmm. The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Wait, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let me go back to my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculating the coefficients.

Wait, the coefficients are:

C0: 1

C1: β1 * [S] =9 *0.1=0.9

C2: β1 *β2 * [S]^2 =9*40*(0.1)^2 = 360 *0.01=3.6

C3: β1*β2*β3 * [S]^3 =9*40*63 * (0.1)^3 = 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 * 0.001=22.68.

C4: β1*β2*β3*β4 * [S]^4=9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4.

9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362880; 362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

So sum is 1 +0.9=1.9 +3.6=5.5 +22.68=28.18 +36.288=64.468.

Correct.

So, the sum is 64.468. So C0=1e-2 / 64.468 = ~1.55e-4 M.

Compute C2: 3.6 * 1.55e-4 =5.58e-4.

So 5.58e-4 / 1e-2 =0.0558, 5.58% → not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about all the dithiocyanato complexes, which would include [Co(SCN)_2] and [Co(SCN)_3]?

Wait, wait, no. Because [Co(SCN)_3] is trithiocyanato, not dithiocyanato. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to all the species where two SCN are bound, but that's only [Co(SCN)_2].

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the sum of all complexes where the number of SCN is two or more, but that's not the case. Or perhaps I got the β's wrong.

Wait, let me think again. The stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

But wait, wait, the way the stability constants are usually defined is for the overall formation, not stepwise. Hmm, no, no, in this case, the β's are given as the stepwise formation constants. So each β is the formation of the next complex from the previous.

Wait, but another possibility is that the β values are for the overall formation from Co^2+ to each complex. For example, β1 is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)]^+.

β1 = [ [Co(SCN)]+ ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-] )

β2 is [ [Co(SCN)_2] ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 )

Wait, that can't be right because that would change the way the coefficients are calculated.

Wait, wait, perhaps I misunderstood the way the β's are used. Let me think: the stepwise formation constant for each additional ligand.

So for the first complex: [Co(SCN)]^+ is formed from Co^2+ and SCN^- → β1 = [ [Co(SCN)]^+ ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-] )

Similarly, the second complex is [Co(SCN)_2], formed from [Co(SCN)]^+ and SCN^- → β2 = [ [Co(SCN)_2] ] / ( [ [Co(SCN)]^+ ][SCN^-] )

So, the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_2] would be β1 * β2.

Because [Co(SCN)_2] = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-] ) * β2 [ [Co(SCN)]^+ ][SCN^-] )

Which simplifies to β1 β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2.

So, the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2] is C2 = β1 β2 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^2.

Similarly, the concentration of [Co(SCN)]^+ is C1 = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-].

So, my previous approach was correct in that each Cn is the product of all β's up to n, multiplied by [SCN^-]^n, and Co^2+ (C0).

So, the previous calculations should be correct, but the percentage is only 5.58%, which is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the order of the β's is different. Let me check the β's again.

The problem says β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, perhaps I should have computed C3 and C4 correctly. Let me recalculate the coefficients.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of C3's coefficient.

C3: β1 * β2 * β3 multiplied by [S]^3.

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 → 9*40=360; 360*63=22680.

[S]^3 = (0.1)^3=0.001.

So 22680 *0.001=22.68. Correct.

C4: β1 β2 β3 β4 * [S]^4.

β4=16. So 22680 *16= 362880.

[S]^4=0.1^4=0.0001.

362880 *0.0001=36.288. Correct.

So the coefficients are correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possibility that the thiocyanate is not in excess and that [SCN^-] is not 0.1 M. But wait, the problem states that [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. So if the total Co is 1e-2 M and the SCN is 0.1 M, which is 1e-1, which is much higher than the 4 * 1e-2=4e-2 M of SCN needed for all possible complexes. So [SCN^-] remains approximately 0.1 M.

So, probably, I'm correct in treating [SCN^-] as a constant.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2] and [Co(SCN)_3], both of which are dithiocyanato? No, no, because [Co(SCN)_3] has three SCN groups, so it's trithiocyanato, not dithiocyanato.

So, I'm back to thinking that the percentage is 5.58%, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the stepwise β's are not correct as I used them. Let me think about the general approach.

The general approach is to write the formation of each complex in a stepwise manner.

So,

Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)]^+ → β1 = [ [Co(SCN)]^+ ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-] )

[Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2] → β2 = [ [Co(SCN)_2] ] / ( [ [Co(SCN)]^+ ][SCN^-] )

Similarly,

[Co(SCN)_2] + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_3]^- → β3 = [ [Co(SCN)_3^- ] ] / ( [ [Co(SCN)_2] ][SCN^-] )

[Co(SCN)_3^- ] + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_4]^2- → β4 = [ [Co(SCN)_4^2- ] ] / ( [ [Co(SCN)_3^- ] ][SCN^-] )

So, the concentrations are:

C1 = β1 C0 [S]

C2 = β2 C1 [S] = β1 β2 C0 [S]^2

C3 = β3 C2 [S] = β1 β2 β3 C0 [S]^3

C4 = β4 C3 [S] = β1 β2 β3 β4 C0 [S]^4

So, the same as before.

So perhaps I didn't make a mistake in the setup. Then why is my calculation not matching the options?

Wait, perhaps I should compute all the concentrations correctly.

Wait, let's compute each concentration:

Given:

C0 =1.55e-4 M

C1=0.9 *1.55e-4=1.395e-4

C2=3.6 *1.55e-4=5.58e-4

C3=22.68 *1.55e-4=3.5154e-3

C4=36.288 *1.55e-4=5.6286e-3.

Wait, but wait, when I sum these up:

C0=1.55e-4 → 0.000155

C1=0.0001395 → sum so far 0.0002945

C2=0.000558 → sum 0.0008525

C3=0.0035154 → sum 0.0043679

C4=0.0056286 → sum 0.010 (1e-2 M). That's correct.

So, the percentages would be:

C0: 0.000155 / 0.01 → 1.55%

C1:0.0001395 /0.01 →1.395%

C2:0.000558 /0.01 →5.58%

C3:0.0035154 /0.01 →35.154%

C4:0.0056286 /0.01 →56.286%

Wait, so C4 is the highest, then C3, then C4 is higher than C3? No, because 56.286% is higher than 35.154%.

Wait, no, but wait:

Wait, C3 is 0.0035154 M, which is 3.5154e-3.

C4 is 5.6286e-3.

So the percentages are:

C0:1.55%

C1:1.395%

C2:5.58%

C3:35.154%

C4:56.286%

Wait, but I thought the β3 was 63, which is higher than β2's 40. So why is C3 lower than C4?

Ah, because β4 is 16, which is lower than β3 of 63. So the higher β3 leads to more C3, but then β4 is lower, so the next step doesn't add as much.

So, the highest is C4, then C3, then C2, then C1, and C0 is the smallest.

So, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex (C2) is about 5.58%, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the coefficients. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that Cn is the concentration of the nth complex, but the way I calculated the coefficients is correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem refers to the sum of all complexes with at least two SCN groups, which would be C2 + C3 + C4. But the question says "the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes", which is probably just C2.

Wait, but the options don't match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I used β1 to β4 as stepwise, but perhaps they are overall formation constants. Let me think about that possibility.

If the β values are overall formation constants for each complex, then:

β_total for Co(SCN)_n is the product of the stepwise β's up to n.

But that's the same as what I did.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, if β_total for [Co(SCN)_n] is the overall formation constant, which is the product of all stepwise β's up to n.

But in that case, the concentrations would be:

Cn = (β_total) * C0 * [S]^n.

But that's exactly what I did. So I think my approach is correct.

Another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of all complexes that have exactly two SCN groups, which is C2. But the calculation shows it's about 5.58%, which is not an option.

Wait, the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the stability constants.

Wait, wait the problem states the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, perhaps the β's are in reverse order. For example, perhaps β1 is for the fourth complex, and so on. But that seems unlikely, but perhaps that's the case.

Wait, if I consider the β's in reverse order, but that would complicate things. Let me think: if β1 is for Co(SCN)_4, but that's unlikely because β1 is the first step.

Wait, perhaps the β's are for the overall formation from Co^2+ to each complex. For example, β1 is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2], etc.

But no, that's the same as what I did before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the stepwise β's, but perhaps the problem uses the overall β's. Let me think about that.

Wait, no, the problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Wait, stability constants (β) are generally the overall formation constants, not stepwise. Wait, no, no—stability constants can be either stepwise or overall. So perhaps I misapplied them.

Wait, if β1 is the overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)]^+, then:

β1 = [ [Co(SCN)]^+ ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-] )

Similarly, β2 = [ [Co(SCN)_2] ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 )

β3 = [ [Co(SCN)_3] ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 )

β4 = [ [Co(SCN)_4] ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4 )

In that case, the concentrations would be:

C1 = β1 C0 [S]

C2 = β2 C0 [S]^2

C3 = β3 C0 [S]^3

C4 = β4 C0 [S]^4

But this is a different approach. In this case, each Cn is directly the product of βn * C0 * [S]^n.

So, the coefficients would be:

C0:1 → C0

C1: β1 * [S] =9 *0.1=0.9 → C1=0.9 C0.

C2: β2 * [S]^2 =40 *0.01=0.4 → C2=0.4 C0.

C3: β3 * [S]^3=63 *0.001=0.063 → C3=0.063 C0.

C4: β4 * [S]^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016 → C4=0.0016 C0.

Now, the sum of all Cn is C0 (1) + C1 (0.9) + C2 (0.4) + C3 (0.063) + C4 (0.0016) = 1 + 0.9=1.9 +0.4=2.3 +0.063=2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So sum is 2.3646.

Total Co is 1e-2 M → sum * C0 =1e-2 → C0=1e-2 /2.3646 ≈4.224e-3 M.

Wait, but that would make C2=0.4 *4.224e-3 ≈1.689e-3 M.

So the percentage would be (1.689e-3 / 1e-2) *100 =16.89%, which is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

Ah, so this approach gives 16.9%, which is option D. So perhaps the β's are overall formation constants, not stepwise.

But wait, in the problem statement, it says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So each β represents the overall stability constant for each complex. So for [Co(SCN)]^+, β1=9; [Co(SCN)_2], β2=40; [Co(SCN)_3], β3=63; [Co(SCN)_4], β4=16.

In that case, the concentrations are:

C1 = β1 * C0 [S]

C2 = β2 * C0 [S]^2

C3 = β3 * C0 [S]^3

C4 = β4 * C0 [S]^4

So, each Cn is directly proportional to βn * [S]^n.

So, the sum is 1 + β1 [S] + β2 [S]^2 + β3 [S]^3 + β4 [S]^4.

But wait, that's assuming Cn = βn C0 [S]^n.

So, in this case:

Compute each term:

C0: 1 * C0 → C0.

C1:9 *0.1 * C0=0.9 C0.

C2:40 * (0.1)^2 * C0=40 *0.01 *C0=0.4 C0.

C3:63 * (0.1)^3 * C0=63 *0.001 *C0=0.063 C0.

C4:16 * (0.1)^4 *C0=16 *0.0001 *C0=0.0016 C0.

So the sum of coefficients is: 1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016= 2.3646.

So, total Co is 2.3646 * C0 =1e-2 → C0=1e-2 /2.3646 ≈4.224e-3 M.

So, C2 is 0.4 *4.224e-3=1.6896e-3 M.

The percentage is (1.6896e-3 / 1e-2) *100 =16.896%, which is approximately 16.9%, option D.

So the correct answer is D)16.9%.

Wait, but earlier I thought the β's were stepwise. So why did I get the wrong answer then?

Because I assumed β's are stepwise, but if they're overall, the approach is different.

But the problem states that the β's are the stability constants of the complexes. So each βn is the overall stability constant for the nth complex.

So the correct approach is to treat each βn as the overall constant for [Co(SCN)_n], which changes the way we compute the concentrations.

In this case, the correct percentage is 16.9%, option D.


To determine the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]) among all cobalt-containing species, we analyze the given stability constants (β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16) and the concentrations of Co²⁺ (1 × 10⁻² M) and SCN⁻ (0.1 M). The stability constants are interpreted as overall formation constants for each complex, meaning:

- β₁ corresponds to [Co(SCN)]⁺.
- β₂ corresponds to [Co(SCN)₂].
- β₃ corresponds to [Co(SCN)₃]⁻.
- β₄ corresponds to [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻.

The total cobalt concentration is distributed among the free ion (C₀), the complexes, and the bound ligands. The concentrations of the complexes are proportional to their respective stability constants and powers of the ligand concentration ([SCN⁻]).

### Step 1: Express the concentrations of the complexes
The concentrations of the complexes are given by:
- \( C_1 = \beta_1 \cdot C_0 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-] \)
- \( C_2 = \beta_2 \cdot C_0 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^2 \)
- \( C_3 = \beta_3 \cdot C_0 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^3 \)
- \( C_4 = \beta_4 \cdot C_0 \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^4 \)

Substituting the given values:
- \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
- \( \beta_1 = 9, \, \beta_2 = 40, \, \beta_3 = 63, \, \beta_4 = 16 \)

### Step 2: Calculate the coefficients
The coefficients for each complex are:
- \( C_1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)
- \( C_2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4 \)
- \( C_3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063 \)
- \( C_4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016 \)

The total coefficient is:
\[
\text{Total Coefficient} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( C_0 \)
The total cobalt concentration is:
\[
C_0 + C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + C_4 = 1 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{M}
\]
Substituting the coefficients:
\[
2.3646 \cdot C_0 = 1 \times 10^{-2} \implies C_0 = \frac{1 \times 10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 4.224 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the concentration of [Co(SCN)₂]
The concentration of [Co(SCN)₂] is:
\[
C_2 = 0.4 \cdot C_0 = 0.4 \cdot 4.224 \times 10^{-3} \approx 1.6896 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the percentage
The percentage of [Co(SCN)₂] among all cobalt species is:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{C_2}{\text{Total Co}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1.6896 \times 10^{-3}}{1 \times 10^{-2}} \right) \times 100 \approx 16.9\%
\]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is **16.9%**.
