Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a line element in some coordinate system. I remember that metrics often describe the geometry of a space, so maybe this is a 2-dimensional space since there's only dx and dy.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Pseudosphere... oh right, that's a term from hyperbolic geometry. I think a pseudosphere is like a surface with constant negative curvature. So the metric might be related to hyperbolic space.

Wait, or is it a sphere? No, because pseudosphere has negative curvature. So the usual sphere area formula would be 4πr², but this must be different because of the metric.

The metric given has a denominator 4 - x² - y². Let's see, if 4 is r², then perhaps r is 2, which matches the question. So 4 = (2)^2. So the denominator is (2² - x² - y²). Hmm, maybe this suggests a coordinate system where x² + y² = 4 is the boundary, beyond which the metric might become undefined, like a horizon or something.

Wait, what is the form of a metric for hyperbolic space? I remember that hyperbolic space can be represented in different coordinate systems, like Poincaré disk or the upper half-plane. The Poincaré disk model has a metric where the line element is ds² = (4/(1 - r²)^2)(dr² + r² dθ²), but that's for polar coordinates. Alternatively, in Cartesian coordinates, maybe it's similar.

Wait, in the Poincaré disk model, the metric is usually expressed with a different factor. Let me think. The Poincaré disk has a conformal metric, meaning it's a scalar multiple of the Euclidean metric. The conformal factor is (2/(1 + r²))^2, but wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the metric is (dx² + dy²)/(1 - r²)^2, where r is the radial coordinate.

But in the given metric, it's (32)/(4 - x² - y²) multiplied by (dx² + dy²). So the metric can be written as ds² = 32/(4 - (x² + y²)) (dx² + dy²). Let me think about the denominator: 4 - (x² + y²) is 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4 ) So it's 32/(4(1 - (x² + y²)/4 )) ) = 8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4 )

Wait, so 8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4 ) = 8/(1 - r²/4 ), where r² is x² + y². So the metric becomes ds² = 8/(1 - r²/4) (dr² + r² dθ²), I think, if we switch to polar coordinates. Because in polar coordinates, dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ².

Wait, actually, wait. Let me write it correctly. If x² + y² = r², then the metric in polar coordinates would be ds² = 32/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²). So ds² = (32)/(4 - r²) dr² + (32 r²)/(4 - r²) dθ².

But for hyperbolic space, the metric in the Poincaré disk model is (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 - r²)^2, right? So comparing that to our metric, the conformal factor is (32)/(4 - r²) = 32/(4(1 - r²/4)) ) = 8/(1 - (r²/4)).

Wait, 32/(4 - r²) = 8*(4)/(4 - r²) → Wait, maybe I should factor out the 4 from the denominator. 4 - r² = 4(1 - r²/4). So 32/(4 - r²) = 32/(4*(1 - r²/4)) ) = 8/(1 - r²/4).

So the metric becomes ds² = [8/(1 - r²/4)] (dr² + r² dθ²). Comparing this to the standard Poincaré disk metric, which is (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 - r²)^2, the conformal factor is 1/(1 - r²)^2.

Wait, so in our case, the factor is 8/(1 - (r²/4)). Let me write it as 8/(1 - (r^2)/(2^2)).

So to match the standard form, let's think about the curvature. The Poincaré disk model has curvature K = -1/(radius)^2. Wait, the radius here is the curvature radius, which for K=-1, the radius is 1. If we have a metric with a different radius, say a radius of R, then the metric would be (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 - (r^2/R^2))^2, and the curvature K would be -1/R².

So in our given metric, the conformal factor is 8/(1 - r²/(4)) = 8*(1/(1 - (r²/4))).

Wait, perhaps I should think about the standard form. The standard Poincaré disk metric is ds² = (4 R^2)/(4 R^2 - r^2)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), where R is the radius. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting the scaling wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's (dr² + r² dθ²)/(R² (1 - r²/R²)^2), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric can be rewritten in terms of a hyperbolic metric. Let me think about the line element:

ds² = (32)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ² ), where r² = x² + y².

Let me factor out 4 from the denominator: 4 - r² = 4(1 - r²/4 ). So the denominator becomes 4*(1 - (r²/4)), and the whole expression becomes 32/(4*(1 - r²/4)) ) = 8/(1 - r²/4).

So ds² = [8/(1 - r²/4)] (dr² + r² dθ²).

Now, let's compare this to the standard hyperbolic metric. The standard hyperbolic metric in Poincaré coordinates is:

ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²) / (1 - r²)^2, where r is the radial coordinate in the Poincaré disk model, and the curvature is K = -1.

Wait, but in our case, the denominator is (1 - r²/4 ), squared? Or not? Hmm, wait.

Wait, perhaps the given metric is scaled differently. Let me think: the standard Poincaré metric is (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 - r²)^2. If I let r' = r/2, then r = 2 r', and dr = 2 dr'. Let me substitute this into the standard metric.

So dr² = (2 dr')² =4 dr'².

r² = (2 r')² =4 r'².

So the standard metric becomes (4 dr'^2 +4 r'^2 dθ^2)/(1 - (2 r')^2 )^2 = 4 (dr'^2 + r'^2 dθ^2)/(1 -4 r'^2 )^2.

Wait, but our metric is [8/(1 - r^2/4 ) ] (dr^2 + r^2 dθ^2 ) = 8/(1 - (r^2/4 )) dr² + 8 r²/(1 - (r^2/4 )) dθ^2.

Hmm, if I compare this with the transformed standard metric:

In terms of r' = r/2, the standard metric is [4 (dr'^2 + r'^2 dθ^2 ) ] / (1 -4 r'^2 )^2.

Wait, but our given metric is [8/(1 - r²/4 ) ] (dr² + r^2 dθ² ). Let me substitute r = 2 r' into the given metric:

r = 2 r' → r² = 4 r'² → denominator 1 - (4 r'²)/4 = 1 - r'².

So the given metric becomes:

[8/(1 - r'²) ] (4 dr'^2 +4 r'^2 dθ^2 ) = 8 *4 (dr'^2 + r'^2 dθ^2 )/(1 - r'² ) =32 (dr'^2 + r'^2 dθ^2 )/(1 - r'² )

The standard metric in terms of r' is (dr'^2 + r'^2 dθ^2 )/(1 - r'^2 )^2.

So the given metric is 32/(1 - r'^2 ) multiplied by (dr'^2 + r'^2 dθ² ), but the standard is (1/(1 - r'^2 )^2 ) (dr'^2 + r'^2 dθ² ).

So the given metric is 32 times (dr'^2 + r'^2 dθ² ) divided by (1 - r'^2 ), which is 32 (dr'^2 + r'^2 dθ^2 )/(1 - r'^2 ).

The standard hyperbolic metric is (dr'^2 + r'^2 dθ^2 )/(1 - r'^2 )^2.

So for the given metric to be hyperbolic, the (1 - r'^2 ) in the denominator must be squared. So perhaps there's a mistake in my scaling, or perhaps the given metric is scaled differently.

Alternatively, maybe the given metric is for a hyperbolic space with a different curvature.

Wait, maybe I should compute the Gaussian curvature of the metric to see what it is. The Gaussian curvature K for a metric in polar coordinates ds² = A(r) dr² + B(r) r² dθ² is given by:

K = - (1/(2 B)) d/dr (A' B / A )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compare to known metrics.

Wait, perhaps the given metric is that of a sphere, but the question is about a pseudosphere. Wait, no, pseudosphere has negative curvature.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric describes a sphere of radius 2. Wait, but the metric's denominator has 4 - (x² + y²), which would make sense for a sphere of radius 2, because 4=2². Wait, but the metric looks like a conformal metric, which is similar to a sphere's metric.

Wait, let me think about the sphere's metric. For a sphere of radius a, the metric in polar coordinates is ds² = a² (dr² + r² dθ²)/(a² - r²)^2. Wait, is that right? No, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the metric for a sphere in polar coordinates is ds² = a²/(a² - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ² ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the given metric is not that of a sphere but a pseudosphere, which is a surface of constant negative curvature. So if it's a hyperbolic plane metric, then the area would be infinite because hyperbolic space is non-compact. But wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2.

Wait, but a pseudosphere is a finite area surface, isn't it? Or is the question referring to a hyperbolic space which has infinite area?

Wait, wait, the question says "pseudosphere of radius r=2". I think a pseudosphere is an infinite surface, so its area is infinite. But wait, maybe I'm confusing terms. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a 2-dimensional hyperbolic space (a pseudosphere), and the area would be infinite because it's a non-compact space.

Wait, but the options include D) +infty. So maybe the area is infinite, so the answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is that of a sphere, but with radius 2, so the area would be 4 π (2)^2 = 16 π. But that's not one of the options. Looking at the options, option B and C have 4 π (x² + y²) and (x² - y²). Those are functions, not numerical values. So perhaps the question is about the area as a function, but that doesn't make sense because the area is a scalar.

Wait, but the question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So if the metric is for a pseudosphere, which is a model of hyperbolic 2-space, then the area would be infinite because it's unbounded. So the answer would be D) +infty.

But wait, let me think again. The metric given is in 2D, right? Because it's only dx and dy. So if it's a 2D hyperbolic plane, its area is infinite. So the pseudosphere, as the 2D hyperbolic plane, has infinite area. So the answer would be D.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is for a sphere, but then the area would be finite, but the given options don't have 16 π (as 4 π r² with r=2 is 16 π). So perhaps the given metric is not of a sphere, but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric represents a sphere in a different coordinate system. Let me think: for a sphere of radius a, the metric in isothermal coordinates (which are conformal) is ds² = (4 a²)/(a² - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²). So comparing that to our given metric, which is 32/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ² )= 32/(4 - r²)(dr² + r²dθ²).

If a=2, then 4 a² = 16 a²= 16*(4) =64? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the isothermal metric for a sphere of radius a is (4 a²)/(a² - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ^2 ). So if a=2, then it's (4*4)/(4 - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ² )= 16/(4 -r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ² ). But the given metric is 32/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ² ), which is different. So perhaps it's not a sphere.

So, given that the metric is more similar to a hyperbolic plane (since the denominator is linear in r²), then the space described by this metric is a hyperbolic plane. So the area of a hyperbolic plane is infinite. So the answer would be D) +infty.

Wait, but the options include A) 0, which I don't think makes sense. So putting it all together, the area of the pseudosphere (which is a model of hyperbolic plane) with radius r=2 would have infinite area.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This metric describes a 2-dimensional space with a conformal factor. The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) suggests a boundary at \(x^2 + y^2 = 4\), which corresponds to a radius of \(r = 2\). The metric resembles the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic geometry, where the line element is conformally scaled by a factor that depends on the radial coordinate.

For a pseudosphere (a model of hyperbolic space), the area is infinite because hyperbolic space is non-compact and extends indefinitely. The metric provided aligns with the behavior of hyperbolic geometry, where the curvature is negative, and the space has no boundary other than the asymptotic "horizon" at \(x^2 + y^2 = 4\). This indicates that the space described by the metric is unbounded, leading to an infinite area.

Analyzing the options:
- **A) 0**: This is incorrect because the area of a pseudosphere is not zero.
- **B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)** and **C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: These are functions, not scalar values for the area.
- **D) \(+\infty\)**: This is correct because the pseudosphere, as a model of hyperbolic space, has infinite area.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.

Answer: D
