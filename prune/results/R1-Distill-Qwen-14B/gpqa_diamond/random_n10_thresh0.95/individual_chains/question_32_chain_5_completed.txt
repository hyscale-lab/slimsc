--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. I think nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So, lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number is 3 (protons) +3 (neutrons) =6. Oh wait, wait, no, wait. The atomic number is the number of protons. So lithium has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, then the isotope is Li-6, right? Because 3 protons +3 neutrons =6 nucleons.

So the nucleus is Li-6. That means its mass is the mass of a Li-6 nucleus. But wait, in terms of mass for relativistic calculations, I think we usually consider the rest mass of the particle. So for a nucleus, the rest mass would be the mass of the entire nucleus, which is the sum of the masses of protons, neutrons, and electrons, but wait, no. Wait, for an atomic nucleus, the mass is approximately the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons minus the binding energy (mass defect), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, in particle physics, when considering heavy ions, the rest mass is the mass of the entire nucleus. So maybe I can model this as a single particle with mass m.

So the problem is to find the total energy of the nucleus when its speed is 0.96c. The energy in particle physics usually refers to the total energy, which is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy (m c squared). So the formula for total energy is E = gamma * m c².

But wait, what is gamma? Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I'll need to calculate that.

Given v = 0.96c. Let me compute gamma first.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) 

Calculating (0.96)^2: 0.96 *0.96 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784) is what? Let me think, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 (because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784). So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that. 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but let me double-check: 0.28 times 3.5714 is 1? 0.28 *3 is 0.84, 0.28 *0.5714 is about 0.16. Adding together, 0.84 +0.16=1. So yes, gamma is approximately 3.5714.

So gamma is 3.5714. Now, the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus is m c². But what's m?

Wait, the mass of a Li-6 nucleus. I think the mass is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u), since each nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 1 u. Let me confirm: for the Li-6 nucleus, the mass is about 6 u. So the rest mass energy is 6 u c².

But wait, how to convert this into GeV? Because the options are in GeV.

I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6 u would be 6 *931.5 MeV = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV.

So, m c² =5.589 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Actually, the exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus might be a bit different because of the binding energy. But for the purposes of this problem, perhaps we can approximate it as 6 u, which would give us 5.589 GeV.

So the total energy E is gamma multiplied by m c².

So E = gamma * m c^2 = 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV.

Let me compute that. Let me calculate 3.5714 *5.589.

Hmm, 3 *5.589 is 16.767. 0.5714 is about 0.5714.

0.5714 *5.589: Let's compute 5.589 * 0.5 is 2.7945, 5.589 *0.0714 is approximately 0.3996. So adding 2.7945 +0.3996 =3.1941.

So total E ≈ 16.767 +3.1941 =19.961 GeV.

Wait, but let me do a more precise calculation. Because 3.5714 is 3 + 0.5714.

3 *5.589 =16.767.

0.5714 *5.589: Let's compute 5.589 *0.5=2.7945, 5.589 *0.07=0.39123, 5.589 *0.0014= approx 0.007825.

Adding them: 2.7945 + 0.39123=3.18573 +0.007825=3.193555.

So total E is 16.767 +3.193555=19.960555 GeV, which is approximately 19.96 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

So 19.96 is closest to option C, which is 20.132 GeV. But wait, perhaps I made an approximation that's too rough. Let me check whether the actual calculation is a bit different.

Wait, let me re-calculate gamma more precisely.

v=0.96c.

v² = (0.96)^2 =0.9216.

1 - v²/c² =1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 =3.57142857...

So gamma is approximately 3.57142857.

Now, the calculation of the rest mass energy: 6 u *931.5 MeV/u =5589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.589 GeV.

Let me compute this with more precision.

5.589 *3 =16.767.

0.57142857 *5.589 = ?

0.5 *5.589 =2.7945.

0.07142857 *5.589.

Wait, 0.07142857 is 1/14. So 5.589 /14 = approx 0.399214.

So 0.57142857 *5.589 =2.7945 +0.399214=3.193714.

So 3.57142857 *5.589 =3 *5.589 +0.57142857 *5.589 =16.767 +3.193714=19.960714 GeV.

Hmm, so approximately 19.9607 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Option D is 21.419, which is way higher. Option A is 18.475, which is lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rest mass energy. Maybe the mass of the Li-6 nucleus isn't exactly 6 u. Let me think. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus is actually a bit less than 6 u because the binding energy (mass defect) is about 0.05 u or so.

Wait, the exact mass of Li-6 isotope is approximately 5.919 u. Let me check: The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.01512 u, but wait, that's the atomic mass including electrons. Hmm, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the mass of the nucleus (without electrons) is different from the atomic mass. The atomic mass includes electrons. For a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons. So for Li-6, atomic number is 3, so 3 electrons. So the atomic mass is approximately the mass of the nucleus plus 3 electrons.

But wait, in particle physics, when considering a nucleus as a single particle (like in RHIC), we use the mass of the nucleus. So the actual mass of the Li-6 nucleus is the atomic mass minus the mass of 3 electrons.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.01512 u. The mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, neutron is 1.008665 u. So the mass of a Li-6 nucleus (3 protons and 3 neutrons) would be 3*(1.007276 +1.008665) u?

Wait, let me compute that: 3*(2.015941) =6.047823 u.

But the actual atomic mass is 6.01512 u. So the discrepancy is because in the nucleus, some mass is converted into binding energy (mass defect). So the actual mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.01512 u (atomic mass) minus the mass of 3 electrons (since the nucleus is in the atom, which has 3 electrons). Wait, no: the atomic mass includes the nucleus plus electrons. So the mass of the nucleus is atomic mass minus (number of electrons * electron mass).

Electron mass is about 0.00054858 u. So 3 electrons have a mass of 3 *0.00054858 =0.0016457 u.

So nucleus mass = atomic mass - electrons' mass.

So for Li-6, nucleus mass =6.01512 u -0.0016457 u=6.0134743 u.

Wait, but that can't be right because 3 protons and 3 neutrons would have a mass of 6.047... u, but the nucleus with binding energy would have a lower mass.

Wait a second, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me recall that the mass of a nucleus is given by:

M_nucleus = Z * m_p + (A-Z)*m_n - mass_defect

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus in atomic mass units.

Wait, maybe I can look up the atomic weight of Li-6. The standard atomic weight of lithium is about 6.94, but Li-6 is a specific isotope. The exact mass of Li-6 isotope is approximately 6.01512 u (atomic mass). So the mass of the nucleus is atomic mass minus the mass of 3 electrons. So 6.01512 u - 3*(0.00054858 u) =6.01512 -0.0016457=6.0134743 u.

But wait, another thought: when dealing with heavy ions in colliders, the mass used is the mass of the entire nucleus, which includes the electrons. Or is it the bare nucleus? Hmm, for a nucleus, in collider terms, the effective mass would be just the mass of the nucleus itself, not including the electrons because the electrons are in the atom. Wait, but when considering as a single particle, the nucleus is treated as a single entity with its own mass. So perhaps I should use the atomic mass minus the electron mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just use the mass number (A) as an approximation, so 6 u, even though the actual is a bit less.

If I use 6 u, then the rest mass energy is 6 *931.5 MeV =5589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

But if I use the precise nucleus mass of about 6.0134743 u, that's 6.0134743 *931.5 MeV = let's compute that.

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.0134743 *931.5 ≈ let's compute 0.0134743 *931.5:

Approx 0.01 *931.5=9.315; 0.0034743 *931.5 ≈ 3.233.

So total is 9.315 +3.233≈12.548 MeV.

So total rest mass energy is 5589 +12.548=5601.548 MeV=5.601548 GeV.

So using the more precise nucleus mass, m c² is approximately 5.6015 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.6015 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3 *5.6015 =16.8045.

0.57142857 *5.6015 ≈ Let's compute 0.5 *5.6015=2.80075.

0.07142857 *5.6015≈5.6015 *0.07142857≈approx 0.3994.

So 2.80075 +0.3994=3.19915.

So total E=16.8045 +3.19915=19.99865 GeV, approximately 20.0 GeV.

But wait, the options are given to four decimal places. So perhaps the precise calculation is needed.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute gamma exactly and use precise mass.

Wait, let's compute gamma again.

v =0.96c.

Gamma =1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Mass of Li-6 nucleus is 6.0134743 u.

So m c² =6.0134743 u *931.5 MeV/u =6.0134743 *931.5 MeV.

Let me compute that precisely.

6 *931.5=5589.

0.0134743 *931.5:

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.0034743 *931.5:

Compute 0.003 *931.5=2.7945.

0.0004743 *931.5≈0.4426.

So 2.7945 +0.4426=3.2371.

So 0.0034743 *931.5 ≈3.2371.

So 0.0134743 *931.5=9.315 +3.2371=12.5521 MeV.

So total m c²=5589 +12.5521=5601.5521 MeV =5.6015521 GeV.

So E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.6015521 GeV.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6015521.

Let me compute 3 *5.6015521=16.8046563.

0.57142857 *5.6015521=?

0.5 *5.6015521=2.80077605.

0.07142857 *5.6015521=0.4016 (exact calculation: 5.6015521 *0.07142857.

Compute 5.6015521 *0.07=0.392108647.

5.6015521 *0.00142857≈approx 0.008. So total approx 0.392108647 +0.00798245≈0.400091097.

So 0.57142857 *5.6015521≈2.80077605 +0.400091097=3.20086715.

So total E=16.8046563 +3.20086715=20.0055234 GeV.

So approximately 20.0055 GeV.

Looking at the options again, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher than 20.0055.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, perhaps the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.01512 u, but that's the atomic mass, which includes electrons.

So the mass of the nucleus is atomic mass minus the electrons.

For Li-6, the atomic number is 3, so 3 electrons. Each electron is 0.00054858 u. So 3 electrons=0.00164574 u.

So nucleus mass =6.01512 u -0.00164574 u=6.01347426 u.

Wait, earlier I had 6.0134743 u, which is the same as this. So that part was correct.

So perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6015521.

Another approach is to compute 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6015521.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.0015521≈0.005550.

So total: 2.142857142 +0.005550≈2.148407.

So 3.57142857 *5.6015521=17.85714285 +2.148407=20.0055498 GeV.

So about 20.0055 GeV.

But looking at the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the error is because I used 931.5 MeV/u. Let me check: 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So that's correct.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the nucleus is considered as a collection of protons and neutrons, so the rest mass is sum of individual protons and neutrons minus binding energy. So perhaps the mass isn't exactly 6 u.

Wait, the mass of a Li-6 nucleus: it's (3 protons +3 neutrons) - binding energy.

Protons are about 1.007276 u each, neutrons 1.008665 u.

So 3*(1.007276 +1.008665)=3*(2.015941)=6.047823 u.

But the actual mass is 6.013474 u. So the binding energy is about 6.047823 -6.013474 =0.03435 u, which is about 31.2 MeV (since 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c²).

So the rest mass energy is 6.013474 u *931.5 MeV/u =5.60155 GeV.

But perhaps the problem expects to approximate the nucleus mass as the mass number (A=6) in u, i.e., 6 u, leading to m c²=5.589 GeV.

With that, E=3.57142857 *5.589 ≈19.9607 GeV.

Which would be approximately 19.9607 GeV. But none of the options match this exactly.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Hmm. 19.96 is close to 20 GeV, which is near option C (20.132). But why is there a discrepancy?

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate gamma more accurately.

Wait, let me compute the gamma with more precision.

v =0.96c.

v²/c² =0.9216.

1-v²/c²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.5714285714...

But perhaps using a more precise value of v could change things. Wait, v is exactly 0.96c, so no approximation needed.

Another thought: perhaps I should compute gamma using the exact formula, without approximating sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

Wait, 0.0784 is 196/2500, but perhaps that's complicating.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach: compute sqrt(0.0784) precisely.

Wait, 0.0784 is 784e-4.

sqrt(784)=28. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So no issue there.

So gamma is exactly 3.5714285714.

So then the calculation of E=3.57142857 *5.6015521 GeV gives approximately 20.0055 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, why is there a difference? Did I make a mistake in the mass calculation?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. Oh! Wait, that's a possibility I hadn't considered. Because sometimes in these problems, people confuse total energy with kinetic energy.

Wait, the question says, "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)" so that the speed is 0.96c. So the energy here refers to the total energy (kinetic + rest mass energy), unless specified otherwise.

But sometimes, in collider experiments, the energy can refer to the kinetic energy. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think.

The RHIC accelerates heavy ions to a certain energy. The energy given is their kinetic energy, or the total energy?

Wait, no, in particle physics, when you say the energy of the collider, it's usually the kinetic energy added to the rest mass, but sometimes it's the total energy.

Wait, no, for heavy ions, the energy is usually given as the kinetic energy per nucleon or per ion. But in this problem, the options are in GeV, which is a unit of energy.

Wait, but looking at the calculation: if the energy E is the total energy (gamma * m c²), then it's about 20 GeV. So if the options have 20.132 GeV, then perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the kinetic energy.

Kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c².

So in that case, KE= (3.57142857 -1)*5.6015521 GeV.

=2.57142857 *5.6015521≈?

2 *5.6015521=11.2031.

0.57142857 *5.6015521≈3.200867.

So KE=11.2031 +3.200867≈14.404 GeV.

But that's lower than all the options except A, which is 18.475 GeV.

Wait, so that can't be right. So the problem must be referring to the total energy, not the kinetic.

Thus, the total energy is about 20 GeV, so the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

But why is the calculation giving me 20.0055 GeV and the option is 20.132?

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong mass for the nucleus.

Wait, let me compute the exact mass of Li-6 in u.

I found online that the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.01512 u.

But since the nucleus is Li-6, the mass is 6.01512 u minus the mass of 3 electrons.

Wait, each electron is about 0.00054858 u, so 3 electrons is about 0.0016457 u.

So nucleus mass =6.01512 -0.0016457=6.0134743 u.

Then, m c²=6.0134743 u *931.5 MeV/u =5.60155 GeV.

So E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.60155 GeV.

Let me compute this with more precise decimals.

3.57142857 *5.60155.

Breaking it down:

3 *5.60155 =16.80465.

0.57142857 *5.60155.

Let me compute 0.5 *5.60155=2.800775.

0.07142857 *5.60155.

Compute 5.60155 *0.07=0.3921085.

5.60155 *0.00142857≈0.007985.

So 0.3921085 +0.007985=0.4000935.

So 0.57142857 *5.60155=2.800775 +0.4000935=3.2008685.

So total E=16.80465 +3.2008685=20.0055185 GeV.

So approximately 20.0055 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.126 GeV higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, gamma=1/sqrt(1 -v²/c²).

V is 0.96c, so v²=0.9216 c².

1 -v²/c²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

But perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, so gamma is exactly 3.5714285714.

So perhaps I should think about other factors. Oh! Wait, maybe the mass used is the actual mass including the binding energy, which is lower than 6 u, but perhaps in the problem, the mass is considered as 6 u.

So if I use m=6 u, then m c²=6 *931.5=5589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.589.

3 *5.589=16.767.

0.57142857 *5.589= let's compute.

0.5 *5.589=2.7945.

0.07142857 *5.589= approx 0.3992.

So 2.7945 +0.3992=3.1937.

Total E=16.767 +3.1937=19.9607 GeV.

Which is about 19.9607 GeV.

So there's a discrepancy between using 6 u and 6.01347 u.

Wait, but why is the option C 20.132? Let me compute 20.132 /20.0055≈1.006. So perhaps the actual calculation is using a different approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is given as 0.96c, but the calculation is done with more precise v.

Wait, if v is 0.96c, but perhaps using more precise v^2 calculation.

Wait, 0.96^2 is exactly 0.9216, so no error there.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the formula. The energy of the nucleus is given by gamma*m c². So if the nucleus has a higher mass (like 6.01347 u), the energy increases a bit.

So with m=6.01347 u, E=3.57142857 *5.60155 GeV=20.0055 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.126 GeV higher.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) multiplied by the number of nucleons, but that would be overcounting.

Alternatively, perhaps the nucleus is being treated as a composite particle with each nucleon having its own gamma, but no, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using exact values without approximations.

Let me compute gamma precisely.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)=1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So no issue here.

Now, the rest mass energy m c²=6.0134743 u *931.5 MeV/u.

Let me compute 6.0134743 *931.5.

6 *931.5=5,589.

0.0134743 *931.5=let's compute:

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.0034743 *931.5.

Compute 0.003 *931.5=2.7945.

0.0004743 *931.5= approx 0.442.

So 2.7945 +0.442=3.2365.

So 0.0034743 *931.5=3.2365.

So 0.0134743 *931.5=9.315 +3.2365=12.5515.

So total m c²=5,589 +12.5515=5,601.5515 MeV=5.6015515 GeV.

Now, E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.6015515.

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.6015515.

3 *5.6015515=16.8046545.

0.57142857 ×5.6015515.

Breaking it down:

0.5 ×5.6015515=2.80077575.

0.07142857 ×5.6015515.

Compute 5.6015515 ×0.07=0.392108605.

5.6015515 ×0.00142857= approximately 0.007985.

So 0.392108605 +0.007985=0.400093605.

So 0.57142857 ×5.6015515=2.80077575 +0.400093605=3.200869355.

So total E=16.8046545 +3.200869355=20.00552385 GeV.

So approximately 20.0055 GeV.

Hmm. So why is option C 20.132 GeV? There must be a mistake, perhaps in the initial assumption of the nucleus mass.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the nucleus as a single proton? No, no, the nucleus is Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps I have a mistake in the number of neutrons.

Wait, the problem states that X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. So Li has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons, making it Li-6. So the mass is correct.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is done using a different value for 1 u. For example, if 1 u is 931.494 MeV/c² instead of 931.5 MeV/c².

So let's recompute with 931.494 MeV/u.

So m c²=6.0134743 u *931.494 MeV/u.

Compute 6 *931.494=5,588.964 MeV.

0.0134743 *931.494.

Compute:

0.01 *931.494 =9.31494.

0.0034743 *931.494= let's compute:

0.003 *931.494=2.794482.

0.0004743 *931.494= approx 0.4422.

So 2.794482 +0.4422=3.236682.

So 0.0034743 *931.494=3.236682.

Total 0.0134743 *931.494=9.31494 +3.236682=12.551622.

So m c²=5,588.964 +12.551622=5,601.515622 MeV=5.601515622 GeV.

Now E=3.57142857 *5.601515622.

Compute 3 *5.601515622=16.804546866.

0.57142857 *5.601515622= let's compute.

0.5 *5.601515622=2.800757811.

0.07142857 *5.601515622.

Compute 5.601515622 ×0.07= 0.3921060935.

5.601515622 ×0.00142857= approx 0.007985.

So 0.3921060935 +0.007985=0.4000910935.

So 0.57142857 *5.601515622=2.800757811 +0.4000910935=3.2008489045.

Total E=16.804546866 +3.2008489045=20.00539577 GeV.

Still about 20.0054 GeV.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a calculation mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.60155 GeV precisely using a calculator method.

3.57142857 ×5.60155.

Let me set it up as:

5.60155  
×3.57142857  
= ?

Compute each digit:

First, 5.60155 ×3 =16.80465.

5.60155 ×0.5 =2.800775.

5.60155 ×0.07=0.3921085.

5.60155 ×0.001=0.00560155.

5.60155 ×0.0004=0.00224062.

5.60155 ×0.00002=0.000112031.

5.60155 ×0.000008=0.0000448124.

5.60155 ×0.00000057≈0.00000319.

So adding all contributions:

16.80465 +2.800775 =19.605425.

+0.3921085=19.9975335.

+0.00560155=20.00313505.

+0.00224062=20.00537567.

+0.000112031=20.0054877.

+0.0000448124=20.00553251.

+0.00000319=20.0055357.

So total E≈20.005536 GeV.

Still around 20.0055 GeV. So none of the options match exactly. The closest is option C (20.132 GeV) and option D (21.419 GeV) is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mass.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the nuclear mass is taken as 6.94 GeV/c². No, that can't be right because that's the atomic mass including electrons.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the relativistic energy expression without considering the precise rest mass, perhaps using the mass number A=6, but treating it as 6 GeV/c².

Wait, 1 GeV/c² is approximately 1.097e-27 kg. But that's not directly relevant.

Wait, if m=6 GeV/c², then:

gamma =3.57142857.

E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *6 GeV=21.4285714 GeV.

Which is approximately 21.4286 GeV, which is very close to option D)21.419 GeV.

Ah! So perhaps the question expects you to take the nucleus mass as 6 GeV/c², leading to E=21.4286 GeV, which rounds to option D (21.419 GeV). But wait, why would they do that?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation where I used the actual nuclear mass. But perhaps the problem expects the mass to be taken as A u, where A is the mass number.

In that case, A=6, so m=6 u. So m c²=6 *931.5 MeV=5.589 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.589=19.9607 GeV.

But that's not any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the mass is taken as (A + Z)*u, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the rest mass energy as the mass of the entire atom, not the nucleus. So for Li-6, atomic mass is 6.01512 u. So m=6.01512 u.

Then m c²=6.01512 *931.5 MeV=5.603 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.603= let's compute.

3 *5.603=16.809.

0.57142857 *5.603=3.195.

So total E=16.809 +3.195=20.004 GeV.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, another thought. Maybe I should calculate the energy per nucleon and then multiply by the number of nucleons. Wait, no, the problem refers to the nucleus as a whole, so energy is per nucleus.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the velocity is given as a fraction of c, and the calculation uses natural units where c=1. So gamma is 1/sqrt(1-v^2).

Wait, v=0.96, so v²=0.9216.

1-v²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

Gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

So that's the same as before.

So if I have m=6 GeV/c², then E=gamma *m=3.57142857 *6=21.42857 GeV, which is approximately 21.4286 GeV. So option D is 21.419 GeV, which is close.

Alternatively, if m=6.01347 u *931.5 MeV/u=5.6015 GeV. So E=20.0055 GeV.

But since option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute with more precise figures.

Wait, 3.57142857 *5.60155=?

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.60155.

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.60155=?

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.00155=0.00554441.

So adding: 2.142857142 +0.00554441=2.14840155.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.14840155=20.0055444 GeV.

So about 20.0055 GeV.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, but it's not matching exactly. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the speed as 0.96c, but in the calculation, uses a different approximation for gamma.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the calculation is done using beta= v/c=0.96, and gamma=1/sqrt(1-beta^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857, which is correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is 20.0055 GeV, but since the options don't have that, I must have made a mistake in considering the mass.

Wait, perhaps the mass is taken as the mass of a single proton, but that's not the case.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the problem uses the relativistic energy expression with E^2 = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2, but since the particle is moving at high speed, p≈gamma m v. So perhaps it's better to compute it that way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c², but I think that was ruled out earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the precise value of gamma * m c² using a calculator.

Wait, 3.57142857 multiplied by 5.60155.

3.57142857 ×5.60155.

Let me compute:

3 ×5 =15.

3 ×0.60155=1.80465.

0.57142857 ×5=2.85714285.

0.57142857 ×0.60155=0.3438.

Adding all:

15 +1.80465=16.80465.

+2.85714285=19.66179285.

+0.3438=20.00559285 GeV.

So approximately 20.0056 GeV.

Hmm, but the options don't have this value. The closest is option C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the initial calculation of the rest mass.

Wait, the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Li-6 has 3 protons, 3 neutrons.

The exact mass can be found using the formula:

Mass of nucleus = Z*m_p + N*m_n - binding energy.

But I don't have the exact binding energy, but perhaps I can look up the exact mass.

Upon checking, the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.013474 u.

So, m c²=6.013474 u ×931.5 MeV/u=5.60155 GeV.

Thus, E=gamma ×m c²=3.57142857 ×5.60155=20.0055 GeV.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to approximate.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation is needed, and the correct answer is option C, but I'm not seeing why.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma again precisely.

v=0.96c.

v²= (0.96)^2 c²=0.9216 c².

1-v²/c²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

So that's correct.

So, perhaps the problem is in the rest mass energy. Let me compute m c² again.

m=6.013474 u.

m c²=6.013474 ×931.5 MeV.

6 ×931.5=5,589 MeV.

0.013474 ×931.5=12.55 MeV.

So m c²=5,589 +12.55=5,601.55 MeV=5.60155 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 ×5.60155=?

3.57142857 ×5.60155= let's compute.

3 ×5=15.

3 ×0.60155=1.80465.

0.57142857 ×5=2.85714285.

0.57142857 ×0.60155=0.3438.

Total:

15 +1.80465=16.80465.

+2.85714285=19.66179285.

+0.3438=20.00559285 GeV.

So, 20.0056 GeV.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem uses 931.494 MeV/u as the conversion factor.

So, m c²=6.013474 ×931.494 MeV.

Compute 6.013474 ×931.494.

Let me compute 6 ×931.494=5,588.964.

0.013474 ×931.494= 12.548 MeV.

So m c²=5,588.964 +12.548=5,601.512 MeV=5.601512 GeV.

E=3.57142857 ×5.601512.

3 ×5.601512=16.804536.

0.57142857 ×5.601512=3.20087.

So total E=16.804536 +3.20087=20.005406 GeV.

Still about 20.0054 GeV.

Hmm. It's frustrating. Since none of the options match exactly, perhaps the correct answer is intended to be option C, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the relativistic energy formula with E = mc² / sqrt(1 -v²/c²), which is the same as gamma *m c².

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem asks for the kinetic energy, which is E - m c²= (gamma -1) m c².

So, KE= (3.57142857 -1) ×5.60155=2.57142857 ×5.60155.

Which is approximately 14.404 GeV.

That's not in the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the relativistic momentum and energy equations, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, let me think: another approach. The energy can also be calculated using E = gamma m c², and gamma can be expressed in terms of velocity.

But I don't think that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the energy to be expressed as E = (gamma) * (m c²), where m is the mass of a single nucleon multiplied by the number of nucleons. But that would be incorrect, because the nucleus is treated as a whole.

Wait, Li-6 has 6 nucleons (3 protons +3 neutrons). So if each has a mass of about 1 u, total is 6 u, so m=6 u. So m c²=5.589 GeV.

E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 ×5.589=19.9607 GeV.

But that's option ... none of the options exactly. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, but I can't reconcile it with the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus. Let me check another source.

Upon checking, the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.013474 u. So I think that's correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think the intended answer is option C, but according to the calculations, it's about 20.0055 GeV, which is approximately 20.0055 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the calculation uses a more precise gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

gamma=1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.571428571428571...

So precise gamma is 3.5714285714.

Now, E=3.5714285714 *5.60155 GeV.

Compute 3.5714285714 *5.60155:

3 *5.60155=16.80465.

0.5714285714 *5.60155=3.20087.

So total E=16.80465 +3.20087=20.00552 GeV.

Hmm. So I think the correct answer is approximately 20.0055 GeV, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects to use the rest mass as 6.94 GeV/c² (the atomic mass). Let me compute that.

m=6.94 u.

m c²=6.94 *931.5=6477.41 MeV=6.47741 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *6.47741=?

3 *6.47741=19.43223.

0.57142857 *6.47741=3.7101.

So E=19.43223 +3.7101=23.1423 GeV.

Which is close to option B)23.069 GeV. But that's a big difference.

Hmm. I'm not sure. I think I've spent enough time on this. Given the calculations, the closest option is C)20.132 GeV, but according to my precise calculation, it's about 20.0055 GeV. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, but I can't find where.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus \( X \) (Li-6) is \( 0.96c \), we calculate the total energy using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

For \( v = 0.96c \):

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 = 0.0784, \quad \sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28
\]

Thus:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} = 3.57142857
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy \( m c^2 \)
The nucleus \( X \) is Li-6, which has a mass of approximately \( 6.013474 \, u \), where \( u \) is the atomic mass unit. Converting this to energy:

\[
1 \, u = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2, \quad m c^2 = 6.013474 \, u \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/u = 5.60155 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
Using \( E = \gamma m c^2 \):

\[
E = 3.57142857 \times 5.60155 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this into components:

\[
3 \times 5.60155 = 16.80465, \quad 0.57142857 \times 5.60155 \approx 3.20087
\]

Adding these:

\[
E = 16.80465 + 3.20087 = 20.00552 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated total energy is approximately \( 20.0055 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:

- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too high.

### Conclusion
The closest option to the calculated energy is **C) 20.132 GeV**. While the exact calculation yields \( 20.0055 \, \text{GeV} \), minor approximations or rounding in the problem setup may account for the slight discrepancy.

Answer: C
