Okay, I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's read it carefully. So, the question is about transit probabilities of two Earth-like planets. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability because they have limited time. Both planets have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Wait, the problem says both have the same mass. Oh, but the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1's period is P1, and Planet_2's is P2 = 3*P1. Hmm, no, wait: the problem says Planet_1's period is three times shorter, so P1 is P2 /3. Because, shorter period means it's closer in, right?

The stars: The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they have same radii. So, same size but different masses.

The question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the size of the orbit. The formula for transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by something else, but wait, no—the main factors are the orbital distance and the relative sizes.

Wait, the transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective) is given by (R_star + R_planet)/(a), but I might have it a bit wrong. Alternatively, another approach is that the probability is proportional to (R_p / a) * (something else?), but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Oh, right! The probability of a transit is approximately (R_*/a), where R_* is the radius of the star and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (in the same units). But wait, actually, the formula I remember is P = (R_p + R_*) / a, but wait, no. Or maybe it's (R_*/a) multiplied by the impact parameter? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, the probability is the ratio of the area of the star's disk to the area that the planet can transit when considering the orbital plane. Wait, perhaps the transit probability is (R_*/a) multiplied by (some factor based on the relative sizes). Or maybe it's (R_*/a) times something else.

Wait, I think I should look up the formula again. Oh wait, I can't look it up right now, so I'll try to recall. The transit probability is the ratio of the size of the star plus the planet (but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, maybe it's approximated as R_*) over the orbital distance (in the same unit). So P ≈ (R_*) / a, but wait, that doesn't make sense because a is in astronomical units or meters, and R_* is in radius, which is a distance from the center. Alternatively, I think the probability is proportional to (R_*) / a. Because the planet has a small chance of passing in front if the orbital distance is much larger.

But wait, another formula I remember is P = (R_*) / a, but that can't be right because if a is in the same unit as R_*, say both in solar radii, then for a=1 AU, which is much larger than R_* (about 0.0047 AU for a star), the probability would be very small, which makes sense because transits are rare.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_* + R_p) / a, but since R_p << R_*, it's approximately R_*/a. So the probability is proportional to R_* / a.

Wait, but also, the semi-major axis a is determined by the orbital period and the star's mass using Kepler's third law. So a^3 = (G(M_*) P^2)/(4π²). But since the planets have the same mass, but what about the Kepler's law? So for each planet, a is determined by the mass of the star and the orbital period.

Given that, let's compute a for each planet. Kepler's third law: a^3 = (G(M_*) P^2) / (4π²). But we can ignore the constants and just relate a to M and P.

So a is proportional to [ (M_*) * P² ]^(1/3).

So for Planet_1, M1 is 2 M2 (because the host star's mass is twice that of Planet_2's host). Wait, no: the host of Planet_1 has mass M1 = 2 M2, where M2 is the host of Planet_2.

The orbital period of Planet_1 is P1 = (P2)/3 because it's three times shorter. So P1 = P2 /3.

So for Planet_1, a1 is proportional to (2 M2) * (P1^2) )^(1/3). Since P1 = P2/3, P1^2 = P2²/9.

So a1 ∝ (2 M2 ) * (P2² / 9 ) )^(1/3) = [ (2/9) M2 P2² ]^(1/3).

For Planet_2, a2 is proportional to (M2 * P2² )^(1/3).

So the ratio a1/a2 would be [ (2/9) M2 P2² )^(1/3) ] / [ (M2 P2² )^(1/3) ) ] = (2/9)^(1/3) = (2)^(1/3) / (9)^(1/3). Let's compute that.

2^(1/3) is about 1.26, and 9^(1/3) is about 2.08. So 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.605. So a1 is about 0.605 times a2. Hmm, so a1 is smaller than a2, which makes sense because Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period, so it's closer to its star.

Now, the transit probability is P = (R_*) / a.

But wait, the stars have the same radius R_*. The problem says both host stars have the same radii. So R1 = R2 = R.

So the transit probability for Planet_1: P1_prob = R / a1.

For Planet_2: P2_prob = R / a2.

So the ratio P1_prob / P2_prob = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2 / a1.

From earlier, a1/a2 ≈ 0.605, so a2/a1 ≈ 1.65.

So P1_prob / P2_prob = 1.65. So P1_prob is about 1.65 times P2_prob.

Wait, that can't be right. Because a1 is smaller than a2, so R/a1 is larger than R/a2, meaning Planet_1 has a higher probability to transit.

Wait, but wait: If a is smaller, then R/a is larger. So yes, Planet_1 has higher probability.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher than Planet_2 by about 1.65 times. So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1 because it has a higher probability.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says ~2.7 times, which is higher than what I calculated.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of a1 and a2.

Wait, let's recalculate the a ratio more accurately.

M1 = 2 M2

P1 = P2 /3

So a1^3 = (M1 * P1^2 ) = 2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 = 2 M2 * P2² /9.

a2^3 = M2 * P2^2.

So a1 = [ (2 M2 P2² ) / 9 ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ M2 P2² ]^(1/3 )

So a1 / a2 = [ (2/9) ]^(1/3 ) = (2/9)^(1/3).

Compute 2/9 = approximately 0.2222.

The cube root of 0.2222: Let's compute.

0.2222^(1/3) ≈ 0.605, as before.

So a1 = 0.605 a2.

So the ratio a2/a1 is about 1.65.

Thus, P1_prob is (R/a1) = (R/(0.605 a2)) = (1/0.605) * (R/a2) ≈ 1.65 * (R/a2) = 1.65 * P2_prob.

So Planet_1's transit probability is 1.65 times that of Planet_2.

So the researchers should prefer Planet_1, which is option C.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

So the correct answer is C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula and the given parameters. The transit probability is proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \), with smaller \( a \) leading to a higher probability.

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_* P^2 \), where \( M_* \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period, we calculate the semi-major axis ratio \( a_1 / a_2 \) for Planet_1 and Planet_2. The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host (\( M_1 = 2M_2 \)), and Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter (\( P_1 = P_2 / 3 \)).

For Planet_1:
\[
a_1^3 \propto M_1 P_1^2 = 2M_2 \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{2}{9} M_2 P_2^2
\]

For Planet_2:
\[
a_2^3 \propto M_2 P_2^2
\]

The ratio of semi-major axes is:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{\frac{2}{9} M_2 P_2^2}{M_2 P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.605
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.605 a_2 \), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its star and has a smaller semi-major axis. Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), Planet_1's transit probability is higher than Planet_2's. The ratio of transit probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{0.605} \approx 1.65
\]

Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. The researchers should prefer observing Planet_1.

**Critical analysis of options:**
- **Option A and B:** Incorrect. These suggest Planet_2 has a higher transit probability, which contradicts the calculations.
- **Option C:** Correct. Planet_1 has a 1.65 times higher transit probability, aligning with the calculations.
- **Option D:** Incorrect. This overestimates the transit probability ratio as 2.7 times, which is inconsistent with the derived value.

**Answer: C**
