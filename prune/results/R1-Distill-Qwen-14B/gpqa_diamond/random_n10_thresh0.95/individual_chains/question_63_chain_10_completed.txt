--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and how it transitions between energy states when a photon is absorbed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The molecule is made up of atoms X and Y. The question gives me their masses: Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of the photon that will take it to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the quantum rotation-vibration model... I remember that for a diatomic molecule, the energy levels come from both rotational and vibrational motions. Oh right, the rigid rotor model describes rotational states, and the quantum harmonic oscillator for vibrations. But wait, the question says it's the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, but I think for the fundamental state, it's the lowest energy for both rotation and vibration.

In the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized and depend on the rotational quantum number J. The energy for rotation is given by E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) J(J+1), where I is the moment of inertia. But wait, the non-rigid rotor would allow some stretching, but perhaps for this problem, R is fixed, so maybe we can treat it as a rigid rotor for the rotation part.

The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is the vibrational quantum number. The fundamental state is n=0, so the energy is (1/2) ħω.

Now, the molecule is in the fundamental state. Wait, the fundamental state probably refers to the lowest energy state, which is the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So I think that's the state where J=0 and n=0.

But the question says, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So what's the next state? I think the next possible state would be the first excited state, but which transition is allowed? Well, in quantum mechanics, transitions are governed by selection rules. For rotations, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. For vibrations, Δn = ±1.

Wait, but the question says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So maybe the molecule can transition either to a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. Which one requires less energy? Because the energy levels are quantized, the next state could either be the first excited vibrational state (n=1) or the first excited rotational state (J=1).

Let me think about the energies. The vibrational energy level spacing is ΔE_vib = ħω. The rotational energy level spacing between J=0 and J=1 is E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = (ħ²/(2I)) [1(2) - 0] = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/(I). So which is larger, ħω or ħ²/(I)?

I need to calculate both to compare.

First, calculate the moment of inertia I. I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass. The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Let's compute that.

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So Mx + My is 22. So μ = (20*2)/(22) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. Oh wait, but I need to convert that into kilograms because the moment of inertia uses SI units.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ ≈ (20/11) * 1.6605e-27 kg. Let me calculate that.

20/11 is approximately 1.818. 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ let's see, 1.8 * 1.66e-27 ≈ around 2.988e-27 kg. Let me be more precise: 20/11 is exactly 1.8181818... So 1.8181818 * 1.6605e-27 = let's compute 1.8181818 * 1.6605 ≈ about 3.022e-27 kg? Wait wait, actually 1.818 *1.6605 = let's compute 1.8 *1.6605 is 2.989, and 0.018 *1.6605 is about 0.0298, so total 3.0188e-27 kg.

Then R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R is 2e-10 m.

So I = μ R² = (3.022e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.022e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2088e-46 kg m².

Now, the rotational energy difference when J increases by 1: ΔE_rot = E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = (ħ²/(2I)) * [1*(1+1) - 0] = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = (ħ²)/I.

Plugging in the numbers:

ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²s².

So ΔE_rot = (1.112e-68) / (1.2088e-46) = approximately 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, wait, let me calculate that again:

1.112e-68 / 1.2088e-46 = (1.112 /1.2088) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.92 * 1e-22 = 9.2e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference is ΔE_vib = ħω. Given ω is 4e14 rad/s.

So ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

Wait, 4.218e-20 J is way larger than the rotational ΔE of 9.2e-23 J. So 4.2e-20 is about 46 times larger than 9.2e-23. So the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational one.

Therefore, to move to the next lowest energy state, the photon would cause a transition to J=1, keeping n=0, because that's a lower energy increase than going to n=1.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which could imply the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So the next state would be the next higher energy state, which for the same molecule would be either the next rotational level (J=1) or the next vibrational level (n=1). Since the rotational transition requires less energy, the photon's energy would match the rotational transition.

Wait, but the question says, what momentum should the photon have. Momentum p of a photon is related to its energy. The energy of the photon is E_photon = ΔE. Since E=pc for photons (because their mass is zero, so E=pc), so p = E_photon / c.

Wait! Wait, no, E = pc only if the photon's mass is zero, which it is. So p = E/c.

So, the photon's energy is the energy required for the transition. So if the transition is a rotational one, which requires ΔE_rot = 9.2e-23 J, then the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, and its momentum is E/c = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but let's double-check the numbers.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy. Let me recalculate the moment of inertia.

Wait, μ was (20 * 2)/(20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. Converting to kg: 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg, so 20/11 * 1.6605e-27 = about 3.022e-27 kg. Correct.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. So R squared is (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

I = μ R² = 3.022e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2088e-46 kg m². Correct.

Then, the rotational energy difference is (ħ²)/(2I) * [J(J+1) - J_prev(J_prev +1)]. For J=0 to J=1, it's (1*2 - 0) = 2. So the ΔE_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/I.

Compute ħ²: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²s². Correct.

So ΔE_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.2088e-46 = approximately 9.2e-23 J. Correct.

And the vibrational ΔE is ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 ≈ 4.218e-20 J. So yes, the rotational transition is lower in energy.

So the photon's energy should be equal to ΔE_rot = 9.2e-23 J.

Then, the momentum p is E/c. Let's compute that.

E = 9.2e-23 J.

c = 3e8 m/s.

p = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s. Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are around 1e-31. Let me look at the options:

Options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C)1.1e-27 Ns

D)1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, wait a second. Ns is the same as kg m/s, since 1 Ns =1 kg m/s. So all options are in kg m/s. But my calculation gives p=3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is 3.07e-31 Ns. But none of the options are anywhere near that. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm. Let me go back and check.

Wait, perhaps I confused the reduced mass. Let me recalculate μ again.

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. Correct.

Wait, but when calculating I, I used R as 2e-10 m. Correct. So I = 3.022e-27 kg * (2e-10)^2 = 1.2088e-46 kg m². Correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rotational energy calculation. Let me re-express the rotational energy formula.

The rotational energy levels are E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * J(J+1). So the difference between J=0 and J=1 is (ħ²/(2I)) * [1*(2) - 0] = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = (ħ^2) / I.

Ok, that's correct.

Hmm. So why do the options not match this? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of μ. Let me check amu to kg again.

Wait, 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg. So 20/11 amu = (20/11)*1.6605e-27 kg.

20/11 is approximately 1.81818. 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = let's compute 1.8 * 1.6605 = 2.989, and 0.01818 *1.6605≈0.02998. So total is about 3.0189e-27 kg.

So I = 3.0189e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0189e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.20756e-46 kg m².

Calculating ħ squared: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J·s².

So ΔE_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.20756e-46 ≈ approximately 9.206e-23 J.

Hmm, so 9.2e-23 J. So photon energy E = 9.2e-23 J. Then momentum p = E/c = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but the options are all in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range. That's way bigger than my result. So perhaps I made a mistake in the model.

Wait, the question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model. Oh, wait, maybe the molecule is in the fundamental vibrational state but with some rotational state. No, the question says it's in the fundamental state, which would be the lowest energy for both rotation and vibration. So J=0, n=0.

Wait, perhaps the next state is a combination where both n and J increase. But that would require more energy, so it's not the next lowest. The next state with the lowest energy would be either J=1 (rotational) or n=1 (vibrational). Since the rotational requires less energy, the photon should match the rotational transition.

Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in the way I considered the energy levels. Maybe the question is considering only vibrational transitions. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the problem in terms of the rovibrational energy levels, which combine both rotation and vibration.

Wait, the rotation-vibration model typically includes both. So the energy levels are a combination of both. The total energy would be E = E_vib + E_rot. So the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state would be either n=1, J=0 or J=1, n=0. Which of these is lower in energy?

Let's compute the energies.

E_vib(n=1) = (1 + 1/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω ≈ 6.327e-20 J.

E_rot(J=1) = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = (1.112e-68 J s²) / (1.2088e-46 kg m²) ) * 2? Wait, no, earlier calculation said E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(0) is 9.2e-23 J, so E_rot(J=1) is 9.2e-23 J.

So the next lowest state after the fundamental (n=0, J=0) is either J=1, n=0, which is E=9.2e-23 J, or n=1, J=0, which is E=6.327e-20 J. So the J=1, n=0 is lower in energy, so the photon would cause a transition to J=1, n=0.

So the photon energy is 9.2e-23 J.

Then, the photon's momentum is p = E/c = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 N s.

But the options are all much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, wait. Maybe the question is considering the molecule transitioning to the next higher energy state, which could be a combination of vibrational and rotational transitions. But that would be higher in energy, so the next state would be the one with the lowest possible energy increase.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the energy required for the transition to the next state as the sum of both vibrational and rotational steps. No, that's not right because the fundamental state is the lowest, so the next state would be either a higher J or a higher n.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the energy of the photon required for the transition, either rotational or vibrational, and choose the one with the lower energy.

Wait, but as we saw, the rotational transition energy is much lower. So the photon's energy is about 9.2e-23 J.

But the options don't have anything close. Let me look again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moment of inertia.

Wait, maybe I forgot to convert R from angstroms to meters? No, R is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. Correct.

Hmm... Maybe I should check the formula for the rotational energy.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) J(J+1). The energy difference between J and J+1 is E_rot(J+1) – E_rot(J) = (ħ²/(2I)) [ (J+1)(J+2) – J(J+1) ] = (ħ²/(2I)) [ (J+1)(J+2 - J) ) ] = (ħ²/(2I)) (J+1)*2 = (ħ² (J+1)) / I.

Wait, when transitioning from J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is (ħ² (0+1)) / I = ħ² / I, which matches what I did earlier. So that part is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the question is looking for the transition from J=0 to J=2? No, that would require more energy. The selection rule for rotation is ΔJ=±1, so the allowed transition is J=0→1.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the vibrational transition, not the rotational one.

Wait, if the photon causes a vibrational transition, the energy is ħω. Let's compute that.

ω is 4e14 rad/s. ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

Photon momentum p = (4.218e-20 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 1.406e-28 kg·m/s = 1.406e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns. That's close.

So why would the photon cause a vibrational transition instead of a rotational one?

Because perhaps in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (n=0), but the rotational state is not necessarily J=0. Wait, but the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. So n=0 and J=0.

Wait, but perhaps the model allows for the molecule to be in a higher rotational state but same vibrational state. No, because the fundamental state is the lowest.

Alternatively, perhaps the rotational energy is negligible compared to the vibrational, but that doesn't fit with the numbers we have.

Wait, but the energy for rotational transition is 9.2e-23 J, which is way less than the vibrational transition of 4.2e-20 J. So why would the photon cause a vibrational transition?

Unless the question is not considering rotational transitions, but only vibrational, but that's not the case because the model is rotation-vibration.

Hmm... Maybe the model in question considers only the vibrational transition, and that the rotational states are not considered in the transition. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering whether the next state is the first excited rotational or vibrational state. Let me think about the energy levels.

n=0, J=0: E = (1/2)ħω + 0 = (1/2)(4.218e-20 J) ≈ 2.109e-20 J.

n=0, J=1: E = (1/2)ħω + (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = 2.109e-20 J + 9.2e-23 J ≈ 2.118e-20 J.

n=1, J=0: E = (3/2)ħω +0 = 6.327e-20 J.

So the next state with the lowest energy after n=0, J=0 is n=0, J=1, which is 2.118e-20 J, which is higher than the initial 2.109e-20 J by about 9.2e-23 J.

But the vibrational transition to n=1, J=0 would require E=6.327e-20 J, which is a much larger increase.

So the photon's energy needed is 9.2e-23 J, leading to a momentum of 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, maybe the question is not about the transition to the next rotational state, but the next vibrational state. Why would that be the case?

Because perhaps in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the fundamental state refers to the vibrational state being the fundamental (n=0), and the rotational state can have higher J. So the next state in energy would be the same vibrational state but higher J.

But wait, the question says, the photon is absorbed to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon's energy must be the minimum possible to reach the next state.

So between the two options (rotational or vibrational transition), the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, leading to p=3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the photon's energy is the sum of both a vibrational and rotational transition. No, that would be higher energy, not the minimal.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a different approach, such as the energy of the photon being the energy difference between the vibrational and rotational states. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the rotational state n=0, J=0 to n=1, J=0, but that would require the vibrational energy plus any rotational energy if applicable. But that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the vibrational energy, and the rotational energy is a separate consideration, but the photon's energy is the vibrational one.

Wait, but earlier calculation for vibrational transition energy is 4.2e-20 J, and the required momentum is 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But why would the photon cause a vibrational transition when a lower-energy rotational transition is possible?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the rotational energy levels are negligible compared to vibrational, but from the calculation, the rotational transition energy is about 9.2e-23 J, which is much less than 4.2e-20 J. So the rotational transition is much easier.

But the options don't have the 3e-31 Ns value. So perhaps the problem is only considering the vibrational transition, and the rotational is being neglected.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the reduced mass calculation.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate the reduced mass.

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

Reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) = (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Yes, correct. So that's 1.818 amu.

Wait, wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next higher vibrational state, which is n=1, but with J=0. That would require a photon of energy 4.2e-20 J, leading to p=1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But why would the molecule transition to a higher vibrational state when a lower-energy rotational transition is possible?

Ah! Perhaps because the question states the molecule is in its fundamental state, which may refer to the vibrational state being fundamental (n=0), but the rotational state can be in any level. But the fundamental state in terms of the combined energy is the lowest possible, which is n=0 and J=0.

So the next state would be either n=0, J=1 or n=1, J=0, whichever has lower energy.

As computed earlier, n=0, J=1 has lower energy. So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, which is about 9.2e-23 J, leading to p=3.07e-31 Ns.

But again, the options don't match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor, but the question says it's modeled using the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, but I'm not sure how that changes things.

In the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length isn't fixed, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps R is considered fixed, so I can proceed as before.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of I. Let me recompute I.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. Correct. μ is approximately 3.022e-27 kg. So I = μ R² = 3.022e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.022e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2088e-46 kg m². Correct.

So I'm confident the previous calculations are correct.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the problem is about the transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the first excited state (n=1, J=0). But that would require a photon with E = (3/2 ħω) - (1/2 ħω) ) = ħω. So E_photon = ħω = 4.218e-20 J.

Momentum p = E/c = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s = 1.406e-28 Ns, which is option D.

So why would the transition be to n=1, J=0 instead of J=1, n=0?

Because perhaps the question is considering that the rotation is already in the J=0 state, and the next state is the first excited vibrational state. But that would require a higher energy.

But according to the energy calculations, the next state with the lowest energy is J=1, n=0.

Hmm, so perhaps the correct answer is that the photon's momentum is 3.07e-31 Ns. But since this is not an option, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state in the rovibrational spectrum, which is a combination of both. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the model being used considers the rotational energy as part of the vibrational state. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the unit conversion for the mass. Let me recheck.

Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (22) amu = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

So 1.818 amu = 1.818 *1.6605e-27 = 3.022e-27 kg.

Yes, correct.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the problem is referring to the fundamental vibrational state, which is n=0, but the rotational state is not necessarily J=0. No, the fundamental state would be the lowest energy, which would be J=0 and n=0.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider only the vibrational energy transition, leading to option D.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D, 1.4e-28 Ns. But I'm confused because according to the energy calculations, the rotational transition is lower. But maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy calculation for the rotational transition.

Wait, let me compute the rotational energy difference again.

E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * J(J+1).

At J=0, E_rot = 0.

At J=1, E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2.

So ΔE_rot = 2*(ħ²/(2I)) )= ħ²/I.

ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²s².

I = 1.2088e-46 kg m².

So ħ²/I = 1.112e-68 / 1.2088e-46 ≈ 9.2e-23 J.

Yes, correct.

So, if the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, then p = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the vibrational transition, leading to option D.

But why would the problem consider that? Maybe the question is not considering the rotational transition, perhaps the molecule is modeled as a pure vibration, not considering rotation.

Wait, the question states that the model is the quantum rotation-vibration model, so both are considered. So I'm back to square one.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the transition to the next state in the vibrational spectrum, which would be n=1, regardless of rotation. So the photon's energy is ħω, and the momentum is 1.4e-28 Ns.

I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option D is 1.4e-28 Ns, which is exactly what I get when I compute E_photon = ħω and p= E/c.

So maybe the question is expecting me to choose this.

But why would the photon cause a vibrational transition instead of a rotational one?

Ah, perhaps because the rotational energy levels are part of the same energy state, and the next state is a vibrational transition, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the first transition possible is the vibrational one because the rotational transition requires a different selection rule, but I'm not sure.

Wait, selection rules for vibrational transitions usually require Δn=±1, and for rotational ΔJ=±1. But in some cases, dipole transitions require specific polarization of the photon, but that's more about whether the transition is allowed, not the energy.

But the question is about the energy required, not whether the transition is allowed. So the selection rules wouldn't affect the energy calculation.

So, in conclusion, I think the correct approach is to calculate the vibrational transition, leading to option D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the rotational and vibrational energy transitions.

### Key Parameters:
- **Masses**:  
  \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}, \, M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)  
  Reduced mass:  
  \[
  \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{22} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
  \]  
  Converting to kilograms:  
  \[
  \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.022 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
  \]

- **Bond length**: \( R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)  
  Moment of inertia:  
  \[
  I = \mu R^2 = (3.022 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2088 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
  \]

- **Angular frequency**: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)  
  Planck's constant: \( \hbar \approx 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)  
  Speed of light: \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)

### Energy Transitions:
1. **Rotational Transition (J = 0 → J = 1)**:  
   The rotational energy levels are given by:  
   \[
   E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} J(J+1)
   \]  
   The energy difference between \( J = 0 \) and \( J = 1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}
   \]  
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.2088 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Vibrational Transition (n = 0 → n = 1)**:  
   The vibrational energy levels are given by:  
   \[
   E_{\text{vib}} = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right) \hbar \omega
   \]  
   The energy difference between \( n = 0 \) and \( n = 1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega
   \]  
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
   \]

### Comparison of Transitions:
The rotational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), while the vibrational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \). Since the rotational transition requires significantly less energy, the photon should correspond to the rotational transition.

### Photon Momentum:
The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \). For the rotational transition:  
\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s} = 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}
\]

However, none of the provided options match this value. If we instead consider the vibrational transition, the photon momentum is:  
\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}
\]  
This matches **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
Although the rotational transition requires less energy, the problem may assume the photon causes a vibrational transition. Based on the options provided, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
