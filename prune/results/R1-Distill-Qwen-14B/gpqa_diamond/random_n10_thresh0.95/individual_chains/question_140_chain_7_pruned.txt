Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. It seems a bit complex at first, but I'll break it down.

So the question is about a chemical reaction involving Substance X and Liquid Y. Let's see what information we have.

First, Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. That probably means X has an isotope with a higher atomic mass. I remember that isotopes have the same number of protons but different neutrons. So X has an element with a heavier isotope.

When X reacts violently with Liquid Y, a gas W is released. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, molecules where protons and neutrons are equal... wait, let me think. For a molecule, each atom contributes protons and neutrons. But the question says the molecule as a whole has the same number of neutrons and protons. So total protons = total neutrons.

Possible gases: maybe CO2? Let me see. Carbon has 6 protons, oxygen 8. CO2 would have 6 + 16 = 22 protons, and 6 (carbon's neutrons) + 16 (oxygen's neutrons, maybe 8 each?) Wait, that might not add up. Alternatively, maybe H2O? No, that's a liquid. Or something like O2 or N2, but those are diatomic and have the same number of protons and neutrons? Let me check. O2: each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So each O atom has 16 atomic mass. O2 molecule has 16 protons (8*2) and 16 neutrons (8*2). So 16 each? That fits the description. So W could be O2, but wait, O2 is a diatomic gas, but when reactions happen, sometimes O2 is produced. Alternatively, maybe H2? Because H2 would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons (each H is 1 proton, maybe 1 neutron if it's deuterium). So H2 would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons in total. Or maybe another molecule like NH3? Wait no, but that's a gas but the numbers don't add. Wait, ammonia has 14 protons (N:7, H:3 each) and 10 neutrons (N has 7-7=0 wait no, N has 7 protons, maybe 7 neutrons in the most common isotope? Hmm, maybe that's not it. Alternatively, maybe CO? Let me think. CO is a molecule: C has 6 protons, O has 8. So total protons 14. Neutrons: C has 6 (since carbon-12 has 6 neutrons), O has 8 (oxygen-16 has 8). So total neutrons 6+8=14. Oh! That fits. So W is CO. Because each molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So gas W is carbon monoxide.

So when X reacts with Y, they produce CO gas and precipitate G. Then, when G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. Let me convert 277 K to Celsius: 277 - 273.15 = 3.85°C, so about 4°C. What substance has a melting point around there? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? Or perhaps something else. Alternatively, maybe B is water? Wait, water freezes at 0°C, but 277 K is about 4°C, so maybe something that melts at that point. Alternatively, maybe B is another compound.

Wait, another thought: if B is an element, like maybe sulfur? No, its melting point is higher. Alternatively, perhaps it's something else. Alternatively, maybe B is a metal, but I'm not sure.

Okay, let's think about the reaction between X and Y. X is a substance that when reacting with Y, produces CO. Let me think about possible reactions. For example, perhaps X is a metal, and Y is an acid. But if the reaction produces CO, maybe Y is a carbonate. Wait, but carbonate reacting with a metal would produce CO2, not CO. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal reacting with a solution that releases CO, like if Y is a solution of something else.

Wait, another approach: if X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, it's probably something like a strong base or a reducing agent. Wait, the question says that X is used especially its analog is a reagent. So X might be something like NaOH or KOH, but they're strong bases. Alternatively, maybe it's a metal, like sodium or magnesium, but those are more reactive metals.

Wait, another thought: if X is sodium (Na), then reacting with an acid (like HCl) would produce H2 gas. But the gas here is CO. So maybe X is a carbonate and Y is an acid. Let's see: if X were sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), and reacts with an acid like H2SO4, would that produce CO2? But the gas W in the problem is CO, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if X were something else.

Wait, but wait: the product when X is reacted with a certain keto acid gives a compound with two oxygen atoms. Keto acid is an acid with a ketone group, like acetoacetic acid. Hmm, but how does that tie in?

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal that produces CO when reacting with a solution. Let me think: metals like zinc or iron when reacting with certain solutions can produce CO under specific conditions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe X is a reducing agent. For example, maybe it's sodium (Na), which when reacted with a metal salt solution, can cause a displacement reaction.

Wait, perhaps X is sodium (Na). Let's see. If X is sodium, when it reacts with a liquid Y, perhaps Y is water. Sodium reacts violently with water to produce H2 gas. But the gas in the question is CO, so that doesn't fit. Hmm, so maybe a different element.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate. Let me think: if Y is a strong acid, then maybe X is a carbonate reacting with HCl to produce CO2, but again, the gas is CO, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms CO. So what kind of reaction produces CO? Maybe a reaction between a metal and a solution containing something else, like a reaction between a metal and a nitrate solution under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal that reacts with a solution containing a carbonate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe X is a metal like zinc. If Y is a solution of HCl, then Zn + HCl → ZnCl2 + H2. But that gives H2, not CO. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal reacting with a salt solution that produces a different gas.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and a solution of a salt with carbonate. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a carbonate solution, and X is a metal that displaces something. Let me think, but I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So G might be a carbonate that upon heating decomposes. For example, if G is sodium carbonate, upon heating, it doesn't decompose easily, but perhaps another carbonate. Or maybe G is a hydroxide that upon heating loses water. Wait, if B is the product of heating G, and B has a melting point near 4°C, what could that be?

Wait, another thought: if B is water, but water's melting point is 0°C. 277 K is about 4°C. Alternatively, maybe B is another compound. Wait, what if B is a metal oxide? Or perhaps B is a gas?

Wait, perhaps G is a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. But that would produce CO2, not CO. Alternatively, maybe G is a bicarbonate, which upon heating decomposes to CO2 and the metal oxide. But again, that's CO2.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a different kind of compound. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Y is a solution of HCl, and X is a metal carbonate. Let's say X is sodium carbonate. Sodium carbonate reacts with HCl to produce sodium chloride, water, and CO2 gas. But the problem says gas W is CO, so that's not matching. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of something else. Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution of a metal hydroxide. Hmm, not sure. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about other parts of the problem.

The question also mentions that the product of a certain keto acid with X contains two oxygen atoms. So when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 O atoms. Keto acids have a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group. For example, acetoacetic acid is CH3C(O)CH2COOH. If X is a base, perhaps it deprotonates the keto acid, but I'm not sure how that would affect the oxygen count.

Wait, another approach: what if X is a strong base like NaOH? When a keto acid reacts with NaOH, it would undergo a neutralization reaction, producing a salt and water. Let's see: for example, if the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid, which has four oxygen atoms. The product would be the sodium salt, which would have some oxygen. But the product is said to have 2 oxygen atoms. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is a carboxylic acid salt. For example, acetoacetic acid (CH3C(O)CH2COOH) reacting with NaOH would produce CH3C(O)CH2COO^- Na+ and water. That product would have more than two oxygen atoms. Hmm, perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a reducing agent, like sodium borohydride (NaBH4). When a keto acid is reduced, it might form an alcohol. But I'm not sure how that relates to the number of oxygen atoms.

Wait, maybe the product is something like a metal oxide. Let me think differently.

Wait, let's think about the initial reaction. X reacts with Y to produce CO, precipitate G, and perhaps other products. Let's say X is sodium (Na), and Y is a solution of lead nitrate (Pb(NO3)2). Sodium would displace lead, but what gas would form? I don't think that produces CO.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate, and Y is a solution of hydrochloric acid. For example, Na2CO3 + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + H2O + CO2. But that produces CO2, not CO. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a sulfide. If X is FeS and reacts with HCl, it would produce FeCl2, H2S gas. But that's not CO either.

Alternatively, maybe X is a metal that reacts with a carbonate solution. For example, if X is zinc and Y is a sodium carbonate solution. Then, Zn might react with Na2CO3 to produce CO gas. But I'm not sure about that reaction. Let me think: Zn + Na2CO3 → ? Maybe some displacement reaction where Zn displaces CO3^2-? Not sure, but that might form CO.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal that when reacting with a carbonate solution, produces CO. I'm not certain about that, but perhaps that's the case.

So, if X is a metal that reacts with a carbonate to produce CO, the precipitate G could be a metal carbonate, perhaps. Then when heated, G might decompose into the metal oxide and CO2 or CO. But earlier, the gas is CO, so maybe G is a carbonate that upon heating decomposes into CO gas.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck. Let me approach this from another angle. The melting point of B is about 277 K, which is about 4°C. What substances have a melting point near that? Maybe ammonium chloride, which has a melting point around 334 K (61°C), which is higher. Alternatively, maybe something like potassium nitrate? No, that's higher. Wait, perhaps B is a different compound. Another thought: perhaps B is a hydrate, which melts at a lower temperature. For
