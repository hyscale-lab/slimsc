Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are A, B, C, D, each combining different symmetries.

First, I need to remember what each of these symmetries entails and whether they're required in the SMEFT framework.

Starting with Lorentz symmetry. I think Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental aspect of relativity, so any theory that respects special relativity must have Lorentz symmetry. SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model, so it should definitely respect Lorentz symmetry. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations? Like, the Poincare group includes both Lorentz transformations and translations in spacetime. So if a theory respects Poincare symmetry, it must also respect Lorentz symmetry, right? But does SMEFT necessarily have Poincare symmetry? Hmm. I'm not entirely sure. Because SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model, which itself respects Poincare symmetry. Wait, but do these operators automatically respect Poincare symmetry?

Wait, the SMEFT is constructed to maintain the symmetries of the Standard Model. The Standard Model has Poincare symmetry. So, the SMEFT operators should respect all the SM symmetries, including Poincare. But wait, do the higher-dimensional operators necessarily respect Poincare? Or is that automatically taken care of by how they're constructed?

I think that in effective field theories, you only add operators that are compatible with the symmetries of the underlying theory. So the SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry. Because the SM has Poincare, the SMEFT does too. So both Lorentz and Poincare (options 1 and 2) are required.

Wait, but wait. I'm getting a bit confused here. Lorentz is a subset of Poincare. So if the theory respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So the question is, does SMEFT require all operators to respect Poincare? Or is it that they can be built in a way that respects Poincare, but perhaps not necessarily?

Wait, the question says which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if Poincare is a symmetry, then all operators must respect it. So both Lorentz and Poincare would be required. But wait, sometimes I've heard that effective operators are classified under Lorentz symmetry, so maybe Poincare isn't a separate requirement, but Lorentz is part of it.

Wait, but in the SMEFT, the operators are arranged into classes based on their Lorentz structure. So each operator must respect Lorentz symmetry. But what about Poincare? Because Poincare includes translations. So if the theory is invariant under translations, then the action must be invariant, meaning that the Lagrangian is invariant. So every term in the Lagrangian must have the same transformation properties under spacetime translations, which they do because they're part of a local Lagrangian.

Wait, but SMEFT includes higher-dimensional operators, which are of the form (1/Lambda^n) * O, where O is a Lorentz-invariant operator. So each operator O would be Lorentz invariant. But Poincare involves not just Lorentz but also translation invariance. So each operator must be Poincare invariant. Because the entire Lagrangian must be Poincare invariant.

Wait, but wait. The Lagrangian is Poincare invariant, which implies that under translations, it's invariant. So each term in the Lagrangian must be a scalar under Poincare. But I'm not sure if each individual operator must transform in a certain way.

Alternatively, perhaps Poincare symmetry is automatically satisfied if Lorentz and other symmetries are. Or maybe not. Hmm. I think I'm getting stuck here.

Moving on to CP symmetry (option 3). The Standard Model has approximate CP symmetry, but not exact. The SMEFT includes operators that can violate CP, because some higher-dimensional operators can change CP properties. For example, the QCD axion models use SMEFT operators to generate the axion. So CP symmetry isn't necessarily respected by all SMEFT operators. So option 3 is not a must. So the operators don't have to respect CP symmetry, so 3 is incorrect.

Then, CPT symmetry (option 4). CPT is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. The Standard Model is CPT symmetric. So the SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry because the SM does. Otherwise, the effective theory would violate CPT, which is not possible because CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. So all SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry.

Wait, but wait. Are all SMEFT operators CPT invariant? Because if the SM is CPT invariant, then any operator you add that's compatible with the SM's symmetries should also respect CPT. So yes, 4 is required.

So putting it all together. Which symmetries must all operators respect? Let's list:

1. Lorentz: yes.

2. Poincare: Hmm, earlier confusion. Let me think again.

The question is whether Poincare symmetry is a must. The SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry because it's part of the SM's symmetries. So all operators in SMEFT must be Poincare-invariant? Or do they just have to be Lorentz-invariant, and Poincare is a separate symmetry?

Wait, the Poincare group includes translations, which imply the conservation of energy and momentum. Since the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and the Lagrangian is a scalar under Poincare, each operator in the Lagrangian must respect Poincare. So yes, operators must be Poincare-invariant.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Because in some contexts, when you have higher-dimensional operators, you have to make sure they are Poincare invariant. So each operator must be a scalar under the Poincare group. So I think 2 is also a required symmetry.

Wait, but wait. Since Poincare implies Lorentz, but the question is which symmetries must be respected. So for example, if a theory respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz. So if the question's options include both, but you think that Poincare is a must, then 2 must be correct.

But wait, I'm not entirely certain. Let me think: the SM respects Poincare, so the SMEFT, as an effective theory built on the SM, must also respect Poincare symmetry. Because the SMEFT is just the SM plus higher-dimension operators that don't break the SM's symmetries.

So SMEFT operators must have terms that are compatible with Poincare symmetry. So 2 is also a must.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries all operators must respect. So if all the operators are part of a Poincare-invariant theory, then each operator must be Poincare-invariant.

But maybe in practice, when you construct the operators, they only need to be Lorentz-invariant and have the right transformation properties under other symmetries. So perhaps Poincare isn't a separate symmetry that each operator must respect beyond Lorentz. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is that the SMEFT respects the same symmetries as the SM. The SM has Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT does too. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry.

But I'm not 100% sure. Another approach is to recall what the symmetries of the SMEFT are. The SMEFT is constructed to respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model. The SM has Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz and translations. So the SMEFT must respect Poincare, so all operators must be Poincare-invariant.

Wait, but in terms of individual operators, when you write down the operators, they're constructed to be Poincare scalars. So each operator must be a Poincare scalar. So 2 is a must.

So then, which options include 1 and 2. Looking back, option A is 1 and 2. Option C is 1, 2, and 4. Option C includes 4, which we thought was a must. So if the correct required symmetries are Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, then option C would be correct.

Wait, but what's the correct answer. Let me think again.

The SM has Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT must have Poincare as well. So 2 is a must. So the symmetries to check are:

1. Yes
2. Yes
3. No (CP not necessarily)
4. Yes

So the required are 1,2,4. Which would be option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 4 (CPT) must be respected because the SM is CPT-symmetric. So all SMEFT operators must respect CPT.

So the three required are 1, 2, 4. So the correct option is C.

But wait, another angle: Some sources say that CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories, so any renormalizable or effective theory must respect CPT. So yes, 4 is definitely a must.

So, to recap: which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT?

- Lorentz: Yes
- Poincare: Yes
- CP: No
- CPT: Yes

So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4.

Looking at the options:

Option C) 1,2,4.

So the answer should be C.


The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). To determine this, we analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SMEFT is constructed to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model (SM), which includes Lorentz symmetry. Since the SMEFT incorporates the SM, all operators in the SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. Thus, Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is required.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: The Poincaré group combines Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations. The SM respects Poincaré symmetry, and the SMEFT, as an effective theory built on the SM, must also respect Poincaré symmetry. This implies that all operators in the SMEFT must respect Poincaré symmetry. Therefore, Poincaré symmetry (option 2) is required.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM has approximate CP symmetry, but it is not exact. The SMEFT includes operators that can violate CP symmetry, such as those relevant for QCD axions. Since CP symmetry is not necessarily respected by all SMEFT operators, CP symmetry (option 3) is not required.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, and the SM respects CPT symmetry. Since the SMEFT is built on the SM, all operators in the SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. Thus, CPT symmetry (option 4) is required.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct option is:

**Answer: C**
