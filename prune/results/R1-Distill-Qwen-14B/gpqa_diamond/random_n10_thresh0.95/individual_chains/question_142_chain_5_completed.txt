Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me think. 

First, the question gives a density matrix ρ. It says ρ is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. For pure states, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ><ψ|. But this one is a mixture of |0> and |1>, each with equal probability because of the 1/2 factor. So, this must represent a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states are inside. For a completely mixed state, the density matrix is (I + |0><0| - |1><1|)/2? Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight.

Wait, the given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. That's the same as (|0><0| + |1><1|) multiplied by 1/2. Alternatively, I can write this as (I)/2, since I is the identity matrix. Because I = |0><0| + |1><1|, right. So ρ is (I)/2. 

I remember that the Bloch vector representation of a density matrix can be found by looking at the off-diagonal elements. The general form of a qubit density matrix is:

ρ = [ [ (1 + z)/2 , (x - iy)/2 ],
       [ (x + iy)/2 , (1 - z)/2 ] ]

So, for the given ρ, let's compute it. Let me compute |0><0| and |1><1| first.

|0><0| is [[1, 0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So when we add them, we get [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Multiply by 1/2, we get ρ as [[1/2, 0],[0,1/2]].

So, comparing this to the general form, the (1,1) element is (1 + z)/2 = 1/2. So (1 + z)/2 = 0.5 → 1 + z = 1 → z = 0.

The (2,1) element is (x - iy)/2. But in our ρ, the (2,1) element is 0. So (x - iy)/2 = 0 → x = 0 and y = 0. 

So the Bloch vector r has components (x, y, z) = (0,0,0). That's the origin. So the density matrix is at the center of the Bloch sphere. That makes sense because the state is completely mixed, so it's the maximally uncertain state, which is represented by the center point.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch vector of a density matrix is derived from its components:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix} 
\frac{1+z}{2} & \frac{x - iy}{2} \\ 
\frac{x + iy}{2} & \frac{1-z}{2} 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

For the given \(\rho\), we compute:

\[
|0\rangle \langle 0| = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad |1\rangle \langle 1| = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Adding these and multiplying by \(\frac{1}{2}\), we get:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this to the general form of \(\rho\), we find:

- \(\frac{1+z}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \implies z = 0\),
- \(\frac{x - iy}{2} = 0 \implies x = 0, y = 0\).

Thus, the Bloch vector is \((x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere. This represents the completely mixed state, where the qubit has no coherence and maximal uncertainty.

From the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\)**.

Answer: C
