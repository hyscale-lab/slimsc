Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, parallax is usually denoted by 'p' or 'plx', right? So the number of stars, N, is proportional to 1/plx^5. Or wait, is it 1/(plx^5)? Yeah, that's correct.

Now, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. So, we're looking for the relationship between N and distance r. But wait, how does parallax relate to distance?

I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1 / distance, but wait, in parsecs. So, distance r (in parsecs) equals 1 / plx. So plx is 1/r. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

So, if plx = 1/r, then r = 1/plx. Now, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5), so substituting r into that, let's see.

Since r = 1/plx, then plx = 1/r. So plx^5 is (1/r)^5, which is 1/(r^5). So 1/plx^5 would be r^5. Because 1/(1/r^5) is r^5.

Wait, wait, let me calculate that again. Let's take N ∝ 1/(plx^5). Since plx = 1/r, plx^5 = (1/r)^5 = 1/(r^5). Therefore, 1/(plx^5) is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So we might need to think about the derivative of N with respect to r. Because if N is proportional to r^5, then the rate of change (like the number per unit distance) would be dN/dr, which is proportional to 5r^4.

Wait, but the options don't have a 5r^4 option. Let's see the options again. Option B is ~ r^5, which is the same as N. But the question is about the change per unit range of distance. So if you have more stars as r increases, how does the number per unit distance change?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think about it differently. The number of stars per unit volume in space is what we're looking for. Wait, but the problem says the number varies with parallax. Oh, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, perhaps the number of stars in a region is proportional to r^5. So when you go to a larger distance, the number increases as r^5. But when considering how many stars are present in a shell of radius r to r+dr, that would be the derivative, which is proportional to r^4.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So it's asking about the rate of change, the number per unit distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a region is proportional to the volume, but given the specific relation, maybe it's not about volume. Because the number varies as 1/plx^5, which implies a certain density.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me go step by step.

Given: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

But plx = 1/r (in parsecs), so N = k * r^5, where k is a constant.

So N is proportional to r^5. So for each unit increase in r, N increases by r^5. So the number of stars increases as r^5, which would mean that the number per unit distance (like the density) is proportional to r^5.

Wait no, the number per unit distance would be dN/dr. Because if N is the total in a certain region, then the rate of change with distance is how many additional stars are added per parsec, perhaps.

So dN/dr = d/dr (k r^5) = 5k r^4. So the number of stars added per unit distance is r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4.

But looking at the options, option C is r^4. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but the problem states "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5". So is N proportional to 1/(plx)^5, which is r^5, so N increases with r^5. But when considering per unit distance, perhaps the question is about how the number of stars in a thin shell (like a spherical shell) at distance r would depend on r. Because a shell at radius r has surface area 4πr², and if density (number per volume) is proportional to r^5, then number per shell would be density * volume element, which is 4πr² * (r^5) dr, which is 4π r^7 dr. Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the setup wrong. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. Since N is proportional to r^5, the number per unit distance (like the change in N with r) would be proportional to r^5. But wait, that's not the case. Because the change in N with r is dN/dr, which is 5 r^4.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the differential. Let me re-read the question.

The question: How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?

Wait, perhaps the problem is looking for the rate of change of N with respect to r, so the change in N per unit change in r. So dN/dr = 5 r^4, so the number changes as r^4. So the correct option would be C, r^4.

But let me think again. How does N (the number of stars) vary with r? N is proportional to r^5. So as r increases, N increases as the fifth power. But the question is about the change in N per unit change in r. So the rate of change is proportional to r^4.

So the correct answer would be option C, which is ~r^4.

Wait another thought: Maybe the number of stars is proportional to r^5, so for each unit increase in r, the number of stars increases by a factor of r^5. So the change in N is proportional to r^5. But that doesn't make sense because if r increases by 1, the change in N would be proportional to r^5. But this seems conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the relationship between N and r. Since N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and plx = 1/r, then N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars in the region increases as r^5. So the change per unit range of distance would be the derivative, which is 5 r^4, but that's not an option in the same way.

Wait no, the options are A to D, with option B being r^5, which is the same as N. So if the number of stars increases as r^5, then the correct answer would be option B, ~r^5.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Ah, perhaps the confusion is whether the question is about N as a function of r, or dN/dr as a function of r. Because the wording is a bit ambiguous.

If the question is asking how N depends on r, then N ∝ r^5, which is option B.

But if it's asking about the change in N with r, which is dN/dr, then it's proportional to r^4, which is option C.

So which is it?

The question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Hmm, "change with distance per unit range" suggests the change is per unit r, which is dN/dr.

But if that's the case, then the answer would be r^4, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps "change" refers to the overall trend, not the differential. So if N increases as r^5, then the number of stars changes in a way that's proportional to r^5. So that would be option B.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about it another way.

Suppose I have two distances, r and r + dr. The number of stars at each distance is N = k r^5. The change in N when moving from r to r+dr is approximately dN = 5 k r^4 dr. So the number of stars added per unit distance (dr) is about 5 k r^4 dr. So per unit dr, the number of stars is proportional to r^4.

Therefore, the number of stars in a region per unit distance (the change in N) is proportional to r^4. So the answer is option C, ~r^4.

But wait, the question says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N = k (1/plx^5) = k r^5. So N increases with r^5. So for each increment in r, the number of stars increases as r^5.

Wait no, because for each unit increase in r, the change in N would be much more than just r^5. It's the derivative, which is r^4.

But perhaps the question isn't about the differential and is simply asking how N depends on r, which is r^5. Then the answer would be option B.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased: "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So when you move a unit distance away, how much does the number of stars change? That's the differential, so the answer is r^4.

So I'm thinking the correct answer is option C, ~r^4.


The problem states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( r \)) as \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), substituting this into the relationship gives \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the total number of stars increases with distance as \( r^5 \).

However, the question asks specifically how the number of stars changes with distance "per unit range of distance," which implies the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), or \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto r^5 \), we find \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \).

Given the options:
- **A) ~ \( r^3 \):** Incorrect, as the relationship is not cubic.
- **B) ~ \( r^5 \):** Incorrect, as this describes the total number of stars, not the rate of change per unit distance.
- **C) ~ \( r^4 \):** Correct, as \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4 \).
- **D) ~ \( r^2 \):** Incorrect, as the relationship is not quadratic.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as the number of stars per unit distance changes proportionally to \( r^4 \).

Answer: C
