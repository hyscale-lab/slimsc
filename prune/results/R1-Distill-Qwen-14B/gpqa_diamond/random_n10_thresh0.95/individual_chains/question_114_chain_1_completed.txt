Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The question is about selecting suitable reagents for two reactions. 

First reaction: Butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. 

Second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and water) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different possible reagents A and B.

Hmm. Let me think about each reaction step by step.

Starting with the first reaction: Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when it reacts with NaCN, what's happening here? I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. In this case, NaCN is a source of CN- ions, acting as a nucleophile. So the reaction would be addition of CN- to the carbonyl group.

Wait, but after addition, what's the product? The product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN would attack the carbonyl carbon, forming a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation typically occurs when a ketone reacts with a cyanide source under acidic conditions. So, I think the first step requires adding H+ to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, which then allows the CN- to attack.

So reagent A should be an acid, maybe H3O+ (which is option A and B) or NaHSO3 (which is option C and D). Wait, what's the role of NaHSO3? I think sodium bisulfite is used in the formation of bisulfite adducts, like in some reductions or maybe in the workup. Alternatively, in the case of cyanohydrin formation, the acid is usually added to provide the H+ needed for the mechanism.

So for the first reaction, A must be an acid. Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+; options C and D have A as NaHSO3. Now, which is correct?

Wait, in the cyanohydrin formation, you generally have the ketone reacting with CN- under acidic conditions. So the reagent A is probably an acid like H3O+, which is option A or B.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Alternatively, sometimes NaHSO3 is used as a source of H+ and SO3^- as the nucleophile, but in this case, the nucleophile is CN- from NaCN. So maybe the acid is just H3O+.

So in the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+. So looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+.

Now, moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and the product is the corresponding butanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). 

Wait, but the reagent B is with H2O. So what reagents cause nitriles to form carboxylic acids? I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. The hydrolysis usually requires strong acid or base, heat, and water.

In acidic conditions, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids. For example, using HCl (HCl is a strong acid) and heating. Alternatively, using H2SO4 as a catalyst. So the reagent B would be HCl, which is option A or C, because in options A and C, B is HCl.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: B is HCl.

Option B: B is CH3COOH (acetic acid).

Option C: B is HCl.

Option D: B is CH3COOH.

So, if the second reaction requires HCl as the reagent, then the correct options would be A or C.

Wait, but what about the first reaction? If A is H3O+ (options A and B), versus NaHSO3 (C and D). 

Wait, so first reaction: butanone + NaCN + H3O+ → product.

Butan-2-one plus NaCN in acidic conditions would form the cyanohydrin. So that's correct for A being H3O+.

So for the first reaction, A has to be H3O+. So options A and B are possibilities.

But then, looking at the second reaction. The reagent B is HCl (options A and C) or acetic acid (B and D).

The second reaction requires hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid. So in acidic conditions, perhaps using a strong acid like HCl is needed. So B would be HCl. 

So if that's the case, the correct option is A, where A is H3O+ and B is HCl.

Wait, let me think again. The first reaction is, butanone reacting with NaCN and A. So the reaction is:

(CH3)2CO + NaCN → (CH3)2C(OH)CN

Which is the cyanohydrin. The conditions for this are acidic. So H+ is needed. So A is H3O+.

So the first part A is H3O+. So the options are A and B for reagent A.

The second reaction: nitrile to carboxylic acid. The nitrile is at the end of the molecule, so perhaps it's a primary nitrile. Wait, but in this case, the nitrile is attached to a hydroxyl group. Wait, the structure is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the nitrile is on a carbon that's adjacent to the hydroxyl group. Hmm, but that's a secondary nitrile? Or primary? Let me think. The butanenitrile part is CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so when adding CN, the cyanohydrin would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, but butanenitrile would be four carbons, but the cyanohydrin would have an additional structure.

Wait, perhaps the second reaction is about hydrolyzing the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. So, nitrile → acid. The typical way is strong acid and heat. So using HCl would be appropriate. So in the second reaction, B is HCl.

So combining, the first reagent A is H3O+, and the second reagent B is HCl. So looking at the options, option A is A = H3O+, B = HCl.

So the correct answer should be option A.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction requires acidic conditions to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for the nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, reagent A must be an acid, and H₃O⁺ (option A or B) is the correct choice, as NaHSO₃ (options C and D) is not typically used for this reaction.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This requires strong acidic conditions, and HCl (options A and C) is the appropriate reagent for this transformation. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH, options B and D) is not strong enough for this reaction.

Combining the requirements for both reactions, the correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
