Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal but the angles aren't necessarily 90 degrees. In this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance—I think that's the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. Oh right, the formula for interplanar distance d is given by d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² - 2lm cos α - 2ln cos β - 2mn cos γ), where a is the lattice parameter, and l, m, n are the Miller indices. But wait, since it's a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice is not cubic, so the formula might be a bit more complicated.

But wait, the question gives the interatomic distance as 10 Angstrom. Oh, wait a second. For a cubic structure, the interatomic distance can be simply a√2 for (111) planes, but this is a rhombohedral structure, so that's different.

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which is like a cube that's been skewed. So the lattice parameter a is the edge length, which I think is the same as the interatomic distance here. Oh wait, no. Wait, for a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a√1 = a. But for a rhombohedral structure, each atom is at the corner, so maybe the interatomic distance is a√(some function of the angles). Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So each atom is spaced 10 Angstrom apart. In a simple cubic structure, a would be 10 Angstrom. But in a rhombohedral structure with angles less than 90 degrees, perhaps the actual lattice parameter a is different. Or wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is a√(something). Alternatively, maybe the lattice parameter a is the interatomic distance because each atom is at the corner and the edges are of length a.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the lattice parameter a being the same as the interatomic distance. Because in a simple cubic structure, the distance between adjacent atoms along the edge is a. So if the atoms are at the corners, then the interatomic distance along the edge would be a. So in this case, perhaps a is 10 Angstrom.

But wait, the Miller indices are (111), so l=m=n=1. So plugging into the formula:

d = a / sqrt(1 + 1 + 1 - 2*(1)(1)*cos(30) - 2*(1)(1)*cos(30) - 2*(1)(1)*cos(30))

Wait, wait, let me make sure. The formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is:

d_{hkl} = [a] / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ )

Wait, no
