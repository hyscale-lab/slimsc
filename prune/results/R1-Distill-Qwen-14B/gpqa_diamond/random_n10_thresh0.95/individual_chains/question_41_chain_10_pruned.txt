Okay, so I need to figure out this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me think. The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the lab frame.

Wait, wait. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. Interesting. I remember that the speed of light in a medium is generally c/n, where c is the speed of light in vacuum. But wait, does the motion of the medium affect the speed of light inside it? Or is it that the speed depends on the medium's properties regardless of its motion?

Oh, right! I think in special relativity, the speed of light in a medium moving relative to an observer doesn't change in a way that would exceed c, but I'm not so sure about the exact treatment here. But wait, this problem might not be relativistic because the velocities are low compared to c. Or maybe it's assuming Galilean addition?

Wait, the problem says the speed of light in vacuum is c=1, so maybe we should be using relativistic considerations here.

Wait, but the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. Hmm. So the light is inside the moving glass. So, we need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed of the light in the glass is c/n, but that's in the rest frame of the glass. But when the glass is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the velocity addition formula in special relativity. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c² ), but that applies when transforming velocities from one frame to another moving at speed v relative to the first.

Wait, but in this case, the medium (glass) is moving. So the light's velocity in the medium (u) is in the medium's rest frame. So to find the lab frame's observed velocity, we can apply the velocity addition formula.

Wait, but the glass's velocity is v in the lab frame, same direction as the light. So the light's velocity in the glass frame is u = c/n (since in the medium, light's speed is c/n). So from the lab frame, the velocity u' is (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c² )

Wait, but wait, in this case, the glass is moving towards the observer, so maybe the velocity direction is important. Let me think: if the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, then the lab frame will see the light moving faster than the glass's speed.

Wait, but what's the exact setup? The light is propagating through the glass, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam towards the observer. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n towards the observer (since the beam is moving in the direction the glass is moving towards the lab). So the light's velocity in the glass frame is u = c/n in the direction of motion.

But the lab frame sees the glass moving at velocity v towards the observer. So when we transform, the lab frame's velocity u' for the light would be u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/(c²)).

Wait, yeah, because the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame, and the light's velocity in the glass frame is u = c/n. So to get the lab frame's u', we apply the Lorentz velocity transformation.

So plugging in u = c/n (since in the glass frame, light speed is c/n), and v is the speed of the glass relative to the lab.

So u' = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplifying denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)) )

So denominator is 1 + v/(n c)

Numerator is (c + n v)/n.

Wait, let me compute numerator:

(c/n) + v = (c + n v)/n.

Denominator: 1 + (v (c/n))/c² = 1 + v/(n c).

So u' = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ 1 + v/(n c) ) ] 

Let me factor numerator and denominator.

Let me compute numerator: (c + n v)/n.

Denominator: [ (n c + v ) ] / (n c).

Wait, no: denominator is 1 + [v/(n c)] = [n c + v ] / (n c).

So when you divide numerator by denominator, you have:

[ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n's cancel out. So:

( (c + n v) ) * c / (n c + v )

Wait, but (c + n v) in numerator, and denominator is (n c + v). Are these the same?

Wait, no. c is 1, so n c is n * 1 = n. So the denominator becomes n + v.

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-express with c = 1.

Yes, because the problem states c=1, so c=1. So the denominator in the denominator is (n c + v) = n *1 + v = n + v.

Numerator of the big fraction is (1 + n v) * 1 (since c=1, so (c + n v) is 1 + n v, and multiplied by c=1.

So u' = (1 + n v) * 1 / (n + v )

So u' = (1 + n v)/(n + v )

Looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v). So that's the correct answer.

Wait but let me think again. What if the velocity addition is done incorrectly. Suppose the glass is moving towards the lab, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So their velocities add, but with the relativistic formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the direction. Wait, the glass is moving toward the observer, and the light is also moving in the same direction as the glass. So in the lab frame, the light is moving faster than the glass.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial transformation. Let me double-check. The velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c²) )

In this case, u is the velocity of the light in the glass frame. Since the glass is moving towards the observer at v, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass (i.e., towards the observer), the velocity u is in the same direction as v.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the signs. Let's define positive direction as towards the observer.

In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at u = c/n towards the observer (since the beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass's motion). The glass's velocity relative to the lab is v (towards the observer), so the lab sees the light as moving faster.

Wait, but according to the transformation, u' = (
