Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. The astronomers found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength, which relates to temperature. Oh wait, because a hotter object emits most intensely at a shorter wavelength, right? So if the peak wavelengths are the same, maybe they're at the same temperature?

Wait, but wait, no, wait. No, because the peak wavelength depends on the temperature. The wavelength at which a black body emits most strongly is given by Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (around 2.9×10^-3 m·K). So same lambda_max implies same temperature. So both stars have the same temperature.

But wait, the problem doesn't state that the temperatures are the same, but the peak wavelengths are the same. So yes, same T.

So if both stars have the same temperature, how do their luminosities compare? Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where R is the radius, T the temperature, and σ the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So if Star_1 has radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, and same T, then L1/L2 would be (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. Since T1=T2, the T part is 1. So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that would mean the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2. So the factor is ~2.25, option A.

But wait, the problem says that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2. Oh, right, radial velocity—so Doppler shift. Hmm, but wait, the peak wavelengths are determined by the star's own emission, but if they're moving, the observed wavelength would be different. Oh wait, the question says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed lambda_max is the same for both stars. But each star's own emission would have a lambda_max based on their own temperature. So if they're moving, their observed lambda_max would shift due to Doppler effect.

Wait a minute, maybe I need to consider the Doppler shift here because the stars are moving. Oh wait, the radial velocity of Star_1 is zero, so no Doppler shift for it. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. But wait, we don't know if it's moving towards or away from us. The radial velocity is given as 700 km/s, but without knowing the direction, we can't say whether the wavelength is shifted to blue or red. But wait, the problem says that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So if the stars' own emission peaks are at the same lambda, but Star_2 is moving, would that affect the observed lambda_max?

Wait, perhaps the observed lambda_max is the same, but the actual emitted lambda_max is different. Let me think. Let's say Star_1's emitted peak is lambda1, and Star_2's emitted peak is lambda2. But due to Doppler effect, the observed lambda for Star_2 would be lambda2_obs = lambda2 * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. Wait, the formula for Doppler shift in wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), but for non-relativistic speeds, it's approximately lambda_obs ≈ lambda_emit (1 + v/c), where v is positive if moving away (redshift), negative if moving towards (blueshift).

Wait, but the problem states the observed lambda_max for both stars is the same. So for Star_1, since its radial velocity is zero, its observed lambda_max is lambda1 = b / T1. For Star_2, observed lambda_max is lambda2_obs = lambda2_emit * (1 + v/c). But lambda2_obs = lambda1, because both are the same.

Wait, so for Star_2, its emitted lambda_max is lambda2 = b / T2. But when observed, it's shifted. So:

lambda_obs = lambda2 * (1 + v_r / c) = lambda1.

But lambda1 is the emitted lambda of Star_1, which is b / T1.

So,

lambda2 * (1 + v_r / c) = b / T1.

But lambda2 is b / T2, so:

(b / T2) * (1 + v_r / c) = b / T1.

We can cancel b from both sides:

(1 + v_r / c) / T2 = 1 / T1.

Rearranged:

T1 = T2 * (1 + v_r / c)^(-1).

Wait, but wait, let me make sure about the signs. If Star_2 is moving away, v is positive, so (1 + v/c) is larger than 1, and lambda_obs is longer (redshifted). So if the observed lambda is same as Star_1, which is stationary, then for Star_2, if its emitted lambda is smaller (higher T), then when it's moving away, lambda_obs increases. Or if Star_2's emitted lambda is larger (lower T), moving away would make it even larger, which may not match.

Wait, maybe a better way is to think in terms of temperatures. Let me denote T1 as the effective temperature of Star_1, T2 as the effective temperature of Star_2.

For Star_1: lambda_max1 = b / T1.

For Star_2: lambda_max2_emit = b / T2.

But due to Doppler effect, the observed lambda for Star_2 is lambda_max2_obs = lambda_max2_emit * (1 + v_r / c), assuming v_r is positive when moving away.

But the problem states that lambda_max1 = lambda_max2_obs.

So:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r / c).

We can cancel b from both sides:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r / c).

Rearranged:

T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r / c).

Wait, because if you invert both sides:

T2 = T1 * [1 / (1 + v_r / c)].

Wait, wait let me double-check the algebra.

Equation:

1/T1 = (1 + v_r/c) * (1 / T2).

So, multiply both sides by T2:

T2 / T1 = 1 + v_r/c.

So, T2 = T1 (1 + v_r/c).

Wait, but that can't be right because if Star_2 is moving away, v_r is positive, and that would imply T2 is higher than T1. Because, for example, if Star_2 is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, which implies that the emitted wavelength was shorter (since lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + v/c)). A shorter emitted wavelength would mean higher temperature (since lambda_max is inversely proportional to T).

Wait, but in our case, the observed lambda is the same for both stars. So if Star_2 is moving away, the observed lambda would be longer than it emitted. So for Star_2's observed lambda to match Star_1's emitted lambda, Star_2 must have a shorter emitted lambda. Shorter lambda implies higher T. So T2 would be higher than T1.

Wait, but according to the equation, T2 = T1 (1 + v_r/c). So if v_r is positive, and (1 + v_r/c) is greater than 1, then T2 is greater than T1. So the star that's moving away has a higher temperature.

But wait, Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So in terms of luminosity, L = 4 pi R^2 sigma T^4.

So L1 = 4 pi R1^2 sigma T1^4.

L2 =4 pi R2^2 sigma T2^4.

We need L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4).

But R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1^2 / R2^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T2 is from earlier: T2 = T1 (1 + v_r/(c)).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, earlier equation from the Doppler shift: T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r/c).

Wait, no, let me go back. The equation I came up with earlier was:

T2 = T1 (1 + v_r/c).

Wait, that can't be correct because if Star_2 is moving away, v_r is positive, so T2 would be higher than T1.

But the observed lambda is same as Star_1. So when Star_2 is moving, its emitted lambda is shorter, hence higher T.

So, for example, if Star_2 is moving away, v_r is positive. Then T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r/c) would mean T2 is higher than T1.

Wait, but that seems conflicting with the problem statement that both observed lambdas are the same. Let me make this concrete with an example.

Suppose Star_1 has T1=5000 K. So its lambda_max is b/5000.

Star_2 is moving away at v_r=700 km/s.

Then, its observed lambda is lambda2_obs = lambda2_emit * (1 + 700e3 / (3e5)).

Wait, 700e3 m/s divided by 3e5 m/s is about 700e3 / 3e5 = 700/(300) = 7/3 ≈ 2.333... So the factor is about 1 + 2.333 = 3.333.

So lambda2_obs = lambda2_emit * 3.333.

But lambda2_obs must equal lambda1, which is (b/5000).

So lambda2_emit = (b/5000) / 3.333.

So lambda2_emit = b/(5000 * 3.333) ≈ b/(16665 K).

Which is a higher temperature than T1. Because, T2 = b / lambda2_emit = b / (b/(16665)) ) = 16665 K.

So T2 is higher than T1.

So T2 = 16665 K, T1 =5000 K.

So in this case, T2 is higher than T1.

But according to the equation I had earlier, T2 = T1 (1 + v_r/c) ?

Wait, no, because in the equation I derived, T2 = T1 (1 + v_r/c).

In the example, v_r is 700e3 m/s.

So (1 + v_r/c) = 1 + (700e3)/(3e5) = 1 + 700/(300) = 1 + (7/3) ≈ 1 + 2.333 = 3.333.

So T2 = 5000 K *3.333 = 16665 K, which matches the example.

So the equation T2 = T1 (1 + v_r/c) is correct.

Wait, but wait. When the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. So to have the same observed wavelength as Star_1, the emitted wavelength of Star_2 must be shorter. A shorter emitted wavelength implies higher temperature.

So yes, T2 is higher than T1.

So now, going back to the problem, T2 is higher than T1, because Star_2 is moving away. So when we calculate L1/L2, it's (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4).

But R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1^2 = 2.25 R2^2.

T2 is T1 * (1 + v_r/c). So T2 = T1 * (1 + 700e3 / 3e5).

So let's compute (1 + v_r/c) = 1 + (700e3)/(3e5) = 1 + (700/300) = 1 + 2.333... = 3.333... approximately 3.3333.

So T2 = T1 * 3.333.

So T2^4 = (T1 * 3.333)^4.

So T1^4 / T2^4 = 1/(3.333^4).

Let's compute that.

3.333 is approximately 10/3, because 3.333 is 10/3 ≈3.3333.

So 3.333^4 = (10/3)^4 = (10^4)/(3^4) )= 10000/81 ≈ 123.4568.

So 1/(3.333^4 )≈ 1/123.4568 ≈0.0081.

So now L1/L2 = (2.25) * (0.0081) ≈ 2.25 * 0.0081.

Calculating that: 2.25 * 0.008 = 0.018, 2.25 *0.0001=0.000225. So total is approximately 0.018 + 0.000225 = 0.018225.

Wait, wait, wait. That can't be right. Because if T2 is higher than T1, then (T1/T2)^4 is less than 1, so L1 = 4 pi R1^2 sigma T1^4, L2=4 pi R2^2 sigma T2^4. So L1/L2 = (R1^2/R2^2) * (T1^4/T2^4) = (2.25) * (1/( (10/3)^4 )) ).

Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier in the step.

Wait, the calculation is L1/L2 = (R1^2/R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4 ).

R1/R2=1.5, so R1^2/R2^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r/c) = T1 * (1 + 700e3 / 3e5 )= T1 * (1 + 7/3 ) = T1 * (10/3).

So T1 = (3/10) T2.

So T1^4 = (3/10)^4 T2^4.

Thus, T1^4 / T2^4 = (3/10)^4 = 81/10000 = 0.0081.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.0081 = 0.018225.

Wait, that's about 0.018. So L1 is 0.018 times L2. So L1 is less than L2.

But the question says that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor.

Wait, but according to this, L1 is much less than L2. So perhaps I messed up the equation.

Wait, perhaps I got the Doppler equation wrong. Let's go back.

The Doppler effect formula: the observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + v_r / c), when v_r is positive for moving away.

But since Star_2 is moving away, its observed lambda is longer. But the observed lambda for both stars is same.

So, lambda_obs1 = lambda_emit1 = b / T1.

lambda_obs2 = lambda_emit2 * (1 + v_r/c) = same as lambda_obs1.

So:

lambda_emit2 = lambda_obs1 / (1 + v_r/c ) = (b/T1) / (1 + v_r/c ).

But lambda_emit2 is also b/T2.

So:

b/T2 = (b/T1) / (1 + v_r/c )

Divide both sides by b:

1/T2 = (1/T1) / (1 + v_r/c )

Multiply both sides by T1:

T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v_r/c )

So T2 = T1 (1 + v_r/c )

Which is what I had before. So earlier calculations are correct.

So T2 is higher than T1. So in terms of luminosity, which depends on R² T⁴.

So L1 = 4 pi R1² sigma T1^4.

L2 =4 pi R2² sigma T2^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

= ( (1.5 R2) ^2 ) / ( R2^2 ) ) * ( T1^4 / ( T2^4 ) )

= (2.25) * ( (T1 / T2 )^4 )

But T2 = T1 (1 + v_r/c ), so T1 / T2 = 1/(1 + v_r/c ) = 1/ (1 + 700e3 /3e5 )

Compute 700e3 /3e5 = 700/(300) =7/3 ≈2.333.

So 1/(1+2.333) =1/3.333 ≈0.3.

So (T1/T2 )^4 = (0.3)^4 =0.0081.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.0081 = 0.018225.

So that's about 0.018. Which is about 1/55.555.

So L1 is about 1/55.5 of L2. So L2 is about 55 times brighter than L1.

But the question says the factor by which L1 is greater than L2. But according to this, L1 is much less than L2. So the factor would be less than 1, but the options are all above 2, like 2.23, 2.25, etc.

Wait, that's a problem. Because according to this, Star_2 is more luminous than Star_1. So perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler equation.

Alternatively, maybe I flipped the ratio.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler shift equation is lambda_emit = lambda_obs / (1 + v_r/c ). Wait, when the source is moving away, observed wavelength is longer. So lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + v_r/c ).

But if the observed lambda is the same as Star_1's, then lambda_emit of Star_2 must be shorter, which implies higher T.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the way I applied the Doppler shift. Let me rederive it.

The Doppler shift formula when the source is moving away at speed v (v_r is positive):

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + v/c )

But if the source is moving towards us, v is negative, so (1 + v/c) would be less than 1, leading to a smaller observed wavelength.

But in this problem, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. The problem says "the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively." So Star_1 has zero radial velocity, Star_2 has 700 km/s. But it doesn't say the direction. Wait, that's a problem because the Doppler shift depends on whether it's moving towards or away.

Wait, the problem states that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. So Star_1 is stationary, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. But the question doesn't specify whether it's moving away or towards us. Hmm, that's ambiguous.

Wait, but the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So if Star_2 is moving away, the observed lambda would be longer than its emitted. To match Star_1's lambda, which is emitted, Star_2 must have a shorter emitted lambda. Which would imply higher T.

If Star_2 is moving towards us, the observed lambda would be shorter, so Star_2's emitted lambda would have to be longer to match Star_1's emitted lambda, implying lower T.

But in either case, the Doppler shift must be considered.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't state the direction, but the radial velocity is given as positive 700, which usually implies moving away, unless otherwise stated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I miscalculated T2. Let me re-examine the Doppler equation.

Wait, the correct Doppler shift equation for wavelength is:

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) )

This is the relativistic formula. But for v much less than c, we can approximate it as:

lambda_obs ≈ lambda_emit (1 + v/c )

But wait, that's only valid for non-relativistic speeds when v is much less than c. 700 km/s is about 0.23% of the speed of light (since c≈3e5 km/s). So 700 is ~0.23% of c. So the approximation should be okay.

Wait, but in the problem, the observed lambda_max is same for both, so:

lambda_obs1 = lambda_emit1 = (b / T1 )

lambda_obs2 = lambda_emit2 * (1 + v_r/c )

But lambda_obs2 must equal lambda_obs1, so:

lambda_emit2 = lambda_obs1 / (1 + v_r/c )

But lambda_emit2 = b / T2.

So:

b / T2 = (b / T1) / (1 + v_r/c )

Cancel b:

1/T2 = (1/T1) / (1 + v_r/c )

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r/c )

So T2 is higher than T1.

So now, L1 over L2 is (R1^2 / R2^2 ) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

Substituting in the numbers:

R1 = 1.5 R2 → R1²/R2² = 2.25.

T2 = T1 (1 + v_r/c ) → T1 = T2 (1 + v_r/c )^(-1).

Wait, no, T2 = T1 (1 + v_r/c ), so T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r/c )

Wait, but I think I should substitute T2 in terms of T1.

Wait, T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r/c )

So T1^4 / T2^4 = (T1 / T2 )^4 = (1/(1 + v_r/c ))^4.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * (1/(1 + v_r/c ))^4.

Compute (1 + v_r/c )= (1 + 700e3/3e5) = 1 + 7/3 = 10/3 ≈3.3333.

So (1/(10/3 ))^4 = (3/10)^4 = 81/10000 = 0.0081.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.0081 = 0.018225.

So L1 is about 0.018 times L2. That is, L2 is about 55 times L1.

But the question states that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor. So according to this, Star_2 is more luminous, which contradicts the options given (all >2). So perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift assumption.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the velocities are in the opposite direction. Maybe Star_2 is moving towards us, which would cause a blueshift, making the observed lambda shorter.

Wait, but the problem states that the observed lambda_maxes are the same. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed lambda is shorter than its emitted lambda. So for the observed lambda to be same as Star_1, Star_2's emitted lambda must be longer than Star_1's.

So let's see:

If Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed lambda is lambda_emit2 * (1 - v_r/c ), assuming v_r is positive when moving towards.

Wait, no, the correct Doppler shift formula when the source is moving towards the observer is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ), but for non-relativistic speeds, this approximates to lambda_obs ≈ lambda_emit (1 - v/c ).

So in this case, Star_2 is moving towards us, so v_r is -700 km/s.

So lambda_obs2 = lambda_emit2 * (1 - v_r/c )

But since the observed lambda is same as Star_1's, which is lambda_emit1 = b/T1.

So:

lambda_emit2 * (1 - (-700e3 / 3e5) ) = lambda_emit1.

Wait, because v_r is negative (moving towards), so 1 - (v_r/c ) = 1 - (-700e3/3e5) = 1 + (700e3/3e5) = 1 + 7/3 = 10/3.

So:

lambda_emit2 * (10/3 ) = lambda_emit1.

But lambda_emit1 = b/T1, lambda_emit2 = b/T2.

So:

b/T2 * (10/3 ) = b/T1.

Cancel b:

(1/T2) * (10/3 ) = 1/T1.

So T1 = T2 * (3/10).

So T2 = (10/3) T1.

So T2 is larger than T1.

Wait, but in this case, T2 is larger because Star_2 is moving towards us. So same result as before, T2 is higher than T1.

So same as before, L1/L2 would still be 2.25 * ( (T1/T2 )^4 ) = 2.25 * ( (3/10 )^4 ) = 2.25 * 0.0081 = 0.018225.

So same result, L1 is less than L2. So the conclusion remains the same.

But the problem says that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor. So according to this, the factor is less than 1, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I messed up in considering the direction of the velocity.

Wait, wait, perhaps I have an error in the Doppler formula. Because when the source is moving towards the observer, the observed frequency is higher, so wavelength is shorter. So for a given emitted peak, the observed peak would be at a shorter wavelength. So to have the same observed wavelength as Star_1, which is stationary, Star_2's emitted wavelength must be longer. Because when moving towards, observed wavelength is shorter. So to have same observed wavelength, the emitted wavelength must be longer.

Wait, let me think again.

If Star_2 is moving towards us, then its observed lambda is shorter than emitted.

So for lambda_obs to be same as Star_1's (which is emitted), Star_2's emitted lambda must be longer.

So:

lambda_obs = lambda_emit2 * (1 - v_r/c ) = lambda_emit1.

Because Star_2 is moving towards us, v_r is negative.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write v_r as negative in this scenario. So v_r for Star_2 is -700 km/s (if moving towards us).

So, lambda_obs2 = lambda_emit2 * (1 + v_r/c ) = lambda_emit2 * (1 + (-700e3)/3e5 ) = lambda_emit2 * (1 - 2.333 ).

Which would be lambda_emit2 * (-1.333), which doesn't make sense because wavelength can't be negative. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler shift formula for radial velocity needs to consider the sign correctly.

The correct formula for the observed wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer with velocity v (v positive when moving away) is:

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + v/c )

But if the source is moving towards, v is negative.

Wait, no, wait: The standard formula is that if the source is moving towards the observer, the observed wavelength is shorter, so:

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * ( (c - v) / c )

= lambda_emit ( 1 - v/c )

But for small v, this is approximately lambda_emit (1 - v/c )

So for Star_2 moving towards us, v is positive (as in, the radial velocity is positive when receding, negative when approaching?), or is it the other way around?

Wait, the radial velocity is defined as the component of the velocity along the line of sight. A positive radial velocity indicates moving away, negative indicates moving towards.

So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, and it's moving away, then v_r is +700.

If it were moving towards, v_r would be -700.

So in the problem, Star_2's radial velocity is +700, meaning it's moving away.

So initial assumption holds.

So the only conclusion is that L1 is less than L2, which is not matching any of the options.

But the options suggest that L1 is larger than L2 by a factor of around 2.23 or similar. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the radius and mass, but not the Doppler shift. But the problem explicitly says that the observed lambda_max is the same, which depends on Doppler.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in assuming that the observed lambda_max is the same for both stars. So that lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2.

But maybe instead, the stars' own lambda_max (emitted) is the same. Because the problem says, "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So does that mean their emitted lambda_max is same, or the observed lambda_max is same?

The wording is a bit ambiguous. If it's the same emitted lambda_max, then T1 = T2, and so L1/L2 = (R1/R2 )^2 = 2.25, which is option A. But the question also mentions radial velocities, so if the problem is considering that the observed lambda_max is same, then the Doppler shift must be considered.

But the problem states that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So 'appeared' would refer to the observed wavelengths, not the emitted. So the observed lambda_max is same. So the Doppler shift must be considered.

But according to this, L1 is much less than L2, which is not matching any options. So perhaps the problem is considering only the radius, without considering the Doppler shift. But that ignores the given velocity data.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is a red herring. The problem says that both stars have the same mass, but luminosity is about radius and temperature, not mass, so perhaps the mass is irrelevant.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate. Let's see:

If the problem states that the stars' observed lambda_max are the same, then after including Doppler shift, L1/L2 becomes 0.018, which is less than 1. But the options don't have such a factor. So perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the problem.

Wait, what if the problem intended that the stars' emitted lambda_max are the same, regardless of Doppler shift. So if T1 = T2, then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25, which is option A.

But the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So 'appeared' would be the observed wavelengths, which would depend on Doppler shift.

But the options don't match that scenario. So perhaps the problem intended that the stars' emitted wavelengths are same, ignoring Doppler. Then the answer would be 2.25, option A.

But the problem gives radial velocities, so I think I should include that.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the Doppler shift.

Wait, perhaps the formula is the other way around. Let me think.

The observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + v_r/c )

So if Star_2 is moving away (v_r positive), lambda_obs is longer than lambda_emit.

But in our case, lambda_obs for Star_2 must be same as Star_1. So:

lambda_emit2 * (1 + v_r/c ) = lambda_emit1.

So lambda_emit2 = lambda_emit1 / (1 + v_r/c )

But lambda_emit1 = b/T1.

lambda_emit2 = b/T2.

So:

b/T2 = (b/T1
