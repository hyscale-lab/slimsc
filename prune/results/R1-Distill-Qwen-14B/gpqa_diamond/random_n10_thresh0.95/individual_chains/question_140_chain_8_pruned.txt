Alright, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, okay, so the question is about a reaction involving Substance X. I'll go through each part step by step.

First, the question says that Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. I think that means X has an element with a heavier isotope. So, maybe X is a compound where one of its atoms has a heavier variant, like deuterium instead of hydrogen, for example.

Next, X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, same number of neutrons and protons. So, the molecule must be something like H2O, but wait, no. Let me think. For a molecule, each atom contributes. If each atom in W has the same number of n and p, like maybe hydrogen because each H has 1p and 0n. Well, that can't be. Or perhaps a molecule like CO2? No, that's not the same. Wait, maybe the molecule is something like CH4. Wait, no, the same number of neutrons and protons in each molecule? Or perhaps the molecule itself has the same number of each. Let me think again. If W is a molecule where each atom has same number of protons and neutrons, like maybe D2 (deuterium), but wait, deuterium is an isotope of H. Each D has 1p and 1n. So, D2 would have 2 atoms each with 1p and 1n. So the molecule D2 would have 2p and 2n in total, but each atom has equal. Alternatively, maybe it's a molecule like O2 or N2, but those don't fit the description. Wait, the question says the gas W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So, number of neutrons equal to number of protons in the molecule. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's H2O. Let me check. H2O has H (1p, 0n each) and O (8p, 8n). So total protons: 2 +8=10. Neutrons: 0*2 +8=8. Not equal. So maybe not. Another option: CO2? Protons: C has 6, O has 8 each. So 6 + 2*8=22. Neutrons: C has 6 (if it's C-12), O has 8 each. So 6 + 2*8=22. Oh wait, that's same as protons. So CO2 would have 22 protons and 22 neutrons. But wait, the question says "the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons". So that would fit. So gas W is CO2? Or maybe another molecule.

Wait, but when X reacts with Y, which is a liquid. What's a common reaction that produces CO2? Maybe a carbonate reacting with an acid? Or maybe something else. Let me think.

Another thought: if X is a metal, like sodium, reacting with water (liquid Y) would produce H2 gas. But earlier thought about W being H2 wouldn't fit since each H has 1p and 0n, so the molecule would have 2p and 0n. Not equal. So that's not right. Alternatively, maybe W is NH3? No, that's not a gas produced in such violent reactions. Alternatively, maybe W is O2 or O3, but O2 has 16p and 16n (if O is O-16). So O2 would have 32p and 32n? Wait no, each O has 8p and 8n. So O2 has 16p and 16n. So yes, same number. So if W is O2, that would fit.

Wait, but when would X react with a liquid Y (maybe water) to produce O2? That's not a typical reaction. Maybe if X is a metal that reacts violently with water, like potassium or sodium, which produce H2, not O2. Hmm, maybe another approach.

Alternatively, gas W could be CH4. Each C has 6p and 6n (if it's C-12), each H has 1p and 0n. So molecule: 6+4 =10p, 6+0=6n. No, not equal. So that doesn't work.

Wait, maybe W is CF4. Each F has 9p and 9n (assuming F-19). So CF4: 9p (C) +4*9=45p total. Neutrons: C has 6 (if C-12), F has 9 each, so 6 +4*9=42. Not equal. Hmm.

Wait, maybe W is something like BF3. B has 5p and 5n (if B-11). F has 9p and 9n. So BF3: 5 +3*9=32p, 5 +3*9=32n. Oh, that's equal. So W could be BF3. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's something like NO. Wait, NO has 7p and 8n. Not equal.

Wait, maybe the molecule is something else. Let's think of the problem from another angle. The precipitate G, when heated, releases B, whose melting point is near 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. Hmm, what has a melting point around there? Water freezes at 273 K (0 C), so 277 is a bit higher, maybe like 4 C. Wait, maybe B is water? Because when heated, G releases B. If G is a hydrate, heating it would release water. But water's melting point is 273 K, which is close to 277 K. Hmm, that's a bit off, but maybe it's considering that the melting point is 'very close'. So B could be water.

If B is water, then when G is heated, it releases water. So G is perhaps a hydrate. So, for example, a copper sulfate pentahydrate, which upon heating loses water.

But how does this tie back to the reaction between X and Y?

Wait, the reaction of X with Y produces gas W and precipitate G. So maybe it's a double displacement reaction. For example, if X is a metal carbonate reacting with an acid (Y) to produce CO2 gas, water, and a precipitate. But earlier I thought W could be CO2. Let me think about that.

So if X is a carbonate, like calcium carbonate. But wait, what's the reaction when a carbonate reacts with an acid? It produces CO2, water, and a salt. If the salt is insoluble, it would precipitate. So, for example, CaCO3 + HCl → CaCl2 + CO2↑ + H2O. The precipitate would be if another product is insoluble, but in this case, CaCl2 is soluble, so maybe I'm not on the right track.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfide? If X is a sulfide, and Y is an acid, then the reaction could produce H2S gas. But H2S has 2p and 0n, which doesn't match the W condition. Wait, H2S: each H has 1p, 0n. Sulfur has 16p, 16n (if S-32). So total p: 2+16=18. Neutrons: 0*2 +16=16. Not equal. So H2S doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe W is something like CH4, but as I thought earlier, it doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps W is NH3. No, because each N has 7p, 7n. H has 1p, 0n. So NH3: 7+3=10p, 7+0=7n. Not equal.

Wait, another approach. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So, the product has O2? Wait, a keto acid is an acid with a ketone group, like acetoacetic acid or something. When it reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. What reaction could that be?

Wait, X is a reagent used in organic chemistry. Common reagents include things like Grignard reagents, which are organometallic compounds. Grignard reagents react with carbonyl groups, like in keto acids. So if X is a Grignard reagent, when it reacts with a keto acid, perhaps it adds to the carbonyl, turning it into an alcohol. So after the addition, the product would have more oxygen atoms? Or maybe not. Wait, the product has two oxygen atoms. The keto acid has a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group. Let me think. Suppose the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid, which has two carbonyl groups. If X (a Grignard) adds to one of them, maybe it forms an alcohol, so perhaps the product would have one less oxygen. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the product has two oxygen atoms in the molecule. For example, if X is something like NaOH. If a keto acid reacts with NaOH, perhaps it's a neutralization. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if X is a base like NH3, but that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the product is something like an alcohol. For example, a ketone reacting with X (like Grignard) would form an alcohol. So if the keto acid's carbonyl becomes an alcohol, perhaps that adds another oxygen? Or maybe not. Another thought: if X is something like LiAlH4, a
