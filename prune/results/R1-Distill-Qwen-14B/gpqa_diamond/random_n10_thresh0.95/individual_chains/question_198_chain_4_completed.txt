Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the various complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, wait, first I need to figure out what the complexes are. So the complexes are probably [Co(SCN)]^n+ where n varies. The stability constant β tells us how stable each complex is. A higher β means a more stable complex.

Stability constants are for the formation of the complex from the ions. So, for each complex, the β is the equilibrium constant for Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n). Wait, no, wait, the charge of the complex would be 2+ minus the number of SCN^- times their charge. Since each SCN is -1, so for n SCN, the complex charge would be 2 - n*(-1) ? Wait no, wait, Co is +2, each SCN is -1. So if you have n SCN- ligands, the complex's charge would be 2+ - n*(1-) = 2 - n. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think: Co^2+ has +2 charge. Each SCN^- is -1. So if you have n SCN- ligands, the total charge would be 2+ - n*(1-) = 2 - n. So for n=1, the complex is [CoSCN]^+ (charge +1), n=2, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (neutral?), n=3, [Co(SCN)_3]^- (charge -1), n=4, [Co(SCN)_4]^2- (charge -2). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct, but I think that's the way it works.

But the problem mentions the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN ligands, right? So that would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the neutral complex. So we are looking for the concentration of this species relative to all cobalt species.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the color, but the options are about percentages. So the question is, what is the percentage of the dithiocyanato (n=2) complex among all possible Co species.

So the approach here is to calculate the fraction of each complex and sum them up. The highest fraction will be the most abundant complex.

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the Co species: [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

But since the solution is in equilibrium, the concentrations can be determined using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions.

But how do we approach this? I remember that when multiple complexes can form, we can use the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand to find the distribution of each complex.

The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex relative to the total. The fractions are determined by the product of the stability constants and the ligand concentrations raised to the appropriate power, divided by a common term.

Wait, the formula for the fraction of each complex is (β_n * [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1[SCN] + β2[SCN]^2 + β3[SCN]^3 + β4[SCN]^4). Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the fraction for each complex is (β_n * [SCN]^n) divided by the sum of all terms (β_0[SCN]^0 + β_1[SCN]^1 + β_2[SCN]^2 + ... + β_4[SCN]^4), where β_0 is 1 (the fraction of free Co^2+).

Wait, but in this case, the stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So I think β1 is for the first complex (n=1), β2 for n=2, etc. So each β_n is for the complex with n SCN ligands.

So the total concentration of all complexes is the sum over all possible complexes, each term being β_n [SCN]^n.

Wait, but the total cobalt concentration, c(Co), is the sum of all complexes plus free Co^2+? Or is the total c(Co) equal to the sum of all complexes? Because each complex includes the Co^2+.

Wait, I think that the total Co is the sum of all the complexes, because each complex contains one Co^2+ ion. So the free Co^2+ is a separate term, but the problem says the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M.

Wait, maybe I should model this properly. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the species. So:

c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^{2-}]

Each of these terms is the concentration of the respective complex. So the sum of all these equals the total c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

But how do these relate to the stability constants?

The stability constants (β) are defined as:

β1 = [CoSCN^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-])

β2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2)

β3 = [Co(SCN)_3^-]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^3)

β4 = [Co(SCN)_4^{2-}]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^4)

So each β_n represents the equilibrium for the nth complex.

We can express each complex's concentration in terms of [Co^2+] and [SCN^-].

Let me denote [Co^2+] as x.

So:

[CoSCN^+] = β1 * x * [SCN] = 9 x (0.1) = 0.9 x

[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 x [SCN]^2 = 40 x (0.1)^2 = 40 x 0.01 = 0.4 x

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = β3 x [SCN]^3 = 63 x (0.1)^3 = 63 x 0.001 = 0.063 x

[Co(SCN)_4^{2-}] = β4 x [SCN]^4 = 16 x (0.1)^4 = 16 x 1e-4 = 0.0016 x

And the free [Co^2+] is x.

So the sum of all these equals the total Co concentration, which is 1e-2 M.

So:

x + 0.9 x + 0.4 x + 0.063 x + 0.0016 x = 1e-2

Let me compute the coefficients:

x (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = 1e-2

Calculating the sum inside the parentheses:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3

2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363

2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646

So 2.3646 x = 1e-2

Solving for x:

x = (1e-2) / 2.3646 ≈ 4.225e-3 M

Wait, let me compute that accurately.

1e-2 is 0.01. Divided by 2.3646: 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004225 M (approx 4.225e-3 M)

So [Co^2+] is about 0.004225 M.

Now, let's compute each complex's concentration:

[CoSCN^+] = 0.9 x ≈ 0.9 * 0.004225 ≈ 0.0038025 M

[Co(SCN)_2] = 0.4 x ≈ 0.4 * 0.004225 ≈ 0.00169 M

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = 0.063 x ≈ 0.063 * 0.004225 ≈ 0.000266 M

[Co(SCN)_4^{2-}] = 0.0016 x ≈ 0.0016 * 0.004225 ≈ 0.00000676 M

Now, let's sum all these to check against the total Co concentration of 0.01 M:

x ≈ 0.004225

+ 0.0038025 ≈ 0.0080275

+ 0.00169 ≈ 0.0097175

+ 0.000266 ≈ 0.0099835

+ 0.00000676 ≈ 0.00999026

But wait, the total should be 0.01. So perhaps I made a slight approximation. Let me check the exact sum:

x = 0.004225

CoSCN^+ = 0.0038025 → sum now 0.0080275

Co(SCN)_2: 0.00169 → sum 0.0097175

Co(SCN)_3^-: 0.000266 → sum 0.0099835

Co(SCN)_4^{2-}: 0.00000676 → sum 0.00999026

Hmm, it's about 0.009990, which is just under 0.01. Maybe I should use more precise decimal places.

But perhaps I should approach this another way. Instead of approximating, perhaps I should compute each concentration more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to compute the fractions of each complex relative to the total, then multiply by 100 to get percentages.

Wait, let's think about this. The fractions are [complex]/c(Co), where c(Co) is 0.01 M.

So the fraction for each complex is ([complex]/c(Co)) * 100.

Alternatively, since I can compute each complex's concentration, I can sum them all and find the fraction of each.

Wait, but I'm trying to compute the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2].

So let's compute each concentration:

x = [Co^2+] = 0.004225 M

[CoSCN^+] = 9 * x * 0.1 = 9 * 0.004225 * 0.1 = 0.0038025 M

[Co(SCN)_2] = 40 * x * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.004225 * 0.01 = 0.00169 M

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = 63 * x * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.004225 * 0.001 = 0.000266 M

[Co(SCN)_4^{2-}] = 16 * x * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.004225 * 0.0001 = 0.00000676 M

Now, the total c(Co) is:

0.004225 (x) + 0.0038025 (n=1) + 0.00169 (n=2) + 0.000266 (n=3) + 0.00000676 (n=4) ≈ 0.00999026 M, which is close to 0.01. The slight discrepancy is due to rounding, but it's negligible.

Now, for each complex, the percentage is (concentration / 0.01) * 100.

So for [Co(SCN)_2], which is the dithiocyanato complex:

0.00169 M / 0.01 M = 0.169 → 16.9%

Wait, that's option D) 16.9%.

But wait, that can't be right because looking at the β values, β2=40 is higher than β1=9 and β3=63 is higher than β2. So the most abundant complex should be the one with the highest β multiplied by [SCN]^n. Let me think about which term is largest.

Wait, but the β multiplied by [SCN]^n gives the product for each complex. Let's calculate each product:

β1 * [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

β2 * [SCN]^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4

β3 * [SCN]^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063

β4 * [SCN]^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016

So β1 is the largest product here, followed by β2, then β3, then β4.

Which would mean that the most abundant complex is the monothiocyanato (n=1) complex.

So the dithiocyanato (n=2) is the second most abundant.

Wait, but according to our earlier calculation, the [Co(SCN)_2] is 0.00169 M, which is about 16.9% of the total, which matches option D.

But wait, when we calculated the fractions, the [CoSCN^+] is about 38% (0.0038025 / 0.01 = 38.025%), [Co(SCN)_2] is 16.9%, and the others are much smaller. So the percentages would be:

Co^2+: 42.25% → 42.25% (from x=0.004225, 0.004225 /0.01 = 42.25%)

CoSCN^+: 38.025%

Co(SCN)_2: 16.9%

Others: negligible.

So the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which is [Co(SCN)_2] → 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, wait, I thought the dithiocyanato complex is the second most abundant. So in our calculation, [Co^2+] is about 42% and [CoSCN^+] is 38%, which is close. Then [Co(SCN)_2] is 16.9%, which is the next.

So the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might mix up the exponents.

Wait, when calculating [CoSCN^+], it's β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]. Since β1=9, and [SCN] is 0.1, then [CoSCN^+] = 9 * x * 0.1.

x is [Co^2+] = 0.004225.

So 9 * 0.004225 * 0.1 = 9 * 0.0004225 = 0.0038025. Correct.

Similarly, β2=40, [SCN]^2 = 0.01. So [Co(SCN)_2] = 40 * 0.004225 * 0.01 = 40 * 0.00004225 = 0.00169. Correct.

So the fraction is 0.00169 / 0.01 = 0.169 →16.9%.

So the answer is D) 16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2], among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants and the given concentrations to calculate the relative fractions of each cobalt species.

### Key Information:
- Total cobalt concentration: \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \)
- Thiocyanate concentration: \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
- Stability constants: \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), \( \beta_4 = 16 \)

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all cobalt species:
\[
c(\text{Co}) = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{CoSCN}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)_2}] + [\text{Co(SCN)_3}^-] + [\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}]
\]

Using the stability constants, the concentrations of the complexes can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] = x \):
\[
[\text{CoSCN}^+] = \beta_1 \cdot x \cdot [\text{SCN}^-] = 9x \cdot 0.1 = 0.9x
\]
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)_2}] = \beta_2 \cdot x \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40x \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4x
\]
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)_3}^-] = \beta_3 \cdot x \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63x \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063x
\]
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}] = \beta_4 \cdot x \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16x \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016x
\]

The total cobalt concentration is:
\[
c(\text{Co}) = x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = 2.3646x
\]
\[
x = \frac{c(\text{Co})}{2.3646} = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 4.225 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
\]

Now, calculate the concentration of each cobalt species:
\[
[\text{Co}^{2+}] = x \approx 4.225 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
\]
\[
[\text{CoSCN}^+] = 0.9x \approx 0.9 \cdot 4.225 \times 10^{-3} \approx 3.803 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
\]
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)_2}] = 0.4x \approx 0.4 \cdot 4.225 \times 10^{-3} \approx 1.690 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
\]
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)_3}^-] = 0.063x \approx 0.063 \cdot 4.225 \times 10^{-3} \approx 2.661 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{M}
\]
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}] = 0.0016x \approx 0.0016 \cdot 4.225 \times 10^{-3} \approx 6.76 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}
\]

The percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)_2], is:
\[
\text{Percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]} = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)_2}]}{c(\text{Co})} \cdot 100 = \frac{1.690 \times 10^{-3}}{10^{-2}} \cdot 100 \approx 16.9\%
\]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is **16.9%**.
