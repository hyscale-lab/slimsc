Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I need to figure out how the orbital periods of two planets compare based on the given data.

Alright, let's start by recalling what the RV method tells us. The radial velocity method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and we observe this as a shift in the spectral lines. The size of this shift depends on the mass of the planet and its orbital speed, right?

The question says both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. So the planet masses are the same. But the RV shifts are different—5 milliangstrom for planet #1 and 7 for #2. I think a larger RV shift implies a more massive planet, but wait, the planets have the same mass, so maybe the orbital velocity is the determining factor here.

Wait, but if the RV shift is larger, that would mean the star is moving faster towards or away from us. Because the star's velocity is what causes the Doppler shift. So the formula for the RV method is something like velocity semi-amplitude K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )) ) * ( (1 / ( (1 + M_star/M_planet )^(2/3) )) ), but since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So K simplifies to something like ( (G * M_planet ) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(1 + ...)). Wait, maybe I should think of the simplified version.

Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star)^(1/3) * (P/(2π)) )^(1/3). Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula. Let me think again. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v * sin i) 

where v is the star's velocity. The formula for v is derived from the planet's orbit. The exact formula is:

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So the formula simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_*^(2/3) )

Wait, but if both planets have the same M_p and M_* (since both stars are Sun-like), and if their orbital periods are different, then K would be inversely proportional to (P)^(1/3). Because other terms are same for both planets. So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). Hmm, wait that can't be right. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula rearranged: P is the orbital period. So K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3) ). Oh wait, no: the formula is K ∝ (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) ), because when you have (2π G / c P )^(1/3), it's (1/P^(1/3)).

So if K1 and K2 are the radial velocities, then:

K1 / K2 = [ (M_p sin i1) / (M_*^(2/3) P1^(1/3) ) ] / [ (M_p sin i2) / (M_*^(2/3) P2^(1/3) ) ]

Simplify: K1/K2 = (sin i1 / sin i2) * (P2 / P1)^(1/3 )

But in this question, the inclination angles (i) aren't given. However, since both planets are in circular orbits and detected via RV, their inclinations are likely similar. But wait, can we assume sin i is the same? Because if sin i is 1 (edge-on), then we'd detect the maximum velocity. But without knowing, perhaps the question assumes that the inclination is the same for both, so sin i is the same for both. So then, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

But wait, in the problem, K1 is 5 milliangstrom and K2 is 7. So K2 is larger than K1. So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

But according to the formula, K2/K1 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So 1.4 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

To find (P2/P1), cube both sides: (1.4)^3 = P2/P1.

What is 1.4 cubed? Let me calculate. 1.4 * 1.4 = 1.96, then 1.96 * 1.4 = 2.744. So P2/P1 is approximately 2.744.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is planet #2's orbital period than planet #1's. So it's P2 / P1 = ~2.744. So the answer would be ~2.74 times, but that's not among the options. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let's re-examine. Wait, in my earlier formula, I might have gotten the ratio backwards. Because K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), so if K2 is larger than K1, that would mean P2 is smaller than P1, because a larger K implies a smaller period.

Wait, let me think again. Since K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)), if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 must be smaller than P1. Because a higher K leads to a smaller period. So the ratio of K's is K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4. So according to the formula, K ∝ 1/(P^(1
