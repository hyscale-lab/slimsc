Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Let me try to understand what's being asked and how to approach it.

The question gives a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I might have misread that. Oh right, the correct term should be something like L = -λ f ψ̄_f (something) ψ_f. But I think the exact form isn't as important as the fact that X is interacting with fermions. 

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I need to figure out which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into.

Kinematically allowed means that the energy of the boson must be enough to produce the fermion pair. So for a decay X → f f̄, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion f. Because when a particle decays, the rest mass energy must be sufficient to create the rest masses of the decay products.

So, I need to figure out the masses of all possible fermions that X can decay into. Let me recall the masses of the known fermions.

From what I remember:

- Up quark (u): very light, about 2 MeV. So 2 * 2 MeV = 4 MeV, way less than 6 GeV.
- Down quark (d): similar to up, maybe around 5 MeV? Still way under.
- Strange quark (s): around 100 MeV. 2*100=200 MeV. Still way under 6 GeV.
- Charm quark (c): around 1.5 GeV. 2*1.5 = 3 GeV. Less than 6 GeV. So possible.
- Bottom quark (b): about 4.5 GeV. 2*4.5=9 GeV. Oh wait, 9 GeV is higher than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄ because 6 GeV < 9 GeV. So b is out.
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV. So no, X can't decay into t t̄.

For leptons:

- Electron (e): nearly massless, ~0.0005 GeV. So 2*0.0005 = 0.001 GeV. Definitely allowed.
- Muon (μ): ~0.1 GeV. 2*0.1=0.2 GeV. Also allowed.
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV. 2*1.78=3.56 GeV. 3.56 is less than 6 GeV, so tau pairs are allowed.

So the possible fermions X can decay into are: u, d, s, c, e, μ, τ. Wait, but wait: no, because for quarks, the decay must produce a quark and antiquark, but the interaction term must allow that. Also, looking at the Lagrangian, since it's ψ_f, which is a fermion field, and X is a boson, the interaction is like X ψ̄ ψ. So the coupling is to any fermion that has mass, because the term is (v + X) ψ̄ ψ, so it's Yukawa-type coupling. So any fermion with a mass term would couple to X.

But wait, all fermions have mass terms? No, in the Standard Model, the fermions get masses via the Higgs mechanism. So in this problem, the interaction term is probably such that X couples to all fermions, but for decay, the fermion masses determine whether X can decay into them.

So, back to possible decay products:

Which fermions have masses less than 3 GeV each? Because 6 GeV is the mass of X, so each fermion must be less than 3 GeV for X to decay into f and f̄.

Let's list the fermion masses in GeV:

- e: ~0.0005 GeV
- μ: ~0.105 GeV
- τ: ~1.78 GeV
- u: ~0.002 GeV
- d: ~0.004 GeV (or maybe it's as low as 2 MeV?)
Wait, actual masses are more like:

u ~ ~2 MeV (approx 0.002 GeV)
d ~ ~5 MeV (0.005 GeV)
s ~ ~100 MeV (0.1 GeV)
c ~ ~1.5 GeV
b ~ ~4.5 GeV
t ~ ~173 GeV

So:

Each f must satisfy m_f < 6/2 = 3 GeV.

So possible f are:

e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

But wait, tau is about 1.78 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV, so yes.

Charm is 1.5 GeV, so yes.

But bottom is 4.5, which is above 3, so no.

So X can decay into any pair where each fermion has mass less than 3 GeV.

So possible decay channels:

uū, d̄d, s̄s, c̄c, e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ−.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have all of those. Let me look.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, e+ e−.

But wait, since X mass is 6 GeV, and b has 4.5 GeV each, 2*4.5=9>6, so b is not allowed. So option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

So this includes c (1.5 GeV, allowed), s (0.1, allowed), u, d, tau (1.78, 2*1.78=3.56<6), mu (0.105, 0.21<6), e etc. So all these are allowed. So B seems possible.

Option C: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, tau, mu, e. But t is way too heavy, so decay into t t̄ is not allowed. So C is out.

Option D: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau, mu, e. Again, b is not allowed.

So the only correct option is B.

Wait, but the question says "the interaction is given by [Lagrangian]". I should check if the interaction allows for these decay channels. The Lagrangian is L = -λ f ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. So X is coupled to all fermions f. So any fermion that has a mass (i.e., can interact via the Higgs) would have a Yukawa coupling to X. So all fermions can be decay products as long as their mass is under 3 GeV.

So the possible decays are to all fermion pairs with m_f <3 GeV. So that's u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

Wait, but what about the quarks? Are they allowed to be emitted? Because in reality, when a boson decays into quarks, they have to form hadrons, but the question is about the kinematic possibility, not about whether they can be detected as free quarks (which they can't because quarks are confined). But in terms of allowed decays, if the energy is sufficient, the decay is possible, even if the quarks are then hadronized. So from a kinematic standpoint, any fermion pair with 2m_f < M_X is allowed.

So, the correct decay channels are all the fermions listed in option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

So the correct answer must be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian provided indicates that \( X \) couples to all fermions. For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the mass of \( X \) must be at least twice the mass of the fermion \( f \), i.e., \( 2m_f < M_X \).
