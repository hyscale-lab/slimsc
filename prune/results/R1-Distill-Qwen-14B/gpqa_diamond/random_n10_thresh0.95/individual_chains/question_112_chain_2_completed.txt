Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to unpack the question and solve it.

First, the problem statement: We have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so they form an orthonormal basis. The question asks for two things: the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator, and the average value of that operator.

The operator in question has a matrix representation where A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, so what does that matrix look like? Since the basis has |up> and |down>, it's a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out.

The matrix A would be:
[ 0, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, 0 ]

Because when i and j are different (like (1,2) and (2,1)), the elements are ħ/2, and the diagonal is zero.

Wait, but wait. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix. So the operator is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 off-diagonal. So what does this operator represent? It looks like it's proportional to the Pauli X matrix, but scaled. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and here each off-diagonal element is ħ/2. So A = (ħ/2) * σ_x.

So the operator A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. So the eigenstates of operator A would be the same as σ_x, since it's just a scalar multiple.

So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. Because that's how the eigenstates of σ_x are defined.

Wait, but the question says we need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A. So we need to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, and then the square of the coefficients' magnitudes would be the probabilities.

But wait, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, let's normalize it because it's only proportional. We need to find the normalization constant.

Let me compute the inner product of |alpha> with itself. The state |alpha> is c * ( (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ), where c is the proportionality constant. So the norm squared is |c|^2 times [ |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2 ].

Compute |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Compute |2 - i|^2: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5.

So the sum is 2 + 5 =7. So the norm is sqrt(7), so |c|=1/sqrt(7) to make the state normalized. So the actual |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the eigenstates of A are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

We can express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.

Let me write |alpha> as a linear combination:

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>.

We need to find a and b.

Express |alpha> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)
= [ (1+i) + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) [Wait, no, |up> and |down> are orthonormal, so this is correct.]

Expressing in terms of |+x> and |-x>:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, let me solve for |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Adding |+x> and |-x>:
|+x> + |-x> = [2|up> ] / sqrt(2) → |up> = (|+x> + |-x> ) * sqrt(2)/2.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to set up equations.

Let me write |alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>.

Expressed in terms of |up> and |down>:

a |+x> = a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
b |-x> = b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)
So adding these together:

|alpha> = [ a |up> + a |down> + b |up> - b |down> ] / sqrt(2)
= [ (a + b) |up> + (a - b) |down> ] / sqrt(2)

But |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

So setting the coefficients equal:

(a + b)/sqrt(2) = (1 + i) / sqrt(7)
(a - b)/sqrt(2) = (2 - i) / sqrt(7)

Let's solve these two equations for a and b.

Let me write them as:

Equation 1: a + b = [ (1+i) sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)
Equation 2: a - b = [ (2 -i) sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)

Add equation 1 and equation 2:
2a = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ) * sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)
2a = [ 3 * sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)
a = [3 sqrt(2)] / (2 sqrt(7)) ) = 3 / sqrt(14)

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:
2b = [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ) * sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)
= [ (-1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)
So b = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ) ] / (2 sqrt(7)) )
Simplify denominator: 2 sqrt(7) = sqrt(28)
So b = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(28)
= [ (-1 + 2i) ] / sqrt(14) )

Now, we need the probabilities. The probability of measuring |+x> is |a|^2, and |-x> is |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2:
a = 3 / sqrt(14)
|a|^2 = 9 / 14 ≈ 0.642857... So about 0.64, which is close to option A's first number (0.64) or D has 0.61.

Compute |b|^2:
b = (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)
The modulus squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.3571. Wait, but option A has 0.36 which is close to this.

Wait, but let me compute exactly. 5/14 is approximately 0.3571, which is 0.36 when rounded to two decimal places. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but wait a second. Are the eigenstates of the operator A (which is (ħ/2) σ_x) the same as |+x> and |-x>? Yes, because σ_x is the Pauli X matrix, and A is proportional to it. So the eigenvalues of A would be (ħ/2)*1 and (ħ/2)*(-1), so ± ħ/2.

But wait, the question asks for the probability of measuring each eigenstate of A. So the probabilities are |a|^2 and |b|^2, which are 9/14 and 5/14, respectively. So 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, and 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which matches. But let me check the other parts.

The question also asks for the average value of the operator A. The average value is given by <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, and since |alpha> expressed in terms of the eigenstates of A, the expectation value is given by |a|^2 * (ħ/2) * (+1) + |b|^2 * (ħ/2) * (-1).

Wait, because eigenvalues of A are (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1).

So <A> = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)( - ħ/2 )
= [ (9/14 -5/14) ] (ħ/2 )
= (4/14) ( ħ/2 )
= (2/7) ( ħ/2 )
= ħ/7.

Wait, let me double-check that:

Another approach: compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is a matrix, let's compute it.

The state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

The operator A is [[0, ħ/2],[ ħ/2, 0 ]].

So compute <alpha| A |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1-i) , (2+i) ] * A * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i); (2-i) ]

Wait, because <alpha| is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ].

So let's compute the product:

First, compute A multiplied by |alpha> vector.

|alpha> as a column vector is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ].

Multiply by A:
A * |alpha> = [ (0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (ħ/2)*(2-i)/sqrt(7) ),
               ( (ħ/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2-i)/sqrt(7) ) ]
= [ (ħ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

Now, compute <alpha| A |alpha>:
= [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (ħ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T

So each component:

First term: (1-i)/sqrt(7) * ( ħ/2 (2 -i) ) / sqrt(7) ) = (1-i)(2 -i) (ħ/2) / 7

Second term: (2 + i)/sqrt(7) * ( ħ/2 (1 + i) ) / sqrt(7) ) = (2 +i)(1 +i) (ħ/2) /7

So sum these two terms.

Compute (1-i)(2 -i) = (1*2) + (1*(-i)) + (-i*2) + (-i)(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i^2
= 2 -3i -1 (since i^2 =-1)
=1 -3i.

Compute (2+i)(1+i) = 2*1 +2*i +i*1 + i*i
= 2 +2i +i +i²
= 2 +3i -1
=1 +3i.

So the sum becomes:

[ (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) ] * (ħ/2) /7
= [2] * (ħ/2) /7
= ħ /7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A says probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, and average ħ/7. So that's a match.

Wait, but wait, I think in the probabilities, 9/14 is 0.6428 (approx 0.64) and 5/14 ≈ 0.3571, which is approximately 0.36.

So option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which is correct for the probabilities, and the average is ħ/7, which matches.

But wait, let me check the other options.

Option D says 0.61 and 0.29. 9/14 is 0.642857..., so 0.64 is the right first value. So option D is incorrect.

So the correct probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, leading to option A.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option A says "0.64, 0.36 and hbar / 7", which matches what I calculated.

Wait, but let me check another approach: perhaps I made a mistake with the state expansion. Another method is to compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and |-x>.

Compute <alpha | +x >:

|+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
So <alpha | +x> = (1 -i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2)
= [ (1 -i) + (2 +i) ] / (sqrt(7) sqrt(2))
= (3 + 0i) / sqrt(14)
So |a|^2 = (3^2) /14 =9/14 ≈ 0.6428, same as before.

Similarly, <alpha | -x> = (1 -i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (-1)/sqrt(2)
= [ (1 -i) - (2 +i) ] / sqrt(14)
= (-1 -2i) / sqrt(14)
So |b|^2 = ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) /14 = (1+4)/14=5/14≈0.3571.

So same result as before.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.6428 and 0.3571, which rounds to 0.64 and 0.36. So the average is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, ħ/7 → Correct.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given state and operator. The state |α⟩ is proportional to \((1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle\), where \(|\uparrow\rangle\) and \(|\downarrow\rangle\) are orthonormal eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. To normalize |α⟩, we calculate its norm:

\[
\| |α⟩ \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7 \quad \Rightarrow \quad |α⟩ = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

The operator \(A\) has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is proportional to the Pauli \(X\)-matrix, \(A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x\), and its eigenstates are \(|+x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}\) and \(|-x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}\), corresponding to eigenvalues \(\frac{\hbar}{2}\) and \(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\), respectively.

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in \(|+x\rangle\) and \(|-x\rangle\), we express \(|α\rangle\) in terms of these eigenstates:

\[
|α\rangle = a |+x\rangle + b |-x\rangle.
\]

Substituting \(|+x\rangle\) and \(|-x\rangle\) into \(|α\rangle\), we solve for \(a\) and \(b\):

\[
a = \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad b = \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of \(a\) and \(b\):

\[
|a|^2 = \frac{9}{14}, \quad |b|^2 = \frac{5}{14}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \(0.64\) and \(0.36\).

Next, we calculate the average value of \(A\). Using the eigenstate expansion of \(|α\rangle\), the expectation value is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + |b|^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substituting \(|a|^2 = \frac{9}{14}\) and \(|b|^2 = \frac{5}{14}\):

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} - \frac{5}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{4}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, we compare the results with the options. The probabilities \(0.64\) and \(0.36\) match the first two values in option A, and the average value \(\frac{\hbar}{7}\) also matches. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
