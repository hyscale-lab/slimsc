Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice chemistry question here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for the reactions given. Hmm, let's take it step by step. 

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with a nitrile source like NaCN, what's that reaction? Oh, I think that's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrins are formed when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with cyanide ions, typically in an acidic condition. So the reaction is something like ketone + CN- → cyanohydrin.

So for the cyanohydrin formation, the conditions are important. I remember that NaCN is a source of CN- ions, but the reaction usually requires an acid catalyst. Because the ketone is weakly electrophilic, so adding an acid would protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic. The acid also helps in the attack by the CN- ion. So reagent A must be an acid. What's the options for A? Looking at the options, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is a strong acid, like from HCl or H2SO4. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a weaker acid and can act as a source of bisulfite ions, but I'm not sure how that would affect this reaction.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or perhaps (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with CN-, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Oh wait, no, because butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which upon adding cyanide would form (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would be (CH3)2CH(OH)CN? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the nomenclature. Let me think.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So butane has four carbons. Numbering from the nitrile end... Wait, butanenitrile would be four carbons with the nitrile on the first. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have the structure NC-CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2- something? Wait, maybe it's better to draw it out.

Butan-2-one is:

   O
   |
CH3-C-CH2-

Wait, no. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH3? No, wait no, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is (CH3)2-C=O. So four carbons, ketone on C2.

When it reacts with NaCN, the cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon, adding a CN and an OH group. So the product would be (CH3)2-C(OH)-CN. Wait, but that would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, that suggests maybe a longer chain. Wait, wait, but butan-2-one has four carbons, so the product would have four carbons as well. Let me think again.

Butan-2-one is CH3-CO-CH2-CH3. Oh wait no, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is (CH3)2-C=O. So when the cyanide attacks, it would form (CH3)2-C(OH)-CN. That would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, but the product is butanenitrile. Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)2CH(OH)CH2CN, but that wouldn't fit the butanenitrile part. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's focus on the reagents.

So, the first reaction requires an acid catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation. So reagent A is likely an acid. Looking at the options, A can be H3O+ (like from HCl) or NaHSO3. Since NaHSO3 is a source of H+ (as HSO3^- is a weak acid), but it's a milder acid. However, in the formation of cyanohydrins, strong acid conditions are usually used. So the reaction is typically done with aqueous HCN and a catalyst, perhaps H2SO4 (which would give H3O+ in solution). So reagent A is H3O+.

So in the options, looking at options A and B: A is H3O+ in options A and B. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+ or maybe NaHSO3. But I think H3O+ is more likely. So looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+.

Now, the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile. So it's a cyanohydrin structure. The reaction is converting the nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.

How does that happen? Nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The typical hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids requires strong acidic or basic conditions, sometimes with heat.

Wait, the starting material is a cyanohydrin (since it's formed in the first step), and now it's undergoing hydrolysis. So the nitrile group (-CN) in the cyanohydrin is being converted into a carboxylic acid.

So the reaction is hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid. The conditions for this are usually strong acid or strong base with heat. Alternatively, under certain conditions, nitriles can be hydrolyzed in the presence of water with an acid catalyst.

Wait, the reagent in this case is B, and in the reaction, it's written as H2O. So perhaps it's an acidic hydrolysis.

Wait, but in the reaction, the reagent is B (H2O). Wait, that seems confusing. Let me read the question again.

The question says:

Reaction 2: [compound] + B (H2O) → [another compound]

Wait, that might be a typo. Or perhaps it's saying that B is H2O. Or maybe the reaction is conducted in H2O with reagent B. Hmm, perhaps the reagent B is an acid or a base that facilitates the hydrolysis.

Wait, the structure of the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So, it's an alcohol adjacent to a nitrile. Now, the product is a carboxylic acid on that same carbon. So the nitrile group is being oxidized to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, what's the mechanism for that? Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires strong acid conditions, like H2SO4 and heat, or under basic conditions with strong oxidizing agents.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a hydrolysis under acidic conditions. So the nitrile group (-CN) in the presence of water and acid would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but I thought nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid usually involves either acid or base and heat. Let me think again. In acidic conditions, the nitrile can be hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid via an intermediate amide. The steps are: nitrile → amide under acidic conditions, then the amide is further hydrolyzed to carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the presence of the hydroxyl group (the cyanohydrin) might influence this. Hmm, perhaps the reagent B is an acid, like HCl, which would provide the H+ for the reaction.

Looking at the options, B can be HCl, CH3COOH, or HCl again. Let me see the options again.

Options:

A) A = H3O+; B = HCl

B) A = H3O+; B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3; B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3; B = CH3COOH

So for reaction 2, the reagent B is either HCl or CH3COOH (acetic acid). Wait, but the reaction is (compound) + B (H2O) → product.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is conducted in aqueous acid. For the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, strong acids are used. So HCl is a strong acid, which would make sense. Acetic acid is a weak acid. If the reaction requires acidic conditions, perhaps HCl is better.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid. So after hydrolysis, the nitrile becomes a carboxylic acid group. So the reagent would be an acid catalyst. HCl is a strong acid that can protonate the nitrile, making it more electrophilic, which facilitates the attack by water.

Alternatively, I'm a bit confused because sometimes the hydrolysis might require a different approach. Let me think about the reaction steps.

In the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that's a cyanohydrin formation, which requires acid. So A is likely H3O+.

In the second reaction, the nitrile is being converted to a carboxylic acid. The reaction is:

R-C≡N + H2O → R-COOH

With the presence of an acid catalyst, like HCl. So B would be HCl.

Looking at the options, option A has B as HCl. So for the first reaction, A is H3O+, and for the second, B is HCl. So the correct option is A.

Wait, but another thought. Wait, the second reaction is using H2O as a solvent or as part of the reagent, but the reagent B is the catalyst. So if it's an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, then B would be HCl (a strong acid). Alternatively, if it's a base, maybe it's NaOH. But in the options, B is either HCl or acetic acid.

Another point to consider: in the second reaction, the starting material has a hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile. So the molecule is a vicinal diol? No, wait, it's (4-benzylphenyl) attached to the same carbon as the hydroxyl and nitrile. So the structure is something like:

Ph-(CH2)4-C(OH)-CN?

Wait, no. The starting material for the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So butanenitrile is four carbons, with nitrile on C1. The 2-position has a hydroxyl group and the 4-benzylphenyl group. So the structure is more like:

CH2-C(C6H5CH2Ph)(OH)-CH2-CN ?

Wait, not exactly, but the key point is that it's a nitrile adjacent to a hydroxyl group. So when hydrolyzed, the nitrile becomes a carboxylic acid.

Another thought: the hydrolysis of nitriles can be done using strong acids like H2SO4, or using HCl with heat. Alternatively, using a mild acid might not be sufficient unless in the presence of a strong oxidizing agent.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the product is a carboxylic acid, so the nitrile must have undergone hydrolysis. So the reagent B is likely an acid, like HCl. So which option has B as HCl?

Looking again, options A and C have B as HCl and HCl respectively. But wait, option A has A as H3O+ and B as HCl. So that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the second reaction uses a different condition. Wait, nitrile hydrolysis can also be done in the presence of a base, but the product after hydrolysis in base is a carboxylate, which would then need to be acidified to get the carboxylic acid. So if B is a base, then after hydrolysis, you'd need to add acid to get the carboxylic acid. But the reaction given ends with the carboxylic acid, so perhaps the conditions are acidic.

So, putting it all together, for reaction 1, the reagent is H3O+ (so A is H3O+), and for reaction 2, the reagent is HCl (so B is HCl). Looking at the options, that would correspond to option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl.

Wait, but let me double-check the options. Option A is A = H3O+ and B = HCl. Option C is A = NaHSO3 and B = HCl. So if the first reaction uses H3O+, that would be option A or B.

So, the conclusion is that the correct answer is option A.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. Cyanohydrin formation typically requires an acidic catalyst to protonate the carbonyl group, making it more electrophilic for the nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for this reaction, as it provides the necessary acidic conditions. NaHSO₃, while acidic, is a weaker acid and less commonly used for this purpose.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to form a carboxylic acid. This reaction typically requires acidic or basic conditions, with strong acids like HCl being effective for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acids. CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid and less likely to facilitate this reaction efficiently. Therefore, HCl is the most appropriate reagent for the second reaction.

Considering the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  

Option A is the best choice because H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first reaction, and HCl is suitable for the second reaction.

Answer: A
