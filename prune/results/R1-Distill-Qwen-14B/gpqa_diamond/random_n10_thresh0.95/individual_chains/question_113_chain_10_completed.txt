--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it step by step.

The question gives me data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons, varying in hydrogen and oxygen counts. I need to figure out which one fits the given data.

Starting with the FTIR data. The very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 probably indicates O-H stretching, like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But wait, the broadness might suggest a hydrogen-bonded O-H, which is more typical of an alcohol or maybe a phenol. But if it's a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester, the O-H would be less likely unless it's something like an ester with an acidic proton, which I'm not sure about. Alternatively, a broad peak here could also suggest an amide, but the options don't have nitrogen, so we can probably rule that out.

Next, the FTIR shows strong absorption at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, 1700 is a classic carbonyl (C=O) stretch. What about 1650? That's a bit lower than a typical carbonyl. Could it be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds? Like maybe an aromatic ketone, or perhaps an ester where conjugation lowers the wavenumber? Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in a conjugated enone system. Alternatively, 1650 could be an aromatic C=C stretch, but then the 1700 would be the carbonyl. Or maybe it's an amide's N-H bend, but again, no N in the options.

Looking at the NMR data: there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl groups are CH2=CH- or similar. So the compound has double bonds, probably. The presence of vinyl protons suggests maybe an alkene or an aromatic ring. But aromatic protons in 1H NMR usually show up in a certain region, maybe around 6.5-8 ppm. But the question doesn't give specific shifts, just that peaks are present for vinyl hydrogens.

Now, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. Let me think about what that could be. 45 is a common fragment. The molecular ion for 45 would correspond to something like (CH3)2O, which is ether (45 g/mol), but wait, no, (CH3)2O is 45: 12*2 + 1*6 + 16 = 24 +6 +16=46? Wait, no, wait: 12*(2 carbons) =24, 6 H's = 6, O is 16. So 24+6+16=46. Oh, wait, wait, maybe another possibility. Maybe it's a CH3CO+ ion, which is 43? Or perhaps CH2O (formaldehyde) is 30. Hmm, maybe it's a CH2O group, but that doesn't add up to 45.

Wait, 45 could be CH3COCH3 (acetone) but that's 58. Hmm. Alternatively, 45 could be the fragment from something else. Let me think: maybe the molecular ion of the compound breaks into a smaller fragment. Let's think about the molecular formulas of the options.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2: molecular weight = (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72+12+32=116.

B) C6H10O: (6*12)+(10)+(16)=72+10+16=98.

C) C6H10O2: (72)+(10)+(32)=114.

D) C6H12O: 72+12+16=100.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment at 45. Let's see, 45 is lower than the molecular weights of all options. So perhaps it's a common fragment. 45 could be a fragment that's a ketone group. Alternatively, m/z 45 could be from a (CH3)2O group (which would be 46, not 45 though). Alternatively, perhaps it's a (CH2O) group, but that's 30. Another thought: maybe the fragment is an aldehyde group, like CH3CHO. Wait, that's 44. Or perhaps a COCH2 group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the presence of a broad peak in IR around 3000 cm^-1 suggests that the compound has either O-H groups or N-H. Since the options don't include nitrogen, it must be O-H. So we're probably dealing with either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, let me look: the IR also shows a peak at 1700, which is a strong carbonyl. So if the compound has both a carbonyl group and an O-H, what could that be?

Wait, a carbonyl and an O-H suggests either an ester (which doesn't have an -OH unless it's an acid), or perhaps a ketone with an alcohol, but that's less common. Alternatively, maybe a hemiacetal or something else, but that's more complicated.

Wait, another possibility: a conjugated carbonyl. For example, maybe the compound is an aromatic ester, or maybe an aromatic ketone with an alcohol group. Or perhaps an ester with an -OH group.

Wait, if the compound has both an O-H and a carbonyl, perhaps it's a carboxylic ester, but that doesn't have an O-H (except for the acidic alpha protons, which are usually not as broad as an -OH). Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone, but that might not have an O-H unless it's an open ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is part of a hemiacetal or acetal structure, but that's a stretch.

Wait, another angle: think about the molecular formula. Let's see the options:

A: C6H12O2. Degree of unsaturation: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming X=0, N=0. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring or a double bond. But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond (so at least one double bond). So for A, if the degree is 1, that can be either a ring or a double bond. But if the compound has a double bond, the degree would be one from that. So maybe a cyclic ether with a double bond elsewhere?

Wait, but the IR shows a strong peak at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is a carbonyl, which is a double bond. So that would account for one degree of unsaturation. If the FTIR shows a peak at 1650, that's another double bond. Wait, but that would require two degrees of unsaturation. Hmm, wait, but maybe the 1650 is not a double bond.

Wait, the 1650 cm^-1 peak. If it's a carbonyl, but perhaps a conjugated one, which would lower the wavenumber. So maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone. Then, the 1650 would be the conjugated double bond (C=C), and the 1700 would be the C=O. So that would account for two degrees of unsaturation: one from the C=O and another from the C=C.

So the compound would have both a carbonyl group and a conjugated double bond.

Let me think about the options. Let's compute the degrees of unsaturation for each option:

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14 -12)/2= 1. Wait, but if it has a carbonyl (C=O) and a double bond (C=C), that's two DoU. But according to this calculation, it's only 1. Hmm, that doesn't add up. So maybe that's a problem.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU: (14 -10)/2=2. So two DoU. Could be a ring plus a double bond, or two double bonds, or a ring and a carbonyl. But the IR shows a carbonyl, so that would account for one DoU, and another comes from perhaps a ring or another double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU: (14 -10)/2=2. So same as B. Two DoU.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU: (14 -12)/2=1. So only one DoU. But the IR suggests two DoU (C=O and C=C). So D can't have two DoU, so it's less likely.

So let's think again. The compound has a carbonyl group (1700 cm-1) and another peak at 1650, which is likely a C=C. So that's two DoU. So the molecular formula must have two DoU.

Looking at the options, B, C, and A (wait, A is DoU=1, so it can't have two DoU. So A is out. D also only has one DoU.) So only B and C have two DoU.

Wait, options B is C6H10O: DoU=2.

Option C is C6H10O2: DoU=2.

So both B and C have two DoU. So perhaps the presence of two DoU is okay for both.

Now, the IR shows O-H (broad peak) and a carbonyl (1700). So the compound must have both an O-H group and a carbonyl group. So looking at the options, which have both O and H?

Wait, all options except A and D don't have two O's. Wait, options A and C have two O's. So if the compound has both an O-H and a carbonyl, which requires at least two O's (like in an ester or a ketone with an alcohol group), perhaps the formula must have two O's. So the options with two O's are A and C.

Wait, but earlier, the DoU with two would require either a ring and a carbonyl, or two double bonds, etc.

So if the compound has two O's, then either A (C6H12O2) or C (C6H10O2).

But earlier, the DoU for A is 1, which can't account for two DoU (a carbonyl and a double bond). So that's a problem. So A has only one DoU, but the IR suggests two DoU. So A can't be the correct formula.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate the DoU for A.

A: C6H12O2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14 -12)/2= 1. So only one DoU. So if the compound has a carbonyl (which is one DoU) and a double bond (another DoU), that's two DoU, but the formula allows only one. So that can't be. So A is out.

So the only possible option with two O's and two DoU is C: C6H10O2.

So, option C: DoU=2.

So the compound has two DoU, which could be a carbonyl (1) and a double bond (1). So that fits.

Now, the mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z=45. Let's think about what that could be for each option.

Option C is C6H10O2. So the molecular weight is (6×12) + (10×1) + (2×16)=72+10+32=114.

So the molecular ion would be at 114. The fragment at 45 suggests a smaller ion. 45 is exactly 114 - 69 (but I don't know if that helps). Alternatively, perhaps it's a cleavage product.

Looking for common fragments. 45 could be C3H7O or something else. Let me see: the possible fragment could be a ketone group, perhaps a CH2O group? No, that's 30. Alternatively, maybe a CH3CO- group (43, but that's 43), but 45 is close. Wait, 45 could be (CH2)2O, but that would be 44 (12*2 + 2*2 +16=24+4+16=44). Hmm, not 45.

Another possibility: maybe the fragment is an acylium ion. For example, a CH3CO+ would be 43, but if it's a slightly different structure, maybe with an oxygen, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment comes from the loss of a larger group. For example, if the molecular ion is 114, and we lose 69 (114-45=69), but I don't know what 69 is. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule breaks into a smaller fragment.

Wait, let's think about what each option's structure could be. If the compound has both an O-H and a C=O, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid ester. Wait, a carboxylic ester would have the structure R-O-CO-R', which would have both O's but not an O-H. So that can't be because then where would the O-H come from? Alternatively, maybe it's a hemiacetal or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Lactones have an ester group and a ring. But lactones don't have an O-H unless they're open, which they're not. So that's probably not it.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an aromatic compound with a ketone group and an O-H, like a phenol derivative. For example, acetophenone with a hydroxyl group somewhere.

But going back to the NMR: the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests maybe a conjugated system, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. So maybe the structure is something like benzalacetone or similar.

Wait, but let's think about the mass spectrum. For a structure like benzalacetone (which would be C9H10O2, but that doesn't match our options), perhaps the fragment comes from the benzene ring losing some parts, but that's not matching the options.

Wait, maybe the molecular formula C6H10O2 suggests a structure with two oxygen atoms, like an ester or a ketone plus an alcohol. Wait, if it's an ester, like methyl propionate, but that would have O's but no O-H. So perhaps it's a diol with a ketone, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ether with a ketone, but again, not sure.

Wait, another angle: the fragment at m/z=45 could be the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91. No, not matching.

Alternatively, think of common ions. 45 could be the molecular ion of (CH3)2CHO, which is 45 (but that's more like 44 for (CH3)2CHO+?).

Alternatively, perhaps it's an acetyl group attached to something else. For example, CH3COCH2- would be 58. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, I might be overcomplicating this. Perhaps the peak at m/z=45 is the result of a CH2O group, but that's 30. Wait, 45 is 114 - 69. Not sure about that.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is C6H10O2. Let's think about what such a compound could be. One possibility is methyl propionate: CH3CH2COOCH3. Let's calculate the molecular weight: (12*6)+(10*1)+(16*2)=72+10+32=114. So that's exactly option C's molecular formula.

But wait, methyl propionate is an ester. Esters don't have an O-H group. So in the IR, the broad peak at 3000 would suggest an O-H, which wouldn't be present in an ester. So that can't be. So perhaps the structure is different.

Wait, another compound with C6H10O2 is cyclohexene oxide, but that's an ether, not a carbonyl. Hmm, but then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl peak.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a beta-keto ester. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a benzaldehyde derivative. But benzaldehyde has C7H6O, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ester, but again, that would lack the O-H.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again about the O-H. The IR shows a broad peak, which suggests a strong hydrogen bonding, like in an alcohol. So the compound must have an -OH group.

So, for option C (C6H10O2), possible structures that have both an -OH and a carbonyl group: maybe a diol with a ketone, but that seems unlikely. Or perhaps an ester with an -OH, which would be unusual.

Wait, another thought: if the compound is a hemiacetal, but I don't see how that would fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a β-keto alcohol, which would have both a ketone and an -OH group. But I'm not sure if that's common.

But then, looking at the mass spectrum, if the molecular ion is 114, and a fragment at 45 is present, perhaps the molecule undergoes a cleavage to form a smaller ion. For example, if the molecule has a ketone and an ester group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH2O group, but that's 30. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3CO+ group (43) but that's not 45.

Wait, another approach: the fragment m/z=45 corresponds to CH3COO- (45?), but wait, CH3COO- is 60 (12+12 + (16*2 + 1) ? Wait, maybe not. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me think about the options again. So the possible formulas are:

A: C6H12O2 (DoU=1) → cannot have both C=O and C=C, so probably not.

B: C6H10O (DoU=2) → could have C=O and C=C or a ring and C=O.

C: C6H10O2 (DoU=2) → could have C=O and C=C or a ring plus C=O, plus another O somewhere.

Wait, another angle: the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond somewhere. So the compound has at least one C=C.

So in the IR, the 1700 is a C=O, and the 1650 is a C=C. So two DoU, so the formula must have two DoU. So only B and C have two DoU.

Now, B is C6H10O with two DoU. So maybe a ring plus a carbonyl group. For example, cyclopentanone (which is C5H8O), but that doesn't fit the formula. Or perhaps something like phenol with a carbonyl, but that's more carbons than we have here.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like cyclohexenol, which would have a ring (6 carbons) and a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ketone with an alcohol group. But I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps I should look back at the mass spec. So the fragment is at 45. Let me think of possible fragments that give 45.

Wait, 45 could be (CH3)2CHCOOH, but that's more than 45. Alternatively, maybe it's the loss of a larger group, like losing 69 from 114 (114-69=45). But I don't know what 69 is. 69 is the molecular weight of something like CH2CH2COOH (but that's 60) or perhaps another group.

Alternatively, consider that 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O, which is 46. Close, but not exact. Alternatively, maybe it's the mass of a CH2O group plus something else.

Wait, another idea: the fragment could be the methyl group from an ester. For example, if the compound is an ester, like methyl something, then losing the rest would leave the methyl group as CH3O- (which is 31), but that doesn't match 45. Alternatively, if the ester is ethyl, that's higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketene ion? Not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of each option and see which makes sense.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU=1. So the structure would have either a ring or a double bond. But the IR suggests two DoU (C=O and C=C), so this can't be right. So A is out.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU=2. So possible structures: either a ring plus a double bond, or two double bonds, or a ring and a carbonyl. The IR shows a C=O and a C=C, so this could fit. So B could be a dienone, for example. But then, the O-H would have to be present. So for B, the formula is C6H10O. So it has one O. So the O could be in a carbonyl and an O-H group. But wait, a carbonyl (like a ketone) would be O, and an O-H would require another O. So that's two O's, but option B only has one O. So that can't be. So B is out because it can't have both a carbonyl and an O-H.

Wait, that's a good point. So if the compound has both a carbonyl (O) and an O-H, then it needs at least two O atoms. So the molecular formula must have two O's. So looking back, options A and C have two O's.

But A has DoU=1, which can't account for two DoU (C=O and C=C). So only option C is left.

So option C is C6H10O2. It has two O's and two DoU, which can account for the C=O and the C=C. So that seems to fit.

The mass spec fragment at 45 would then have to fit into this structure. So, perhaps the compound is something like an aromatic ester with a conjugated carbonyl, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a diketone with an O-H group, but that might not make sense.

Wait, another thought: if the compound is a β-keto ester, but that would have an ester group and a ketone, but where would the O-H come from? It would require another O, but β-keto esters have two O's in the ester group. Hmm, but the IR shows a broad O-H, so maybe the ester group is not present. So perhaps it's a β-keto alcohol, which has both a ketone and an O-H. That would fit.

So the structure would be something like (CH2)3COH-CO-R, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic structure.

Alternatively, the compound could be a diethyl acetal, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of the possible structure of option C (C6H10O2) that has both a carbonyl and an O-H group.

One possibility is a cyclic ketone with an alcohol group. Alternatively, perhaps a diol with a ketone.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclopentanone with an adjacent hydroxyl group, but that would be a five-membered ring. Alternatively, maybe something like methyl cyclohex-2-enone-1-ol, but I'm not sure.

In any case, the IR and NMR data fit better with option C. The O-H would come from the alcohol group, the C=O from the ketone, and the C=C from the conjugated double bond.

Now, the mass spec. For a compound of 114 g/mol, a fragment at 45 could be a common fragment. Maybe the molecule loses a part of it. Let's say the fragment is a CH2O group (30), but that doesn't add up to 45.

Wait, another thought: the molecular ion is at 114. If it loses 69, it becomes 45. What is 69? 69 is the molecular weight of something like CH2CH2COOH (but that's 60). Alternatively, maybe it's a larger group. Hmm, perhaps the molecule breaks into a 45 and 69. If the 45 part is a ketone group, like CH3CO (which is 43), then maybe the loss is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment comes from a cleavage between the carbonyl and the rest of the molecule, leaving a methyl group attached to the carbonyl as a fragment. Wait, CH3CO is 43, close to 45. But it's not exactly matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is something like methyl propyl ketone, but that would have a different formula.

Hmm, perhaps I should move on and see which option fits all the other data.

So, putting it all together:

- FTIR: O-H (broad), C=O (1700), C=C (1650)
- NMR: vinyl Hs, so a double bond is present
- Mass spec: fragment at 45.

The formula must be C6H10O2 (option C), because:

- It has two O's, fitting the O-H and C=O groups.
- It has two DoU, fitting the C=O and C=C.
- The fragment at 45 might correspond to some part of the molecule.

So the correct answer should be option C.


The unknown compound was characterized using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The analysis of the data is as follows:

1. **FTIR Analysis**:  
   - A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol.  
   - A strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to a carbonyl (C=O) group.  
   - A peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ suggests a conjugated C=C bond.  

   This indicates the compound contains both a carbonyl group and a conjugated double bond, requiring two degrees of unsaturation (DoU).

2. **¹H NMR Analysis**:  
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirm the presence of a double bond.  

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:  
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 suggests a common fragment, possibly from the cleavage of the molecule.  

4. **Analysis of Molecular Formulas**:  
   - **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂)**:  
     Degrees of unsaturation = 1. This formula cannot account for both the carbonyl group (1 DoU) and the conjugated double bond (1 DoU), as it only allows for one DoU. Thus, this option is eliminated.  

   - **Option B (C₆H₁₀O)**:  
     Degrees of unsaturation = 2. This formula could account for the carbonyl group and the conjugated double bond. However, it only has one oxygen atom, which is insufficient to explain the broad O-H peak in the IR spectrum. Thus, this option is eliminated.  

   - **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**:  
     Degrees of unsaturation = 2. This formula can account for both the carbonyl group and the conjugated double bond. The two oxygen atoms explain the presence of both the O-H group (broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹) and the carbonyl group (peak at 1700 cm⁻¹). The fragment peak at m/z = 45 could correspond to a common fragment of this compound. This option fits all the data.  

   - **Option D (C₆H₁₂O)**:  
     Degrees of unsaturation = 1. Similar to Option A, this formula cannot account for both the carbonyl group and the conjugated double bond, as it only allows for one DoU. Thus, this option is eliminated.  

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The compound must have two degrees of unsaturation to account for the carbonyl group and the conjugated double bond, as well as two oxygen atoms to explain the O-H and carbonyl groups. The only formula that satisfies all these criteria is **C₆H₁₀O₂**.

Answer: C
