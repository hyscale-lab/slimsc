Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice chemistry question about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me think through each part step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants. I'll need to figure out the products of each reaction and then match them with the options provided.

Starting with part A: dimethyl malonate reacts with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). Sodium ethoxide is a strong base, so I think this is deprotonating something to form an enolate. Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a diester, so it can form an enolate easily.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure where the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is at the 3-position of a p-tolyl group. So the conjugated system is between the carbonyl and the double bond. The enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta position of the acrylate.

Wait, the acrylate is E, so the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite each other. The nucleophilic part of the enolate (the one with negative charge) would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate.

So when the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta position of the acrylate, it should form a new carbon-carbon bond. Then, after the attack, there might be some tautomerism or rearrangement, but I think in this case, the product would be a substituted malonate ester.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. When it acts as a donor, the enolate would form on the central carbon, right? So when it attacks the acrylate, the attack would be on the beta (the position next to the carbonyl) of the acrylate.

The acrylate is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with the p-tolyl group attached to the CH2. Wait, no. Wait, the structure is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the double bond is between C2 and C3, with the carbonyl on C3. So structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 where the CH2 is attached to the p-tolyl group? Or wait, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, the actual structure is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So when substituted at position 3, the structure would be CH2=C-CO-OCH3 where the CH2 is connected to the p-tolyl group. So the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the p-tolyl is on C2.

So when the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the beta carbon (C3 is the carbonyl, so beta is C2), wait no. Wait, the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. The carbonyl is on C3, the double bond is between C2 and C3, so the alpha and beta positions are C2 and C3. Wait, no, alpha is adjacent to carbonyl. So the acrylate is CH2=CHCO-OCH3. So the carbonyl is on C3. So the alpha is C2, beta is C1 (but wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong). Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

The acrylate is (E)-methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is: 

p-tolyl-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, that can't be. Wait, no. Acrylate is CH2=CHCO-O-. So for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the substituent is on the third carbon, which is the carbonyl. That doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe the structure is (E)-CH2=CH-p-tolyl group with a carbonyl attached? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. So the acrylate has the p-tolyl group on the double bond. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, with the p-tolyl on C1 and the CO-OCH3 on C2.

Wait, if that's the case, then the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 but with a p-tolyl group on the CH2, making CH2(p-tolyl)=CH-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, that's not possible because it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me think again.

Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, I think I'm getting mixed up. Another approach: the acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2=C-CO-OCH3, with the p-tolyl attached to the CH2 group. So the double bond
