Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about which molecule has C3h symmetry. The options are four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone, and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. The options are labeled A to D.

Hmm, C3h symmetry. I remember that C3h is a type of molecular symmetry. Let me think about what that implies. Oh wait, point group symmetries. C3h would mean that the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a mirror plane (σh) that includes the axis. Or wait, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, C3h can sometimes refer to a combination of a C3 rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. I'm a bit fuzzy on that, but perhaps I should recall some examples.

Looking at the options, I need to determine which molecule has that symmetry. Let's go through each option.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. That's a mouthful. I'm thinking it's a tricyclic compound with multiple benzene rings attached. Maybe like a larger aromatic system. If it's a tricyclic system, perhaps it has a higher degree of symmetry. Triphenylene comes to mind, which has a certain symmetry. Wait, triphenylene is symmetric, but I'm not sure about the exact symmetry type here. Alternatively, if the molecule has threefold symmetry, maybe C3 is present. But what about the mirror planes?

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Benzo with substituents on the furan rings. I'm not as familiar with this structure, but perhaps it's a compound with two benzene rings connected to a trifuran system. If the substituents are symmetrically placed, maybe it has a certain symmetry. But I'm not sure if it's C3h.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. That's a borate ester with three isopropyl groups attached to boron. So, the structure would be B with three isopropyl groups. Isopropyl groups are -CH(CH3)2, so each is a symmetrical substituent. Now, the boron is in the center with three identical groups. But wait, does that give C3 symmetry? Because each substituent is same, so if you rotate 120 degrees, they should look the same. So the molecule should have a C3 axis. But what about the mirror planes? Since each isopropyl group is symmetric, perhaps there are mirror planes that include the C3 axis. So maybe the symmetry is higher than just C3. Alternatively, could it be Td or something else? Wait, no. Let me think again. The molecule is trigonal planar around boron, but each substituent is an isopropyl group. So when you rotate 120 degrees, the groups are the same. But for C3h, we need a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. If the molecule is planar, maybe the mirror plane exists. But wait, the isopropyl groups are in a trigonal planar arrangement, so maybe the molecule is flat. So the rotation would work, and a mirror plane would also be present. That would fit C3h. But I'm not entirely sure because I might be confusing C3v or other symmetries.

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound, a norbornane derivative. I remember that quinuclidine has a seven-membered ring with two bridgeheads. I think its structure is more like a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. Now, what's the symmetry here? If I recall correctly, quinuclidine has a C2 axis because you can rotate it 180 degrees and it looks the same. Wait, or is it C3? Hmm, no, quinuclidine's structure has a bridge, so maybe the symmetry is lower. Alternatively, perhaps it has a plane of symmetry. But I'm not certain about the exact symmetry. I think quinuclidine has a center of inversion, so maybe its symmetry is Ci. But I'm not sure about C3h.

Wait, let me think again. C3h symmetry requires a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and have a mirror plane perpendicular to the rotation axis.

Looking at the options again:

Triisopropyl borate has three identical substituents around B. So, if you rotate 120 degrees, each group takes the position of the next. That suggests a C3 axis. For C3h, there should be a horizontal mirror plane (like through the B atom and the middle of substituents). So if the molecule is planar, that could work. Triisopropyl borate is planar, right? Because each isopropyl group is in a trigonal planar geometry around B. So in that case, there would be a mirror plane. So C3h symmetry would fit.

What about the others? Benzo... I'm not sure. Triphenylene has a certain symmetry but it's more of a D3h symmetry perhaps? Or maybe C2v? Not quite. Quinuclidine's symmetry is probably lower than C3h. The other option, A, might be a more complex system. Let me think about the substituents. If it's triphenyleno attached to a trifuran, perhaps the substituents are arranged symmetrically, but I'm not sure if the symmetry is exactly C3h.

Wait, another thought. Triphenylborate (C) is a trigonal planar molecule with three isopropyl groups. So, the structure is symmetric with a C3 axis. But does it have a mirror plane? Yes, because if you imagine a mirror plane through the boron and each pair of substituents, like each substituent is in a plane that's a mirror image. So that would make C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, sometimes people confuse C3v and C3h. C3v has a vertical mirror plane, while C3h has a horizontal one. So, if the molecule's C3 axis is perpendicular to the mirror plane, that's C3v. But if the mirror plane is parallel to the C3 axis, it's C3h. Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me get the definitions straight.

In molecular symmetry, C3h is a point group that includes a three-fold rotation (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). The horizontal mirror plane is perpendicular to the C3 axis. So, for a molecule to have C3h symmetry, it must have a three-fold rotation axis and a mirror plane that is horizontal (i.e., perpendicular to the rotation axis).

Triisopropyl borate is planar. So, the B atom is in the center, and the three isopropyl groups are in a plane around it. The C3 axis would be perpendicular to the plane. Now, a horizontal mirror plane would be parallel to the plane of the substituents. Wait, no. The mirror plane in C3h is horizontal, which is perpendicular to the C3 axis. So, if the C3 axis is perpendicular to the mirror plane.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the geometry. Let me visualize. If the molecule is planar, the C3 axis is perpendicular to the plane (like a vertical axis), and the horizontal mirror plane would be the plane itself. So, the mirror plane would include the B atom and the substituents. So, after a reflection, the molecule would look the same.

So, triisopropyl borate would have a C3 axis (rotation) and a horizontal mirror plane (the plane of the molecule). So yes, it should have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but I also remember that if a molecule is planar and has three identical substituents arranged symmetrically, like in a trigonal planar geometry, it can have D3h symmetry. But D3h is a higher symmetry than C3h. So I'm confused now.

Wait, D3h includes a C3 axis, three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3, and a horizontal mirror plane. So, if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it's more than just C3h. So, triisopropyl borate: does it have a three-fold rotation and mirror planes that are perpendicular to the C3 axis?

If the molecule is planar, and the C3 axis is perpendicular (so the rotation is out of the plane), then each substituent is in the plane. So, any mirror plane that includes the C3 axis (like a vertical mirror plane) would also be a symmetry. So, the molecule would have multiple mirror planes.

Wait, maybe triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry, which includes C3h. So, any molecule with D3h would automatically have C3h. But the question is asking which has C3h symmetry. So, if a molecule has a higher symmetry (like D3h), it would still have the C3h element.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the presence of C3h as the highest symmetry. So, which of the molecules has exactly C3h and no higher symmetry.

Wait, but in any case, which option is correct.

Let me go back to the options. The options are A, B, C, D. The correct answer is D, C, or A?

Wait, another approach: looking for examples. Quinuclidine has a structure where the molecule is similar to norbornane. Its symmetry is Ci, because it has an inversion center. So, that's not C3h.

Triisopropyl borate: trigonal planar, with three identical groups. So, perhaps each substituent is in the plane, and the molecule has a C3 axis. If the molecule lies in a plane, then a horizontal mirror plane (the same plane) would be present. So, the combination would be C3h.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, another thought: the molecule might have a C3 axis but not a mirror plane. So, only C3.

Wait, to have C3h symmetry, the molecule must have a three-fold rotation and a mirror plane that's horizontal (perpendicular to the C3 axis). If the molecule is in a plane, then the mirror plane is that same plane. So, yes, it would have a mirror plane, so C3h.

So, triisopropyl borate (option C) should have C3h symmetry.

But wait, then why is option A an option? Maybe I need to think again.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. The name suggests a trifuran (three fused furan rings) with triphenylene substituents. Triphenylene is a symmetric molecule, but how does that affect the symmetry of the larger molecule?

If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps the entire molecule has a higher symmetry. For example, if the triphenylene rings are placed in a way that the molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has D3h symmetry.

But I'm not very familiar with that structure. Without a clear image, it's hard to say. But if triisopropyl borate (option C) has C3h symmetry, then perhaps that's the correct answer. Or, perhaps another option has a higher symmetry.

Wait, another thought. Benzo... option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. That's a compound with a benzo ring fused to a trifuran. The substituents are in positions that might not provide three-fold symmetry. Maybe it's more of a C2 symmetry or something lower.

So, probably, triisopropyl borate (option C) is the correct answer.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h symmetry**, we analyze the options based on their structures and symmetry properties. **C₃h symmetry** requires the presence of a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) that is perpendicular to the C₃ axis.

### Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule consists of a trifuran system with triphenylene substituents. While triphenylene itself is symmetric, the overall structure of this molecule is complex and likely has a higher symmetry, such as **D₃h**, due to the arrangement of the substituents. Since the question asks specifically for **C₃h symmetry**, this option is unlikely to be correct.

### Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule features a benzo ring fused to a trifuran system. The substituents are arranged in a way that does not provide three-fold rotational symmetry (C₃). Instead, the molecule likely has lower symmetry, such as **C₂h** or **C₂v**. Therefore, it does not exhibit **C₃h symmetry**.

### Option C: triisopropyl borate  
This molecule has a boron atom at the center, surrounded by three identical isopropyl groups in a trigonal planar geometry. The molecule has a **C₃ axis** due to the three-fold rotational symmetry. Additionally, the molecule lies in a plane, which serves as a **horizontal mirror plane (σₕ)**. Since both the C₃ axis and the σₕ plane are present, the molecule exhibits **C₃h symmetry**. This makes it a strong candidate for the correct answer.

### Option D: quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound with a seven-membered ring. Its symmetry is described as **Ci** (inversion symmetry), as it has a center of inversion but no three-fold rotation axis (C₃). Therefore, it does not exhibit **C₃h symmetry**.

### Conclusion  
Among the options, **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) is the only molecule that satisfies the criteria for **C₃h symmetry**, as it has both a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. 

Answer: C
