Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. It's about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but I'll try to think this through.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus is. Li with 3 neutrons—so lithium has an atomic number of 3. Wait, lithium has an atomic number of 3, which means it has 3 protons. If there are 3 neutrons, the isotope is Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number of 6.

Next, the problem is about relativistic speeds. The speed given is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. I remember that at such high speeds, relativistic effects become significant. So I can't use classical mechanics here; I need to use the equations from special relativity.

The energy required for a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the total energy formula: E = gamma * m * c². Gamma (γ) is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity v of the particle. The formula for gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Calculate gamma for v = 0.96c.
2. Find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.
3. Multiply gamma by the rest mass energy to get the total energy E.

Wait, but the rest mass energy of the nucleus is m*c². So I need the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a mass of approximately 1.007276 GeV/c² for protons and 1.0086649 GeV/c² for neutrons, but wait, actually, the exact mass of the nucleus is a bit more because of binding energy and other factors. Alternatively, each nucleon is about 1 GeV/c², but maybe I should be more precise.

Alternatively, I can use the approximate mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Since it's 6 nucleons, each roughly around 1 GeV/c², but that's a rough estimate. However, a more accurate approach would be to calculate the mass based on the number of protons and neutrons, considering their individual masses and binding energy. Hmm, but maybe the problem expects me to use the mass number and approximate the mass.

Wait, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is taken as approximately equal to the mass number multiplied by the mass of a proton? Or wait, perhaps the exact mass isn't needed, because the problem might give us a standard approach.

Let me think. The nucleus is Li-6. The mass should be the sum of the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons, but wait, that's not exactly correct because the actual mass is less due to the binding energy (mass defect). But calculating the exact mass would require more precise data. Alternatively, maybe in this problem, they approximate the mass of the nucleus as just the number of nucleons times the mass of a proton or neutron.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is just 6 times the mass of a nucleon. Let's clarify: a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². But wait, the exact values are approximately 938.272 MeV for the proton and 939.565 MeV for the neutron. So maybe the Li-6 nucleus has a mass of (3 * proton mass) + (3 * neutron mass), but that's without considering binding energy. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the mass given by the periodic table, which accounts for the mass defect.

Wait, but the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.017569328 atomic mass units (u). Since 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c², that converts to about 6.017569328 * 931.5 MeV ≈ around 5618.3 MeV, which is 5.6183 GeV.

Wait, let me double-check: 6.017569328 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.017569328 * 931.5 ≈ let me compute that.

6 * 931.5 = 5589, and 0.017569328 * 931.5 ≈ 16.35. So total around 5589 + 16.35 ≈ 5605.35 MeV, which is about 5.605 GeV.

But wait, the exact value would matter for precise calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to approximate the mass as 6 * 938 MeV (proton mass). Let's see: 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV = 5.628 GeV. But the actual mass is a bit less than 6 * (proton + neutron) because of binding energy. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe for this problem, I can use the exact mass of Li-6. Let me check. The mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.017569328 u.

So, converting to GeV: 6.017569328 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.017569328 * 931.5 MeV.

Let me compute that:

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.017569328 * 931.5 ≈ let's compute 0.017569328 * 900 = 15.812, and 0.017569328 * 31.5 ≈ ~0.554. So total ≈ 15.812 + 0.554 ≈ 16.366. So total is 5589 + 16.366 ≈ 5605.366 MeV, which is 5.605366 GeV.

Wait, but I've seen that the mass of Li-6 is approximately 5.605 GeV/c². So m ≈5.605 GeV/c².

So now, the gamma factor at v=0.96c.

The formula for gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute that.

v = 0.96c, so v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

Wait, is that right? Let me compute it more accurately.

0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784: Let me compute sqrt(0.0784). I know that 0.28^2 is 0.0784, so yes, sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

So now, the total energy E is gamma * m c².

But wait, m is 5.605 GeV/c², so m c² is 5.605 GeV. So E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 * 5.605 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.5714 * 5.605.

Breaking it down:

3.5 * 5.605 = 19.6175.

0.0714 *5.605 ≈ 0.0714 *5 = 0.357, 0.0714 *0.605≈0.0432. So total ≈ 0.357 + 0.0432= 0.4002.

So total E ≈ 19.6175 + 0.4002 ≈ 20.0177 GeV.

Wait, but let me do a more precise multiplication.

3.57142857 *5.605.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.605.

Multiply 3.57142857 by 5: 17.85714285.

Multiply 3.57142857 by 0.605: 3.57142857 *0.6 = 2.14285714, 3.57142857 *0.005=0.017857143. So total 2.14285714 + 0.017857143 = 2.16071428.

Adding together: 17.85714285 + 2.16071428 = 20.01785713 GeV.

So approximately 20.0179 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV.

Hmm, our calculation gives about 20.0179 GeV, which is closest to option C (20.132 GeV), but a bit lower. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus?

Wait, let me double-check the mass of Li-6. Maybe I should look it up more accurately. The exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.017569328 u. So 6.017569328 * 931.5 MeV/u = ?

Compute 6 * 931.5 = 5589.

0.017569328 *931.5 = let's compute that.

0.01 *931.5 =9.315,

0.007 *931.5=6.5205,

0.000569328 *931.5 ≈0.5297.

Adding: 9.315 +6.5205=15.8355 +0.5297=16.3652.

So total is 5589 +16.3652=5605.3652 MeV →5.605365 GeV.

So that's correct. So the mass is 5.605365 GeV/c².

Gamma was 3.57142857.

So E = 3.57142857 *5.605365 GeV.

Let me compute that more accurately.

3.57142857 *5.605365.

I can compute this as:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285

3.57142857 *0.605365.

Wait, let's break it down:

0.605365 = 0.6 + 0.005365.

So:

3.57142857 * 0.6 = 2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.005365 = 0.019165 approx.

So total for 0.605365 is 2.142857142 + 0.019165 ≈ 2.162022.

So adding to 17.85714285: 17.85714285 +2.162022 =20.01916485 GeV.

So about 20.0192 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Option D is 21.419, which is higher still. So perhaps my approach is missing something.

Wait a second, perhaps I need to consider that the rest mass energy is m c², but maybe when the nucleus is moving, the kinetic energy is what's being considered. Wait, wait, the question says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)", which I think refers to the total energy, but sometimes colliders measure kinetic energy. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no, wait, in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, it usually refers to the total energy (gamma * m c²), not just the kinetic energy. But I should double-check this.

The formula E = gamma * m c^2 gives the total energy, which includes rest mass energy. So the question is, does the RHIC energy include the rest mass, or is it the kinetic energy?

Wait, the question says: "What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?"

Hmm, that suggests that the energy given is the total energy. Because the speed is given, and the energy would relate to the gamma factor.

But perhaps I should make sure. Another approach: sometimes, the kinetic energy K is given by (gamma -1) m c². But the question doesn't specify, so I think it's expecting the total energy.

Wait, the options don't include 20 GeV, but option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close to my calculation of 20.019 GeV. So perhaps more precise calculation would bring it closer.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma with more precision. Let me redo the gamma calculation.

v = 0.96c → v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28, exactly, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714...

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the mass is more precise? Let's check.

Wait, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.017569328 u. So in GeV:

6.017569328 u * 931.5 MeV/u = ?

Let me compute this:

6 *931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.017569328 * 931.5 = let's calculate this precisely.

0.017569328 * 931.5 = ?

Let me compute 931.5 * 0.01 =9.315.

931.5
