--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again and see if I can figure it out.

The question says: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. A precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Then, the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analogs. We need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes present.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. 

First, let's think about what each part tells us.

1. Substance X reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W, precipitate G, and maybe some other products. The gas W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. So, for a molecule, the number of protons (which is the atomic number) equals the number of neutrons. So, the molecule's formula would have a molecular weight that's twice the atomic number, but wait, maybe not exactly, because for a molecule made of multiple atoms, each with the same protons and neutrons, but perhaps it's a diatomic molecule or something else.

2. When G is heated, it releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K. Let me think about what that temperature translates to in Celsius. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius (since 273 K is 0°C, so 277 is 4°C). So, B is a solid at 0°C but melts a bit higher. Wait, or maybe I should think about common substances. Maybe B is something like ice? No, because ice melts at 0°C (273 K). Wait, 277 K is 4°C, so maybe something else. Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound.

Wait, another approach: maybe B is a metal. Let me think about metals that melt around that temperature. For example, iron melts at around 1500°C, which is way higher. Aluminum is about 660°C. Maybe not a metal. How about something like camphor? Or perhaps a substance like paraffin wax? Wait, but paraffin has a lower melting point, like around 30°C. Hmm, wait, 277 K is 4°C, so maybe something like ammonium nitrate? Or perhaps it's a polymer, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should come back to this point.

3. The product of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So, when X reacts with a keto acid, the product has two oxygen atoms. Maybe X is a base, like an amine or something else that can deprotonate a keto acid. Wait, and the product would be something like a salt, perhaps. Or maybe an ester, but I'm not certain.

4. X is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its analogs are used as reagents. One common such reagent is something like sodium hydride (NaH), which is used as a strong base. Or perhaps it's a Grignard reagent, but Grignards are more reactive metals. Alternatively, maybe it's something like a lithium compound. Wait, but let's think about isotopes. The question says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So, X has an element with a heavy isotope present.

Wait, sodium hydride is NaH. Sodium has a common isotope, like Na-23, but if X has a heavier isotope, perhaps it's something like deuterium? Or maybe a heavier element's isotope.

Wait, another thought: if X is a hydride, like LiH or NaH or something else, but those are ionic. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal hydride. But let me think about the reaction with liquid Y.

So, when X reacts with Y, gas W is released. Let's think about metal hydrides reacting with something. For example, sodium hydride (NaH) reacts with water (H2O) to produce hydrogen gas (H2). Because NaH + H2O → NaOH + H2↑. So, in this case, Y could be water. Then, W would be H2.

Wait, but H2's molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (each H has 1 proton and 1 neutron, but if it's deuterium, each would have 1 proton and 1 neutron? Wait no, wait. Hydrogen has isotopes: protium (H, 1 proton, 0 neutrons), deuterium (D, 1 proton, 1 neutron), tritium (1 proton, 2 neutrons). So H2 would have each H as protium, so each has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So the molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. But the problem states that W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So if W is H2, that doesn't fit because neutrons would be 0 and protons 2. So that can't be right.

Hmm, so maybe W isn't H2. Let's think of another gas. What about ammonia (NH3)? No, because that's a liquid or gas but not something formed in such a reaction. Or maybe CO2? Wait, but CO2 has 22 protons (C has 6, each O has 8; 6 + 2*8=22) and 22 neutrons? Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think: each CO2 molecule has one C (6 protons, 6 neutrons in the most common isotope C-12) and two O (each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons if it's O-16). So total protons would be 6 + 2*8 = 22, and neutrons would be 6 (from C) + 2*8 (from O) = 22. So yes, CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So the molecule would satisfy the condition. So if W is CO2, that meets the condition.

But wait, how would that happen? Let's think about the reaction. If X is a metal carbonate reacting with something to release CO2, but that's not a violent reaction. Alternatively, maybe a carbonate reacting with an acid.

Wait, but if X is a metal hydride, and Y is a carbonate, perhaps. Or perhaps Y is an acid. Let me think again.

Wait, another option: W could be CH4. Let's see, CH4 has 6 (C has 6 protons) + 4 (from H) = 10 protons. Neutrons: C has 6 neutrons (if C-12), each H has 0. So total neutrons: 6. So 10 protons and 6 neutrons. Doesn't match. So not CH4.

Wait another possibility: maybe W is N2? Nitrogen gas. Each N atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (if N-14). So each N has 7p and 7n. So N2 would have 14p and 14n. So total p = 14, n =14. So that fits. So W is N2. How could that be formed?

Wait, when X reacts with Y to release N2. One reaction that produces N2 is the decomposition of sodium azide (NaN3) upon heating, but that may not fit here. Alternatively, maybe X is a nitride reacting with an acid. Wait, for example, sodium nitride (Na3N) reacting with H2O would produce NH3 and NaOH. But that's not N2.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid, and X is a nitride. Let's say X is Na3N (sodium nitride), and Y is H2O. Then, reaction would be Na3N + H2O → NaOH + NH3↑. But that doesn't produce N2.

Alternatively, maybe X is something else. Let's think about another angle.

Wait, the problem states that W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So, for a molecule, total protons = total neutrons.

Let me think of other possible gases. What about O2? O2 has 16 protons (each O is 8) → 16 × 2 = 16? Wait, no. O2 molecule has 2 O atoms. Each O has 8 protons, so 16 in total. Neutrons: each O-16 has 8 neutrons, so 2 × 8 = 16. So total protons and neutrons would each be 16. So O2 would fit. So W could be O2.

How would that happen? Maybe X is a peroxide reacting with something. Alternatively, perhaps a decomposition reaction. For example, if X is a superoxide, perhaps when it reacts with Y, O2 is released. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, but let's consider another approach. The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So, perhaps G is a carbonate, which upon heating decomposes into CO2 and B. Let me think: if G is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), heating it would produce Na2O and CO2. But that's not correct because sodium carbonate doesn't decompose on heating under normal conditions. Alternatively, perhaps G is a bicarbonate, like sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), which upon heating decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. But then B would be Na2CO3, which isn't a solid that's liquid around 4°C. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another idea: if G is a metal sulfide, and when heated, it decomposes to produce B as the metal and SO2 or something, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, let's think about the melting point of B being around 4°C. That's about 39°F. Hmm, what substances have a melting point near that? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? No, I think its melting point is around 334 K (60°C). Alternatively, maybe something like camphor, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps B is water ice. Wait, but ice melts at 0°C (273 K), which is 4 K lower than 277 K. So maybe B is a different compound with a melting point just a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a salt that's just starting to melt around that temperature. For example, some salts have eutectic points around that. But I'm not very certain.

Wait, let me think about the reaction between X and Y. If X is NaH (sodium hydride) and Y is water, then the reaction would produce sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrogen gas (H2). But earlier we saw that H2 doesn't have equal protons and neutrons in the molecule. So that's a problem. Because H2 would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons (assuming protium), so it doesn't fit the condition.

Alternatively, if X is a heavier isotope of hydrogen, like deuterium. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: what if Y is an alcohol, like ethanol, and X is something that reacts with it, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the product of a certain keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. So, the reaction between X and a keto acid produces a compound with two O atoms. Let's think about possible reactions. For example, if X is a base like NaH, and the keto acid is something like acetone (but wait, acetone is not a carboxylic acid, it's a ketone). Alternatively, maybe X is acting as a reducing agent.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal hydride. For example, when a metal hydride reacts with a carboxylic acid, it can deprotonate it. So, for instance, sodium hydride (NaH) would react with a carboxylic acid to form the sodium salt of the carboxylic acid and H2 gas. But in that case, the product would be a carboxylate, which has more oxygen atoms. Hmm, but the product has two oxygen atoms. Wait, maybe the reaction is different.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal like Li, which reacts with a keto acid (like a ketone) to form an alcohol, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the product has two oxygen atoms because it's an ester or something else. But I'm not sure.

Let me try to think of another angle. Let's consider the elements in X. Since X incorporates a heavier isotope, perhaps one of its elements has a heavy isotope. For example, sodium's common isotope is Na-23, but if it's a heavier isotope, like Na-25 or Na-24? Or perhaps it's deuterium.

Wait, but the problem says that X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and its analog is used as a reagent. NaH is used as a strong base in organic reactions. So, X could be NaH.

Wait, if X is NaH, then let's see:

Reaction with Y (liquid) produces gas W. So, when NaH reacts with water (Y is H2O), it produces H2 gas. But as we saw, H2 doesn't fit the condition. So maybe Y is not water.

Alternatively, Y could be another liquid, like an alcohol or an acid.

Wait, another possibility: Y is a carbonate solution. So, NaH reacts with, say, a carbonate. But I'm not sure about the products.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid, like H2SO4, but that's a strong acid and would react violently with NaH.

Wait, perhaps Y is a liquid with acidic properties. So, when NaH reacts with, say, H2SO4, it would produce H2 gas and Na2SO4. Then, W would be H2 again, which doesn't fit the condition.

Alternatively, maybe Y is an alcohol, and X is a metal hydride. For example, NaH reacting with ethanol (Y is C2H5OH) would produce NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and H2 gas. Again, H2 doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a compound that when reacts with X releases a different gas. Let's think of another gas that meets the condition. For example, CO. Let's see, CO has 1 C (6 protons) and 1 O (8 protons), so total protons: 6 +8 =14. Neutrons: C has 6 (if C-12), O has 8 (if O-16). So total neutrons: 6 +8=14. So CO would fit. So W is CO.

How is CO produced? Maybe from the thermal decomposition of a metal carbide. For example, CaC2 reacts with water to produce C2H2 and CaO, but that's not CO. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal carbide, like SiC. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps W is NO. Let's calculate. N has 7 protons, O has 8, so NO has 15 protons. Neutrons: N-14 has 7, O-16 has 8, so total neutrons: 7 +8=15. So NO has 15 protons and 15 neutrons. So that fits. So W could be NO.

But how would NO be produced? Maybe from a reaction involving a nitride. For example, sodium nitride (Na3N) reacting with an acid to produce NO.

Alternatively, perhaps X is sodium azide (NaN3), and when it reacts with an acid, it produces N2 gas, but that doesn't fit because N2's protons and neutrons would be 14 each.

Wait, maybe Y is a nitric acid. Then, X could be a metal, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces NH3. Let's see, NH3 has 14 (N) +3 (H) =17 protons, and if N is 14 (7 neutrons) and H is 0, total neutrons would be 7. So 17 protons and 7 neutrons. Doesn't fit. So that's not it.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think of another approach.

The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. B's melting point is around 277 K (4°C). What could B be? Maybe B is a salt that is solid at lower temperatures but starts to melt around that point. Alternatively, maybe B is something like paraffin wax, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another possibility: B is a type of camphor. Camphor has a melting point around 177°C, which is way higher. So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a type of fat or oil, which can be solid at lower temperatures. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps B is a metal. Let's think about metals and their melting points. For example, mercury has a melting point of about 234 K (-39°C), which is lower than 277 K. Lead melts at 327 K (54°C). So nothing around 277 K.

Alternatively, maybe B is a polymer, but I can't think of any with a melting point near 4°C.

Hmm, perhaps B is something like ammonium nitrate, which can form a solid solution with water. But not sure.

Wait, perhaps B is a type of salt that has a eutectic point around 4°C. For example, sodium chloride and water form a solution that freezes at a lower temperature, but that's about the freezing point, not the melting point.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid with a low melting point. Wait, maybe it's a type of wax, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the precipitate G. If G is a carbonate, when heated, it would decompose to produce CO2 and a metal oxide. But the metal oxide (like Na2O) would not be a gas. Alternatively, if G is a bicarbonate, heating it produces CO2, H2O, and a metal carbonate. But I'm not sure how that relates to B.

Wait, maybe G is a sulfide. When heated, it could decompose into a metal and SO2. But again, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide. When heated, it could decompose into a metal oxide and water. For example, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) doesn't decompose upon heating unless in the presence of something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps G is a nitride. Heating it could produce the corresponding metal and N2. But that brings me back to W being N2, which I'm not sure about.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to summarize what I know so far.

- W is a gas with equal protons and neutrons in its molecule. Possible candidates are O2, CO2, N2, NO, etc.

- X is a reagent in organic chemistry, possibly a metal hydride like NaH.

- The reaction between X and Y produces W, precipitate G, and maybe something else.

- When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K (4°C).

- The product of X and a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms.

Let me think about the product of X and a keto acid. Suppose X is NaH, and the keto acid is something like acetic acid (CH3COOH). NaH would deprotonate it, producing CH3COO^- Na^+ and H2 gas. The product, sodium acetate, has more oxygen atoms, but the question says the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Unless the keto acid is something with fewer oxygens. Wait, a keto acid could be something like ketoglutaric acid, but that has more O's.

Wait, another possibility: the product could be an alcohol. If X is a metal like Li, reacting with a keto acid (like cyclohexanone) to form an alcohol. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a reducing agent, and when it reacts with a keto acid, it forms something else with two O atoms. Maybe it's a dehydration reaction, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So, perhaps it's an ester? Because esters have the formula R-O-CO-R'. But that would have more than two O's in some cases.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone, which has one O. No, the product has two O's. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is an ether? But ethers have one O. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a dialkyl ether, but that's not likely. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonate, but that's getting too speculative.

I'm not making much progress on this front. Let me go back to the precipitate G and product B.

If B has a melting point near 4°C, perhaps B is a type of ice or a substance that is solid at that temperature. Wait, maybe B is a type of crystalline material, like a hydrate. For example, calcium chloride hexahydrate has a melting point around 2°C. Oh wait, that's close. So, perhaps B is calcium chloride hexahydrate, which has a melting point around 2°C, which is close to 277 K (4°C). So, if B is CaCl2·6H2O, then when G is heated, it produces B.

Wait, but how would G relate to B? Maybe G is a hydrate that, upon heating, loses some water and becomes B. Or perhaps when G is heated, it decomposes into B and something else.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide that, upon heating, loses water to become an oxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but if B is CaCl2·6H2O, then it would melt around 2°C. So, perhaps G is a different hydrate that, when heated, becomes B.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a carbonate, and upon heating, it decomposes into B and CO2.

Wait, if G is sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3·10H2O), which has a melting point higher than 277 K, but when heated, it loses water and becomes anhydrous sodium carbonate, which doesn't directly fit with B.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress here. Let me try another approach.

The product of X and a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. So, maybe it's a compound like ethylene oxide (but that's not formed from a keto acid and a reagent like X). Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester or something else. Alternatively, maybe the product is an alcohol with two oxygen atoms, but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. But a ketone has one O. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diketone, but that has two O's as well.

Wait, perhaps X is a reducing agent, and when it reacts with a keto acid, it converts it into an alcohol. For example, sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a common reducing agent that can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. So, if the keto acid is a ketone, then X could be NaBH4. But wait, the product would be an alcohol, which has one O. Hmm, but the question says it has two O atoms. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a hemiacetal or something else, but that's a stretch.

Wait, another thought: if X is a reagent like DIBAL-H (Diisobutylaluminum hydride), which is used to reduce esters to alcohols. But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an acetal, which has two oxygen atoms. Acetals are formed from ketones and alcohols, but I'm not sure how X would fit into that.

Wait, perhaps X is a catalyst in a reaction that forms an acetal. But the question says that X reacts with the keto acid, so it's more of a reactant than a catalyst.

This is getting really complicated. Let me try to think about the elements in X again. The problem asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So, for X, there are two elements, and we're to sum their lightest and heaviest isotopes.

If X is NaH, then the elements are Na and H. The lightest isotope of Na is Na-23 (mass 23), but wait, no, the lightest is Na-23? Wait, no, Na has isotopes like Na-22, Na-23, and Na-24. Wait, Na-23 is the most abundant. H has isotopes like H-1 (protium) and H-2 (deuterium). So, the lightest elements would be Na (23) and H (1). The heaviest would be Na (23) and H (2) if any deuterium is present. Wait, but the problem says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So, X has a heavier isotope than the lightest possible. So for H, the heavier isotopes are D (mass 2) and T (mass 3). So, if X is NaH and has D instead of H, then the isotopes would be Na-23 and H-2 (deuterium).

So, the lightest elements would be Na (23) and H (1), their atomic masses sum to 24. The heaviest would be Na (23) and H (2), sum to 25. So the cumulative atomic masses would be 24 (lightest) and 25 (heaviest). So the total would be 24 + 25 = 49? But wait, the question says "cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X." So, for each element, take the lightest and heaviest isotopes and sum them?

Wait, the question says: "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Wait, perhaps for each element, sum all the lighter isotopes and all the heavier isotopes. But I'm a bit confused by the wording.

Wait, the wording says: "the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Wait, maybe for each element in X, we take the lightest isotope and the heaviest isotope, sum their masses, and add them together.

In the case of X = NaH, the elements are Na and H.

For Na, the lightest isotope is Na-23? Wait, no. Wait, the lightest isotope of Na is actually Na-22, which has a mass of 22. But I think the most common is Na-23. Wait, isotopes of sodium include Na-22 (mass 22), Na-23 (mass 23), and Na-24 (mass 24). So the lightest is Na-22 (mass 22), the heaviest is Na-24 (mass 24). For H, the lightest is H-1 (mass 1), and the heaviest is H-3 (mass 3). But in X, if it's NaH, perhaps the H is in the form of H-2 (deuterium, mass 2), as X incorporates a heavier isotope.

So for Na: lightest is 22, heaviest is 24.

For H: lightest is 1, heaviest is 2 (assuming X has D).

So summing the lightest for both: 22 (Na) + 1 (H) = 23.

Summing the heaviest for both: 24 (Na) + 2 (H) = 26.

Wait, but the options don't include 23 or 26. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the isotopes.

Wait, perhaps for Na, the lightest isotope is Na-23 (mass 23), and the heaviest is Na-25 (mass 25) or Na-24 (mass 24). Wait, I'm not sure about the natural isotopes of sodium. Let me check: natural sodium is about 100% Na-23, with small amounts of Na-24 (about 0.01%) and Na-25 (trace). So the lightest is Na-23 (mass 23), and the heaviest is Na-25 (mass 25). Wait, but if X has a heavier isotope of one of its elements, perhaps Na-25 is present. So, for X, the Na might be in the form of Na-25.

So, for Na, lightest is 23, heaviest is 25. H's lightest is 1, heaviest is 2 (deuterium).

So the cumulative for lightest elements: 23 (Na) + 1 (H) =24.

For heaviest: 25 (Na) + 2 (H) =27.

But the options don't have 24 or 27. So perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, maybe X isn't NaH. Let's think of another possibility.

If X is LiH (lithium hydride), then the elements are Li and H.

Li has isotopes: Li-6 (mass 6) and Li-7 (mass 7). The lightest is Li-6, heaviest is Li-7.

H's lightest is 1, heaviest is 2 (deuterium).

So cumulative lightest: 6 +1=7. Heaviest:7 +2=9. Again, not matching options.

Hmm, perhaps X is something else. Let me think about the possible reactions again.

Wait, another possibility: X is a peroxide, like NaOCl (sodium hypochlorite), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate, but that seems less likely.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G. If G is a carbonate, then when heated, it might not release B as a liquid. Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide that, when heated, becomes an oxide and releases water as vapor. But B is a solid with a melting point around 4°C.

Wait, another thought: if B is a type of ice, but then it would melt at 0°C, not 4°C.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a type of salt that is liquid at 4°C. Wait, sodium chloride has a melting point of about 800°C, so that's too high.

Wait, perhaps B is a type of eutectic mixture. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let's try to think of the options. The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Wait, perhaps the cumulative atomic masses are for two elements, each contributing their lightest and heaviest isotopes.

So, for two elements, the lightest would be, say, 1 and 12 (H and C), sum to 13. The heaviest might be 2 and 14 (D and C-14), sum to 16. But that's not matching the options.

Wait, another possibility: If X is NaOH, but that's a different story.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a heavier metal's hydride, like CaH2. Let's see:

CaH2 reacts with H2O to produce Ca(OH)2 and H2 gas. But H2 doesn't fit W's condition.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal carbide, like SiC, which when reacted with water produces CH4 and SiO2. But CH4 has 10 protons and 14 neutrons, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of the reaction in terms of the answer options.

Looking at the options, the possible sums are 25,29,31,35.

If the lightest and heaviest elements in X are H and O, perhaps. Or maybe C and O.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the product of X and a keto acid having two oxygen atoms. So, perhaps the product is a carbonyl compound. For example, X could be a reducing agent that reduces a keto acid to a ketone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a base that deprotonates the keto acid, producing a salt. For example, if the keto acid is formic acid (HCOOH), then X (like NaH) would deprotonate it to form NaCOO^- and H2. The product (sodium formate) has more than two O's, but the question says it has two. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a hemiacetal or acetal, which has two O's. For that, X might be something like H2SO4 acting as a catalyst, but that's not a reagent used in the same way as NaH.

I'm really stuck here. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the information I have.

So, the possible choices for the cumulative atomic masses are 25, 29, 31,35.

If X is NaH, and it contains Na and H, and if it incorporates a heavier isotope of H (like D), then the lightest isotopes would be Na (23) and H (1), sum 24. The heaviest would be Na (25, if it's a heavier isotope) and H (2), sum 27. But 24 and 27 aren't options, so perhaps X is a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains C and O. For example, if X is CO2, but that seems unlikely as a reagent.

Wait, another possibility: X is a carbonate, but that doesn't fit as a reagent in organic chemistry.

Wait, another angle: maybe the product of X and the keto acid is an ester. For example, if X is a metal, like Li, and the keto acid is a carboxylic acid, then the product would be the carboxylate salt, which has more O's. Hmm, but that doesn't fit the two O's condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ether. But again, not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a borohydride, like NaBH4. Then, when it reacts with a carboxylic acid, it produces an alcohol, but that has one O. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an acetal, which has two O's. So, maybe X is a reagent like H2SO4, but that's not a constituent of the acetal.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

If the cumulative atomic masses are 25, that could be 1 (H) + 24 (Mg) = 25. So, perhaps the lightest and heaviest are H and Mg.

Alternatively, 12 (C) +13 (N) =25. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, 23 (Na) + 2 (H) =25. So, that would make sense if X contains Na and H, with Na-23 and H-2. So the lightest would be Na-23 (23) and H-1 (1), summing to 24. The heaviest would be Na-23 (23) and H-2 (2), summing to 25. So the cumulative would be 24 (lightest) and 25 (heaviest). But the question asks for the cumulative of both the lightest and heaviest. So perhaps it's 24 + 25 =49, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. It says, "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X." So for each element in X, you take the lightest isotope and the heaviest isotope, sum them, and then add those two sums together.

Wait, let me clarify: for each element in X, you find the lightest isotope and the heaviest isotope. Then, for each element, sum lightest and heaviest. Then, add all those sums for all elements in X.

Wait, but if X has two elements, like Na and H, then for each element, sum lightest and heaviest, then add those two sums.

For Na: lightest is Na-22 (22), heaviest is Na-25 (25). So 22+25=47.

For H: lightest is H-1 (1), heaviest is H-3 (3). So 1+3=4.

Total sum: 47 +4=51. Not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps X only has two atoms, each of different elements, and for each element, sum their lightest and heaviest isotopes, then add those two sums.

Wait, for example, if X is NaH, then for Na, lightest is 22, heaviest is 25. Sum:47.

For H, lightest 1, heaviest 2 (if X has deuterium). Sum:3.

Total:47+3=50.

Still not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X has more than two elements, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: if X is a diatomic molecule with two same atoms, like H2. But that can't be, as X is a reagent in organic chemistry, more likely a compound.

Hmm, I think I'm going around in circles here. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the information I have.

If X is NaH, and the isotopes are Na-23 and H-2, then the lightest elements would be Na (23) and H (1), sum 24. The heaviest would be Na (23) and H (2), sum 25. So the cumulative would be 24 and 25. But the options don't include these, so perhaps the correct answer is 25, which is option B.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something else. Let me think: the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So, perhaps the product is a compound like formaldehyde (H2CO), but that's a gas, not a solid. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: if X is a reducing agent that converts a keto acid into an alcohol, which has one oxygen. But the product has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps it's converting a keto acid into something else.

Wait, perhaps the product is a carbonyl compound, but that's not making sense.

I think I'm stuck and need to make a guess. Based on the earlier calculations, if X is NaH (Na and H), and the heaviest isotope sum is 25 (Na-23 and H-2), which is option B, 25.


The problem involves identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W, whose molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons. A precipitate G forms, which releases B upon heating, where B has a melting point close to 277 K (4°C). Additionally, the product of X and a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms, and X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.

Key points of analysis:

1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Possible candidates include O₂, CO₂, or N₂. However, the reaction conditions and the nature of X suggest that W is likely H₂, though this does not perfectly fit the proton-neutron equality condition.

2. **Substance X**: X is a reagent in organic chemistry, likely a metal hydride such as NaH (sodium hydride). Sodium hydride reacts with liquids like water to produce hydrogen gas (H₂) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The problem specifies that X incorporates a heavier isotope, likely deuterium (D) for hydrogen, as NaH is commonly used in such reactions.

3. **Precipitate G and Product B**: The precipitate G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K (4°C). This suggests B could be a salt or hydrate with a low melting point. However, the exact identity of B remains unclear.

4. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product of X and a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. Sodium hydride (NaH) can deprotonate a keto acid, forming a carboxylate salt. While carboxylates typically have more oxygen atoms, the problem specifies a product with exactly 2 oxygen atoms, which could correspond to a specific reaction pathway or intermediate.

5. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**: For X (NaH), the elements are sodium (Na) and hydrogen (H). Sodium has isotopes like Na-23 (lightest, mass 23) and Na-25 (heaviest, mass 25). Hydrogen has isotopes like H-1 (lightest, mass 1) and H-2 (heaviest, mass 2). If X incorporates a heavier isotope of hydrogen (deuterium, D), the cumulative atomic masses are calculated as follows:
   - Lightest isotopes: Na-23 (23) + H-1 (1) = 24
   - Heaviest isotopes: Na-23 (23) + H-2 (2) = 25

The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X are 24 and 25, respectively. Among the options provided, the closest match is **25**.
