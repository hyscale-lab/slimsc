Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and honestly, it's a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step. Let me think through each part.

The problem starts with heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (like 1,3-dibromoadamantane) react with strong bases like KOH, they usually undergo an elimination reaction. But wait, wait—no, wait. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in an adamantane structure. So when KOH is added in excess and heated, it should cause an elimination, forming an alkene. Since there are two leaving groups (Br), this should lead to dehydrohalogenation, resulting in the formation of an alkene.

So product 1 is probably 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. Wait, more accurately, I think the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two HBr molecules when treated with KOH. So the product would be 1,3-adamantadiene, which is an adamantane with a double bond between C1 and C2 and another between C3 and C4, but wait, no. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So each Br is on adjacent carbons? Wait no, wait. Oh, no, wait. Wait, the structure of adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on two opposite positions if the numbering is such. Hmm, maybe when KOH is added, the two Br atoms would eliminate, but wait, the positions would determine where the double bond forms.

Wait, when two adjacent Br atoms are present, elimination would form a double bond between those two carbons. But here, the compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So the Br atoms are on carbons 1 and 3. Are they adjacent? No, because in adamantane, the positions are such that 1 and 3 may not be adjacent. Wait, I'm maybe getting this wrong. Let me think: the structure of adamantane is a diamondoid structure, and 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on two non-adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps when KOH is used in elimination, it can form conjugated dienes. Or maybe the positions of the Br allow for a conjugated diene upon elimination. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. Since there are two Br atoms, perhaps two eliminations occur.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. The 1H NMR has certain signals. Let me look at the given NMR data.

The NMR of product 1 shows:

4.79 (2H) – maybe a CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Or perhaps a coupling with an adjacent group.

2.41-2.23 (10H) – this is a multiplet in the range typical for CH2 groups in a diamondoid structure, perhaps.

1.94 (2H) – another CH2 group, possibly adjacent to something else.

And the IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. Wait, but wait. If product 1 came from elimination, which would form a diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking about the reaction incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction isn't elimination. Another possibility is that KOH in a high temperature could cause a substitution, but that would require a good leaving group. But Br is a good leaving group, but in a substitution reaction, you'd get a hydroxyl group. However, if it's a vicinal dihalide, another possibility is that KOH could perform a double elimination, but perhaps under certain conditions.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation. Vicinal dihalides can form alkenes upon treatment with a base. So with two Br atoms on adjacent carbons, elimination would give an alkene. But wait, in this case, it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so the two Brs are not on adjacent carbons. Wait, no, wait. Oh, no—1,3-dibromoadamantane has Br on carbons 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. So each Br is on a different carbon. So maybe each Br undergoes elimination, but not necessarily forming adjacent double bonds.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a different part of the adamantane structure. So when KOH is used, each Br could leave, forming two double bonds. But that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond, but in a way that both Brs are eliminated, leading to a diene. Alternatively, perhaps only one Br is eliminated, but that would leave another Br, which doesn't fit the IR data.

Wait, the IR peak is at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl. So product 1 has a carbonyl group. So perhaps the reaction isn't just elimination but some kind of oxidation. Wait, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the initial structure is such that elimination leads to a ketone?

Wait, how can elimination lead to a carbonyl? Oh, wait! Perhaps the reaction is a vicinal dihalide elimination leading to a carbonyl. Wait, no, elimination of two X groups would typically form a double bond. Alternatively, maybe there's some kind of rearrangement.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to a carbocation, but then perhaps a neighboring group could form a double bond or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't an alkene but a ketone. So maybe the starting material is a dihalide that, upon treatment with a strong base, undergoes a substitution where each Br is replaced by an OH group, but that would form a diol. But then, would that produce a carbonyl? No, unless some kind of elimination occurs after substitution. Alternatively, maybe the diol undergoes some elimination.

Wait, perhaps the initial product is a diepoxide. No, but then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Wait, another angle: the IR absorbance is at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl peak. What functional groups have that? It could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carbonyl in a ring.

If product 1 has a carbonyl, perhaps it's a ketone. How would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH? Maybe through some elimination that forms a carbonyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a rearrangement, such as a pinacol-like elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a double elimination to form a carbonyl. Let me think: if two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond. But if they are on the same carbon, elimination could form a carbonyl, but that's a geminal dihalide. Oh wait, in our case, it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so the Brs are on different carbons. So perhaps each Br is on adjacent carb
