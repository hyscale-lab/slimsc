Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay, which is given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). Right, so I think S looks like this:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

And Ay = c * S, so substituting c, that's (h/(4π)) multiplied by this matrix.

The problem asks which statement is correct regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Looking at the options, options A, B, and C talk about the eigenvalues, and D talks about the eigenfunctions.

First, I should find the eigenvalues of Ay. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, finding eigenvalues should involve solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0.

Let me compute Ay first. Substituting c into S:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π))],
                      [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ]

So, to find the eigenvalues, I'll set up the matrix (Ay - λ I) and compute its determinant.

The matrix (Ay - λ I) is:

[ -λ, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), -λ ]

The determinant is then (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ].

Calculating each part:

First term: λ².

Second term: (-i)*(i) = (-i²) = -(-1) =1. So the term becomes (1)*(h²/(4π)^2). So the determinant equation is:

λ² - [ (h²)/(16 π²) ] = 0.

So, λ² = h²/(16 π²).

Taking square roots: λ = ± h/(4π).

Wait, wait—hold on. Are these the eigenvalues? So the eigenvalues are plus and minus h/(4π). But wait, looking at the options, let me check.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ± h/(4π). That can't be right because the eigenvalues I just found are real. So A is incorrect.

Option B says imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. Hmm, but from my calculation, the eigenvalues are real, so their imaginary parts are zero. So B must also be wrong.

So that leaves options C and D.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az. Hmm. Wait, A is a component of the angular momentum, so A^2 is the square of the angular momentum. In quantum mechanics, the eigenfunctions of a component (like Ay) are not eigenfunctions of another component (like Az), but they are eigenfunctions of A^2. Because the square of the angular momentum commutes with each component, right? So, if phi is an eigenfunction of Ay, then it's also an eigenfunction of A^2. So the statement in option C is correct. Because Ay and A^2 commute, their eigenfunctions can be the same.

Option D: The eigenfunctions phi are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what this means. Basis functions usually refer to the basis in which the operator is diagonal, I think. Eigenvectors form a basis if they are complete and orthogonal. But operator Ay is 2x2, so its eigenvectors would form a basis for 2D space. So D might be correct as well.

Wait, but let's think again. The operator is 2x2, so it has two eigenfunctions, which form a basis for the space. So the eigenfunctions are a basis, but are they the basis functions of the operator? Alternatively, the matrix representation of Ay in this basis would be diagonal, right? Because the eigenfunctions are the basis, Ay would be diagonal in that basis.

So in that case, option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That sounds correct because the matrix is diagonal in its eigenbasis.

Wait, but wait. The question is about which statement is correct. So both C and D could be correct? But looking at the options, the statements are mutually exclusive.

Wait, let me re-examine. The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct because A² commutes with Ay. So C is correct. And D says the eigenfunctions are the basis for Ay, which is true because any operator's eigenvectors form a basis in which it's diagonal.

Wait, but the question is: which statement is correct. So both C and D could be correct?

Wait, but looking back at the options:

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. That's correct because Az doesn't commute with Ay. So if phi is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's not necessarily an eigenfunction of Az, but it is of A².

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Well, any operator's eigenfunctions form a basis in which the operator is diagonal. So yes, D is correct.

Wait, but wait, the problem is in the way the question is phrased. Let me read each option again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

That is correct. Because A^2 commutes with Ay (since [A^2, Ay] = 0), so their eigenfunctions can be the same. But Az does not commute with Ay, so eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm. The matrix operator is a 2x2 matrix, and its eigenfunctions form a basis for the 2D space. So yes, they are the basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Which of the options is correct? The question says "which statement will you consider to be correct", so it's a multiple-choice with four options, and only one is correct.

Wait, but wait, the eigenvalues are real, so options A and B are incorrect. So the correct answer is either C or D.

Wait, let me think about the statements.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So, the operator's matrix in the eigenbasis is diagonal. So when you represent Ay in its eigenbasis, it's diagonal. But the given matrix S (and thus Ay) is not diagonal in the standard basis. So the eigenfunctions are the basis in which the operator is diagonal. So the statement in D is correct.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A^2. That's correct because A^2 commutes with Ay. So when you have an eigenstate of Ay, it's also an eigenstate of A^2, which is (A_x)^2 + (A_y)^2 + (A_z)^2. So that's correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct. Both C and D seem correct. But in the options, each option is presented as a possible correct statement.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the eigenvalues. Let me double-check my earlier calculation.

Ay is (h/(4π)) * S, where S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the matrix is:

[ 0, -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π)), 0 ]

The eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation:

det(Ay - λ I) = 0.

So, the matrix becomes:

[ -λ, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π), -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ].

Calculating the second term: (-i)*(i) = 1, since i * (-i) = -i² = 1.

So the second term is (1) * (h²)/(16 π²) ).

So determinant equation is λ² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0.

Solving gives λ = ± h/(4 π).

So the eigenvalues are real, not imaginary. So options A and B are wrong.

So back to the statements. Both C and D seem correct, but let me re-examine the options.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. This is correct, because A^2 commutes with Ay, so they share eigenfunctions. However, Az does not commute with Ay, so the eigenfunctions are different.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That's true because any operator's eigenvectors form a basis in which the operator is diagonal. So in this case, the matrix for Ay would be diagonal in its own eigenbasis.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct. So both statements C and D are correct. But looking at the options, only one can be correct, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of the matrix. S is the spin operator. Wait, S is a 2x2 matrix, which suggests it's representing the spin-1/2 system. Because for spin 1/2, the Pauli matrices are 2x2. So S is similar to the Pauli matrices.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So S here looks like σ_y. Because σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So S is σ_y. So Ay = c * σ_y.

So the eigenvalues of σ_y are ±1. So when multiplied by c, the eigenvalues of Ay are c*(±1) = ± c = ± h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real, ±h/(4π). So options A and B can be ruled out.

Now, considering the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. Since A² is the square of the total angular momentum, and since A² commutes with Ay and any other component, yes, eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That is, in the eigenbasis, the operator is diagonal. So the matrix representation in the eigenbasis would be diagonal. So D is correct.

Wait, but the problem says the matrix operator is given as above. So perhaps the matrix is in the standard basis. The eigenfunctions are in a different basis, so the given matrix is not diagonal in the eigenbasis.

Wait, no. Any operator's matrix can be represented in its own eigenbasis as a diagonal matrix. So the statement in D is correct.

But the question is which statement is correct, and the options are mutually exclusive.

Wait, perhaps I should check what each statement says.

Option D says "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

Wait, the matrix operator is given in the standard basis, I think. Because the matrix S is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which I assume is in the standard basis. So the eigenfunctions are not the standard basis vectors, but different vectors. So when you express Ay in the eigenbasis of Ay, the matrix becomes diagonal, so the eigenfunctions are a different basis.

So the statement in D says the eigenfunctions are the basis for the matrix operator. That is, the matrix is expressed in the eigenbasis. But the given matrix is in the standard basis. Therefore, the statement in D would be incorrect because the eigenfunctions form a basis in a different basis, not the one the matrix is expressed in.

Wait, but a matrix's eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space. So in that sense, the eigenfunctions are a basis for the vector space, which is the domain of the operator. So the statement in D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, hence for the operator.

But let's look at the options again. The question says which statement is correct.

So both C and D are correct? Or is there a mistake in my reasoning?

Hmm. Perhaps no, because the matrix operator's eigenfunctions are a basis for the space, which is the case. So option D is correct.

Wait, but the problem is in the way the statement is phrased. The statement says "the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

Wait, the matrix operator is given in a certain basis, and the eigenfunctions are a different basis. So the matrix is not diagonal in its own eigenbasis, but it is diagonal in that basis.

Wait, no. Any operator is diagonal in its own eigenbasis. So the matrix representation of Ay in the eigenbasis is diagonal. So the matrix given in the problem is not in the eigenbasis, because otherwise it would be diagonal. Since the given matrix is not diagonal, it's in a different basis.

So the eigenfunctions are a basis for the operator, so D is correct.

But wait, the given matrix is in the standard basis, and the eigenfunctions are another basis. So the statement in D is still correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis, regardless of which basis the matrix is given in.

But I'm a bit confused now. Let me think about the options again.

The question is which statement is correct.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. This is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions (of the matrix operator). Also correct.

But the options are presented as four choices, so perhaps only one is correct. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct answer among the options. Let's think: which statements are correct.

So the eigenvalues are real, so options A and B are wrong.

Option C: Correct because eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Option D: Correct because eigenfunctions form a basis.

So both C and D seem correct. But that's impossible because the options are single-select.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the nature of the eigenfunctions. Let me think: the operator Ay is Hermitian, so its eigenfunctions are orthogonal and form a basis. So D is correct.

But wait, the question is about what you 'consider to be correct' during the calculation. So which statement is true.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because when you're solving for the eigenfunctions, they form a basis for the operator.

But I'm more confident that option C is correct because it's a fact about angular momentum operators. The eigenfunctions of a component (like Ay) are eigenfunctions of the square of the angular momentum (A²) but not of another component (like Az).

So perhaps option C is correct.

Wait, but let's think about the given matrix. The given matrix S is σ_y, which in quantum mechanics, the eigenstates of σ_y are the same as the eigenstates of A_y for spin systems. And spin matrices commute with the square of the spin. So for a spin-1/2 system, the square of the spin is (3/4)ħ² I, which commutes with any matrix, including σ_y.

So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So option C is correct.

But then, why is option D presented as an option? Because the eigenfunctions do form a basis for the vector space, so D is correct.

So I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

Option D: eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator given.

Which is correct?

In quantum mechanics, any operator can be represented in its eigenbasis as a diagonal matrix. So the statement in D is correct. So the eigenfunctions form a basis of the vector space, hence the operator's matrix in that basis is diagonal.

So both C and D are correct, but since the options don't allow that, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the operator is a 2x2 matrix, implying it's acting on a two-dimensional space, which is the case. So the eigenfunctions form a basis, so D is correct.

But the problem is, I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps the given matrix is in the eigenbasis, but no, because in the eigenbasis, the matrix would be diagonal. The given matrix isn't diagonal, so it's not in the eigenbasis.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is C. Because the question is about the statements made during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So option C is a statement about the properties of the eigenfunctions beyond just being eigenfunctions of Ay.

In any case, I'm probably overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The possible correct options are C and D.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So when you're calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, which statement is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Wait, the matrix is 2x2, so the basis is 2-dimensional, and the eigenvectors are two in number, so they form a basis. So D is correct.

Alternatively, since the operator's matrix is given in the standard basis, and the eigenfunctions are a different basis, D's statement is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis.

So I'm torn between C and D. But the question says which statement is correct.

Wait, perhaps looking at the options again. Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So the matrix operator is represented in that basis. That is, if the matrix is expressed in the eigenbasis, then it's diagonal. So the given matrix is not in that basis because it's not diagonal. So the statement in D is correct because the eigenfunctions are a basis, but the given matrix is in the standard basis, not in the eigenbasis.

Wait, but the statement in D doesn't specify the basis. It says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So perhaps that's correct because any operator's eigenfunctions form a basis.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is D. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C because it's a more specific fact about angular momentum.

Wait, but in the problem, the operator is (h/(4π)) times S, which is σ_y. The eigenfunctions of σ_y are the same as the eigenstates of S_y, which are eigenstates of S², but not of S_z. So yes, option C is correct.

So I think the correct answer is C.


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is defined as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix given by:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( A_y \) is explicitly:
     \[
     A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \cdot S = \begin{bmatrix} 
     0 & -i\frac{h}{4\pi} \\ 
     i\frac{h}{4\pi} & 0 
     \end{bmatrix}.
     \]
   - To find the eigenvalues, solve the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - \lambda I) = 0 \). This gives:
     \[
     \lambda^2 - \left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2 = 0.
     \]
   - Solving this, the eigenvalues are:
     \[
     \lambda = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
     \]
   - These eigenvalues are real, so options **A** and **B** (which involve imaginary parts) are incorrect.

2. **Option C:**
   - The statement claims that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \) (the Z-component of angular momentum).
   - \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), meaning their eigenfunctions can overlap. However, \( A_z \) does not commute with \( A_y \), so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \). This statement is consistent with the properties of angular momentum operators and is correct.

3. **Option D:**
   - The statement claims that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \).
   - While it is true that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form a basis for the vector space, the given matrix \( A_y \) is not expressed in this eigenbasis. Instead, it is expressed in the standard basis, where it is not diagonal. Thus, this statement is misleading and incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **C**, as it accurately reflects the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \). Option D is incorrect because the eigenfunctions do not form the basis in which the given matrix \( A_y \) is expressed.

**Answer: C**
