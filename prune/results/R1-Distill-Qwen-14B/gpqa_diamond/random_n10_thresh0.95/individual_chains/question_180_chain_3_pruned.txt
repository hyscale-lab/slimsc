Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their mass is negligible. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm. So, the setup is that there are 13 charges. One is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. Since all the particles are identical and have charge 2e, the one at P is 2e, and each of the 12 is also 2e.

Wait, but wait a second. If the system is isolated, and the charges are fixed except for the 12th one, but no, actually, the problem says the 13th is fixed at P, and the others are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So all 12 are at 2m from P, and one is fixed at P.

So we're dealing with the potential energy of the system. Because the particles are point charges, the potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. But wait, wait, we have to think about how many interactions we need to consider.

But wait, in calculating the potential energy of a system of charges, the potential energy is the work done to bring each charge from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to all the other charges already in place. So, for a system of n charges, the potential energy U is given by U = (1/(4πε₀)) * sum_{i<j} (q_i q_j) / r_ij.

In our case, all charges are 2e. So each charge is 2e.

Now, in this system, there are 13 charges. The 13th is at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So the distance between the 13th (at P) and any of the other 12 is 2 m. Now, what about the distances between the 12 charges that are at 2m from P? Are they all at the same point, or spread out in a sphere of radius 2m?

Wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their positions are points on a sphere with radius 2 m around P. But the problem doesn't specify whether the 12 are arranged in a particular way, like a regular dodecahedron or something. So, unless otherwise specified, perhaps the minimal energy occurs when the mutual repulsions between the 12 charges are minimized, which would mean that they are as far apart as possible. But wait, in a system of identical repelling charges, to minimize the potential energy, the charges would arrange themselves as far apart as possible. Wait, no, wait—actually, for a fixed set of points, the potential energy depends on the specific arrangement. But in this problem, maybe we can model the 12 charges as being on the surface of a sphere of radius 2 m, each at a distance of 2 m from P, and at a distance d = ? from each other.

Wait, but the problem is about the minimum energy of the system, so perhaps we can find the potential energy due to the interactions between the 13th charge and the 12 others, plus the potential energy between the 12 others themselves.

Wait, another thing: the potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies for each pair. So, each pair contributes a term, and the total is the sum of all those terms.

But let me break this down. The system has a charge at P (charge Q = 2e) and 12 charges each at 2 m away. Let's consider two parts:

1. The potential energy between the fixed charge at P and each of the 12 charges at 2m.
2. The potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

So, the total potential energy U is the sum of these two parts.

Wait, but wait: when calculating the potential energy of a system of multiple charges, each pair is considered once. So for the fixed charge at P and each of the 12, that's 12 pairs. Then, for the 12 charges themselves, each pair contributes a term.

So, the total U is U = U1 + U2, where U1 is the sum of the potentials between P and each 2m charge, and U2 is the sum of potentials between each pair of the 12.

Wait, but when calculating U, the potential energy of the system, each pair contributes (1/(4πε₀)) * (q1 q2)/r. So for each pair, I have to compute that.

So, for the 13th charge and each of the 12, that's 12 pairs. Each has q1 = 2e and q2 =2e, r = 2m.

So U1 = 12 * [ (2e)^2 / (4πε₀ * 2) ].

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the formula is U = (1/(4πε₀)) * sum (q_i q_j)/(r_ij). So each term is (q1 q2)/r.

So for the 12 pairs between the fixed charge and the others, each term is (2e)(2e) / 2m.

So U1 = 12 * [ (2e * 2e) / (2 * 4πε₀) ) ]

Wait, no, the 1/(4πε₀) is a factor outside the sum. So U1 is (1/(4πε₀)) multiplied by the sum of 12 terms, each (2e)(2e)/(2).

Similarly, for U2, the potential energy between the 12 charges. Each of these 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from P, but their mutual distances vary depending on their arrangement. Oh, but wait, the problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So the distance between any two of the 12 charges would depend on their positions on the sphere of radius 2 m. But without knowing their exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual distances are such that each pair is at a certain fixed distance, maybe the same as 2 m. But that can't be right because the distance between two points at radius 2 m on a sphere can't all be 2 m apart unless they are all at the same point, which is impossible because they're distinct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying by considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a regular icosahedron or similar, but without knowing the exact arrangement, it's unclear. So perhaps the problem is only considering the energy due to the fixed charge at P and the 12 charges, but not the energy between the 12 themselves. But that seems unlikely because the question is about the system's energy, which would include all interactions.

Wait, but maybe the problem is presented in a way that the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that can't be because they would repel each other, but the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. Hmm, perhaps the 12 are arranged on a sphere of radius 2 m, but their mutual distances are such that each is at the same distance from each other. But that's only possible if all are at the vertices of a regular polyhedron, like a regular icosahedron. But the exact number of charges isn't matching any regular polyhedron. Wait, 12 points on a sphere for regular spacing; maybe they're arranged in a cuboctahedron or something, but perhaps the problem is making an approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the mutual interactions between the 12 charges because it is a minimal energy configuration, but that seems unlikely. Or perhaps the 12 are arranged such that each is at the same angular separation, leading to their mutual distances being the same. So for simplicity, perhaps each pair of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m apart, but that's probably not correct because the distance between two points on a sphere of radius r is 2r sin(theta/2), where theta is the angle between them. So unless all 12 are at the same point, which is impossible, their mutual distances would vary.

Wait, but maybe the problem is assuming that all the 12 charges are at the same distance from each other as from P. So if each is 2 m from P, then the distance between any two charges (if arranged in a regular way) would be more than 2 m. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual distances are not contributing to the potential energy, but that doesn't make sense because the 12 charges are all present and would repel each other, contributing to the potential energy.

Hmm. But perhaps the problem is designed in a way that the 12 charges are so arranged that the potential energy between them is zero, but that seems impossible because they are all positive charges and would repel each other, leading to a positive potential energy. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the mutual distances are large enough to ignore their contribution, but that's unlikely.

Wait, but maybe the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is negligible compared to the potential energy from the fixed charge. But without more information, perhaps the problem expects us to compute only the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12 others, and not the energy between the 12 themselves.

Wait, let me re-read the question. It says, "the minimum energy of this system." So perhaps the minimal energy is achieved when the 12 charges are arranged in a way that minimizes the potential energy. Since all are positive, they would naturally repel each other, so the minimal potential energy would correspond to them being as far apart as possible. But without knowing their exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy due to the fixed charge at P and the 12 others, and not the interactions among the 12.

Wait, but that seems incorrect. Because the total potential energy of the system would include all pairs. So I must include both the interactions between the fixed charge and the 12, and the interactions between the 12 themselves.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are all at the same position, but that's impossible because they're identical and would repel each other. So no, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 are arranged in a regular icosahedron around P, each at 2 m from P. Then, the distance between any two charges would be sqrt( (2)^2 + (2)^2 - 2*(2)*(2)*cos(theta) ), where theta is the angle between their position vectors from P. But for a regular icosahedron, the angle between any two adjacent vertices is about 63.43 degrees. Wait, but in a regular icosahedron, each vertex is equally spaced. So the distance between any two adjacent charges would be the same.

But wait, this is getting complicated, and perhaps the problem doesn't require that level of detail. Maybe the mutual distances can be approximated as 2 m, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the interactions between the 12 charges, considering that their mutual distances are much larger than 2 m, but that doesn't make sense because they're all at 2 m from P, so their mutual distances can't be arbitrarily large.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem states that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So their positions are on a sphere of radius 2 m. The 13th is at P. So the potential energy U is the sum over all pairs.

So, for the 13th charge and each of the 12, the distance is 2 m. So each pair contributes (2e)(2e)/(4πε₀ * 2). Since there are 12 such pairs, that's 12*(4e²)/(4πε₀ * 2) = 12*(4e²)/(8πε₀) = (12*4)/(8) * (e²/(4πε₀)) )? Let me compute that.

Wait, 12 * ( (2e)(2e) ) / (4πε₀ * 2) ) = 12 * (4 e²) / (8 π ε₀) ) = (48 e²) / (8 π ε₀) ) = 6 e²/(π ε₀).

Wait, but let me compute it step by step. Each term is ( (2e) * (2e) ) / (4πε₀ * 2) ) = (4e²) / (8 π ε₀) ) = (e²)/(2 π ε₀). Multiply by 12: 12*(e²/(2 π ε₀)) ) = 6 e²/(π ε₀).

Now, for the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves. Each pair of the 12 is separated by some distance r, which depends on their arrangement. The number of such pairs is C(12,2) = 66. Each pair contributes (2e)(2e)/(4πε₀ r_ij). So the sum would be the sum over all 66 pairs of (4e²)/(4 π ε₀ r_ij ) = sum (e²)/(π ε₀ r_ij) ). 

But without knowing the exact r_ij for each pair, it's impossible to compute this sum. So perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are all at the same distance from each other, which would be the case if they're equally spaced on a sphere. But that's only possible in certain regular arrangements, and even then, the mutual distances vary depending on the specific arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual interactions between the 12 charges, perhaps because the problem is intended to consider only the potential energy between the fixed charge and the others, but that would be incorrect because the mutual interactions contribute to the system's total potential energy.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the 12 charges to be fixed in place, like fixed on a sphere, so their mutual distances are all the same, but that's not correct because on a sphere of radius R, the maximum number of points that can be equidistant is limited, and 12 is possible (like the vertices of a regular icosahedron). So perhaps the problem assumes that each pair of the 12 charges is separated by the same distance, say d, which can be computed based on the sphere's radius.

Wait, but if the 12 charges are at 2 m from P, arranged on a sphere of radius 2 m, and each pair is at a mutual distance d, which would be determined by the regular icosahedron arrangement. Let me compute that.

In a regular icosahedron, the edge length a (the distance between adjacent vertices) is related to the radius R of the circumscribed sphere. The formula is a = R * sqrt( (10 + 2√5) ) ≈ R * 1.5258. But wait, no, wait. For a regular icosahedron, the edge length is a = R * sqrt( (10 + 2√5)/5 ) ), but I might have the exact formula wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use some trigonometry. The central angle θ between two adjacent vertices in a regular icosahedron is approximately 63.43 degrees. Then, the chord length (distance between two points on a sphere) is d = 2 R sin(θ/2). So for R=2 m and θ=63.43 degrees, sin(θ/2) is sin(31.715) ≈ 0.5257.

So d ≈ 2 * 2 * 0.5257 = 4 * 0.5257 ≈ 2.1028 meters. So each pair of the 12 charges is about 2.1028 m apart.

But wait, but in reality, in a regular icosahedron, not all pairs are the same distance apart; some are adjacent (with edge length a), others are further apart. So perhaps the problem is considering that each pair of the 12 is at the same distance d, but that's not correct in reality. So perhaps the problem is making an approximation, assuming that each of the 66 pairs is at the same distance d, which is approximately 2.1028 m.

But this is getting complicated, and perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the mutual interactions between the 12 charges. Hmm, but that would make the problem easier, but then why would the problem include 12 charges? It would make sense only to consider the fixed charge and the 12 others. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual interactions can be calculated in a way that's easier.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the 12 charges are all at the same distance from each other, but that's only possible if they're all at the same point, which is impossible. So that can't be. So perhaps the problem is only considering the interactions between the fixed charge at P and the 12 others. So the energy would be U = 12 * ( (2e)^2 )/(4 π ε₀ * 2).

Wait, but that would be ignoring the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges, which might be a significant term. But perhaps the problem is intended to ignore that part, perhaps because the mutual distances are too large, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that all 12 are at the same point, but that's impossible because they are identical charges, so they would repel each other. So the problem must involve the mutual interactions.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the 12 charges arranged on a sphere of radius 2 m, each at a distance of 2 m from P, and the mutual distances are all 2 m as well. But that's impossible because if two points are each 2 m from P and at 2 m apart, they form a regular tetrahedron with P. But with 12 points, it's not possible for all mutual distances to be 2 m. So perhaps the problem is making an error here, or I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that the potential energy between them is zero. That would require them to be arranged in a way that their electric fields cancel each other, but that's only possible in specific symmetrical configurations, like positive and negative charges, but all are positive here. So that's impossible. So their mutual potential energy would be positive, adding to the total.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate only the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12 others, and not consider their mutual interactions. Let me try that approach and see which option matches.

So, the potential energy U1 between the fixed charge and the 12 others is:

U1 = (1/(4πε₀)) * sum_{i=1 to 12} ( (2e)(2e) ) / (2 m )

So each term is (4e²)/(8 π ε₀), since denominators are 4πε₀ * 2 m. So sum of 12 terms: 12 * (4e²) / (8 π ε₀) ) = (48 e²)/(8 π ε₀) ) = 6 e²/( π ε₀ )

Then, the energy due to the mutual interactions U2 between the 12 charges: each pair contributes (2e)(2e)/(4πε₀ r_ij ), where r_ij is the distance between each pair. But without knowing r_ij, perhaps the problem is not considering this term. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simplifying and assuming that the mutual distances are all 2 m, but that's not possible. So perhaps the problem is expecting me to neglect U2 and only compute U1.

Wait, but if I proceed under that assumption, what's the value?

Compute U1:

e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs.

So e² = (1.602e-19)^2 ≈ 2.566e-38 C².

1/(4πε₀) is approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

So U1 = 6 * (2.566e-38) / ( π * 8.988e9 )

Wait, wait, let me compute this step by step.

Wait, U1 is 6 e²/(π ε₀ ), with 1/(4π ε₀) being 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Wait, no, wait: because the 1/(4π ε₀) is a constant factor in Coulomb's law. So the calculation would be:

U1 = 12 * ( (2e)(2e) )/(4π ε₀ * 2 )

= 12 * (4 e²) / (8 π ε₀ )

= 12 * (e²) / (2 π ε₀ )

So, U1 = (12 e² )/( 2 π ε₀ )

Simplify: 6 e²/(π ε₀ )

Now, substituting the numbers:

e = 1.602e-19 C.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = approximately 2.566e-38 C².

1/(4π ε₀) is 8.988e9 N·m²/C². So 1/ε₀ is approximately 4π * 8.988e9 ≈ 1.199e11 F/m.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute U1 using the Coulomb constant k = 1/(4π ε₀) ≈ 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So, U1 = 6 * (e²) * (1/(π ε₀ )) ) = 6 * e² * (k) * (1/(2)) ), because k = 1/(4π ε₀), so 1/(π ε₀) is 4k/(4 π ε₀) )= 4k/(π ε₀ )? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me re-express U1.

Wait, U1 = (6 e² )/( π ε₀ )

But 1/(4 π ε₀ ) = k ≈ 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So 1/(π ε₀ ) = 4k/(4 π ε₀ ) * (1/π ε₀ )? Wait, perhaps an alternative approach. Let me compute 1/(π ε₀ ) in terms of k.

Since k = 1/(4 π ε₀ ), then 1/(π ε₀ ) = 4k.

So U1 can be written as 6 e² * 4k = 24 e² k.

Wait, that makes sense because 1/(π ε₀ ) = 4/(4 π ε₀ ) ) = 4 * 1/(4 π ε₀ ) ) = 4k.

So U1 = 6 e² * 4k = 24 e² k.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because 1/(π ε₀ ) = (4 π ε₀ )^(-1/1) ) = 4k (since k =1/(4 π ε₀ )).

Yes, correct. So 1/(π ε₀ ) =4k.

So U1 = 6 e² * 4k = 24 e² k.

Wait, but wait: Let me make sure. Because U1 = 6 e²/(π ε₀ )

And since k = 1/(4 π ε₀ ), then 1/(π ε₀ ) =4 k.

So, substituting, U1 = 6 e² * (4k ) = 24 e² k.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, computing U1:

e = 1.602e-19 C.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So,

U1 = 24 * (2.566e-38 C²) * (8.988e9 N·m²/C² )

Let's compute this step by step.

First, 24 * 2.566e-38 = ?

24 * 2.566 = approx 61.584. So 61.584e-38 = 6.1584e-37.

Then, multiply by 8.988e9:

6.1584e-37 * 8.988e9 = ?

Multiply the coefficients: 6.1584 * 8.988 ≈ let's compute:

6 * 8.988 ≈ 53.928,

0.1584 *8.988 ≈ approx 1.425.

So total ≈53.928 +1.425 = 55.353.

Exponents: 1e-37 * 1e9 = 1e-28.

So U1 ≈55.353e-28 J ≈5.535e-27 J.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is larger than this.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, 24 * e² * k = 24 * (2.566e-38) * (8.988e9 )

Compute 24 * 2.566e-38 = 24 *2.566=about 61.584, so 6.1584e-37.

Multiply by 8.988e9:

6.1584e-37 * 8.988e9 = (6.1584 *8.988) * 1e-28.

Compute 6.1584 *8.988:

6 *8=48,

6 *0.988≈5.928,

0.1584 *8=1.267,

0.1584 *0.988≈0.1567.

Adding up: 48 +5.928=53.928; plus 1.267=55.195; plus 0.1567≈55.3517.

So 55.3517e-28 =5.535e-27 J.

But looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is about 5 times larger than this. So perhaps I missed a factor. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let's go back.

Wait, the potential energy between two charges is U = (1/(4π ε₀ )) * (q1 q2)/r.

In the case of the fixed charge and each of the 12, each pair contributes (2e)(2e)/(4π ε₀ * 2m) as the potential energy.

So, for each of the 12 pairs, U_i = (4 e² )/(8 π ε₀ ) = e²/(2 π ε₀ )

So, summing 12 terms: U1=12 * e²/(2 π ε₀ ) = 6 e²/(π ε₀ )

But earlier, I thought that 1/(π ε₀ ) =4k, so U1 =6 e² *4k =24 e² k.

Wait, but wait, 1/(π ε₀ )= (4 π ε₀ )^(-1) ) *4 =4/(4 π ε₀ )=4k.

So 6 e²/(π ε₀ ) =6 e² *4k/(4 π ε_0 * π ε_0 )) ? No, wait, no. Wait, 1/(π ε₀ )=4k.

So 6 e²/(π ε₀ )=6 e² *4k =24 e² k.

Which gives U1=24 e² k.

Hmm, e² is 2.566e-38 C².

k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So 24 *2.566e-38 *8.988e9.

Wait, computing 24 *2.566e-38 =6.1584e-37.

Multiply by 8.988e9:

6.1584e-37 *8.988e9 = ?

6.1584e-37 *8.988e9 = (6.1584 *8.988) *1e-28.

6.1584 *8.988 ≈ 55.352e-28.

So 5.535e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest would be option B: 2.822e-26 J, which is about 5 times larger. Hmm, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Let's check that again.

Wait, the fixed charge is one, and the other 12 are each at 2 m from it. So the number of pairs is 12, correct? So each pair contributes once.

Wait, yes, 12 pairs.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, the potential energy between two charges is U = (1/(4π ε₀ )) * (q1 q2)/r.

So for each pair between the fixed charge and the 12, U_i = (1/(4π ε₀ )) * (2e)(2e)/(2 m )

= (4 e² )/(8 π ε₀ m )

Wait, no, the denominator is 4 π ε₀ * r, which is 2 m.

So U_i = (4 e² )/(4 π ε₀ * 2 )

= (4 e² )/(8 π ε₀ )

= (e² )/(2 π ε₀ )

So 12 such terms: U1 =12 * e²/(2 π ε₀ ) =6 e²/(π ε₀ )

Which is correct.

Hmm. So U1 is 5.535e-27 J.

But looking at the options, none of them match this. The options are A)5.645e-26, B)2.822e-26, C)7.056e-27, D)122.330.

Wait, but my calculation gives 5.535e-27 J. The closest option is C)7.056e-27, which is a bit higher, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem includes the potential energy between the 12 charges as well. Let's compute that part.

So, the potential energy U2 between the 12 charges.

Each pair contributes (2e)(2e)/(4 π ε₀ r_ij ), where r_ij is the distance between each pair. Since the 12 are on a sphere of radius 2 m, their mutual distance varies based on the angle between them.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem assumes that all mutual distances are the same, say d. If that's the case, then the number of pairs is C(12,2) =66.

So U2 = (1/(4 π ε₀ )) * sum_{i<j} (4 e² )/d = (4 e² )/(4 π ε₀ d ) * 66 = (66 *4 e² )/(4 π ε₀ d ) = (66 e² )/( π ε₀ d )

So U2= (66 e² )/( π ε₀ d )

Now, what is d?

If the 12 charges are equally spaced on a sphere, then the distance between any two adjacent charges can be found. Alternatively, if the problem assumes that the mutual distances are much larger than 2 m, perhaps d=2 m. But that's not correct, as the points would be on a sphere of radius 2 m.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that each mutual distance is 2 m as well. But that's impossible because three points on a sphere can't all be 2 m apart unless they're on a flat plane, which is not a sphere. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is making a mistake and assuming that the mutual distances are 2 m. Let's proceed under that assumption, even though it's incorrect.

So, U2 = (66 e² )/( π ε₀ * 2 )

Then, U2 = (66 e² )/( 2 π ε₀ ) =33 e²/( π ε₀ )

So, the total potential energy U = U1 + U2 = (6 e^2)/(π ε₀) ) + (33 e^2)/( π ε₀ ) ) = (39 e^2 )/( π ε₀ )

Wait, but wait, I thought U1 was 6 e^2/(pi ε₀ ), and U2 is 33 e^2/(pi ε₀ ), making total 39 e^2/(pi ε₀ ).

But wait, let's compute that.

39 e²/( π ε₀ ) = 39 * (2.566e-38) / ( π * 8.85e-12 )

Wait, no, because 1/(4π ε₀ )=8.988e9, so 1/ε₀=4π *8.988e9 ≈ 1.199e11 F/m.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it using Coulomb's constant k=8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So, 1/(4π ε₀ )=k, so 1/(pi ε₀ )=4k.

So, U_total = (6 e² +33 e² )/(pi ε₀ ) )= (39 e²)/(pi ε₀ ) )

=39 e² *4k.

=156 e² k.

So, 156 * (2.566e-38) *8.988e9.

Compute 156 *2.566e-38=156 *2.566= approx 400.056e-38=4.00056e-36.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 4.00056e-36 *8.988e9= approx (4.00056 *8.988 )e-27.

4 *8.988=35.952, 0.00056*8.988≈0.005036.

Total≈35.957e-27=3.5957e-26 J.

Hmm, that's about 3.596e-26 J, which is approximately 3.6e-26 J. Looking at the options, B is 2.822e-26, which is close but a bit lower.

Wait, but I assumed that each mutual distance d is 2 m, which is not correct. So perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual interactions between the 12 charges. But then, our initial calculation without U2 gives U1 as 5.535e-27 J, which is close to option C (7.056e-27), but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the U1 calculation. Let me recompute U1 with more precision.

Compute U1 =6 e²/(π ε₀ )

But, 1/(4π ε₀ )=k=8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So, 1/(π ε₀ )=4k=4*(8.988e9)=35.952e9.

So,

U1 =6 e² * (35.952e9 ) / (4π ε₀ )

Wait, no, because 1/(π ε₀ ) =4k.

So,

U1 =6 e² *4k =24 e² k.

Now, e=1.602e-19 C.

e²= (1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38 C².

k=8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So,

24 *2.566e-38 *8.988e9 =24 *2.566 *8.988e-29.

Compute 24 *2.566=61.584.

61.584 *8.988= 61.584 *8=492.672, 61.584 *0.988≈60.868.

So total≈492.672+60.868=553.54.

So,

553.54e-29 J =5.5354e-27 J.

Which is approximately 5.535e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is about 27% higher than our calculated 5.535e-27 J.

Hmm, this suggests that perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the 12 charges and the fixed charge, but not the mutual energy between the 12. So the correct answer would be approximately 5.535e-27 J, which isn't exactly any of the options. The closest option is C)7.056e-27 J.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of U1. Let me compute it again.

Compute 24 * e² *k.

e²= (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38 C².

k=8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So,

24 *2.566e-38 *8.988e9 = ?

Compute 24 *2.566 =61.584.

61.584 *8.988e9 = ?

61.584 *8.988 = let me compute accurately:

Compute 60 *8.988=539.28.

1.584 *8.988=14.245.

So total 539.28 +14.245=553.525.

So,

24 * e² *k =553.525e-29 =5.53525e-27 J.

Hmm, 5.535e-27 J. Now, looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is about 5 times larger. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 27% higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let's think again: the total potential energy is the sum of all pairs. So, for the fixed charge, it's 12 pairs, each contributing (2e)^2/(4π ε₀ * 2). Then, for the 12 charges, each pair contributes (2e)^2/(4π ε₀ * d), where d is their mutual distance.

But without knowing d, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual distances are 2 m, which is incorrect, but let's proceed.

So, if d=2 m, then U2 = (66)*(4e²)/(4π ε₀ *2 )= (66 *4e² )/(8 π
