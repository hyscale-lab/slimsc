Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to understand what it's asking. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and eigenvectors represent the states when the operator is measured, yielding the corresponding eigenvalue.

Wait, the operator is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, so the operator P is the vector operator, which is a combination of these components. But wait, how is the operator P defined? Oh yeah, in the x, y, z directions, each component is an operator, and the total operator P would be the vector sum in the direction n.

Wait, the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So, the operator along n would be something like P · n̂, where n̂ is a unit vector in the x-z plane. So n̂ can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that? Wait, no, since it's in the x-z plane, the angle φ would be 0 or π, because y-component is zero. So n̂ has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, right?

Wait, okay, so the operator P along n is given by P·n̂ = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ. Because in spherical coordinates, the x component is sinθ cosφ, but since φ is 0, cosφ is 1. So n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ.

So first, I need to find the matrix representation of the operator P·n̂. Let's compute that. The given matrices for Px, Py, Pz are each 2x2, multiplied by ħ/2.

Let me write down the matrices:

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So when I take P·n̂, it's (ħ/2) (sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] )

So, let's compute that matrix:

Matrix A = sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So:

A =
[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, no. Let me compute each element step by step:

First row, first column: cosθ *1 (from Pz) because it's the (0,0) element. Because Pz is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so when multiplied by ħ/2, but since we're combining, we can just compute the matrices.

Wait, actually, the matrices for Px, Py, Pz are all multiplied by ħ/2. So when we write P·n̂, it's (ħ/2) ( sinθ * Px_matrix + cosθ * Pz_matrix )

But let me re-express P·n̂ as:

(ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

So let's compute the matrix inside:

The (0,0) element is cosθ * 1 (from Pz) because the Pz matrix has 1 in (0,0) and 0 elsewhere except (1,1). So when we multiply by sinθ * Px, which has 0 in (0,0), so the (0,0) element is cosθ.

The (0,1) element is sinθ * 1 (from Px), since Px has 1 in (0,1).

Similarly, (1,0) is sinθ * 1 (from Px), and (1,1) is cosθ * (-1) because Pz matrix has -1 there.

So the matrix for P·n̂ is (ħ/2) times:

[ cosθ, sinθ ]
[ sinθ, -cosθ ]

Wait, no. Wait, because the (1,1) element of Pz is -1. So in the matrix, it's cosθ * (-1) = -cosθ. So the matrix becomes:

[ cosθ, sinθ ]
[ sinθ, -cosθ ]

But all multiplied by ħ/2.

So the operator is (ħ/2) * A, where A is that 2x2 matrix.

We need to find the eigenvector of this matrix corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. Because the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

So the equation is (P·n̂ - λ I) |v> = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue, which is +ħ/2.

So substituting, we have ( (ħ/2) A - (ħ/2) I ) |v> = 0.

Factor out ħ/2: (ħ/2)(A - I) |v> = 0.

Which implies (A - I) |v> = 0. So we can ignore the ħ/2 factor for the eigenvector calculation since it's a scalar multiple.

So the matrix equation is (A - I) v = 0.

So let's compute A - I:

A is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

I is identity matrix: [[1,0],[0,1]]

So A - I:

[ cosθ -1, sinθ ]

[ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ]

So the system of equations is:

(cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0

sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 = 0

So this is a homogeneous system. To find non-trivial solutions, the determinant must be zero, but since we already know that this is an eigenvector, the equations are dependent.

So let's write the first equation:

(cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0.

We can solve for v2 in terms of v1.

v2 = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] v1

Assuming sinθ is not zero. Hmm, but when sinθ is zero, that's a different scenario, but I think since n is in the x-z plane (arbitrary), θ can vary from 0 to π, so sinθ can be zero when θ=0 or π.

But let's proceed under the assumption that sinθ ≠ 0.

So v2 = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] v1.

We can write this as v2 = [ (2 sin²(θ/2)) / (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) ] v1, using the identities 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So simplifying, (2 sin²(theta/2)) / (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) = [ sin(theta/2) ] / [ cos(theta/2) ] = tan(theta/2).

So v2 = tan(theta/2) v1.

So the eigenvector can be written as [v1, v2]^T = v1 [1, tan(theta/2)]^T.

So the vector is proportional to (1, tan(theta/2)).

To normalize it, we compute the norm squared: 1^2 + (tan(theta/2))^2 = 1 + tan^2(theta/2) = sec^2(theta/2) = 1 / cos^2(theta/2).

So the normalization factor is sqrt(1 / cos^2(theta/2)) ) = 1 / |cos(theta/2)|. Since theta is between 0 and pi, cos(theta/2) is positive, so 1/cos(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, since:

v1 = 1 * [1 / cos(theta/2) ]

v2 = tan(theta/2) * [1 / cos(theta/2) ] = [ sin(theta/2) / cos(theta/2) ] * [1 / cos(theta/2) ] = sin(theta/2) / cos^2(theta/2) ?

Wait, maybe I should write it more carefully.

Wait, the original components are [v1, v2] = [1, tan(theta/2)] multiplied by 1/sqrt(1 + tan^2(theta/2)}.

Because the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(1 + tan^2(theta/2)} = 1/sqrt(sec^2(theta/2)) ) = cos(theta/2).

So [v1, v2] = [1 * cos(theta/2), tan(theta/2) * cos(theta/2) ].

Wait, tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2), so v2 = [ sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2) ) * cos(theta/2) ] = sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, that seems too simple. Let me recheck.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the eigenvector in terms of components that don't involve trigonometric functions. Alternatively, perhaps the components are (sqrt(2/3), sqrt(1/3)) multiplied by some factors, depending on theta.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I got.

But wait, let me think again. The operator is along n in the x-z plane. So, in the eigenbasis of P·n, the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. The eigenvectors should correspond to spin-up and spin-down along that direction.

In quantum mechanics, the spin-up state along direction n is often expressed as a combination of the spin-up and spin-down states in the z basis. So for a general direction n, the spin-up state would be a linear combination of |↑z> and |↓z>, with coefficients depending on the angles.

So, the state |+n> can be written as cos(theta/2) |↑z> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |↓z>.

But in our case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is zero, right? Because the direction is in the x-z plane, so the angle phi is 0 or pi, but in this case, the state doesn't involve an exponential factor for phi, because the direction is along x-z, which would set phi=0 or pi, but the state doesn't have a phase difference between the components.

Wait, in the general case, the state is cos(theta/2)|↑> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)|↓>, where theta is the polar angle. But in our case, since the direction is in x-z plane, phi=0, because it's either along x (theta=90 degrees) or along z (theta=0 or 180). So phi is 0.

So the state becomes cos(theta/2)|↑z> + sin(theta/2)|↓z>, which matches the eigenvector we found earlier.

Looking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is the first component and second component. So that's exactly what we have for the eigenvector.

Wait, but the problem says "normalized eigenvector", so the components should be divided by the norm. But in our case, the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), which are already normalized because cos^2 + sin^2 = 1. So yes, option C seems correct.

But let me double-check the other options to make sure.

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ). Wait, units? The components shouldn't have ħ in them because eigenvectors are dimensionless. So this option is probably wrong.

Option B: (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ). Hmm, this looks like a spherical coordinate parametrization, but I don't think this is the normalized eigenvector for spin-1/2. Spin-1/2 states are parameterized with theta/2, not theta.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)). Again, presence of ħ in the components, which doesn't make sense for a normalized vector. So this is probably incorrect.

So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is defined in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be expressed as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$
The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is a linear combination of the components of $\vec{P}$:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta.
\]
Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The combined matrix becomes:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Solve for the eigenvector
We seek the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\left(\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I\right) |v\rangle = 0,
\]
where $I$ is the identity matrix. Substituting $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$:
\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} = 0.
\]
This simplifies to the system of equations:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1) v_1 + \sin\theta v_2 = 0,
\]
\[
\sin\theta v_1 + (-\cos\theta - 1) v_2 = 0.
\]
From the first equation, solving for $v_2$ in terms of $v_1$:
\[
v_2 = \frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} v_1.
\]
Using the trigonometric identities $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, we find:
\[
v_2 = \tan(\theta/2) v_1.
\]
Thus, the eigenvector can be written as:
\[
|v\rangle = v_1 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \tan(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Normalize the eigenvector
The normalization condition is:
\[
|v_1|^2 + |v_2|^2 = 1.
\]
Substituting $v_2 = \tan(\theta/2) v_1$:
\[
|v_1|^2 \left(1 + \tan^2(\theta/2)\right) = 1.
\]
Using $1 + \tan^2(\theta/2) = \sec^2(\theta/2)$, we find:
\[
|v_1| = \cos(\theta/2), \quad |v_2| = \sin(\theta/2).
\]
Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ — Incorrect, as eigenvectors are dimensionless and do not include $\hbar$.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ — Incorrect, as the parameterization involves $\theta/2$, not $\theta$.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ — Correct, matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ — Incorrect, as eigenvectors are dimensionless and do not include $\hbar$.

### Final Answer:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.
