Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question says to assume that stars are uniformly distributed, and then asks how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each being a different inverse power of plx.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think this through. Parallax is a measure of distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, wait, no—parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a star with a larger parallax is actually closer because parallax is 1 over distance (in parsecs). So, plx = 1/d, where d is distance.

Wait no, more accurately, the parallax angle (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So if a star is at 1 parsec, its parallax is 1 arcsec. At 2 parsecs, it's 0.5, and so on. So higher parallax means closer distance.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, how does N (number of stars) depend on plx.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, it means that the number density is the same in all directions. But because the volume of space increases with distance, more distant regions can have more stars. Wait, but the distribution is uniform, so the number per volume is constant.

Wait, no, wait. Uniform distribution in space would imply that the number density (stars per unit volume) is constant. So n = N/V is constant. So as you go further out, the number of stars in a shell depends on the volume of that shell.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So let's think in terms of parallax.

Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. The volume of a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr is approximately 4πd² dr. But if we're considering a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, then we have to relate this to dr.

So, d = 1/plx. So dr/dplx = derivative of (1/plx) with respect to plx. Let's compute that. dr/dplx = -1/(plx²). So dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, which makes sense.

So the volume element is 4πd² dr. Let's substitute d = 1/plx and dr from above.

Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/plx² dplx )
Wait, but the negative sign just indicates the direction, so when considering the absolute value, we can ignore it for now. So Volume ≈ 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx )?

Wait, no, let's correct that substitution. So:

dV = 4π d² dr.

We have d = 1/(plx), so d² = 1/(plx²).

And dr = ( -1/(plx²) ) dplx. The absolute value is 1/plx² dplx.

So plugging in, dV = 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx² dplx )

Wait, that would make dV = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, that can't be right because that would make the volume proportional to 1/plx^4 multiplied by dplx.

But wait, earlier I thought that the number of stars in a volume element is n * dV, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume). So, if the number density is uniform (n is a constant), then the number of stars in the shell is N = n * dV.

So N = n * 4π (1/plx²) (1/plx² dplx) ) → N = 4π n (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, but that would make the number of stars per unit plx interval (dplx) to be proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number per unit plx is ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought that the number of stars in a shell at distance d is proportional to the surface area, which is 4π d², multiplied by the thickness dr. Since d = 1/plx, dr = -d (dplx), because plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx → dd = -1/(plx²) dplx.

So substituting, the thickness dr is 1/(plx²) dplx (taking absolute value). So the volume element is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx ) = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars in that volume element would be n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Therefore, the number per unit plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the answer would be A.

Wait a second, but I'm not so sure. Let me think again. Because when you have a uniform distribution in 3D space, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is proportional to the surface area (4π d²) multiplied by the thickness of the shell (dr). But dr is related to the parallax: as plx is 1/d, then dr is ( -1/d² ) dplx.

So dr = - (1/d²) dplx → since d = 1/plx, 1/d² = plx². So dr = - plx² dplx.

So substituting into the volume element:

dV = 4π d² dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (- plx² dplx ) → 4π (1/plx^2) * plx^2 dplx = 4π dplx.

Wait, that's different. So dV becomes 4π dplx. So the volume element is 4π dplx.

Wait, but that can't be right because the volume shouldn't be just proportional to dplx. Because as plx changes, the volume depends on both d² and dr. Wait, perhaps my substitution is incorrect.

Wait, let me re-express dV in terms of plx.

dV = 4π d² dr.

But d = 1/plx → d² = 1/plx².

And dr = (dd) = d (d plx). Since plx = 1/d → d plx = -1/d² dd → dd = - d² d plx → dr = - (1/(plx^2)) d plx.

So, putting it all together:

dV = 4π * (1/plx^2) * ( - (1/plx^2) dplx ) → 4π * (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx ) → 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, yes, as before.

So the number of stars in that volume is n * dV = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Therefore, the number per unit plx interval (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the correct option is A) ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we assume a uniform distribution of stars in space. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. As \( \text{plx} \) increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( d \) depends on the volume of the shell, which is proportional to \( 4\pi d^2 \, dr \), where \( dr \) is the thickness of the shell. Since \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), the thickness \( dr \) can be expressed in terms of \( d\text{plx} \) as \( dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} \) into the volume element, we get:

\[
dV = 4\pi d^2 \, dr = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx}\right) = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \, d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this volume element is proportional to the volume, assuming a uniform number density \( n \) of stars. Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is:

\[
N \propto n \cdot dV \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) ~1/\text{plx}^4**

Answer: A
