Okay, so I've got this question here about detecting transiting planets, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, let's break it down.

So, both planets are Earth-like and have been detected via the RV method. That means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. The key here is their transiting probability because the researchers want to observe the one with the highest chance.

Wait, transiting probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. Oh right, the probability is higher if the planet's orbit is edge-on. But how do we calculate that probability?

I remember that the probability (P) of a planet transiting is given by the formula P = R_star / (a * (1 - e²)^(1/2)). But wait, in this case, both orbits are circular because they have circular orbits. So the eccentricity e is 0, simplifying the formula. So P = R_star / a, where a is the orbital radius. Or wait, no, the formula I think is P = (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(1/2)), but since e=0, it's just P = R_star / a.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think again. Oh wait, the transit probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the distance of the planet's orbit, but adjusted for the inclination. Alternatively, the probability is the area of the star's disk relative to the planet's orbital area. Oh right, the probability is given by the formula (R_star / a)², but no, wait, that's the area ratio, which is for the chance that the planet's path crosses our line of sight.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Another approach: the transit probability is approximately R*/a, where R* is the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis (orbital radius). Because the planet has to pass in front of the star, and the chance depends on the ratio of the star's size to the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, but I've read that the probability is R*/(a * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) ), but for circular orbits, e=0, so it's R*/a. So P = R*/(a). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the unit would be (length)/(length) = dimensionless. Oh wait, no, because R* is in the same unit as a. So yeah, it's just R*/a.

But wait, let me double-check. Another source says the transit probability is (R* / a) multiplied by (1/(sqrt(1-e²))), but since e=0, it's R*/(a). So yes, the formula is R*/a.

But wait, wait, I'm getting conflicting information. Some sources say the probability is (R*/a), others say (R*/a)². Hmmm. Let me think about it. If the planet's orbit is such that the star's disk is R*, and the planet's orbit is a, the chance that the orbit intersects our line of sight is when the planet's orbit plane is within a certain angle. The probability is proportional to (R*/a)^2, because it's the cross-section area. Because the cross-section for the planet to transit is a circle of radius R*, and the total possible cross-section is the area of the planet's orbit (a circle of radius a). So the probability is (pi R*^2) / (pi a^2) ) = (R*/a)^2. Oh, that makes more sense. So the probability is (R*/a)^2.

Wait, but that would be the geometric probability. Because the star's size is R*, and the planet's orbit is a. So the probability that the planet's path crosses our line of sight is the area of the star relative to the orbit. So yes, (R*/a)^2.

Wait, but some sources say it's (R*/a), not squared. So I might be getting this wrong. Let me think again. The transit happens when the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view. The probability depends on the inclination of the orbit. The maximum possible inclination is 90 degrees (edge-on), and the probability is the ratio of the favorable inclinations to all possible inclinations. So the probability is the area of the star's disk divided by the area of the planet's orbit, which is (R*/a)^2.

So yes, the transit probability is (R* / a)^2.

Wait, but I also remember that the probability is (R* / a) multiplied by (some factor), but I'm getting confused. Let's try to proceed with this assumption and see where it leads.

So, to find the probability for each planet, we need R*/a for each, then square it.

The question states that both host stars have the same radii. So R1 = R2.

So, the probability for each planet will be (R*/a1)^2 and (R*/a2)^2, respectively.

So the ratio of the probabilities is (a2/a1)^2.

Because if a1 is smaller (since Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period), then (R*/a1) is larger, making the probability higher.

But wait, the planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. We also know the masses of their host stars.

Given that Planet_1's host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both have the same radius.

Wait, Kepler's third law comes into play here. The period of the planet's orbit is related to the mass of the star and the semi-major axis.

Kepler's third law is (P^2) = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a^3. But since M >> m (planet's mass is much smaller), it's approximated as P² = (4π² / G M) * a³.

So, P² ∝ a³ / M.

Wait, let me write this more accurately. The formula is P² = (4π² a³)/(G(M_star + M_planet)).

But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, we can approximate P² ≈ (4π² a³)/(G M_star).

So, for each planet:

P1² = (4π² a1³) / (G M1)
P2² = (4π² a2³) / (G M2)

Given that P1 is three times shorter than P2, so P1 = P2 / 3.

So, (P1)^2 = (P2/3)^2 = P2²/9.

Substituting into the equation:

P1² = (4π² a1³)/(G M1) → (P2²/9) = (4π² a1³)/(G M1)
P2² = (4π² a2³)/(G M2)

Dividing the first equation by the second:

(P2²/9) / (P2²) ) = (4π² a1³/(G M1)) / (4π² a2³/(G M2)))

Simplify left side: 1/9.

Right side: (a1³ M2) / (a2³ M1).

So,

1/9 = (a1³ M2) / (a2³ M1)

We can rearrange this to find the ratio a1/a2.

Let me write:

a1³ / a2³ = (M1 * M2) / (9 M2)

Wait, no, let's be precise.

From 1/9 = (a1³ M2) / (a2³ M1)

So,

a1³ / a2³ = (M1)/(9 M2)

Wait, because a1³ M2 = (a2³ M1) * (1/9)

Wait, 1/9 = (a1³ M2) / (a2³ M1) → (a1³ M2) = (a2³ M1) /9 → a1³ = (a2³ M1) / (9 M2)

So,

a1³ = (a2³ M1) / (9 M2)

Taking cube roots,

a1 = a2 * (M1/(9 M2))^(1/3)

Given that M1 is twice M2. So M1 = 2 M2.

Substituting,

a1 = a2 * (2 M2 / (9 M2))^(1/3) → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3)

Hmm, 2/9 is approximately 0.222. The cube root of that is about 0.6, because 0.6^3 is 0.216.

So,

a1 ≈ a2 * 0.6.

So a1 is 0.6 times a2. That means a2 is larger than a1.

But wait, let me compute (2/9)^(1/3). Let's see. 2/9 is 0.2222. The cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.602, so yes, a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So, a1 is about 0.6 a2.

Now, the transit probability is (R*/a)^2.

Since R* is the same for both, the probability for Planet_1 is (R*/a1)^2, and for Planet_2 it's (R*/a2)^2.

So the ratio of probabilities P1/P2 is (a2/a1)^2.

Because P1 = (R*/a1)^2, P2= (R*/a2)^2.

So, P1/P2 = [ (R*/a1)^2 ] / [ (R*/a2)^2 ] = (a2/a1)^2.

We found a1 ≈ 0.6 a2. So a2/a1 ≈ 1/0.6 ≈ 1.6667.

So (a2/a1)^2 ≈ (1.6667)^2 ≈ 2.7778.

So P1 is approximately 2.77 times higher than P2.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if a1 is smaller, then (R*/a1) is bigger, so P1 should be higher than P2. So yes, so the transit probability of Planet_1 is higher.

But let me double-check.

Wait, the transit probability is (R*/a)^2. So if a1 is smaller, (R*/a1) is bigger, so (R*/a1)^2 is bigger. So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

So the options are:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~2.25 times higher probability.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~1.5 times higher.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times.

So according to our calculation, P1/P2 ≈ 2.78. So Planet_1 is preferred, and the probability is ~2.7 times higher. So the correct option is D.

Wait, but let me recompute the exact ratio without approximations.

We had 1/9 = (a1^3 M2) / (a2^3 M1)

We have M1 = 2 M2.

So,

1/9 = (a1^3 M2) / (a2^3 * 2 M2) ) → the M2 cancels.

So,

1/9 = (a1^3)/(2 a2^3)

→ 2 a2^3 = 9 a1^3

→ a2^3 = (9/2) a1^3 → a2 = a1 * (9/2)^(1/3)

Alternatively, (a2/a1) = (9/2)^(1/3).

What's (9/2)^(1/3)?

9 is 3², so 9/2 is 4.5. The cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.65.

Because 1.65^3 ≈ 4.49, which is close to 4.5. So (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65.

So a2 = a1 * 1.65 → a1 = a2 / 1.65 ≈ 0.606 a2.

So a1 is about 0.606 a2.

So the ratio (a2/a1) is 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So (a2/a1)^2 = (1.65)^2 = approximately 2.7225.

So the probability of Planet_1 is roughly 2.72 times higher than that of Planet_2.

Therefore, the transit probability of Planet_1 is higher, and the researchers should prefer observing Planet_1, which is option D: ~2.7 times higher.

So the correct answer is D.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The geometric transit probability is proportional to \( P \propto \left(\frac{R_*}{a}\right)^2 \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis (orbital radius) of the planet. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \).

### Step 1: Relationship Between Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis
Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M_*} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period and \( M_* \) is the mass of the host star. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

\[
\frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / M_1}{a_2^3 / M_2}
\]

Given \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) and \( M_1 = 2M_2 \), we substitute:

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / (2M_2)}{a_2^3 / M_2}
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{1}{9} = \frac{a_1^3}{2a_2^3}
\]

\[
2a_2^3 = 9a_1^3
\]

\[
\frac{a_2^3}{a_1^3} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left(\frac{9}{2}\right)^{1/3} \approx 1.65
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \).

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is proportional to \( \left(\frac{R_*}{a}\right)^2 \). Since \( R_* \) is the same for both stars, the ratio of probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2
\]

Substitute \( \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx 1.65 \):

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = (1.65)^2 \approx 2.72
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability than Planet_2.

### Conclusion
Planet_1 is preferred for observation due to its ~2.7 times higher transit probability.
