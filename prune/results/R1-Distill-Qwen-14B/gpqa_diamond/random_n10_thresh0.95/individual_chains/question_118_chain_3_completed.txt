Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. Hmm, I remember that when alkenes react with bromine, it's usually an addition reaction. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to visualize the structure of 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. Cyclopentene has a five-membered ring with a double bond. The "enol" part means there's an alcohol group adjacent to a carbonyl, right? Wait, no, enol is where the double bond is between a carbon and an oxygen. Oh wait, no, enol is an alcohol with a double bond. So in this case, cyclopent-1-enol would have the double bond between carbon 1 and 2, and the hydroxyl group on carbon 1 or 2. Wait, no, wait. The numbering might be 1 and 2. Let me sketch it out.

Cyclopentane is a five-membered ring. If it's cyclopent-1-enol, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. And the OH group is on carbon 1 because the enol form has the OH next to the double bond. So structure-wise, it's cyclopentene (five-membered ring with double bond between C1 and C2) and an OH group on C1. But wait, there's also substituents: 4,4-dimethyl. So on carbon 4, there are two methyl groups. So the ring has five carbons. Carbon 1 has the double bond to carbon 2 and an OH group. Carbon 4 has two methyl groups attached.

Now, when this compound reacts with bromine (Br2), what happens? Bromine adds across double bonds in a diaddition, typically via an anti addition, right? So the double bond is between C1 and C2. Adding Br2 would add Br atoms to both C1 and C2, but in a specific fashion. But wait, wait—what's the structure of the starting material? Is it an enol (with an OH group) or maybe a ketone? Wait, no, the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So it's an enol, meaning it's a dihydroxy structure with a double bond.

Wait, no. Enol is when a carbonyl group is adjacent to an alcohol. So, for example, cyclopentanone would have a carbonyl, and the enol form would have a double bond between the carbonyl carbon and the adjacent carbon, with an OH on that adjacent carbon. So in this case, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol would have the structure where the ring is cyclopentene (double bond between C1 and C2), and the OH is on C2? Or is it on C1?

Wait, perhaps I should clarify. The nomenclature: the enol has the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and the OH is on carbon 1 or 2. Wait, no, because in enols, the OH is on the same carbon as one end of the double bond. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

In the enol form of cyclopentanone, for example, the ring would have a double bond between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2. So when the compound is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C1, because it's the first position. Wait, maybe it's on C2? No, wait, the numbering starts so that the double bond is between the lowest possible numbers. So, in 1-enol, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C1. Because the OH is on the same carbon as one end of the double bond.

Wait, maybe that's not right. Enol structure: cyclopentanone has a carbonyl group. The enol form would have a double bond between the carbonyl carbon and the adjacent carbon, and an OH on that adjacent carbon. So, for example, cyclopentanone would have the structure O=C-(CH2)3-CH2. The enol form would replace the carbonyl (C=O) with a double bond to the adjacent carbon, and an OH on that adjacent carbon. So, the enol structure would be CH2=CH-OH attached in a ring. Wait, no, in a five-membered ring, so perhaps the ring is such that the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's just think about the reaction. The molecule is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, which means the ring has a double bond between C1 and C2, and an OH group on C1. And on C4, there are two methyl groups.

When bromine (Br2) reacts with an alkene (the double bond here), it typically undergoes an addition reaction. The bromine adds across the double bond in a dibromide. The addition is anti, leading to a vicinal dihalide.

So in this case, the double bond is between C1 and C2. Adding Br2 would add a Br to C1 and another Br to C2, but on opposite sides (anti addition). But wait, the molecule also has an OH group. Wait, but the OH is on C1 as well. So when Br adds to C1, it will be on the same carbon as the OH.

Wait, but that's a problem because adding Br across the double bond would add a Br to C1 and another to C2. So the product would have Br on C1 and C2, and the OH is on C1. So the structure would be 1,2-dibromocyclopentanol with substituents.

Wait, but looking at the options, options A and D are 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, but they differ in stereochemistry. Option A is (1R,2S), and D is (1R,2R). So the product would have Br on C1 and C2, with OH on C1.

Wait, but wait a minute. The starting material is an enol. Enols are usually more reactive towards electrophiles because the lone pair on the oxygen can conjugate with the double bond, making the double bond more electron-rich. But in this case, the reaction is with Br2, which is an electrophilic addition. So the reaction would proceed via the normal dibromide addition.

Wait, but in the case where the OH is adjacent to the double bond, will that affect the addition? Like, maybe the enol would get protonated or do something else. Hmm, not necessarily. Because in the presence of Br2, which is a dienophile, the addition is more likely. Also, Br2 is a diadduct, so the enol's OH might not play a role in the initial addition.

Wait, but when the enol is present, could it undergo some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction? But I don't think there's any acid mentioned here. The reaction is just between the enol and Br2, so it's likely an addition across the double bond.

So the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, with the stereochemistry determined by the anti addition of Br2. So the Br atoms would add on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, but the starting material's structure: the OH is on C1, right? So when Br adds across the double bond, C1 and C2 each get a Br. So the OH is on C1, and Br is added to C1 and C2.

Wait, but now I'm confused. If the OH is on C1, wouldn't adding Br to C1 create a situation where C1 has two substituents: OH and Br? But that's possible as long as it's a vicinal dihalide.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. Option D is (1R,2R). So the stereochemistry depends on the addition.

In bromine addition to alkenes, the bromines add anti to each other. So if the starting double bond is in a certain configuration, the bromines will end up on opposite sides.

But wait, the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. The substituents on C4 are two methyl groups, which are bulky. So during the addition of Br2, will the bromines add in a certain way due to steric factors?

Wait, let's think about the stereochemistry. When Br2 adds to a double bond, the two Brs add to opposite faces because the addition is anti. So the configuration would be trans.

In the starting material, the double bond is between C1 and C2. Let's assume the double bond is in a certain conformation. Adding Br2 would then add the Br atoms on opposite sides, leading to a specific stereochemistry.

But wait, the starting material has an OH on C1. So after addition, the OH and Br would both be on C1. But wait, that can't be right. Because the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C1. When Br adds to C1, the Br would be on the opposite side from the OH due to the anti addition.

Wait, no. Let's imagine the double bond is in a certain arrangement. Let me draw a rough structure. The ring is cyclopentane, so it's a five-membered ring. The substituents are on C4 (two methyl groups), and the double bond is between C1 and C2. The OH is on C1.

So, the structure would be something like:

C1 (double bond to C2, OH, and two other ring bonds)
|
C5
|
C4 (two methyl groups)
|
C3

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the positions. So C1 is adjacent to C5 and C2. C2 is adjacent to C1 and C3. C3 adjacent to C2 and C4. C4 has two methyl groups and is adjacent to C3 and C5. C5 is adjacent to C4 and C1.

So, the molecule has a five-membered ring with the double bond between C1 and C2, and an OH on C1. The substituents on C4 are two methyl groups.

When Br2 adds across the double bond, it will form a vicinal dibromide. Since the addition is anti, the Brs will be on opposite sides.

So, the initial double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 and C2 were each bonded to two carbons (part of the ring). Adding Br to each, but on opposite sides.

Now, the OH is on C1. So after the addition, C1 will have OH and Br, and C2 will have Br.

Wait, but wait. The starting material is an enol. So perhaps the reaction isn't just a simple addition. Oh, but wait, enols can also undergo keto-enol tautomerism. But in this case, the question is about adding Br2, which is an electrophilic addition.

So, the primary reaction is the addition of Br2 to the double bond, forming a dibromide.

Now, looking at the options:

Option B is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Hmm, that suggests a bromine on C2 and a ketone. So that would imply some kind of oxidation or ring opening, but I don't think that's the case here.

Option C is 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Again, a ketone with a Br on C4. That implies perhaps some kind of ring-opening or substitution, but again, I don't think that's the case.

Options A and D are both 1,2-dibromo derivatives with the OH group. The difference is in the stereochemistry.

So, the main outcome is the addition of Br across the double bond, giving a vicinal dibromide along with the existing OH group.

So the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Now, the stereochemistry: the addition is anti, so the Brs are on opposite sides.

But wait, the starting material's configuration—how is the double bond oriented? Let's imagine the cyclopentene ring. The OH is on C1. So when looking down the C1-C2 bond, the OH is on one side, and the ring is on the other.

When Br2 adds, the Brs will add to opposite faces. So, the Br on C1 will be on the opposite side from the Br on C2.

Wait, but the starting material's geometry could affect the outcome. But without specific information about E or Z, I think the reaction just gives a racemic mixture or some diastereomers.

Wait, but the options have specific configurations. So perhaps the starting material has a certain configuration that leads to a specific outcome.

Alternatively, maybe the enol form allows for some kind of conjugate addition, but I don't think so. Br2 tends to add directly to the double bond.

Wait, but wait a second. Enols can undergo bromination via an electrophilic attack. But in this case, the double bond is conjugated with the OH, so perhaps the Br adds in a way that involves the OH.

Wait, maybe the reaction is more of a dihydroxylation, but no, bromine adds as Br across the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol is more reactive, leading to a different pathway. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe it's a bromohydrin formation, but that requires a different setup, like with water and an acid catalyst. Hmm, no, because the question is about Br2.

So, sticking with the initial thought: the product is a 1,2-dibromide with the existing OH group, leading to options A or D.

Now, the stereochemistry: the addition of Br is anti. So, the Br on C1 would be on the opposite side of the Br on C2.

But the OH is on C1. So, the configuration around C1 and C2 would determine the R/S configurations.

Wait, let's imagine the addition. The bromine adds to the double bond so that the two Brs are on opposite faces. The ring is planar around the double bond, so the Brs add top and bottom.

So, for C1 and C2:

Assume that the double bond is in the s-cis or s-trans conformation. But in the enol, the substituents are arranged such that the OH is on the same face as the methyl groups.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. Let's think about the possible products.

The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. Let's imagine that the double bond is between C1 and C2, with the OH on C1. So the structure is as follows:

C1 has a double bond to C2, an OH group, and two ring bonds (to C5 and C2). C2 has a double bond to C1, and two ring bonds (to C1 and C3). C4 has two methyl groups.

When Br2 adds, the Brs will add across the double bond. So C1 gets a Br, and C2 gets a Br, and they are anti.

So the product will have Br on C1 and C2, and the OH on C1.

So looking at options A and D.

Option A: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Option D: (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

So the question is about the configuration—whether the Brs are on the same face (leading to R,R) or opposite (R,S).

Wait, but in the addition of Br2, the Brs add anti, so if the Br on C1 is on the same face as the OH, then the Br on C2 will be opposite to that, leading to a trans arrangement.

Wait, perhaps it's better to assign configurations.

Let's imagine the starting material: the OH is on C1. When looking at C1, the OH is on one side. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So when Br adds, the Br on C1 will be on the opposite side of the OH (since addition is anti). Then, the Br on C2 will be on the same side as the Br on C1, but for the opposite position.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules to determine R/S configurations.

For C1: the substituents are Br, OH, and two ring carbons (C5 and C2, which are part of the ring). The ring carbons are considered as CH2 groups perhaps.

Wait, but in the product, after addition, C1 has Br, OH, and two ring bonds (C5 and C2). Similarly, C2 has Br, and two ring bonds (C3 and C1).

Wait, but the ring is cyclopentane, so each carbon is connected to two other ring carbons.

So, for C1: substituents are Br, OH, and two CH2 (or CH) groups (from the ring). The priority order would be OH (highest, since O has higher atomic number than Br and C), then Br, then the two ring carbons (since CH2 groups have lower priority than Br and OH). So the configuration at C1 is determined by the arrangement of Br, OH, and the two ring substituents.

But perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the product structures again.

In option A, the configuration is (1R,2S). So C1 is R, C2 is S.

In option D, it's (1R,2R).

So which one would the anti addition lead to?

In the addition, the Brs add to opposite faces. So, if the OH is on the same face as one Br, the other Br would be on the opposite face.

Wait, perhaps drawing a Newman projection would help. Let's imagine the double bond is between C1 and C2.

In a cyclopentene ring, the substituents are arranged in a certain way. Let's say that the OH is on the same face as the Br that adds to C1. Then, the Br on C2 would be on the opposite face.

Wait, but I'm not making progress here. Let me think about the possible stereochemistry.

The addition is anti, so the Brs are trans to each other. So the Br on C1 and C2 would be on opposite sides.

But since the starting material's OH is on C1, whether the Br adds to the same face as the OH or the opposite?

Wait, in the starting enol, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The OH is on C1, and is part of the conjugated system. So the OH's position affects where the Br adds.

Alternatively, perhaps the OH is in a position that makes the addition of Br favor a particular stereochemistry.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think of the product as a vicinal dihalide with the OH group on C1.

The major outcome is that the OH is on C1, and the Brs are on C1 and C2, anti to each other.

So, in the product, the Br on C1 is on the opposite side of the Br on C2.

But without knowing the exact starting structure's configuration, it's hard to assign R/S.

Wait, but maybe the starting material's configuration leads to a specific outcome.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a trans-dibromide.

Wait, another approach: the options A and D have different configurations. The correct product would have the Brs in a trans configuration.

Wait, but the addition of Br2 leads to a trans addition. So the Brs are on opposite sides.

So the product would have a trans configuration between C1 and C2.

But determining whether each center is R or S depends on the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B or C, but I don't think so because those are ketones, implying oxidation or ring opening, which doesn't match the reaction with Br2.

So, the major outcome is the addition of Br across the double bond, leading to a 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Now, considering the options, the only two possibilities are A and D.

The starting material's configuration determines the stereochemistry of the product.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a trans-dihalide, so the Brs are on opposite sides.

So, for C1 and C2, the Brs are trans.

But the OH is on C1. So, the configuration at C1 would be R or S, and similarly for C2.

Wait, another thought: maybe the addition doesn't change the configuration of the substituents. For example, the OH is on the same face as one Br, and the other Br is on the opposite.

But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps the correct answer is A or D.

Wait, another approach: the reaction is between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. Enols can sometimes undergo electrophilic attack at the carbonyl, but in this case, the bromine is adding to the double bond.

So, the product would be 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Looking at the options, that's options A and D.

Now, the stereochemistry. Let's imagine the starting material's double bond is in a certain configuration. Let's say that the enol form has the OH on the same side as the two methyl groups on C4.

So, when Br2 adds, the Brs would add to opposite faces. So, C1 would have Br on one side, and C2 would have Br on the opposite.

But how does that translate to R/S configuration?

Alternatively, perhaps the product would have the Brs in a certain configuration.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A. Let me think: if the Br on C1 is on the same side as the OH, and the Br on C2 is on the opposite, that would lead to a certain configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the diastereomer would form.

But I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is option B or C, but I don't think so. The options A and D are the only ones with the OH group.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A or D. But which one?

Wait, another point: the enol form can rearrange into the keto form upon reaction. But with Br2, perhaps it doesn't do that.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a diol with Br substitution. So, perhaps the product is 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, with the stereochemistry determined by the anti addition.

Based on the options, the correct answer is either A or D.

Wait, perhaps the addition leads to both Brs being on the same side relative to the ring. Or opposite.

Wait, another approach: in bromine addition to cyclopentene, the bromine adds across the double bond in a trans fashion, leading to a trans dibromide.

So, the diastereomer formed would have the Brs on opposite sides.

But in this case, the enol has an OH group on C1. The Br on C1 would be on the opposite side of the OH due to the anti addition.

So, considering the configuration of C1 and C2.

At C1: substituents are OH, Br, and two ring carbons (C5 and C2).

At C2: substituents are Br, and two ring carbons (C1 and C3).

Wait, but for the configuration at C1:

The priority order is: 1. OH (O), 2. Br, 3. C5, 4. C2.

Wait, but the two ring substituents (C5 and C2) are both CH2 groups (since it's a ring), so their priority would be lower than Br and OH.

Wait, but in the molecule, the OH is on C1, the Br on C1 is added, and the two ring bonds are to C5 and C2.

So, when determining the configuration of C1, the substituents are:

1. OH (highest priority)

2. Br (next)

3. C5 (ring, lower priority)

4. C2 (ring, same as C5?)

Wait, but in the case where two substituents are the same (like C5 and C2, which are both CH2 groups), the next determining factor is the next substituent in the chain. But in this context, since they're both part of the ring, their priorities might be considered equal, so we might need to look at the next substituent.

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's think about the possible product.

If the Br adds in a way that the Br on C1 is on the opposite side of the OH, then when we look at the configuration, the OH is in the front, Br is behind, and the ring substituents are on the sides.

Similarly, for C2, the Br is on a certain side.

But without the actual spatial arrangement, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

Wait, that would suggest that the double bond was opened in a way that the OH group is converted into a ketone, and a Br is added.

But how? That would require the OH to be oxidized. But bromine isn't typically an oxidizing agent in such a way. Unless it's a different reaction, like a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's with other reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an electrophilic addition where the OH group is involved. But I don't see how that would lead to a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the enol form undergoes bromination on the carbonyl carbon. But no, the enol doesn't have a carbonyl; it's an enol.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition, but that would require an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, which this isn't.

Hmm... I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should go back.

The question is about the reaction between an enol and bromine. The enol is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol.

The options are:

A) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol

B) 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone

C) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone

D) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol

From what I know, bromine adds across double bonds in a vicinal dibromide. So options A and D are the only ones that fit, as B and C involve a ketone, which would require a different reaction pathway, such as oxidation, which doesn't seem to be the case here.

Thus, the product should be a vicinal dibromide with the OH group.

Now, the stereochemistry: the addition is anti, so the Brs are on opposite faces.

So, the product has the Brs in a trans configuration.

But the options A and D have different configurations.

Option A has (1R,2S), which is opposite configurations (trans), and option D has (1R,2R), which is same (cis).

Wait, no. (1R,2S) would be across for each configuration. Let me think about the arrangement.

Wait, if C1 is R and C2 is S, that means the substituents are arranged in a certain way. Alternatively, if both are R, that's a different arrangement.

But since the Br addition is anti, the Br on C1 and C2 are on opposite sides.

Let me imagine that OH is on the same face as the Br on C1. Then, the Br on C2 would be on the opposite face.

Now, looking at C1 and C2:

For C1, the substituents are OH (front), Br (back), and the two ring carbons (left and right). So, priority-wise, the highest is OH, then Br, then the two ring carbons.

The arrangement around C1 would be: OH in front, Br behind, and the two ring groups on the left and right. The priority order is OH (1), Br (2), then the two ring groups (3 and 4). So, for the configuration, we look at the order of substituents clockwise or counterclockwise.

If looking from the front (OH in front), the substituents go Br (behind, 2), then ring group (3), then another ring group (4). So, if the order is Br, ring, ring, that would be either R or S.

Wait, perhaps I can draw a simple model.

Let me imagine C1: substituents are OH (front), Br (back), and two CH2 groups (left and right).

In the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system, the priorities are 1 (OH), 2 (Br), 3 (CH2 left), 4 (CH2 right).

When ranking, the substituents are arranged in the order of priority. For C1:

The highest priority is OH (front). The next is Br (back). The third is CH2 left (let's say left as third), and the fourth is CH2 right.

Now, looking at the arrangement, the order of substituents when moving counterclockwise from the highest priority (OH) is: Br (behind), CH2 left (left), CH2 right (right), and back to OH.

Wait, but this is getting complicated without a diagram.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration at C1 would be R if the substituents are arranged in a way that the highest priority (OH) is in the front, Br is behind, and the two CH2 groups are left and right. So, the order would be OH, Br, CH2 left, CH2 right, making a counterclockwise arrangement, which would be R configuration.

Similarly, for C2: substituents are Br, and two CH2 groups (from C1 and C3).

So, the priorities are Br (1), then the two CH2 groups. The arrangement would be Br in front, and the CH2 groups on either side.

At C2, if the Br is in front, and the two ring substituents are on the left and right, the configuration would be determined by the order of substituents when moving counterclockwise from Br.

If the Br is front, and the two CH2 groups are left and right, the arrangement would be Br (1), CH2 left (2), CH2 right (3), and the fourth substituent (back) would be the ring connection. But this is getting too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the configurations at C1 and C2 are R and S, respectively.

But I'm not entirely sure. However, based on the anti addition, the product would have trans Brs, leading to a diastereomer with opposite configurations.

Looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S), which fits the scenario where the Brs are trans, leading to opposite configurations. Option D is (1R,2R), which would imply the Brs are on the same face, which is not the case in anti addition.

So, the correct answer should be option A: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.


The reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine involves the addition of bromine across the double bond in the enol structure. This is a typical electrophilic addition reaction where bromine adds across the double bond in a vicinal fashion, with the bromine atoms adding to opposite sides of the double bond (anti addition). The starting material, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, has a double bond between C1 and C2, with an hydroxyl group (-OH) on C1 and two methyl groups on C4.

When bromine adds across the double bond, a vicinal dibromide is formed. The product will have bromine atoms on C1 and C2, with the hydroxyl group remaining on C1. The stereochemistry of the product is determined by the anti addition of bromine, which places the bromine atoms on opposite faces of the ring. This results in a trans configuration between the bromine atoms.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. This option describes a product where the bromine atoms are in a trans configuration, consistent with the anti addition of bromine. The (1R,2S) configuration aligns with the stereochemical outcome of the reaction.
- **Option B**: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. This product suggests the formation of a ketone, which would require oxidation of the enol. However, bromine does not act as an oxidizing agent in this context, making this option unlikely.
- **Option C**: 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. Similar to Option B, this product implies oxidation to a ketone, which is not consistent with the reaction conditions.
- **Option D**: (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol. This option describes a product where the bromine atoms are in a cis configuration. However, this contradicts the anti addition mechanism of bromine, making this option incorrect.

The correct product is (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, as described in Option A. This is consistent with the anti addition of bromine across the double bond and the resulting trans configuration of the bromine atoms.
