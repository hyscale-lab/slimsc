Okay, so I've got this question about molecular symmetry, and I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that C3h symmetry is a type of point group in molecular symmetry. Point groups describe the symmetry elements a molecule has. 

Wait, C3h... yeah, I think C3h is the same as the D3h point group but without the inversion. Or was that different? No, wait. The point groups are usually named based on the principal axis and other symmetry elements. C3h has a principal C3 axis, a horizontal mirror plane, and maybe other elements like C2 axes perpendicular to the principal axis.

So I need to look at each molecule's structure and see if it matches the C3h symmetry. Let's list the options again:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

I remember that triphenylene is a molecule with a certain symmetry. Triphenylborate is [B(C6H5)3], which I think has a trigonal planar structure because boron is in the center with three phenyl groups. Wait, but triisopropyl borate is boron with three isopropyl groups. Is isopropyl similar to phenyl in terms of symmetry? Let's think. Triisopropyl borate would have a central boron connected to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is a substituent. So the molecule would have a trigonal planar geometry, but does it have a plane of symmetry? Let me visualize it. Each isopropyl group is identical, so the molecule should have a three-fold rotational axis (C3). Are there any mirror planes? Well, if you look from the top, there's a plane perpendicular to the C3 axis that bisects two of the isopropyl groups. So I think triisopropyl borate has C3 symmetry but maybe not C3h? Because I'm not sure if it has a horizontal mirror plane. Hmm.

Quinuclidine is another molecule. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic structure, I think it's a cube-like structure with a bridge. Its structure is similar to that of adamantane. Quinuclidine has a certain symmetry. I remember that it's a tetrahedral structure, but what's its point group? I think quinuclidine has a C3 axis because the molecule is three-fold symmetric. Wait, no, quinuclidine has a C4 axis, or maybe it's C2. Alternatively, perhaps it's in the Td point group, but that's for tetrahedral. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up. Or perhaps quinuclidine is in the C2h symmetry. Not sure. I'll have to come back to that.

The other options are more complex: the benzo... and triphenyleno... structures. These are fused ring systems. Let me think about benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran. So the benzo part is a benzene ring fused with three furan rings, I guess. Wait, the numbering might be a bit complicated. Alternatively, these compounds are tricyclic systems. Do they have three-fold symmetry? Let me try to imagine their structures.

Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. So benzo refers to a benzene ring, and the rest are furan rings. The substituents are at positions 1,3,4,6,7,9. Wait, the 'trifuran' part suggests three fused furan rings. So maybe it's a structure where benzene is fused to three furan rings in such a way that there's a central point with three-fold symmetry. If the molecule has three identical substituents around a central point, that might give C3 symmetry.

Similarly, triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran... So that's a triphenylene part fused to three furan rings, perhaps. Triphenylene is a tricyclic molecule with three benzene rings fused in a symmetric way. If the triphenylene part is symmetric, then attaching three furan rings might preserve that symmetry. So perhaps this molecule has a higher symmetry, maybe C3h.

Wait, so what's C3h symmetry? C3h has a principal C3 axis, a horizontal mirror plane (sigma h), and maybe three C2 axes perpendicular to the principal axis. So the molecule should have a three-fold rotational symmetry and also a horizontal mirror plane.

Now, considering each option:

Option C: triisopropyl borate. It's [B(CH(CH3)2)3]. So the structure is a central boron with three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is the same, so the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis. Does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If the molecule is symmetric across a plane that includes the boron and bisects two isopropyl groups, then yes. So that would give C3h symmetry. Because the structure is trigonal planar, with each substituent the same, and a mirror plane perpendicular to the C3 axis.

Wait, wait. No, wait. For C3h, the main axis is C3, and the mirror plane is sigma h, which is a horizontal plane. So for a molecule like triisopropyl borate, which is planar around the B, the mirror plane would be perpendicular to the C3 axis (i.e., vertical), not horizontal. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the terms. Let me think again. The C3 axis is going through the boron and perpendicular to the plane. So a horizontal mirror plane would be parallel to the plane of the molecule. Does triisopropyl have that?

Wait, in triisopropyl borate, the three isopropyl groups are all in the same plane as the boron, right? So imagine looking down the C3 axis (along boron), the substituents are arranged in a trigonal planar fashion. The mirror plane would be a plane that includes the C3 axis, like a vertical plane. So that would be a sigma v plane, not sigma h. So without a horizontal mirror plane, the symmetry would be C3v, perhaps, but not C3h. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. I'm not so sure now.

Alternatively, perhaps triphenylene derivatives have C3h symmetry. Let's think about the structures. Triphenylene itself is a symmetric molecule with three benzene rings arranged in a symmetric way. If the substituents are attached symmetrically, the molecule would have C3h symmetry.

Looking at option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Hmmm. The benzo part suggests a benzene ring fused to the furans. If the way the rings are connected is symmetric, maybe this molecule has a three-fold symmetry. Let's imagine the structure. The molecule might have three substituents at positions that are each 120 degrees apart, leading to C3 symmetry. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Alternatively, option A: triphenyleno[...]trifuran... So it's a triphenylene fused with three furan rings. Triphenylene itself has a three-fold symmetry, so if the trifuran is attached symmetrically, it might retain that symmetry. So perhaps this molecule has a C3h symmetry.

Wait, another approach: think about the number of symmetry elements. C3h has a C3 axis, a horizontal mirror plane, and three C2 axes perpendicular to C3. So the molecule should have these elements.

Benzo[1,2-c:...]trifuran might not have a three-fold symmetry. Maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that doesn't allow for 120-degree rotations. Alternatively, triphenyleno... might.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about each molecule one by one.

Option C: triisopropylborate. Structure is trigonal planar. Each isopropyl is identical, so it has a C3 axis. Any mirror planes? It has three planes that include the C3 axis (sigma v planes), but does it have a sigma h plane? The sigma h would be a horizontal plane, like cutting through the center. In this molecule, the boron is in the center, and the isopropyl groups are all in the same plane. So a horizontal plane through the boron would reflect each substituent onto itself. Wait, but each isopropyl group is itself symmetric. So yes, I think there is a sigma h plane. So the molecule would have C3h symmetry. Because the mirror plane is perpendicular to the C3 axis, wait no—sigma h is a horizontal plane. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe I should look up what the actual symmetry of triisopropyl borate is. But I can't look it up right now. Alternatively, I can think about whether the molecule is centrosymmetric. Triisopropyl borate: if you have a central boron, and three identical substituents. If the molecule is nonpolar, it might have inversion symmetry. But I'm not sure. Wait, C3h has a sigma h plane and a C3 axis. So if the molecule is symmetric across a horizontal plane, then yes. Let me imagine looking down the C3 axis. The substituents are arranged in a circle. A horizontal mirror plane would mean that each substituent is mirrored across that plane. But in a trigonal planar arrangement, the mirror plane would cut through each substituent, but perhaps that's not possible. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: if a molecule has C3h symmetry, it cannot have a center of inversion, because C3h is in the same family as the D3h group, which is a subgroup of Oh. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the groups. Alternatively, maybe triisopropyl borate has a higher symmetry than C3h, like D3h or something else.

Alternatively, for the other compounds. Let's think about quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bridge structure. I think it has a C3 axis. Let me think of the structure. Quinuclidine is like a cube where one corner is replaced by a bridge. So the molecule has three bridges. If the molecule has a three-fold rotational axis, then it would have C3 symmetry. Does it have a mirror plane? If it does, then maybe C3v or C3h. Alternatively, perhaps it has C2h symmetry. Not sure.

The other options are the benzo and triphenylene derivatives. Triphenylene is a molecule with three benzene rings connected in a way that forms a symmetric structure. Its point group is D6h, I think. Or perhaps C3h. Wait, triphenylene has three benzene rings arranged in a trigonal fashion. So it has a three-fold symmetry. If the molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then it would have C3h symmetry. But triphenylene itself might have higher symmetry, like D3h.

Wait, but the options are different. Option A is triphenyleno fused to trifuran. So it's a more complex structure. Let's imagine that the triphenylene part imparts the three-fold symmetry, and the trifuran is attached in a symmetric way. So perhaps the entire molecule has a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane, making it C3h.

Option B is benzo fused to trifuran. If the benzo part is a single benzene ring, then the fusion with trifuran might not have three-fold symmetry. For example, if the benzo is attached in a way that breaks the three-fold symmetry, then the molecule would have lower symmetry. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar structure, with three identical substituents. It has a three-fold rotational axis (C3). Does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Let's visualize the molecule. If you imagine a plane that is perpendicular to the C3 axis (so vertical), then it would act as a mirror plane. But that's a sigma v plane, not sigma h. Wait, the C3h point group requires a horizontal mirror plane. So if the molecule has a sigma h plane, then it's C3h.

Wait, how do I determine if there's a horizontal mirror plane? In triisopropyl borate, looking from the top, the boron is at the center, and the three isopropyl groups are arranged around it. A horizontal plane cutting through the boron would reflect each isopropyl group onto itself. Because each isopropyl group is itself symmetric, the reflection would leave the molecule unchanged. So yes, that would be a sigma h plane. So the molecule would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but wait. The sigma h plane in C3h is perpendicular to the principal C3 axis, or is it parallel? No, the sigma h is a horizontal plane. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the terminology.

Wait, the principal axis in C3h is the C3 axis, which is along the z-axis, say. The sigma h plane is the xy plane. So if the molecule is symmetric across the xy plane, then it would have a sigma h. For triisopropyl borate, the molecule is in the xy plane (the three substituents are around the boron in the plane). So a horizontal plane through the boron would reflect each substituent onto itself. So each isopropyl group is symmetric upon reflection across that plane. So yes, the molecule has a sigma h plane, making its symmetry C3h.

So looking at the options, option C is triisopropyl borate, which would have C3h symmetry. Then which other options?

Wait, let me think again. If triisopropyl borate has C3h symmetry, then option C is correct. What about the other options? Let's check quinuclidine. Quinuclidine's structure is a bridged bicyclic system. It has a three-fold axis but perhaps without a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe it has a sigma h plane. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure.

But among the options, I think the correct answer is option C: triisopropyl borate has C3h symmetry.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h symmetry**, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry elements. C₃h symmetry consists of a principal **C₃ axis** (a three-fold rotational axis), a **horizontal mirror plane (σh)**, and three **C₂ axes** perpendicular to the principal axis.

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule is a fusion of a triphenylene core (a symmetric tricyclic structure) with three furan rings. The triphenylene core itself has **C₃ symmetry** due to its three-fold rotational symmetry. If the trifuran rings are attached symmetrically, the molecule retains **C₃h symmetry**, as it would have a horizontal mirror plane and a three-fold rotational axis. This option is a strong candidate for **C₃h symmetry**.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule consists of a benzene ring fused with three furan rings. The benzene ring introduces asymmetry, as it disrupts the three-fold rotational symmetry required for **C₃h symmetry**. Without a symmetric arrangement of substituents, this molecule does not exhibit **C₃h symmetry**.

### Option C: Triisopropyl borate  
Triisopropyl borate ([B(CH(CH₃)₂)₃]) has a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups. The molecule is **trigonal planar**, with a **C₃ axis** (three-fold rotational symmetry) and a **horizontal mirror plane (σh)** that reflects each isopropyl group onto itself. This satisfies the requirements for **C₃h symmetry**, making this molecule a strong candidate.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bridged structure. While it has a **C₃ axis**, it lacks a **horizontal mirror plane (σh)** due to the asymmetry introduced by the bridge. Therefore, it does not exhibit **C₃h symmetry**.

### Conclusion  
Both **Option A** (triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone) and **Option C** (triisopropyl borate) exhibit **C₃h symmetry**. However, triisopropyl borate is simpler and unambiguously satisfies the criteria for **C₃h symmetry**. Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
