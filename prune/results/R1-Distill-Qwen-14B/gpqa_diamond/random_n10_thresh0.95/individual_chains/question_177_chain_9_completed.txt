Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star 1 and Star 2. The info given is that Star 1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star 2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh right, that's about the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation.

So, the first thing I remember is Wien's Law, which says that the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature of the blackbody. The formula is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, T would be the same. Wait, but wait a second. Because the only factor in Wien's law is temperature. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, the temperatures T1 and T2 are equal.

Wait, but what about other factors like radius and mass? The mass might not directly affect the peak wavelength, but maybe the radius does through the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates luminosity, radius, and temperature.

Stefan-Boltzmann law says L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So luminosity depends on R squared and T to the fourth power.

Since both stars have the same T (since λ_max is same), the luminosity ratio L1/L2 would be (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴). But since T1 = T2, the T terms cancel out. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)².

But wait, R1 is 1.5 times R2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Therefore, (R1/R2)² is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 should be 2.25 times L2. Oh, but the options have A as ~2.25, D as ~2.23, and others. Hmm, but wait I think I might be missing something here.

Wait, the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity based on blackbody radiation. Oh, but wait, the question also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to Doppler effect. But the problem states that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the actual emitted wavelengths are different, but due to Doppler shift, they appear the same.

Wait, so the peak emission wavelength from each star would be different, but due to their velocities, the observed wavelength is the same. So I need to adjust for the Doppler shift when calculating their temperatures.

Oh right, because Doppler effect shifts the wavelength. The formula for Doppler shift is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), assuming v_r is much less than c, so using the approximation. Alternatively, for radial velocity v, the observed wavelength is λ0 (1 + v_r / c), where c is speed of light. But wait, the exact formula depends on the direction of motion. If a star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter (blue shift); moving away, it's longer (red shift).

Let me think. So Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so its observed wavelength is the same as emitted. Star_2 has radial velocity 700 km/s. But wait, which direction? The problem just says 700 km/s, but I think it's a radial velocity, which could be either towards or away. But the problem doesn't specify direction, so perhaps it's moving away, so the observed wavelength is longer. Or moving towards, making observed wavelength shorter. But in any case, the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars.

So the emitted wavelengths (λ_emit) would be different because of their velocities. Let me denote λ1 as the emitted peak wavelength of Star_1, and λ2 as that of Star_2.

Since Star_1's observed wavelength is λ1, because v_r is 0. So λ1_obs = λ1.

Star_2's observed wavelength is λ2_obs = λ2 * (1 + v_r / c), assuming v_r is the component along the line of sight. But wait, the exact Doppler formula for wavelength shift when the source is moving with velocity v is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c), where v is positive if moving away (redshift), negative if moving towards (blueshift). But wait, the problem says Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so λ1_obs = λ1.

Star_2 has radial velocity 700 km/s. Let's say that's v. So the observed wavelength for Star_2 is λ2_obs = λ2 * (1 + v/c), assuming v is positive if moving away. But wait, the problem says that λ1_obs and λ2_obs are the same. So λ1 = λ2_obs = λ2 * (1 + v/c).

But according to Wien's law, the emitted wavelengths are λ1 = b / T1, and λ2 = b / T2. So if T1 and T2 are the same, λ1 would equal λ2. But in reality, λ1_obs = λ2_obs, so perhaps the emitted wavelengths are different and adjusted by Doppler.

Wait, maybe I should model this properly. Let's denote:

λ1_obs = λ1 (since v_r1 = 0)
λ2_obs = λ2 * (1 + v_r2 / c ) [v_r2 is 700 km/s]

But according to the problem, λ1_obs = λ2_obs. So:

λ1 = λ2 * (1 + v_r2 / c )

But from Wien's law, λ1 = b / T1 and λ2 = b / T2.

So:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Wait, no: rearranging,

(1/T1) = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Multiply both sides by T2:

T2/(T1) = (1 + v_r2/c )

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

But wait, that would mean T2 is higher than T1 if v_r2 is positive (i.e., moving away, redshift). Because if the star is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer, which would imply a lower temperature. Hmm, perhaps I messed up the formula.

Wait, let me re-derive the Doppler effect. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away at speed v is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c ), where v is positive if moving away, and c is the speed of light. Since v is much smaller than c, the approximation holds.

So if Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, then λ2_obs = λ2 * (1 + v/c )

But λ1_obs is equal to λ2_obs, so λ1 = λ2 * (1 + v/c )

But from Wien's law, λ1 = b / T1 and λ2 = b / T2.

So substituting, b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v/c )

Cancel b from both sides: 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v/c )

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c )

Wait, but this suggests that T2 is higher than T1. But that feels a bit counterintuitive. Because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer, implying a lower temperature. Because a longer wavelength (redshift) means lower temperature. Hmm, maybe I got the relation wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps when the star is moving away (v positive), the observed wavelength is longer, which implies lower temperature, so T_obs = T_emit / (1 + v/c ), right? Because a longer wavelength (lower temp) would suggest T_obs is lower.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of observed temperature. If Star_2 is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted, so the observed temperature would be lower. Because Wien's law says λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to find the observed temperature. Because the observed peak wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r/c ), but the observed temperature would be T_obs = T_emit / (1 + v_r/c ). Because λ_obs = b / T_obs = b / (T_emit / (1 + v_r/c )) ) = (b (1 + v_r/c )) ) / T_emit = (1 + v_r/c ) * (b / T_emit ) = (1 + v_r/c ) * λ_emit.

So T_obs = T_emit / (1 + v_r/c ).

Wait, but in the problem, the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars. So for Star_1, observed wavelength is λ1_emit, since v_r1=0. For Star_2, observed wavelength is λ2_emit * (1 + v_r2/c ). And λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r2/c ).

But according to the problem, both observed wavelengths are the same (λ1_obs = λ2_obs). So λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r2/c )

Wait, then in terms of temperature:

λ1_emit = b / T1
λ2_emit = b / T2

So, substituting:

b / T1 = [b / T2 ] * (1 + v_r2/c )

Cancel b: 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

=> T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

But that would imply that T2 is larger than T1 if v_r2 is positive (moving away). But if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer than emitted, implying lower temperature. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the observed temperature is T_obs = T_emit * sqrt( (1 - v_r/c ) / (1 + v_r/c )) ). But maybe it's better to approach this using the relation between observed and emitted temperatures.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So for Star_1, λ_max = λ1 = b / T1. For Star_2, the observed λ_max is λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r2/c ), and this equals λ1.

So,

λ2_emit * (1 + v_r2/c ) = λ1 = b / T1

But λ2_emit = b / T2.

So,

(b / T2) * (1 + v_r2/c ) = b / T1

Cancel b:

1/(T2) * (1 + v_r2/c ) = 1/T1

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

But wait, this would mean that T2 is larger than T1 if v_r2 is positive (since denominator is greater than 1, making T1 smaller than T2). So T2 is higher.

Wait, but that would mean that Star_2 is hotter than Star_1 because it's moving away. But if Star_2 is moving away, wouldn't that make it appear cooler? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think again.

Let me try plugging in the numbers. Let's say v_r2 is 700 km/s. The speed of light c is about 3e5 km/s. So v_r2/c is about 700/(3e5) ≈ 0.0023333. So 1 + v_r2/c ≈ 1.002333.

So, T1 = T2 / (1.002333) ≈ T2 * 0.99767.

So T2 is about 0.23% higher than T1.

Wait, but how does that affect the luminosity calculation?

The luminosity is given by L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So L1 = 4π (R1)^2 σ T1^4
L2 = 4π (R2)^2 σ T2^4

We need to find L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4

We know R1 = 1.5 R2, so (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

We have T1 = T2 / (1.002333) = T2 * (0.99767), so T1/T2 = 0.99767.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.99767)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which would be about 2.23. So the answer should be D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, when the star is moving away (v positive), the observed wavelength is longer, which would imply a cooler temperature. So if the observed wavelengths are same for both stars, then Star_2 must have a higher temperature than Star_1 to compensate for the redshift. Because when Star_2 emits at a shorter wavelength (higher temperature), the Doppler shift makes it appear at the same wavelength as Star_1, which has a lower temperature.

So, with T2 being higher than T1, the calculation for L1/L2 would be (1.5)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

But according to the calculation, T1 = T2 / (1.002333) = T2 * 0.99767. So T1 is slightly smaller than T2.

So (T1/T2)^4 is (1/1.002333)^4 ≈ (0.99767)^4 ≈ approx 0.9907.

So 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228. Which is approximately 2.23. So the correct option is D.

So the initial approach without considering Doppler shift would give 2.25, but considering the Doppler effect, the actual ratio is a bit less, around 2.23.


To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5
\]

Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The problem also states that the observed peak wavelengths of the two stars are the same. Using Wien's law:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

where \(b\) is Wien's displacement constant. For the observed wavelengths to be the same, the emitted wavelengths must differ due to the Doppler effect. The observed wavelength for Star_2 is redshifted because it has a radial velocity of \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\). The Doppler shift formula is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

For Star_1, \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,1}}\) (since \(v_r = 0\)), and for Star_2, \(\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)\). Since \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\), we have:

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

Using Wien's law, \(\lambda_{\text{emit}} = \frac{b}{T}\), we can write:

\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

Canceling \(b\):

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{T_2} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1 + \frac{v_r}{c}
\]

Substituting \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\):

\[
\frac{v_r}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} \approx 1.002333
\]

So:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx \frac{1}{1.002333} \approx 0.99767
\]

### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
Substituting into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot (0.99767)^4
\]

Calculating \((0.99767)^4\):

\[
(0.99767)^4 \approx 0.9907
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.228
\]

### Step 4: Final Answer
The closest option to \(2.228\) is:

**D) ~2.23**

Answer: D
