Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diatomic molecules and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

The question says that the molecule is in its fundamental state and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state. The options are given as A, B, C, D with some numbers.

First, I remember that in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. The molecule's state is described by quantum numbers for both rotation and vibration. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would probably be the first vibrational level and the lowest rotational state.

So when a photon is absorbed, it's probably providing energy to either increase the vibrational state or the rotational state. But the problem states it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. I think that refers to the next state in terms of energy, so the minimal energy increment. That might involve a vibrational transition or a rotational one.

Wait, the fundamental state in vibration is the ground state, n=0. The next state could be n=1, which is the first excited vibrational state. Alternatively, rotationally, the molecule could move from J=0 to J=1, since that's the next rotational state. But which transition gives the lower energy?

I remember that vibrational energy levels have a much larger spacing than rotational ones. So perhaps the rotational transition requires less energy. But wait, the question is about the photon's momentum, which relates to its energy via E = p c, but wait, actually, the photon's momentum is p = E/c. So if the energy required is lower, the momentum would be lower as well.

Wait, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think step by step.

The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the ground state for both vibration and rotation. So the vibrational state is n=0, and rotational state is J=0.

We need to find the photon's momentum that would take it to the next possible state with the lowest energy. The next possible states could be either:

1. The next vibrational state (n=1), same rotational state (J=0).
2. The same vibrational state (n=0), but next rotational state (J=1).
3. Or a combination, but I think the question is about the minimal energy photon, so the minimal energy transition.

So which transition requires less energy: a vibrational transition from n=0 to n=1, or a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1?

I remember that for a diatomic molecule, the vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w, and the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant.

The rotational constant B is given by (h / (8 π² μ R²)), but I might have to compute that. Here, μ is the reduced mass of the molecule.

Wait, the problem gives the masses of X and Y. Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So the reduced mass μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Let me compute that.

Mx is 20, My is 2. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. But wait, 1 amu is about 1.66e-27 kg, so μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ approximately 3.01e-27 kg.

But I'll need to be more precise. Let's calculate μ exactly.

μ = (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.81818 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg ≈ let's see:

1.81818 * 1.660539e-27 ≈ approx 3.011e-27 kg.

Wait, actually, 20/11 is approximately 1.81818. Multiply by 1.6605e-27:

1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 = Let's compute 1.81818 * 1.6605.

1.81818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.011, so 3.011e-27 kg.

Now, the rotational constant B is (h) / (8 π² μ R²). Wait, h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s. R is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

So R squared is (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So B = (6.626e-34) / (8 * π² * μ * R² )

Plugging in the numbers:

Denominator: 8 * (pi^2) * (3.011e-27 kg) * (4e-20 m²) )

First compute denominator:

8 * (approx 9.8696) [since pi²≈9.87] = 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

Multiply by μ: 78.9568 * 3.011e-27 ≈ 78.9568 *3e-27≈ 2.3687e-25; but more accurately, 78.9568 *3.011= about 237.22, so 237.22e-27 kg.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each step accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute each part step by step.

Wait, let's compute the denominator:

Denominator = 8 * π² * μ * R².

Given μ ≈ 3.011e-27 kg, R²=4e-20 m².

So denominator = 8 * (pi)^2 * 3.011e-27 kg * 4e-20 m².

Compute 8 * pi²: 8 * 9.8696 ≈78.9568.

Multiply by 3.011e-27 kg: 78.9568 * 3.011e-27 ≈ let's calculate 78.9568 *3.011 = approx 237.5, so 237.5e-27 kg.

Multiply by 4e-20 m²: 237.5e-27 *4e-20 = 950e-47 kg m².

Wait, 237.5 *4 = 950, so 950e-47 kg m².

So denominator is 950e-47 kg m².

So B = h / denominator. h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So B = (6.626e-34) / (950e-47) ) [J·s / (kg m²)].

Wait, J is kg m²/s², so J·s is kg m²/s.

So unit-wise, J·s / (kg m²) ) → (kg m²/s) / (kg m²) ) → 1/s. So B has units of 1/s, which makes sense as an angular frequency.

Now compute the value:

6.626e-34 / 950e-47 = 6.626e-34 / 9.5e-45 = (6.626 /9.5 ) * 1e11.

6.626 /9.5 ≈ 0.7.

So approx 0.7e11 → 7e10 1/s.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

6.626 /9.5 = approximately 0.69
