--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two specific spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Let's try to work through this step by step.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. The question is about which stars can be observed by both spectrographs. The key is to find the stars that are bright enough for both instruments. So I should probably look at the magnitude limits of each spectrograph.

From the question, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. That means any star with a V magnitude less than or equal to 17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. On the other hand, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be <=16, because HIRES only goes up to 16, but wait, no. Wait, I need to clarify: the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. Brighter than 17 means magnitude less than 17. Similarly, for HIRES, brighter than 16 V mag means app mag less than 16.

Wait, wait, magnitude works in a way where lower numbers are brighter. So, if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that's m < 17. For HIRES, brighter than 16, so m <16.

So a star must have apparent V magnitude less than 16 to be seen by HIRES. And less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO. So to be detected by both, the star must have apparent V magnitude <=16, because that's the stricter condition.

Now, each star's info is given. Let's go through each star.

Star1: It has absolute V mag 15.5 and is at 10 pc. I think I need to calculate its apparent magnitude. The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d), where d is distance in parsecs. Wait, no, the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d) - 5. Because the absolute magnitude M is the apparent mag at 10 pc. So for d=10 pc, m = M.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The formula is m - M = 5 log10 (d) - 5. So m = M + 5 (log10 d) -5. For d=10 pc, log10(10) =1, so m = M +5*1 -5 = M. So Star1 has M=15.5, so m=15.5. So apparent V mag is 15.5. That's less than 16, so HIRES can detect it. ESPRESSO can too since 15.5 <17.

Star2: Apparent V mag is 16.5. Wait, that's 16.5, which is greater than 16. So HIRES can't detect it because its limit is m <16. ESPRESSO can detect it, because 16.5 <17? No, wait, no. Wait, ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. So m <17. Star2 has m=16.5 which is less than 17, so ESPRESSO can. But HIRES requires m <16. Star2's m=16.5 is more than 16, so HIRES can't. So Star2 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, not both.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5, but there's extinction. The E(B-V) is 0.6 mag. The question says that the total absorption in V is related with E(B-V) via a coefficient of 3.1. So, I think that means extinction A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. So the observed apparent magnitude is the intrinsic m plus the extinction. Wait, wait, no. Wait, extinction makes stars appear fainter. So if the star's true apparent magnitude without extinction is m0, then with extinction, it's m = m0 + A_V.

Wait, but wait, Star3's given apparent V magnitude is already considering the extinction? Or is it the observed m? Hmm, the problem says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag" and "E(B-V)=0.6 mag." So I think the given 15.5 is the observed (apparent) magnitude, which includes extinction. Wait, no. Because E(B-V) is the color excess, which is due to interstellar reddening. So the extinction A_V is 3.1 * E(B-V). So the actual star's light is dimmed, making it appear fainter. So if the star's true magnitude is m0, then what we observe is m = m0 + A_V.

Wait, but wait, the way it's worded: Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but the extinction is 0.6 in E(B-V), so A_V is 3.1 *0.6 =1.86. So without extinction, the apparent magnitude would be m0 = m - A_V =15.5 -1.86 =13.64. But the question is about what the stars' apparent V magnitudes are when observed. So for detection, it's the observed apparent magnitude. Because if the star appears too faint because of extinction, then it's not detected.

Wait, but wait, the initial problem states the apparent V magnitudes, so Star3's m is given as 15.5, which already includes extinction. So for the purpose of the question, when we're determining if the spectrographs can detect it, we use the given apparent magnitude, which is 15.5. So that's less than 16, so HIRES can. And less than 17, so ESPRESSO can. So Star3 is detectable by both.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the question again. Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6. The note says that the total absorption in V is 3.1 * E(B-V). So perhaps the given 15.5 is the intrinsic magnitude, and the observed would be higher. Because if the star is behind dust, its observed magnitude would be m = m_intrinsic + A_V.

Wait, no, that's conflicting. The question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag". So that's the observed magnitude. So the extinction would make it appear fainter, but wait that's not how it works. Wait, extinction (absorption and scattering) causes the star to appear dimmer, so the apparent magnitude would be higher (fainter) than the intrinsic. So if the star's true (intrinsic) m is 15.5, then with A_V=1.86, the observed m would be 15.5 + 1.86 =17.36. Which is greater than 17. Then, ESPRESSO can't see it because it can observe stars brighter than 17 (m <17). So Star3's observed m is 17.36, so it's too faint for ESPRESSO. But wait, the question says Star3's apparent V mag is 15.5. Maybe that's the observed m, so extinction is already accounted for.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's clarify. If the star's true (intrinsic) apparent magnitude is m0, and there's extinction A_V, then the observed m is m0 + A_V. So if the question states the observed apparent magnitude, that's m = m0 + A_V. Conversely, in Star3's case, if the question says apparent V mag is 15.5, which is the observed m, then that's the number to use.

Wait, but the problem says for Star3: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc." So that's the observed m, which includes extinction. So in that case, Star3's m is 15.5, which is less than 16, so detectable by both HIRES and ESPRESSO.

Wait, but wait, another thought. The absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc. So perhaps Star3's actual apparent magnitude without extinction would be different. Wait, but the problem states that Star3 is at 15 pc. So let's compute its apparent magnitude without considering extinction, and then see what the extinction adds.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the true apparent magnitude (without extinction) and then add the extinction to get the observed m.

Wait, but the question gives Star3's apparent V magnitude as 15.5, which I think is already the observed value. So perhaps I don't need to compute anything else.

Wait, perhaps it's better to process each star step by step.

Let me make a table.

Star | Apparent V mag (given) | Extinction (A_V) | Observed m | Detectable by ESPRESSO? (m <17) | Detectable by HIRES? (m <16)

Star1: m=15.5, no extinction (since E(B-V)=0?), so observed m=15.5. Both YES.

Star2: m=16.5, E(B-V)=? Wait, Star2's info says apparent V mag 16.5, and located at 5 pc. So E(B-V) isn't given. So I think Star2 has no extinction? Because the problem doesn't mention E(B-V) for Star2. So Star2's observed m=16.5. ESPRESSO can detect it (16.5 <17), HIRES can't (16.5>16). So only ESPRESSO.

Star3: m=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So A_V=3.1*0.6=1.86. So the observed m = m_true + A_V, but wait no: the problem says the apparent V mag is 15.5. So maybe that's the observed m, which includes extinction. So Star3's observed m=15.5. So yes to both.

Wait, but another approach: maybe the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic, and the extinction has to be added. But that can't be, because the question clearly states the apparent V magnitude. So I think Star3's apparent m is 15.5, which is observed. So no, the extinction is already included.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic, and the extinction affects it. So for Star3, the observed m is 15.5 (intrinsic) + 1.86 =17.36. Which is greater than 17, so ESPRESSO can't detect it. Wait, but the question says that Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the way to read it is: the apparent magnitude you observe is brighter or fainter based on extinction. So the observed apparent magnitude is m_obs = m_true + A_V. So if the star's true (intrinsic) apparent magnitude is m_true, then the observed is m_obs = m_true + A_V.

But in the problem, for Star3, the apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5. So that's the observed m. So in this case, Star3's m_obs is 15.5, which is less than 16 and 17, so detectable by both.

Wait, but that scenario would imply that the extinction isn't affecting the apparent magnitude, which doesn't make sense because extinction makes stars appear dimmer (higher m). So how can the observed m be 15.5 if the star's true m is brighter?

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the true m without extinction, then add the extinction to get the observed m.

Wait, but the problem says Star3's apparent V mag is 15.5. Hmm. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the given m is the absolute magnitude, and we need to compute the apparent m, then apply extinction.

Wait, no. The problem gives Star3's apparent V magnitude as 15.5. So that's the observed m. So perhaps the extinction doesn't affect the detection in this scenario. Or perhaps the extinction is already a part of the observed m.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to proceed with the initial approach: for each star, determine the apparent V magnitude, after considering any extinction. Then check if it's <=16 for HIRES and <=17 for ESPRESSO.

Wait, for stars with extinction, their apparent magnitude is higher (since they are dimmer). So if a star's true (intrinsic) apparent magnitude is m0, and extinction adds A_V, then the observed m is m0 + A_V.

So for Star3, the problem says the apparent V mag is 15.5, but this is with extinction. Wait, no. The problem says the apparent V mag is 15.5, and the E(B-V) is 0.6. So I think the apparent V mag is 15.5, which includes the extinction. So A_V is 1.86, but that's already been added to the star's true m. So no, the observed m is 15.5.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed step by step.

Star1: m_obs =15.5. So both can detect.

Star2: m_obs=16.5. Only ESPRESSO can detect.

Star3: m_obs=15.5. So both can detect.

Star4: Absolute V mag=15.5, located at 10 pc, E(B-V)=0.4.

We need to calculate its apparent V magnitude.

First, compute the true apparent magnitude without extinction.

m_true = M + 5 log10(d) -5.

M=15.5, d=10.

log10(10)=1.

m_true =15.5 +5*(1) -5 =15.5 +5-5=15.5.

Now, add the extinction A_V=3.1 * 0.4=1.24.

m_obs = m_true + A_V = 15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So Star4's observed m is 16.74.

HIRES requires m <16, so 16.74 is too high. So HIRES can't detect it.

ESPRESSO can, since 16.74 <17? No, 16.74 is less than 17. So m=16.74 is within ESPRESSO's limit (brighter than 17, i.e., m <17). So Star4 can be detected by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES.

Star5: Absolute V mag=16.5, distance=5 pc.

Compute m_true: M=16.5, d=5.

m_true =16.5 +5*log10(5) -5.

log10(5)=~0.69897.

So 5*0.69897 ≈3.4949.

m_true=16.5 +3.4949 -5 =16.5 + (-1.5051)=14.9949, approximately 15.0.

Now, does Star5 have extinction? The problem doesn't mention E(B-V), so I assume it's zero. So m_obs =15.0.

So Star5's m is 15.0, which is less than 16, so detectable by both.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation for Star5.

m_true = M + 5 log10(d) -5.

d=5 pc.

log10(5)=0.69897.

5 * 0.69897 ≈3.49485.

So 16.5 +3.49485 =19.99485.

Minus 5: 19.99485-5=14.99485. So m_true= ~15.0.

No extinction, so m_obs=15.0.

So Star5's m is 15, which is within both instruments' limits.

So now, let's list which stars can be detected by both:

Star1: m=15.5 → yes to both.

Star3: m=15.5 → yes to both.

Star5: m=15.0 → yes to both.

Star2: m=16.5 → only ESPRESSO.

Star4: m=16.74 → only ESPRESSO.

So the stars detectable by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Now, looking at the options.

Options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected by both.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't be detected by HIRES.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that includes Star1,3,5. Let's check the options again.

The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4's m=16.74, which is >16 → HIRES can't detect.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both have m=15.5 and 15.0, which are <16 → detectable by both.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 is 16.5 (>16) → HIRES can't.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4's m=16.74, again, HIRES can't.

So the correct answer would be B, as both Star3 and Star5 have apparent m within the limits of both spectrographs.

Wait, but wait. Wait, Star3's m is 15.5, which is <16. So yes. Star5's m is 15.0, also <16. So both are detected by both.

Wait, but wait. The options given are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → no.

B) Star3 and Star5 → yes.

C) Star2 and Star3 → no.

D) Star1 and Star4 → no.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but I thought Star1 is also detectable by both. Why isn't it in any option? Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

So the only option that includes both stars detected by both instruments is option B: Star3 and Star5.

But wait, earlier I thought Star1 is also detectable by both. So why isn't it in any option?

Wait, let me recheck Star1.

Star1: absolute V magnitude 15.5, distance 10 pc.

m = M +5 log10(10) -5 =15.5 +5 -5=15.5. So m=15.5. So Star1's apparent V mag is 15.5, which is within both spectrographs. So why isn't it in any option besides option D, which is Star1 and Star4.

Wait, but Star4's m is 16.74, which is above 16, so HIRES can't detect it. So option D is incorrect.

So why is Star1 not part of any correct option? Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) 4 and 5 → no.

B)3 and5 → yes.

C)2 and3 → no.

D)1 and4 → no.

So according to my analysis, Star1 can be detected by both, but it's not part of any answer option. Hmm. That suggests I might have made a mistake.

Wait, no, the question is asking which stars can be detected with both. So if a star can be detected by both, it's a candidate. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering Star1.

Wait, Star1 has RA=15 deg, DEC=-75 deg. Now, the observatories at Paranal and Keck. Do they have the same visibility?

Wait, the question says to disregard the pointing limits and altitudes. So no need to check if the stars are visible from those observatories. So that's not the issue.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Star5's apparent magnitude. Let me double-check.

Star5: M=16.5, d=5 pc.

m_true =16.5 +5 log10(5) -5.

log10(5)=0.69897.

5 * 0.69897 ≈3.49485.

16.5 +3.49485 =19.99485.

19.99485 -5=14.99485 → ~15.0.

So m=15.0. So that's correct.

Star3: m=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, so A_V=1.86. So observed m is 15.5 +1.86=17.36? Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused again. Because the given apparent magnitude for Star3 is 15.5. So if that's the observed m, then extinction is included. But if the given m is the intrinsic, then the observed would be m+ A_V.

Wait, the problem states Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, which is the observed m. So that's the value to use. Therefore, Star3's m is 15.5, which is okay for both.

But wait, if the given m is the intrinsic, and the extinction adds 1.86, then the observed m would be 17.36, which is too high for ESPRESSO.

Wait, but the problem says: Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6.

So perhaps to compute the observed m, I should take the intrinsic m and add the extinction.

Wait, but where is the intrinsic m coming from? From the absolute magnitude and distance.

Wait, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic, without considering extinction. So let's recalculate.

Star3: M = ?

Wait, Star3's absolute V magnitude isn't given. Wait, the problem states the absolute V magnitude is given for Star1, Star4, and Star5. For Star2 and Star3, the absolute V isn't given. Wait, let me look again.

Problem statement:

Star1: absolute V mag 15.5.

Star2: apparent V mag 16.5, distance 5 pc.

Star3: apparent V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, distance 15 pc.

Star4: absolute V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, distance 10 pc.

Star5: absolute V mag 16.5, distance 5 pc.

So for Star3, we have to compute its absolute magnitude from the given apparent magnitude and distance, then apply extinction.

Wait, no, that's the opposite. Maybe I should compute its intrinsic apparent magnitude and then add extinction.

Wait, perhaps this is the correct approach.

For each star, if their apparent magnitude (m) is given without extinction, then the observed m is m + A_V.

But for Star3, the problem says apparent V magnitude is 15.5 mag, which I think is the observed m (including extinction). So no, I can't recalculate that.

Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (without extinction), and the extinction has to be accounted for.

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. Let's reevaluate.

If the given m is the observed (including extinction), then Star3's m is 15.5, which is within both instruments' limits.

If the given m is the intrinsic (without extinction), then Star3's observed m would be 15.5 + 1.86 =17.36, which is too high for HIRES (since m must be <16) and just within ESPRESSO's limit (m <17). So in this case, Star3 would only be detectable by ESPRESSO.

But this would change the earlier conclusion.

So the confusion arises from whether the given apparent magnitude for Star3 includes the extinction or not.

The problem states, for Star3: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1."

Ah, the note is about absorption, so perhaps the given m is the intrinsic, and absorption (extinction) must be added.

In that case, for Star3, the observed m would be 15.5 + 1.86 =17.36.

Which is greater than 17, so ESPRESSO can't observe it. Wait, no: ESPRESSO requires m <17. 17.36 is more than 17, so it's too faint.

Wait, but this contradicts the initial approach. So perhaps I should compute the apparent magnitudes without extinction, then add the extinction to get the observed m.

So for each star:

Compute the intrinsic apparent magnitude (m0) from absolute mag (M) and distance (d):

m0 = M + 5 log10(d) -5.

Then, compute observed m = m0 + A_V, where A_V =3.1 * E(B-V).

If the star's given m is the observed value (including extinction), then that's m. But if the given m is the intrinsic (without extinction), then compute observed m as m0 + A_V.

Now, looking back, for Star3, the problem states:

Star3: apparent V mag=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, distance=15 pc.

So, if the apparent magnitude given is the intrinsic (without considering extinction), then the observed m would be:

m0 = M + 5 log10(15) -5.

But wait, the problem doesn't give M for Star3. Oh, wait: the problem gives the apparent V magnitude as 15.5. So perhaps we can't compute M, but we have to think differently.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this again.

The key is that each spectrograph has a limit on apparent V magnitude. To be visible by both, the observed m must be <=16 (HIRES) and <=17 (ESPRESSO). So the star's observed m must be <=16.

So, for each star:

Star1:

M=15.5, d=10 pc.

m0 =15.5 +5*log10(10) -5 =15.5 +5 -5=15.5.

E(B-V)=0? The problem doesn't mention it for Star1. So A_V=0. So observed m=15.5.

Thus, Star1 is detectable by both.

Star2:

m=16.5 (apparent), E(B-V)=0? The problem doesn't mention it. So observed m=16.5.

HIRES can't detect (16.5>16). ESPRESSO can (16.5<17).

Star3:

m=15.5 (apparent), E(B-V)=0.6. So A_V=3.1 *0.6=1.86.

If the given m is the intrinsic (without extinction), then observed m=15.5 +1.86=17.36.

Which is >17 → not detected by ESPRESSO. But the problem says the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, which includes extinction, so observed m=15.5. So detectable by both.

Wait, this is conflicting. How can a star with E(B-V)=0.6 have an apparent magnitude of 15.5? Because extinction makes it appear fainter, so m would be higher.

So perhaps the given m is the intrinsic. Therefore, the observed m is 15.5 +1.86=17.36, which is too faint for both spectrographs.

Wait, but the question says the apparent magnitude is 15.5. So I think that includes extinction. So Star3's observed m=15.5, which is detectable by both.

But wait, if the star's light is extinguished, the observed m should be higher than the intrinsic. So if the given m is the observed, which is 15.5, that suggests the star is bright, despite the extinction. So perhaps the given m is the observed, so no further extinction has to be added.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is structured so that for all stars, E(B-V) is zero unless stated otherwise. But in this case, Star3 has E(B-V)=0.6, so we need to account for that.

I think I'm stuck here, so perhaps I should proceed with the initial approach, assuming that the given apparent magnitude is the observed, including any extinction. So:

Star1: 15.5 → yes to both.

Star2: 16.5 → only ESPRESSO.

Star3: 15.5 → yes to both.

Star4: 16.74 → only ESPRESSO.

Star5: 15.0 → yes to both.

So the stars detectable by both are Star1, Star3, Star5.

Looking at the options, option B is Star3 and Star5. So that's correct. Also, Star1 is present in option D, but Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

Wait, but according to this, Star1 is also detectable by both, but it's not in any option except option D. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate Star4.

Star4: M=15.5, d=10 pc, E(B-V)=0.4.

Compute m0 =15.5 +5 log10(10)-5=15.5 +5-5=15.5.

A_V=3.1 *0.4=1.24.

So observed m=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So Star4's m=16.74. HIRES can't detect (m<16 needed). So Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

So Star1, Star3, Star5 are detectable by both.

But the options don't include any option that includes all three. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Star5.

Wait, Star5: M=16.5, d=5 pc. E(B-V)=0?

m0 =16.5 +5 log10(5) -5.

log10(5)=0.69897, so 5*0.69897≈3.4949.

m0=16.5 +3.4949 -5 =16.5 + (-1.5051)=14.9949 ≈15.0.

No extinction, so observed m=15.0. So Star5 is detectable by both.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, Star5.

But looking at the options:

Only option B includes Star3 and Star5.

Option D includes Star1 and Star4, but Star4 isn't detectable by HIRES.

So the correct answer must be option B: Star3 and Star5.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars and compare them to the detection limits of the instruments. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., \( m < 17 \)), while HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag (i.e., \( m < 16 \)). A star must satisfy both conditions to be detectable by both instruments.

### Analysis of Each Star:

#### **Star1**
- **Given Data**: Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \), no extinction mentioned.
- **Calculation**: The apparent magnitude is calculated using \( m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 \).  
  \[
  m = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10) - 5 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 = 15.5
  \]
- **Conclusion**: \( m = 15.5 \), which is less than both 16 and 17. **Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.**

#### **Star2**
- **Given Data**: Apparent V magnitude \( m = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \), no extinction mentioned.
- **Conclusion**: \( m = 16.5 \), which is less than 17 but greater than 16. **Detectable only by ESPRESSO.**

#### **Star3**
- **Given Data**: Apparent V magnitude \( m = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \), distance \( d = 15 \, \text{pc} \).
- **Extinction**: The total absorption in the V band is \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.6 = 1.86 \).
- **Observed Magnitude**: Since the problem states the apparent magnitude \( m = 15.5 \) already includes extinction, no further adjustment is needed.
- **Conclusion**: \( m = 15.5 \), which is less than both 16 and 17. **Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.**

#### **Star4**
- **Given Data**: Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \), \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \).
- **Intrinsic Apparent Magnitude**:  
  \[
  m_0 = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10) - 5 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 = 15.5
  \]
- **Extinction**: \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24 \).
- **Observed Magnitude**:  
  \[
  m = m_0 + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
  \]
- **Conclusion**: \( m = 16.74 \), which is less than 17 but greater than 16. **Detectable only by ESPRESSO.**

#### **Star5**
- **Given Data**: Absolute V magnitude \( M = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \), no extinction mentioned.
- **Intrinsic Apparent Magnitude**:  
  \[
  m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5) - 5
  \]
  Using \( \log_{10}(5) \approx 0.69897 \):  
  \[
  m = 16.5 + 5 \times 0.69897 - 5 = 16.5 + 3.49485 - 5 = 15.0
  \]
- **Conclusion**: \( m = 15.0 \), which is less than both 16 and 17. **Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.**

### Final Determination:
- **Star1**: Detectable by both.
- **Star2**: Detectable only by ESPRESSO.
- **Star3**: Detectable by both.
- **Star4**: Detectable only by ESPRESSO.
- **Star5**: Detectable by both.

The stars detectable by both instruments are **Star1, Star3, and Star5**. Among the given options, only **Star3 and Star5** are included in **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
