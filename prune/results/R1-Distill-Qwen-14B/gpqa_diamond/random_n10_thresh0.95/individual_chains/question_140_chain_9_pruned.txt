--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's read it again and break it down.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Then there's another part about a keto acid reacting with X, and the product has two oxygen atoms. Finally, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog.

I think I'll start by identifying what each part refers to. Let's take it one piece at a time.

First, the reaction between X and Y. It's violent, so maybe something reactive. The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, same number of protons and neutrons—so the molecule must have atoms with that property. For example, H2O: the H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if W is CO2, each carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (in 12C), but wait, CO2 is a molecule, so each atom's neutrons and protons should match. Let me think—maybe the gas is something like methane? No, methane has CH4. Wait, wait, perhaps W is CH4? Let's see: C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (12C). H has 1 each. But CH4 has a molecule, so each H would have 1 proton and 0 neutrons. But the molecule as a whole—no, the question says each atom in W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh wait, wait, the molecule's atoms each have the same number of neutrons and protons. So for example, H2O: H is 1p, 0n; O is 8p, 8n. No, that's not same. Wait, but if the molecule is something like O2, each O atom has 8p and 8n. So O2 would have each atom with 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So then, O2 is a possible W. But O2 is diatomic, yes.

Alternatively, maybe W is CO, but then C has 6p,6n and O has 8p,8n. So each atom in CO has same number of n and p. So CO's molecule has atoms where each has same n and p. So that's possible.

Now, the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. B has a melting point near 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. Wait, 277 K is 4°C. So B is a solid at that temperature. What solid has a melting point near 4°C? Maybe something like ice? No, ice melts at 0°C. Hmm, another thought: maybe B is a bicarbonate? Wait, wait, 277 K is 4°C. Alternatively, maybe B is some form of ammonium salt? Wait, ammonium carbonate decomposes upon heating. Or perhaps B is sodium bicarbonate? Wait, sodium bicarbonate's melting point is higher, around 270 K maybe. Alternatively, maybe B is some kind of metal carbonate?

Wait, going back to the reaction. X reacts with Y (liquid) violently. Let's think about reactions that produce gas. Maybe X is a metal reacting with an acid. For example, if X is sodium or potassium, and Y is water. But wait, sodium reacts with water violently, producing H2 gas. But in that case, W would be H2. Each H atom has 1p and 0n. So n and p are not equal. So that can't be. Hmm, so maybe the gas isn't H2. Alternatively, maybe Y is an acid, like H2SO4, and X is a carbonate? No, maybe X is something else.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe X is a metal that reacts with an acid to produce CO2 gas. For example, if X is a carbonate, but that's not likely. Alternatively, if X is a metal reacting with a carbonate solution. Hmm, maybe I should think about the precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. If B is a solid with a melting point around 4°C, perhaps B is something like NaHCO3? Wait, sodium bicarbonate's melting point is higher, around 270 K (like 270 K is about -23°C, no... wait, let me think about the actual melting points. Wait, maybe I should think about what B is. If B is a carbonate, perhaps it's sodium carbonate, but that's solid at room temp. Wait, perhaps B is ammonium chloride? No, that's white and would melt higher. Or maybe B is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is something that upon heating loses CO2, like a carbonate. Wait, for example, if G is calcium carbonate, but when heated, it decomposes into CaO and CO2. But CaO's melting point is much higher than 277 K. Wait, 277 K is about 4°C, so perhaps B is something that's solid at 4°C, like maybe water ice? No, that's melting at 0. Wait, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps B is something else. Let's think about the product of the reaction. The product of a keto acid reacting with X has two oxygen atoms. Hmm, a keto acid is an acid with a ketone group. For example, acetoacetic acid. If X is something that adds to a keto acid, perhaps it's a base, like NaOH or something. Wait, but the product after reaction would have two oxygen atoms. Let me think, maybe X is something like NH3? Or maybe X is a strong base.

Wait, the product of the reaction of a keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So if the keto acid is, say, acetoacetic acid (which is a beta-keto acid), and X is something that deprotonates it. Wait, but if X is a base, perhaps it would deprotonate the keto acid, forming a salt. The product would be the conjugate base, which would have more oxygen? Or perhaps the product is something else.

Wait, perhaps the product is a saponification product. Wait, if X is a base like NaOH, reacting with a keto acid ester. Hmm, but the question says a keto acid, not an ester. Hmm.

Wait, let's consider another angle. The product after reaction has two oxygen atoms. So maybe the product is a molecule with two oxygen atoms. For example, if the keto acid is RCOCH2COOH, and X is something that adds an oxygen. Or maybe X is a metal, which would displace something else and form a salt.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is something like a carbonate or bicarbonate. Wait, but that's getting a bit ahead.

Now, the question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So I need to find out which elements are present in X and sum their lightest and heaviest isotopes.

Wait, the problem mentions that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X has an element with a heavier isotope, which suggests that one of its elements has multiple isotopes. So X is made of at least two elements, one of which has isotopes.

Also, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Hmm, I'm thinking maybe X is something like sodium or potassium, which are used in organometallic reactions. Or perhaps X is an amine, but that's not likely.

Wait, what if X is a metal like sodium or potassium? Let's say X is Na. Then Y would be water, perhaps. Na reacts with water violently to produce H2 gas. But wait, earlier we thought the gas has same number of protons and neutrons per atom. H2 has H atoms: 1p, 0n. So no, that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is CO. Let's think about that. If X is a metal reacting with carbon-containing liquid Y. Alternatively, X is a metal reacting with a carbonate solution, releasing CO2. But CO2 has 12C (6p,6n) and 16O (8p,8n). So each atom in CO2 has same number of p and n. So in that case, W would be CO2.

So W is CO2. Then, X could be a metal reacting with a carbonate. Wait, but metals typically react with acids, not carbonates. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a carbonate reacting with another carbonate? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid, but then the gas would be CO2, which fits.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal reacting with a weak acid or a carbonate. Let's suppose that. If X is sodium, Y could be a carbonate solution. Sodium reacts with carbonate? Well, sodium is already in the carbonate. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a carbonate, and X is a metal that reacts with it, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of something else. Let me think about the precipitate G. When heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. Maybe G is a hydroxide. For example, if X is a metal reacting with a liquid acid to form a salt and H2 gas. Wait, but earlier the gas W didn't fit. Alternatively, think about a reaction that produces a carbonate precipitate.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal reacting with a carbonate solution. For instance, if X is Mg and Y is Na2CO3 solution. Then, Mg would react with Na2CO3 to produce NaOH and MgCO3 precipitate. But MgCO3 is slightly soluble in water. When heated, MgCO3 decomposes into MgO and CO2. The B here would be CO2, but earlier W was CO2. Hmm, but that would mean W is CO2, which fits. Let me check: Mg + Na2CO3 → MgCO3↓ + 2NaOH. Then heating MgCO3 gives MgO and CO2. So B would be CO2, which is a gas, but the melting point of B is 277 K. Wait, but CO2 is a gas under normal conditions. Oh, maybe I got that wrong. Wait, B is a solid? No, because melting point is given. Hmm, perhaps I confused B with another product.

Wait, the problem says that when G is heated, it releases B. So G is a precipitate, which upon heating releases B. So G could be a carbonate, which upon heating gives B as CO2. So B is CO2. But CO2 is a gas, so its melting point isn't really applicable. Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, maybe G is a bicarbonate. If G is sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3, then heating it would give Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. But the melting point of B would then be something else. Hmm, but the problem states that B's melting point is near 277 K, which is about 4°C. So perhaps B is a salt that's solid at this temperature. For example, maybe B is sodium carbonate? But sodium carbonate is solid, so its melting point is higher than that, maybe around 1000 K. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound. Let me think about other possibilities.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the product from the keto acid reaction. The product has two oxygen atoms. So if the keto acid is, say, acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH), and X is a base, perhaps NaOH. The reaction would neutralize the acid, forming the conjugate base. The product would be sodium acetoacetate (CH3COCH2COO^- Na^+). The formula of this sodium salt would be C4H5O4Na. Wait, but that product has four oxygen atoms. So maybe that's not it. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. Or maybe the product is something else entirely.

Wait, another thought: If X is a dehydrating agent, like PCl5 or something, and reacts with the keto acid to form an anhydride. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a reagent that adds to the keto group. For example, in the case of the Wolff-Kishner reaction, where a carbonyl is reduced. But I think that uses hydrazine and then heat, so maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the product has two oxygen atoms, so maybe it's a molecule like CO2 or something. Hmm, but the product of the reaction is a compound, so perhaps it's something like acetone (which has two oxygen atoms in the carbonyl group). But how would that form from a keto acid?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is decarboxylation, releasing CO2, but that doesn't directly give a product with two oxygen atoms.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone, which would have a carbonyl group (one oxygen). Hmm, but the product has two oxygen atoms. So maybe something like an ester, but I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let's try another angle. The substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog. So possible candidates for X are things like NaOH, KOH, or maybe something like NH3 or another amine. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal like Mg or Na, which are used in Grignard reagents.

Wait, if X is sodium, then the reaction with water would produce H2 gas. But earlier we saw that H2 doesn't fit the neutron and proton condition. So maybe X isn't a metal.

Wait, another idea: Maybe X is a carbonate. Because when carbonates react with acids, they release CO2 gas. So if X is sodium carbonate, Y could be an acid like H2SO4. Then, the reaction would produce CO2 gas. CO2 has 12C (6p,6n) and 16O (8p,8n), so each atom in the molecule has the same number of p and n. That fits the description of W.

So W is CO2. Then, Y is sulfuric acid, and X is sodium carbonate. The reaction would be Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2↑ + H2O. The precipitate G would form if any of the products are insoluble. But in this case, Na2SO4 is soluble, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution containing a different salt that precipitates when reacting with X.

Wait, perhaps X is a hydroxide. Let's say X is sodium hydroxide, Y is an acid. Then, the reaction would produce water and a salt. But then, the gas wouldn't be produced. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfite. Reacting with an acid would release SO2 gas. But SO2 has S (16p, 16n) and O (8p,8n). So each atom has same p and n. That could fit. So W might be SO2.

But then, let's think about the precipitate G. If X is a sulfite, like Na2SO3, reacting with HCl would produce SO2 gas. The reaction would be Na2SO3 + 2HCl → 2NaCl + H2O + SO2↑. But what precipitate would form here? Unless another compound precipitates, like if the acid is not HCl but another, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the precipitate G is a sulfide? Or perhaps it's something else entirely.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate, Y is a solution containing a metal cation, and the reaction forms a carbonate precipitate. For example, X is sodium carbonate, Y is a solution of calcium chloride. Then, the reaction would produce calcium carbonate precipitate and sodium chloride. So X (sodium carbonate) + Y (CaCl2) → G (CaCO3) + NaCl. When G is heated, it decomposes into CaO and CO2. So B would be CO2, which is a gas, but the problem says B is a solid with a melting point near 277 K. Hmm, no, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the precipitate isn't the carbonate but something else. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a hydroxide. Wait, if X is NaOH, and Y is an acid like H2SO4, the reaction would produce water and sodium sulfate. No gas would be released. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's consider the information about B. B is a solid with a melting point near 277 K (4°C). What substances have a melting point around that? Maybe something like ammonium nitrate? No, its melting point is higher. Or maybe something like ice, but ice melts at 0°C. Alternatively, perhaps B is a form of sodium bicarbonate, but I thought earlier its melting point is higher. Let me check: Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) has a melting point around 270 K, which is about -23°C. Wait, that's lower than 277 K. Hmm, doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe B is something else.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the product of the reaction involving the keto acid. The product has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps it's a ketone, which has one O in the carbonyl. Hmm, but maybe it's a diketone? Or maybe the product is an ester, which has two oxygen atoms. For example, if X is an alcohol, and the reaction is esterification. But then, the product would be an ester with two oxygen atoms. Alternatively, maybe X is a base that deprotonates the keto acid, forming a salt. The salt would have more oxygens in the structure.

Wait, another thought: The product has two oxygen atoms. Maybe it's a carbonate, like CO3^2-? That has three oxygens, so that's not it. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonyl-containing compound. Wait, the product after reaction is a substance with two oxygen atoms. Let me think: Maybe the keto acid is converted into a ketone via decarboxylation. For example, if the keto acid is something like malonic acid, and X is a dehydrating agent that causes decarboxylation, forming CO2 and a ketone. So the product would be a ketone, which has one O. But the question says two O's. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an ester, which has two oxygen atoms. So for example, if the keto acid is reacted with an alcohol in the presence of acid, forming an ester. In that case, the product would have two O's. But wait, the question says that X is the reagent. So X would be the alcohol. But then, when the alcohol reacts with the keto acid, it forms an ester. Hmm, that could fit.

Wait, but the initial reaction of X with Y produces gas W. If X is an alcohol, Y would be something else. Maybe an acid, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a base, like KOH. Reacting with a keto acid would form a salt. For example, if the keto acid is acetoacetic acid, the product would be the potassium salt, which has more oxygen in the structure. But I'm not sure how that relates to the two O's.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress on that part. Let me go back to the first part.

W is a gas with same number of protons and neutrons in each atom. So possible candidates are O2 (each O has 8p,8n), N2 (7p,7n?), C (6p,6n?), He (2p,2n), etc. So possible W molecules are O2, N2, CH4? No, because CH4 has H's with 1p,0n. So W can't be that. So W must be a molecule where each atom has same p and n.

So possible W: O2, N2, C (graphite?), etc. But since it's a gas released during a reaction, O2 or N2 are possibilities. Alternatively, CO (each atom has 6p,6n and 8p,8n, no, wait. C has 6p,6n, O has 8p,8n, so they don't match. So CO can't be W. So W must be a molecule where each atom has same p and n.

So O2 is possible. So W is O2.

Wait, but O2 is diatomic, so each O has 8p and 8n. So the molecule has O atoms with same p and n. So W is O2.

But how does that fit into the reaction? Let me think.

If X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid, the reaction would produce CO2, not O2. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if X is a peroxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: What about the decomposition of a superoxide? For example, if X is a superoxide, like KO2, and it reacts with something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps W is O2 being released through some decomposition. For example, if G is a superoxide that upon heating produces O2. But that's getting complicated.

Another possibility: Maybe W is CO. Wait, no, C has 6p,6n; O has 8p,8n. So each atom in CO doesn't have same p and n. So W can't be CO.

So W must be O2. Then, the reaction between X and Y releases O2. So what reactions produce O2 gas? For example, the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to H2O and O2. But X and Y would have to be H2O2 and a catalyst, but that doesn't fit the initial conditions.

Alternatively, if X is a metal oxide reacting with an acid to produce water and O2? Not sure.

Wait, another possibility is that X is H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide), and Y is something that causes it to decompose into H2O and O2. But in that case, Y would be a catalyst, perhaps. But then, the precipitate G would be something else, maybe not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, and Y is a peroxide. For example, sodium peroxide (Na2O2) reacting with water produces O2. Let's see:

2 Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaOH + O2↑

In this case, W is O2. So X is Na2O2, Y is H2O. Then, the precipitate G would be NaOH, which is soluble. Hmm, so no precipitate. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe X is sodium peroxide, Y is an acid. Hmm, but that might not produce a precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a different peroxide.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. Let's think: when a metal reacts with a peroxide, but I'm not making progress here.

Alternatively, perhaps W is N2 gas. Each N atom has 7p,7n. So W could be N2. So what reaction produces N2 gas?

Well, for example, the decomposition of ammonium nitrate, but that's a dangerous reaction and not likely here. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is between a metal and a solution containing nitrate ions, causing the release of N2. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Let me consider that maybe W is CH4. But CH4 has H with 1p,0n, so no, that can't be. So W must be O2 or N2.

Wait, perhaps W is O2, and X is H2O2. Let's see: X is H2O2, Y is a catalyst (like MnO2), and the reaction produces O2 and H2O. But then, what's the precipitate G? H2O is a liquid, so no precipitate. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate, Y is an acid, and gas W is CO2. But earlier I thought that didn't fit the p and n condition. Wait, CO2: each C has 6p,6n; each O has 8p,8n. So no, each atom in CO2 doesn't have the same p and n.

Wait, maybe the gas is a molecule where each atom has same p and n. So O2 (each O has 8p,8n), N2 (7p,7n), or He (2p,2n), but He is a noble gas and not likely to be produced in such a reaction.

So if W is O2, then the reaction between X and Y must produce O2. Let's think about what reactions do that.

Another possibility: The decomposition of a metal peroxide, like PbO2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe X is a solution of a peroxide, and Y is an acid that reacts to produce O2. For example, H2O2 (X) and H2SO4 (Y) could react under certain conditions, but I don't think that produces O2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal and Y is a peroxide solution. For example, sodium (X) reacts with sodium peroxide (Y) to produce something, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps X is a carbonate and Y is a strong oxidizing acid, like H2SO4, which could produce CO2. But earlier we saw that CO2 doesn't fit because O has 8p,8n and C has 6p,6n. So each atom in CO2 doesn't have same p and n. So W can't be CO2.

Hmm, maybe W is O2. So how can X and Y produce O2?

Wait, maybe X is KClO3 and Y is MnO2, acting as a catalyst, but that's for decomposition of KClO3 into KCl and O2. But then, Y would be MnO2, and X would be KClO3. The reaction would be:

2 KClO3 → 2 KCl + 3 O2↑ (with MnO2 as catalyst)

In this case, precipitate G would be KCl, which is soluble. So no precipitate, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a solution of a metal nitrate, and Y is a strong base, causing a reaction that produces O2. But I don't recall such a reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and a nitride. For example, Mg + N2 → Mg3N2, but that's a synthesis reaction and might not produce O2.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the other clues.

The product of the reaction involving the keto acid has two O atoms. So perhaps it's an acetylation product. Wait, if X is acetyl chloride, reacting with the keto acid, but then the product would be an ester, which has two O's.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a base, and the reaction produces a salt. Let's say the keto acid is something like citric acid, and X is NaOH. The product would be sodium citrate, which would have three O's in the formula. Hmm, but the product needs exactly two O's.

Wait, another idea: The product after reaction has two O atoms, so perhaps it's a carbonyl group. For example, if the keto acid loses CO2 (decarboxylation), the product would be a ketone, which has one O. Hmm, but that's one O, not two.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an ester. For example, if X is ethanol, and the keto acid is reacted to form an ester, which has two O's.

But then, X would be ethanol, which is an organic reagent, fitting the clue that X and its analog are used as reagents. So if X is ethanol, Y could be an acid like H2SO4, and the reaction could be esterification. But then, would that produce a gas? Not unless it's a dehydration reaction.

Wait, in esterification, the reaction is acid + alcohol → ester + water. No gas is released, so that doesn't fit the initial condition where gas W is released.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is a base. Let me think: If X is a base, like NaOH, reacting with a keto acid (like acetoacetic acid) would form the conjugate base and water. So the product would be sodium acetoacetate, which has four O's (CH3COCH2COO^- Na^+). That's not two O's.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, implying decarboxylation. So if X is a dehydrating agent, like P2O5 or something, and the reaction causes the keto acid to lose CO2, forming a ketone. The product would have one O, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the product is an aldehyde, which has one O. Hmm.

I'm not making progress here. Let me try to think about the elements in X.

X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X has at least two elements, one of which has multiple isotopes. The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X would require knowing the elements in X.

If X is NaOH, it's made of Na, O, and H. Na has isotopes (like Na-23, Na-24, etc.), so that's possible. The lightest element would be H (atomic mass ~1), and the heaviest would be Na (about 23). Summing gives 24. But that's not one of the options. So probably not.

Wait, the options are 35, 25, 31, 29. So perhaps the sum is something else.

Alternatively, if X is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. It's made of Na, C, and O. C has isotopes (like C-12, C-13, C-14). So the lightest element is C (12?), but wait, H is lighter. Wait, no, X is Na2CO3. So elements present are Na (atomic number 11), C (6), O (8). The lightest element is C (6), but wait, no, C is heavier than O and H. Wait, wait, the elements are Na, C, O. So the lightest is O (8), or C (6) is lighter than O (8). Wait, atomic numbers: C is 6, O is 8, so C is lighter. So the lightest element in X (Na2CO3) is C (atomic mass 12), and the heaviest is Na (atomic mass 23). Wait, but Na is 23, C is 12, O is 16. So the heaviest element is Na, and the lightest is C. Wait, but maybe I got it wrong.

Wait, the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within X. So we're to sum the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So in X (Na2CO3), the elements are Na, C, O. The lightest is C (12), heaviest is Na (23). So 12 + 23 =35. Oh! 35 is one of the options (option A). But wait, let me make sure.

Wait, but wait, what if X is something else with elements that add up to 31? Let me think.

If X is KNO3 (potassium nitrate), the elements are K, N, O. Lightest is N (14), heaviest K (39). 14+39=53, not an option. Hmm.

If X is NH4Cl, elements N, H, Cl. Lightest is H (1), heaviest Cl (35.5). Sum is 36.5, not an option.

If X is NaOH, elements Na (23), O (16), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum is 24, not an option.

If X is CH3COOH (acetic acid), elements C, H, O. Lightest H (1), heaviest C (12). Sum 13, not an option.

Wait, but what if X is something like C2H5OH (ethanol)? Then, elements C, H, O. Lightest H (1), heaviest C (12). Sum 13. Not in options.

Wait, another possibility: X is NH3. Elements N and H. Heaviest is N (14), lightest is H (1). Sum 15, not an option.

Wait, but earlier with X being Na2CO3, the sum was 35, which is option A. But let's see if that fits the other conditions.

So X is Na2CO3.
