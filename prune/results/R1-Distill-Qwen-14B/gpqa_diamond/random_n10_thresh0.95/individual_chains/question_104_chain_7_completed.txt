Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, radial velocity... I remember that's when you look for Doppler shifts in a star's spectrum caused by an orbiting planet. The star moves back and forth, and that causes the spectral lines to shift a little. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet, or the closer it is to the star, right?

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the planets are probably similar in mass, but their orbital periods are to be compared based on their radial velocity shifts.

Planet #1's spectral line shifts by 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's is 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but how does that relate to the orbital period? Oh right, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to the Doppler shift. So K is the maximum velocity the star moves towards or away from us.

The formula for K is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (1 + M_planet/(M_star))^(1/3) )) * (1/( (1 AU)^(1/3) ) ) * (P/(2π))^(1/3) ) )... Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )). But since M_planet is much less than M_star (like Neptune vs Sun), we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. And since the inclination i is probably 90 degrees for both (because they detected the planet, so edge-on), sin i is 1. So K is approximately proportional to (M_planet) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Wait, but the star's mass is the same for both systems (solar masses). So M_star is same. M_planet for both is same (Neptune-like). So K should be inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So if K is higher, that would mean P is shorter. Because if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). Rearranging, (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1. So P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

Wait, in this question, which K is bigger? Planet #2 has a larger shift, 7 mA, compared to 5 mA for Planet #1. So K2 is higher than K1. So K2 = 7, K1 =5.

So K1/K2 =5/7. Then (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364. So P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1 → P2 = 0.364 * P1. So the orbital period of Planet #2 is about 0.364 times that of Planet #1. So the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. Wait, no. Wait, the question says, "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So that's P2 / P1.

Wait, according to our calculation, P2 is 0.364 times P1. So P2/P1 ≈ 0.364. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times as long as planet #1. So it's shorter. Therefore, the ratio is 0.36. So the correct answer would be option A) ~0.36.

Wait, but let me think again. So K is higher when the velocity of the star is higher. When K is higher, that suggests a shorter orbital period because the star is moving more quickly. Because if the planet is orbiting quickly, the star's velocity would be higher. So a higher K implies a shorter period.

Wait, so if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1. So P2/P1 is less than 1, which aligns with our calculation of ~0.36. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times the period of planet #1. So it's longer? No, wait. If P2 is smaller, then it's not longer. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1. Oh, wait no, the question is phrased as "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's shorter, so it's 0.36 times as long. So the ratio is 0.36. So the answer is A.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of this shift, \( K \), is proportional to the star's velocity, which depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period. The formula for \( K \) can be simplified as:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_{\text{planet}}}{M_{\text{star}}^{2/3} P^{1/3}}
\]

Since the stars have the same mass (\( M_{\text{star}} \)) and the planets have similar masses (\( M_{\text{planet}} \)), \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \). This relationship can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging, we find:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{mA} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{mA} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the ratio is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} \approx 0.36
\]

The correct answer is **A) ~0.36**.
