Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral crystal's (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices.

Wait, rhombohedral crystals... right, they have all sides equal and all angles the same. So in this case, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all angles are 30 degrees. Oh wait, wait. Wait, no, the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter 'a' in a rhombohedral system, right? Because each atom is at a corner of the rhombohedral unit cell, so the edge length a is the distance between adjacent atoms. So yeah, a = 10 Angstroms.

But wait, the angles are all 30 degrees. Oh, right, in a rhombohedral system, the lattice is defined by a, and the angles α, β, γ which are all equal in this case. So the formula for interplanar distance is the same as for a general hexagonal or cubic system, but with the given angles.

I think the formula for interplanar distance (d_hkl) is given by 1/d^2 = (h² + k² + l²)/a² - (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)(cos^2 α + cos^2 β + cos^2 γ - 1)/(a²). Or wait, no, wait. Maybe I should recall the correct formula for a rhombohedral system.

Wait, another approach: the general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system, including rhombohedral, is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos γ) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos α) ) )

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think. The formula for the interplanar distance in a general triclinic system is:

d_{hkl}^2 = (a^2 (h² + k² + l²) - a^2 (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α)) ) / ( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)^2 - (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) + ... ) Hmm, maybe I should look for the formula specific to rhombohedral systems.

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are the same, so α = β = γ = 30 degrees. So maybe the formula simplifies. Let me try to find the formula for d for a rhombohedral lattice.

I think the formula for the interplanar distance (d) in a rhombohedral lattice is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors, which in this case is 30 degrees. Because in a rhombohedral system, all the vectors are at the same angle to each other.

So the Miller indices here are (1,1,1), so h=1, k=1, l=1.

Plugging in the values:

h=1, k=1, l=1.

So the denominator becomes sqrt( (1^2 + 1^2 +1^2) - 2(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) cos(30°) )

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

First, compute the numerator of the denominator's expression: h² + k² + l² = 1 +1 +1 =3.

Then the next term: 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ.

hk =1*1=1, same for hl and kl. So (hk + hl + kl) =3. Multiply by 2: 6. Then multiply by cos(30 degrees). Cos 30 is sqrt(3)/2, approximately 0.8660.

So 6 * (sqrt(3)/2) )= 3 sqrt(3) ≈ 5.196.

So the denominator's expression is sqrt(3 - 5.196).

Wait, 3 is about 3.000, 5.196 is about that number, so 3 -5.196 is -2.196. That can't be right because we can't take the square root of a negative number. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me think again. Another formula I remember is d^2 = (a²) / ( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cosγ + hl cosβ + kl cosα) ) )

But in rhombohedral, all angles are the same, so cosα = cosβ = cosγ = cosθ, where θ is 30 degrees.

So the denominator becomes h² + k² + l² - 2[ hk + hl + kl ] cosθ.

So plug in h=1, k=1, l=1.

h² +k² +l² =3.

Then 2[ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ] cosθ = 2*(3)*cosθ = 6 * cosθ.

So denominator is 3 -6 cosθ.

So denominator = 3 -6*(sqrt(3)/2) =3 -3*sqrt(3).

Compute that: sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 3*1.732 ≈5.196.

So 3 -5.196 ≈-2.196.

Wait, but that's negative. Square root of a negative number is not possible. So that can't be right. So I must have the formula wrong.

Hmm, maybe I missed a negative sign somewhere. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

But considering that in a rhombohedral system, the angles are between the lattice vectors. Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the vectors a, b, c have angles α between a and b, β between a and c, and γ between b and c. So in this case, all angles are 30 degrees.

So the formula is correct as I wrote. But why am I getting a negative denominator?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in taking the angles. Because in a rhombohedral system, the angles between the vectors are 30 degrees. But perhaps the cosines are negative? Because 30 degrees is acute, but maybe in the formula, the angles are actually the supplement.

Wait, no, that can't be right because cos(30) is positive.

Wait, perhaps I should rederive the formula.

The interplanar distance d is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector. Alternatively, the formula is:

1/d² = (h² +k² + l²)/(a²) - (h^2 +k^2 +l^2)(cos² α + cos² β + cos² γ -1)/(a²). 

Wait, I'm not sure, but maybe that's another formula.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: in a rhombohedral system, the structure can be considered as a cube that's been deformed. The interplanar distance would depend on the angles between the planes.

But perhaps a better way is to use the general formula for interplanar distance in a triclinic system.

The general formula for interplanar distance is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) )

Wait, no, that can't be correct because the units wouldn't match. Oh wait, no, perhaps it's:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) )

Yes, that's right. Because in the cubic system, when the angles are 90 degrees, cos terms are zero. So the formula becomes a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²), which is correct.

So in our case, α=β=γ=30 degrees.

So plugging h=1, k=1, l=1.

Denominator inside the sqrt is:

h² +k² +l² =3.

Then, 2[ hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α ] = 2[ 1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30 ]

Which is 2*(3 * cos30) )= 6 * cos30.

So denominator becomes 3 - 6 * cos30.

But cos30 is about 0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 ≈5.196.

So 3 -5.196 ≈-2.196.

Wait, that's negative again. So I'm getting a negative value under the square root, which is impossible. That's a problem. Am I making a mistake in the formula?

Hmm, perhaps I'm not considering the correct angles. Wait, in the formula, the angles are the angles between the vectors. So in a rhombohedral system, the angle between a and b is α, between a and c is β, and between b and c is gamma. So all are 30 degrees. But sometimes, the formula considers the angles as the angles between the lattice vectors, so maybe the cos terms are negative. Because in a rhombohedral system, the angle between vectors is 30 degrees, but the angle in the formula might be the supplementary angle? That's confusing.

Wait, wait, let me think again. For a cubic system, angles are 90 degrees, so cos is zero. For a tetragonal, the angles are 90, so cos terms are zero except for the non-cubic axes. But for a rhombohedral system, the angles can be either acute or obtuse, but in our case, it's 30 degrees, which is acute.

Wait, but perhaps the formula uses the angle between vectors as 180-30 =150 degrees? Because in some conventions, the angle used is the one inside the unit cell. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because angles in a crystal are the angles between the vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the angle in the formula is the angle between the vectors or their supplements.

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me think. The correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) )

But in this case, all angles are 30 degrees, so:

d_{111} = a / sqrt(3 - 2*(1*1*cos30 + 1*1*cos30 + 1*1*cos30) )

Which is a / sqrt(3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2) )

Compute that: 6*(sqrt(3)/2)=3*sqrt(3)= approx 5.196.

So 3 -5.196= -2.196. That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the angles as 180-θ, so cos becomes negative. Because if the angle between the vectors is 30 degrees, then the angle between the lattice vectors in the formula is 30 degrees, but sometimes, in some conventions, the angles in the formula are the supplementary angles. So, instead of cos30, perhaps it's cos(150 degrees), which would be negative.

Wait, that's a possibility. Because sometimes, when the angle between the vectors is acute, but for the sake of the formula, they consider the obtuse angle as the angle between the vectors. Let me think about that.

For example, in a face-centered cubic system, which is a type of cubic close packing, the angle between the vectors might be 60 degrees, but in the formula, perhaps it's taken as 120 degrees because the formula uses the angle that is the supplement. Because in that case, the cos would be negative, and it would make the denominator positive.

So in our problem, if the angle between the vectors is 30 degrees, perhaps in the formula, we should use 180-30=150 degrees, so cos(150 degrees) is -sqrt(3)/2.

So let me try that. So cos30 becomes cos150 = -sqrt(3)/2.

Now, let's compute the denominator again.

Denominator inside sqrt is 3 - 2*( hk*(-sqrt(3)/2) + hl*(-sqrt(3)/2) + kl*(-sqrt(3)/2) )

Since h=k=l=1:

Denominator = 3 - 2*( 3*(-sqrt(3)/2) )

Which is 3 - 2*( (-3 sqrt(3)/2) )

Wait, 2*( (-3 sqrt(3)/2) )= -3 sqrt(3).

So denominator becomes 3 - (-3 sqrt(3)) = 3 +3 sqrt(3).

Now, 3 sqrt(3) is approximately 5.196, so total denominator is 3 +5.196=8.196.

So the denominator inside the sqrt is 8.196.

So d= a / sqrt(8.196 )

Given a=10 Angstrom.

So sqrt(8.196)= approx sqrt(8.196)= around 2.863.

So d=10 / 2.863 ≈3.493 Angstroms? Wait, wait, that doesn't match any of the options given. The options are all around 9 Angstrom.

Wait, that can't be right. That would suggest that maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps I swapped the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reciprocal space. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach, such as the Bragg's law, but I don't think that applies here since we're just finding d.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for d is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector. The reciprocal lattice vector is given by (h, k, l) in reciprocal space, so the magnitude is sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2(hk cos α + ... etc) )

Wait, no, the reciprocal lattice vector components are (h, k, l) but the metric tensor comes into play. So the magnitude of the reciprocal vector (h, k, l) is sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) ), where γ is the angle between a and b, etc.

Wait, but in this case, the angles are 30 degrees, so let's proceed.

So the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector is:

sqrt( (1)^2 + (1)^2 + (1)^2 - 2*(1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30) )

Which is sqrt(3 -6*(sqrt(3)/2) ) = sqrt(3 -3 sqrt(3)).

But 3 sqrt(3) is about 5.196, so 3-5.196= -2.196. Again, negative inside the square root.

Wait, that's impossible. So perhaps I'm using the wrong approach. Maybe I should consider that in rhombohedral systems, the interplanar distances can be derived using a different approach, perhaps using the volume of the unit cell.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the formula in a different way. Let's think about the volume of the unit cell. The volume V is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 θ + 2 cos^3 θ ), where θ is the angle between the vectors. For θ=30 degrees, let's compute that.

But I'm not sure how that would directly help, but perhaps the formula for the reciprocal lattice can be expressed in terms of the volume.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the general formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system, which is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

Wait, but that would mean that the denominator is 3 - 6 cosθ.

If θ is 30 degrees, cosθ is about 0.866, so denominator is 3 -6*(0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196. Again, negative. So this approach isn't working.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the structure factor. No, that's not helpful here.

Wait, maybe I should look for another approach, perhaps using the Miller indices and the unit vectors.

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors can be represented as a, b, and c vectors, each with length a=10 Angstrom, and angles between each pair is 30 degrees.

So the vectors are:

a = a_x i +0 j +0 k,

b = a_x cosθ i + a_y j + 0 k,

c = a_x cosθ i + a_y cosθ j + a_z k.

But perhaps it's better to represent this in terms of the basis vectors.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance is given by the formula:

d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ + 2(h^2 +k^2 +l^2)(1 - cosθ) ) ) 

Wait, no, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should look up the correct formula.

Wait, I think I remember that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But that brings me back to the same problem where the denominator is negative when θ is 30 degrees.

Wait, but in reality, when the angles are more than a certain value, the denominator could be positive. For example, if θ is 60 degrees, let's compute.

h=k=l=1.

Denominator: 3 -6*(0.5) =3-3=0. So d would be infinite, which makes sense because a 60-degree rhombohedral system with (111) planes would have those planes coinciding, leading to no interplanar spacing (or maybe I'm getting it wrong).

Alternatively, perhaps I should check for θ=60 degrees. Wait, in a rhombohedral system with θ=60 degrees, the structure is equivalent to a hexagonal close-packed structure, and the (111) planes would have certain spacing.

Wait, but in the given question, θ=30 degrees, which I'm not sure how to handle. Perhaps the issue is that my formula is missing a term, or the angles are being treated differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the reciprocal of the angles. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, but the conclusion is that for this particular case, the (111) planes don't exist because the denominator is negative. But that can't be right because the question provides options, so the calculation must be possible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Another approach: the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system can be written as:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But in this case, the denominator is 3 -6 cos30.

If θ is 30 degrees, then cos30 is positive, and the denominator is negative, which is impossible. But perhaps the formula uses the angle 180-θ, which would make the cosine negative, leading to a positive denominator.

So let's try that. Let me take θ=150 degrees, which has cos150 = -sqrt(3)/2.

Then denominator becomes 3 -6*(-sqrt(3)/2) )= 3 + 3*sqrt(3) ≈ 3 +5.196=8.196.

So d=10 / sqrt(8.196) ≈10/2.863≈3.493 Angstroms. But the options are all around 9 Angstroms. So that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula because the rhombohedral system is a special case. Let me think about the unit cell. In a rhombohedral system, the unit cell can be considered as a cube that's been skewed. The volume of the unit cell is a^3 multiplied by the square root term.

But perhaps the interplanar distance can be found by looking at the height of the unit cell in the (111) direction.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral lattice, which may have a simplified formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - ( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) * ( (cos α + cos beta + cos gamma) )  )) )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, I think I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me try to think again.

Wait, I'll try to compute the reciprocal lattice vector components. In a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal vectors are given by:

b1 = (1/a)(1, 1, 1) / sqrt(1 -3cos^2θ + 2cos^3θ )

Wait, no, perhaps that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (1/a) ( 1/(sin α sin β sin gamma) )^(1/3) ) [ 1, 1, 1 ]

But I'm not confident about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance in the (111) plane is given by a / (sqrt(3) * |sin(θ)| ), where θ is the angle between the vectors. But again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps in a simple cubic system, the interplanar distance is a/sqrt(3) for (111) planes. So for a=10, it's about 5.77 Angstrom. But in our case, the angles are 30 degrees, so it's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the distance using the dot product approach.

In a rhombohedral system, the vectors a, b, c each have length a, and the angle between any two is 30 degrees. The (111) plane is defined by the plane that cuts the lattice vectors in the ratio 1:1:1. The interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent planes in this direction.

To compute this, perhaps I should find the normal vector to the (111) plane and then compute the distance between planes.

Wait, the normal vector to the (hkl) plane in a crystal is given by the reciprocal lattice vector, which is proportional to (h, k, l). But in a non-cubic system, this involves the metric tensor.

In a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors can be calculated using the metric tensor. The metric tensor G is a 3x3 matrix given by:

G = [ a² (1 - cos^2 α)      a² ( - cos α cos β )   a² ( - cos α cos gamma ) ]
       [ a² ( - cos alpha cos beta )   a² (1 - cos^2 beta)     a² ( - cos beta cos gamma ) ]
       [ a² ( - cos alpha cos gamma )   a² ( - cos beta cos gamma )   a² (1 - cos^2 gamma) ]

But since α=β=gamma=30 degrees, this simplifies.

So,

G = [
a² (1 - cos^2 30)        a² (-cos30 cos30)       a² (-cos30 cos30),
a² (-cos30 cos30)        a² (1 - cos^2 30)       a² (-cos30 cos30),
a² (-cos30 cos30)        a² (-cos30 cos30)       a² (1 - cos^2 30)
]

Let's compute each element.

cos30 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

cos^2 30 = 3/4 =0.75.

So,

G_11 = a² (1 - 0.75 ) = a² * 0.25 = (10)^2 * 0.25 = 100 *0.25=25.

G_12 = a² (- (0.8660)^2 )= a² * (-0.75) = 100*(-0.75)= -75.

Similarly, G_13= same as G_12, so -75.

G_21= same as G_12, so -75.

G_22= same as G_11, 25.

G_23= same as G_12, so -75.

G_31= same as G_12, so -75.

G_32= same as G_12, so -75.

G_33= same as G_11, 25.

So the metric tensor G is:

[25   -75    -75]

[-75   25    -75]

[-75  -75    25]

Now, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by the inverse of the metric tensor multiplied by the reciprocal of a^2.

Wait, no, the reciprocal lattice vectors are defined such that the metric tensor of the reciprocal lattice is the inverse of the original metric tensor.

But perhaps an easier way is to compute the reciprocal of the metric tensor and then find the reciprocal lattice vector (h, k, l) in terms of the original lattice.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance d is given by:

d = 1/ sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma) )

But in our case, we have the same angles for all, so:

d = 1/ sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, but in our case, h=k=l=1, θ=30 degrees.

So denominator is 3 -6*(sqrt(3)/2) =3-3*sqrt(3)=3-5.196= -2.196.

Again, negative. So this approach isn't working.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula uses the supplementary angle. So cosθ becomes cos(180-30)=cos150= -sqrt(3)/2.

So denominator becomes 3 -6*(-sqrt(3)/2) =3 +3*sqrt(3)=3+5.196=8.196.

So d=1/ sqrt(8.196) ≈1/2.863≈0.349 A^{-1}.

Wait, but that's the reciprocal of the interplanar distance. So the interplanar distance is 1/d= 2.863 A.

But 2.863 is way lower than the options given, which are around 9A.

Hmm, perhaps I'm still making a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But in the case where the denominator is negative, it implies that such a plane doesn't exist, but the question gives options, so that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be written with a plus instead of minus. Let's try that.

So denominator is 3 +6*sqrt(3)/2=3+3*sqrt(3)=8.196.

So d=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.493 A.

That's still not matching the options. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the volume of the unit cell. The volume V is given by a^3 * sqrt(1 − 3 cos²θ + 2 cos³θ).

But I'm not sure how that helps.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 hk cosα - 2 hl cosβ - 2 kl cosγ )) 

But because in a rhombohedral system, α=β=gamma=θ=30 degrees, the formula becomes:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l^2 − 2 hk cosθ − 2 hl cosθ − 2 kl cosθ )

So for (111) plane, h=k=l=1.

Denominator: 3 - 2[ cosθ (1*1 + 1*1 +1*1) ] =3 -6 cosθ.

Again, same problem as before. So denominator is 3-6*(sqrt(3)/2)=3-3*sqrt(3)=3-5.196= -2.196. Which is negative.

But this suggests that the calculation is impossible, which can't be the case. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula uses the angle between the planes, not the angle between the vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the angle between the planes as 180 -30=150 degrees, which would change the cosine to negative.

So denominator in that case would be 3 -6*( -sqrt(3)/2 )=3 +3 sqrt(3)=8.196.

So d=10/sqrt(8.196)≈10/2.863≈3.493 Angstroms. But the options are all around 9, which is about 3 times higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should have included the volume in the calculation. Because in some formulas, the interplanar distance uses the volume of the unit cell.

The volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2θ +2 cos^3θ).

So V=10^3 * sqrt(1 -3*(3/4) + 2*(3√3/8)).

Wait, let me compute that:

Compute inside the sqrt:

1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*(3√3/8) =1 - 9/4 + (6√3)/8.

Simplify:

1=4/4, so 4/4 -9/4= -5/4.

Plus (6√3)/8= (3√3)/4.

So overall: -5/4 + (3√3)/4 = (3√3 -5)/4.

Compute numerically:

3√3≈5.196 → 5.196-5=0.196.

0.196/4≈0.049.

So V=1000 * sqrt(0.049)≈1000 * 0.221≈221 Angstrom^3.

But how does that help me find the interplanar distance?

Alternatively, the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = (a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )) ) / ( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) * something )

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:

d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk cosθ + hl cosθ + kl cosθ) )) )

But this is the same formula I've been using, leading to a negative denominator. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that a is the interatomic distance. Maybe in a rhombohedral system, a is not the interatomic distance but the lattice parameter. Because in some cases, the lattice parameter a is the distance between atoms in a particular direction, but in a rhombohedral system, the atoms are at the corners of the unit cell, so a would be the interatomic distance. So a=10 Angstrom is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the inverse of the reciprocal lattice vector. Let me compute the reciprocal lattice vector for (111).

The reciprocal lattice vector g is given by:

g = [ (h/a)^2 - (hk cosγ)/(a^2) - (hl cosβ)/(a^2) ) ]^(1/2) 

No, that's not helpful. Alternatively, the magnitude of the reciprocal vector is |g|= sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk cosθ + hl cosθ + kl cosθ) ) / a.

So the interplanar distance d is 1/|g|.

So |g|= sqrt(3 -6 cosθ)/a.

So d= a / sqrt(3 -6 cosθ).

But with θ=30 degrees, cosθ=sqrt(3)/2.

Thus, denominator is sqrt(3 -6*(sqrt(3)/2)) = sqrt(3-3√3).

Which is sqrt(negative), which is impossible. So, perhaps the formula is incorrect, or the angles are being treated differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be d = a / sqrt( (1/h^2 +1/k^2 +1/l^2) ... ), but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me look for another approach. Maybe using the volume and the Miller indices.

The volume of the unit cell is V= a^3 * sqrt(1 -3 cos^2θ + 2 cos^3θ).

We calculated V≈221 Angstrom^3 earlier.

The number of unit cells in the (111) direction would be related to the interplanar distance. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is given by a divided by the square root of (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) multiplied by some factor involving the angles.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the height of the unit cell along the (111) direction.

But I'm not sure how to proceed.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = a * sqrt( (1/h^2 + 1/k^2 +1/l^2) ) / (something involving angles)

But no, that's unclear.

Another idea: perhaps I can think of the rhombohedral system as a distorted cubic system. So in a cubic system, d is a/sqrt(3). For a=10, that's about 5.77 Angstrom. But the options are higher, around 9 Angstrom.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is larger than in the cubic case because the angles are smaller, making the planes further apart.

Wait, maybe I should compute using a different approach. Let me consider the vectors.

In a rhombohedral system, the (111) plane is formed by the vectors a, b, and c, each of length 10 Angstrom, with angles of 30 degrees between them.

The normal vector to the (111) plane can be found by taking the cross product of two vectors in the plane. Let me choose vectors along a and b.

Wait, the vectors a, b, and c. So to find a vector in the (111) plane, perhaps I can take a + b + c.

Wait, but the normal vector would be perpendicular to this, so perhaps it's (1,1,1) in reciprocal space.

Alternatively, perhaps the normal vector is (a, b, c), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the normal vector N to the (111) plane can be found by N = a × b × c, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps N is (a, b, c) but scaled appropriately.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to compute the magnitude of the normal vector, then find the reciprocal of that to get the interplanar distance.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can model the lattice vectors.

Let me model the vectors a, b, and c in a coordinate system.

Let me define the a vector along the x-axis: a = (a, 0, 0).

The b vector makes an angle θ=30 degrees with a. So b = (a cosθ, a sinθ, 0).

The c vector makes an angle θ=30 degrees with both a and b.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, the angle between a and c is θ, and between b and c is θ as well.

Wait, perhaps the c vector can be represented as:

c = (a cosθ, a cosθ, a sqrt(1 - 2 cos^2θ + cos^4θ )) ?

Wait, perhaps I should find the components of c such that the angle between a and c is θ, and the angle between b and c is θ.

So, the dot product:

a · c = |a||c| cosθ → a * a * cosθ → a^2 cosθ.

So, a · c = a * c_x = a^2 cosθ → c_x = a cosθ.

Similarly, b · c = |b||c| cosθ.

b is (a cosθ, a sinθ, 0).

So, b · c = (a cosθ) c_x + (a sinθ) c_y = a * c_x cosθ + a c_y sinθ.

But since |b|=a, because each vector has length a.

So, b · c = a^2 cosθ.

Substituting c_x= a cosθ:

a cosθ * a cosθ + a c_y sinθ = a^2 cosθ.

So, a² cos²θ + a c_y sinθ = a² cosθ.

Divide both sides by a:

a cos²θ + c_y sinθ = a cosθ.

Solving for c_y:

c_y sinθ = a cosθ - a cos²θ = a cosθ (1 - cosθ).

So,

c_y = [ a cosθ (1 - cosθ) ] / sinθ.

Simplify:

cosθ/(1 - cosθ) = [1 - cosθ]/sin^2θ.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, let me compute numerically.

Given θ=30 degrees, cosθ=√3/2≈0.8660, sinθ=0.5.

So,

c_x= a * cosθ =10 * 0.8660≈8.660.

c_y= [ 10 * 0.8660 * (1 - 0.8660) ] / 0.5.

Compute numerator: 10 *0.8660 * (0.134)=10 *0.8660 *0.134≈1.160.

Divide by 0.5: 1.160 /0.5=2.32.

So c_y≈2.32.

Now, to find c_z, we can use the fact that the magnitude of c is a=10.

So,

c_x² + c_y² + c_z^2 = a^2.

c_x=8.660 → c_x²=75.

c_y=2.32 → c_y²≈5.38.

So,

75 +5.38 + c_z^2 = 100 → c_z^2=20 → c_z=√20≈4.472.

So, c= (8.660, 2.32,4.472).

Now, the (111) plane is defined by the plane equation: x + y + z = d.

The normal vector to the plane is (1,1,1), so the unit normal vector is (1,1,1)/sqrt(3).

The interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent planes, which can be found by taking the dot product of the normal vector with a vector connecting two adjacent lattice points along the plane's normal direction.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the distance from the origin to the plane, then the interplanar distance would be the distance between two adjacent planes along the normal direction.

The distance from the origin to the plane (111) is given by d_plane = |0 +0 +0 - d| / sqrt(1^2 +1^2 +1^2) ), but in our case, the plane equation is x + y + z = (d_plane)*sqrt(3).

But I'm not sure how this helps. Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent points along the normal direction.

So, the interplanar distance d is given by the projection of the lattice vector onto the normal direction.

Wait, perhaps the lattice vectors can be projected onto the normal direction to find the interplanar distance.

The normal direction is (1,1,1) direction. So, for a vector R in the crystal, the projection onto the normal direction is (R · n) / |n|, where n is (1,1,1).

But for the (111) plane, the spacing would be determined by the component of the lattice vectors along the normal direction.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the sum of the projections of the basis vectors onto the normal direction.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the sum of the projections of a, b, and c onto the normal direction (1,1,1).

Let me compute the projection of each lattice vector onto the (1,1,1) direction.

The unit vector in the (1,1,1) direction is n = (1,1,1)/sqrt(3).

Projection of a onto n: a · n = (a_x, 0,0) · (1,1,1)/sqrt(3) )= a_x *1/sqrt(3) =10 *1/sqrt(3)= ~5.7735.

Similarly, projection of b onto n: b=(8.660, 2.32, 0).

b · n = (8.660 +2.32 +0)/sqrt(3) ≈10.98/sqrt(3) ≈6.33.

Projection of c onto n: c=(8.660, 2.32,4.472).

c · n = (8.660 +2.32 +4.472)/sqrt(3) ≈15.452/sqrt(3) ≈9.004.

Wait, so the projections are about 5.7735, 6.33, and 9.004.

But I'm not sure how to combine these to find the interplanar distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the sum of these projections. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the dot product of the normal vector with the reciprocal lattice vector.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the distance using the formula for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral structure.

Wait, if I can't find the formula, perhaps I should look for another way.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system, but with the angles replaced by 150 degrees, leading to a positive denominator.

So let's compute:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But with θ=150 degrees, cosθ= -sqrt(3)/2.

So,

d=10 / sqrt(3 -6*(-sqrt(3)/2) )=10/sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)).

Compute denominator:

3+3*1.732=3+5.196=8.
