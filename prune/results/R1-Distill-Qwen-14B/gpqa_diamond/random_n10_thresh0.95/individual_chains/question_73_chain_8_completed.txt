Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction, right? I remember that because of the way velocities add in special relativity, you can't just say 0.6c minus 0.5c equals 0.1c. That would be the case in classical mechanics, but relativity has a different formula.

So, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity when two objects are moving in the same direction is v_rel = (u1 - u2)/(1 - (u1 u2)/c²). Wait, no, wait. Actually, if the two objects are moving at speeds u1 and u2 in the same direction, then the relative speed from the perspective of the first object (u1) is (u1 - u2) / (1 - (u1 u2)/(c²)). But wait, I'm a bit confused about which object's frame we're considering. Oh right, the relative speed between the two would be (u2 - u1)/(1 - (u1 u2)/c²) if you're looking from the perspective of the first object. Or maybe I should think from the perspective of the second object. Wait, no, the relative speed between them is the same regardless of direction because it's symmetric in that way? Or wait, no, because velocity is directional. So I think that the relative speed would be (u1 - u2)/(1 - (u1 u2)/c²). Let me plug in the numbers: u1 is 0.6c, u2 is 0.5c.

So substituting, the numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7 = approximately 0.142857c, which is roughly 0.14c. So the relative speed is around 0.14c. Hmm, looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's a clue.

Now, the total energy of the system. In relativity, the total energy of a moving object is given by gamma multiplied by its rest mass energy. So for each astronaut, their energy would be gamma * m * c². Wait, but wait, the problem says their masses are 2m and 3m. So for the first astronaut, energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c². Similarly, E2 = gamma2 * 3m c². Then the total energy E_total = E1 + E2.

So let's compute gamma for each speed. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

For the first astronaut, v=0.6c. So v²/c² = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma1 is 1/0.8 = 1.25.

For the second astronaut, v=0.5c. v²/c² is 0.25. 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660. So gamma2 is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

Now, computing E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c². E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding them together: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc². So the correct option should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check the relative speed calculation. Because I might have mixed up the direction. If one is moving at 0.6c and the other at 0.5c in the same direction, then from the perspective of the first astronaut, the second is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/c²) = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1 /0.7 c ≈0.1428c, which is 0.14c when rounded. So that's correct.

So the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc², which matches option C. So the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using principles of special relativity.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u_1 - u_2}{1 - \frac{u_1 u_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u_1 = 0.6c \) and \( u_2 = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

1. **Numerator**: \( u_1 - u_2 = 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c \)
2. **Denominator**: \( 1 - \frac{u_1 u_2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7 \)

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1429c \approx 0.14c
\]

The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \). For the two astronauts:

1. **First astronaut** (\( m_1 = 2m, v_1 = 0.6c \)):
   \[
   \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
   \]
   \[
   E_1 = \gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
   \]

2. **Second astronaut** (\( m_2 = 3m, v_2 = 0.5c \)):
   \[
   \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
   \]
   \[
   E_2 = \gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
   \]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

---

### Final Answer
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c \).
- The total energy of the system is \( E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2 \).

Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c, E = 5.96m c^2 \)**.
