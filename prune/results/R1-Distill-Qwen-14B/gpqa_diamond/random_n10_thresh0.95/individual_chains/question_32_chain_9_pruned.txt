Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number A is 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6. So it's Li-6.

Right, so I need to find the total energy of the ion in the collider. The ions are moving at 0.96 times the speed of light, which is pretty fast, so relativistic effects are definitely in play here. 

Let me think about the formulas. The total energy E of a relativistic particle is given by gamma multiplied by m0c², where m0 is the rest mass of the particle. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

So first, I should calculate gamma. Since v is 0.96c, let's plug that in. 

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)^2 / c^2) ) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²). Let's compute 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 is... let me see, 0.90 + 0.06 * 0.96 * 2. Wait, actually, 96 * 96 = 9216, so 0.96^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. 

So sqrt(0.0784) is... hmm, what's the square root of 0.0784? Well, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. Oh wait, no, 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714286.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784, yes. So 1/0.28 is 10/2.8 = 100/28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.5714. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². Wait, yes, I remember that. So for Li-6, which has 6 nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons), the mass should be 6 * 938 MeV/c². Let me calculate that.

6 * 938 = 5628 MeV/c². But wait, wait. Actually, the exact mass of a nucleus isn't just exactly the sum of the individual nucleons because of binding energy, but since the problem doesn't mention anything about that, I think I should just go with the approximation where the mass is the sum of the individual nucleons. So 6 * 938 is 5628 MeV/c², which is 5.628 GeV/c².

Wait another thing, but sometimes in these problems, they might use the mass of the specific isotope. For example, the mass of Li-6 is known, but I'm not certain about the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps we can look up the approximate mass or use the given approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass as 6 times the proton mass, but that's probably okay.

So m0c² for Li-6 would be 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

So the total energy E is gamma multiplied by m0c². So E = 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV.

Let me compute that. Let's compute 3.5714 * 5.628. 

First, I'll calculate 3 *5.628 = 16.884. Then 0.5714 *5.628.

0.5 *5.628 = 2.814.
0.0714 *5.628 ≈ 0.0714*5=0.357, and 0.0714*0.628≈0.0449. So total approx 0.357 + 0.0449 = 0.4019. So 2.814 + 0.4019 = 3.216 approx.

So adding to the 16.884: 16.884 + 3.216 = 20.1 GeV. Hmm, so approximately 20.1 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute it more accurately. 

3.5714 *5.628:

Let me write it as 3.5714 multiplied by 5.628.

3.5714 *5 = 17.857.

3.5714 *0.628 = ?

Wait, 3.5714 *0.6 is 2.14284.

3.5714 *0.028 is 0.100. Approximately.

So 2.14284 + 0.100 = 2.24284.

So total is 17.857 + 2.24284 = 20.09984 GeV.

So approximately 20.10 GeV. Let me check the options. Option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. But was my gamma calculated correctly?

Wait a second, maybe I should be more precise in the gamma calculation. Let's recalculate gamma.

v = 0.96c.

Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784).

Wait, sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, because 0.28^2=0.0784. So gamma is exactly 1/(0.28) = 25/7 ≈3.57142857.

So no error there.

So m0c² is 6 * 938 MeV = 5628 MeV =5.628 GeV.

So E= gamma * m0c² = (25/7) *5.628 GeV.

Compute 25/7 = 3.57142857.

Multiply by 5.628:

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 5.628 * 25 =140.7, then divide by 7.

140.7 /7 =20.1.

So E=20.1 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should use a more precise value for the speed. Wait, no, it's given as exactly 0.96c. So speed is precise.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is more precise. Wait, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is not exactly 6 * 938 MeV/c². Let me check.

Wait, the mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So maybe using more precise values.

But the problem probably approximates to 938 MeV per nucleon. Alternatively, perhaps it expects me to use the exact mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is slightly less than 6 * (proton + neutron) due to binding energy. But in exams, sometimes they give the mass as approximately the sum.

Wait, but perhaps the molar mass is 6 g/mol, but that's different. Wait, no, I'm talking about the mass in MeV/c².

Alternatively, let me think: the mass of Li-6 is 6 * (average of proton and neutron masses). But that would be about 6*(938.7 MeV/c²) is 5632.2 MeV, which is 5.6322 GeV.

Wait, but I'm getting into more precise numbers now. Let me recalculate E with more accurate m0.

Assume m0c²=6 *938.272 MeV = 5629.632 MeV =5.629632 GeV.

Gamma is 25/7 ≈3.57142857.

E = 3.57142857 *5.629632 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.629632.

Let me compute it step by step.

First, 3 *5.629632 =16.888896.

0.57142857 *5.629632: Let's compute that.

0.5 *5.629632 =2.814816.

0.07142857 *5.629632 ≈ 0.07142857 *5 =0.35714285; and 0.07142857 *0.629632≈0.045136.

So sum is approximately 0.35714285 +0.045136 ≈0.402279.

So 0.5 gives 2.814816, plus 0.0714... gives 2.814816 +0.402279=3.217095.

So total E is 16.888896 +3.217095=20.105991 GeV.

So approximately 20.106 GeV. Hmm, that's about 20.106, which is about 20.106 GeV. So looking at the options, option C is 2
