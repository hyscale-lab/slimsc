Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Ay operator. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to piece it together.

So, the problem says that Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator. The operator is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S has a specific form. The first row of S is [0, -i], the second row is [i, 0]. Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli Y matrix, but maybe scaled somehow.

Wait, let me write down what S looks like. S is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

So, the Pauli Y matrix is usually represented with a factor of i in some places, but in this case, it's as given. So Ay is c times S. Let's compute what Ay is.

Given c = h/(4π), so Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. So, substituting S, Ay becomes:

[0, -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[i*(h/(4π)), 0 ]

So, the matrix elements are (0, -i c) and (i c, 0), with c = h/(4π).

Now, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue, and I is the identity matrix.

Let me set up the matrix Ay - a I:

[ -a       (-i c) ]
[ i c     -a    ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (i c)(-i c) = a² - (i c)(-i c). Wait, let's compute that.

(i c)(-i c) is equal to (-i² c²). Because i*(-i) is -i², which is -(-1) = 1. So, (i c)(-i c) = (-i^2) c^2 = c^2 because i^2 is -1. So, the determinant becomes a² - (c^2) = 0.

So, a² = c² → a = ±c. Therefore, the eigenvalues are c and -c.

Wait, but what's c? c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). So, a is either h/(4π) or -h/(4π). That's the eigenvalues.

Now, looking at the options, let's see which statements match. Let's go through each option.

Option A: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue are +2πh or –2πh, real parts are +h/(4π) or –h/(4π).

Wait, but the eigenvalues I found are a = ± h/(4π). These are real numbers, so their imaginary parts are zero. So option A is talking about the imaginary parts being ±2πh which doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues are real. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, wait, but again, our eigenvalues are real, so the eigenvalues are a real number. So option B's eigenvalues have non-zero imaginary parts, which can't be right. So B is incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Wait, A is the intrinsic angular momentum operator, which is like the spin operator. So, for spin-1/2 particles, the square of the angular momentum is A² = (ħ/2)^2 * 3 * I, where I is identity? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the Pauli matrices are Sx, Sy, Sz, and S² = (Sx² + Sy² + Sz²) = (3/4) I for spin-1/2. So, for our case, since Ay = c S, then A^2 = c² S². And S² is ( (Sx)^2 + (Sy)^2 + (Sz)^2 ) = (3/4) I, I think. Wait, but in this case, Ay is just the y-component. So, A² would be Ay².

Wait, but the eigenfunctions of Ay are the same as the eigenfunctions of A²? Because A² is a scalar multiple of identity, so all eigenvectors are eigenvectors of A². Because any vector is an eigenvector of the identity matrix with eigenvalue 1 multiplied by a constant. So, any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A² (with eigenvalue (±c)^2 = c^2). But what about Az? Az is a different component. So, the eigenfunctions of Ay can't be eigenfunctions of Az because they don't share the same eigenstates (unless you have a simultaneous eigenstate, but for spin systems, you can't have a state that's an eigenstate of both Ay and Az unless it's a simultaneous eigenstate, which is only possible if they commute, which they don't). So, the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az.

Wait, but option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. So that statement would be correct. Because any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A², since A² is a multiple of identity. So C's first part is correct. The second part says they're not eigenfunctions of Az, which is correct because the angular momentum components don't commute. So option C is plausible.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, what does that mean? The basis functions usually refer to the standard basis, like |+> and |-> states. The eigenfunctions of Ay would be the eigenvectors we find. But the matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space. So, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the operator's space. So, option D is saying that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. So that's correct. Because any operator's eigenvectors (if they form a complete set) can form a basis.

Wait, but the basis functions of the operator might refer to the standard basis. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenfunctions (if they form a basis) are the basis. So perhaps D is correct. But I'm a bit confused about what option D is exactly saying.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So, looking back, when I calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

So, let me recap the findings so far. The eigenvalues are ±c, which is ±h/(4π). So, real numbers. So, options A and B are wrong because they talk about complex eigenvalues.

So, only options C and D might be correct.

Option C: eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. As discussed, that's correct.

Option D: eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Hmm, the basis functions are the eigenvectors. So, that's correct, because the eigenvectors of a 2×2 matrix (if they are two linearly independent vectors) form a basis for the space. So, any vector can be expressed in terms of these eigenvectors. So option D is correct.

Wait, but both C and D could be correct. Hmm, but looking back, the options are only one correct.

Wait, the question is asking which statement is correct. So maybe both C and D are correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating D.

Wait, let me think again. The eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors of Ay. The matrix operator Ay is 2x2, so the eigenvectors are two-dimensional vectors. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of Ay are a basis for the space in which the operator acts. So, statement D is correct. Because the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors would form the basis.

But wait, perhaps the wording in D is a bit unclear. It says, "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." Hmm, I'm not sure what exactly is meant by "basis functions of the matrix". Alternatively, perhaps D is correct because the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form the basis.

But in the options, the question gives four statements, and only one is correct.

Wait, let me think about what each option is talking about.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

As I thought earlier, yes because any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A² (since A² is a multiple of the identity matrix, so any vector is an eigenstate). But not eigenstate of Az because Az is a different component and the operators don't commute.

So statement C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay's matrix. So, the eigenfunctions are the basis. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenfunctions (if they are two linearly independent vectors) indeed form a basis. So statement D is correct.

Wait, but perhaps D is not correct. Because the basis functions of the matrix operator are the standard basis, like |0> and |1> or something. The eigenvectors are a different basis, but they can form a basis. So, the statement in D is correct.

But wait, the question says which statement is correct during the calculation.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the correct answer among the options.

Wait, what about the eigenvalue equations.

So, the eigenvalues are real, which rules out A and B.

So, now, looking at C and D.

If the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Since A² is a multiple of identity, any state is an eigenstate. So, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So, that part is correct. As for Az, since [Ay, Az] = iħ A something? Or maybe [Ay, Az] = iħ A... Wait, the commutator of angular momentum components. For spin, [Sx, Sy] = iħ Sz, and similarly for others. So, [Ay, Az] = iħ A something? Wait, but Ay = c S_y, Az = c S_z. So, their commutator is [S_y, S_z] = i S_x. So, [Ay, Az] = c^2 [S_y, S_z] = i c^2 S_x.

Which is not zero, so Ay and Az don't commute. Therefore, their eigenstates are different. So, the eigenfunctions of Ay cannot be eigenfunctions of Az. So, the first part of C is correct, second part is correct. So, C's statement is correct.

Similarly, D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. So, since the operator is 2x2, the eigenfunctions (if distinct and non-degenerate) would form a basis. So, D is correct.

Wait, but I can't have both C and D being correct. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the question is to choose which statement is correct. So, perhaps more than one is correct, but the options are given as A, B, C, D, and I have to choose the correct one.

In the problem, it's a multiple-choice with four options, and only one is correct.

Let me think again.

Option D: the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Well, the matrix operator Ay is represented in the standard basis, which for a 2x2 matrix is the computational basis (like |0> and |1>). The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of Ay would form a different basis, perhaps. So, the statement D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix. Hmm, I'm not sure. The matrix's basis is the standard basis, but the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a different basis. So, perhaps statement D is incorrect because the basis functions of the matrix are the standard basis, not the eigenvectors. So, the eigenvectors are bases, but not the basis in which the matrix is written. So, perhaps D is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, which is the same as the basis in which the matrix is expressed. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps D is trying to say that the eigenfunctions form a basis (which they do), so D is correct.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So let me think about the problem again.

The operator is 2x2, so it's acting on a two-dimensional space. The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of Ay would be two vectors (assuming they are non-degenerate and distinct), which would form a basis for the space. So, yes, the eigenfunctions are a basis for the space. So statement D is correct.

But then, if both C and D are correct, but in the multiple-choice, it's only one correct option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about option D. The question says, 'the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.' So, what is the 'basis functions of the matrix operator'? Maybe the basis in which the matrix is expressed, such as the standard basis. Alternatively, the eigenvectors form a basis, which is different from the standard basis.

Wait, the standard basis is |0> and |1>, but the eigenvectors of Ay could be different vectors. So, the statement D is saying that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Hmm, perhaps that's not correct. Because the matrix is expressed in a particular basis, but the eigenfunctions are in another basis.

Alternatively, maybe the eigenfunctions are the basis of the space, in any case. So, perhaps D is correct.

But I'm getting stuck between options C and D.

Wait, looking back, the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation.

Let me look at the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

We know that any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A², because A² is a multiple of the identity, which commutes with everything. So, that part is correct.

But for Az, since [Ay, Az] is non-zero, their eigenstates are different. So, the eigenfunctions of Ay cannot be eigenfunctions of Az. So, statement C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, I'm not sure. The matrix operator is expressed in the standard basis, but the eigenfunctions are in another basis. So, the eigenfunctions are a basis, but not the basis in which the matrix is written. So, perhaps D is incorrect because they are not the basis functions of the matrix operator (which is expressed in another basis). So, the statement D is not correct.

Alternatively, the term 'basis functions of the matrix operator' might refer to the eigenbasis, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps D is trying to say that the eigenfunctions form a basis, which they do, so D is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the question is more about the process of calculation. So, during the calculation, what do you consider correct.

Let me think, what is the process.

First, we found that the eigenvalues are ±c, which is ± h/(4π).

Then, to find the eigenvectors, we can solve (Ay - a I) |ψ> = 0.

Let me compute the eigenvectors.

For a = c = h/(4π):

Ay - c I = [ -c       -i c ]

          [ i c      -c ]

So, the matrix becomes:

[-c   -i c ]

[i c  -c ]

So, the equations are:

(-c) ψ1 - i c ψ2 = 0 → ψ1 = (i) ψ2.

So, the eigenvectors are proportional to [i, 1]^T.

Similarly, for a = -c:

[Ay + c I] = [ c    -i c ]

            [i c    c ]

So, equations:

c ψ1 -i c ψ2 = 0 → ψ1 = (i) ψ2 * (c/c) → ψ1 = i ψ2.

So, eigenvectors are [i, 1]^T for a = c, and [i, 1]^T for a = -c? Wait, wait, no, I think I made a mistake.

Wait, for a = -c, the matrix is:

c * I + S * ... Wait, no, Ay is c S, so when a = -c, Ay - (-c) I = c S + c I = c (S + I). Wait, perhaps I should recompute.

Wait, Ay = c S. So, for a = c, the matrix (Ay - a I) is c S - c I = c (S - I).

So, the matrix for a = c is:

c*( [0, -i] , [i, 0] ) - c I = c*( [0 -1, -i 0], [i 0, 0-1] )? Wait, no, perhaps I should compute it correctly.

Wait, no, the matrix Ay is:

[ 0, -i c ]

[i c, 0 ]

So, when a = c, Ay - a I is:

[ -c, -i c ]

[ i c, -c ]

So, the first equation is -c ψ1 -i c ψ2 = 0 → -ψ1 -i ψ2 = 0 → ψ1 = -i ψ2.

So, the eigenvector is ψ = [ψ1, ψ2]^T = [-i ψ2, ψ2]^T. So, taking ψ2 = 1, we get ψ = [-i, 1]^T.

Similarly, for a = -c, the matrix Ay - (-c) I = Ay + c I is:

[ c, -i c ]

[i c, c ]

So, the equation is c ψ1 - i c ψ2 = 0 → ψ1 = (i) ψ2.

So, eigenvectors are [i, 1]^T.

So, the two eigenvectors are [-i, 1] and [i, 1].

These are the two eigenfunctions. So, these form a basis for the space. So, any vector can be written as a linear combination of these two. So, the statement D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space.

So, both C and D could be correct, but only one option is correct.

Wait, but looking back, let's reevaluate the options.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A squared, but not of Az. So, that's correct because A squared is a multiple of identity, so eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². But they are not eigenfunctions of Az because the operators don't commute.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So, yes, because they form a basis. So, D is correct.

But according to the options, only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the question again. The question says, during the calculation, which statement is correct.

Wait, perhaps option D is correct because the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Wait, but the basis functions of the matrix operator would be the standard basis vectors. The eigenfunctions are a different basis.

So, perhaps D is incorrect because the eigenfunctions are not the same as the standard basis, which is used to represent the matrix.

Hmm, but the matrix operator is represented in a certain basis, but the eigenfunctions are the basis in their own right. So, perhaps D is correct in that sense.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Because option D may not be correct. Because the eigenfunctions are a basis, but the matrix is represented in a different basis (probably the standard basis). So, during the calculation, when you're finding the eigenfunctions, you'd note that they form a basis, but the statement may not be correct as written.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about each option again.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. As discussed, this is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Hmm, perhaps the matrix is expressed in the standard basis, so the basis functions of the matrix are the standard basis vectors. The eigenfunctions are another basis. So, D is incorrect.

Thus, the correct option is C.

So, the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the operator \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Thus, \( A_y \) becomes:

\[
A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i\frac{h}{4\pi} \\ i\frac{h}{4\pi} & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
The eigenvalues \( a \) of \( A_y \) are found by solving the characteristic equation:

\[
\det(A_y - aI) = 0.
\]

Substituting \( A_y - aI \), we get:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} -a & -i\frac{h}{4\pi} \\ i\frac{h}{4\pi} & -a \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The determinant is:

\[
(-a)(-a) - \left(-i\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)\left(i\frac{h}{4\pi}\right) = a^2 - \left(-i^2 \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2}\right).
\]

Since \( i^2 = -1 \), this simplifies to:

\[
a^2 - \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2} = 0 \implies a^2 = \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2}.
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues are:

\[
a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenvectors of \( A_y \)
For \( a = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the matrix \( A_y - aI \) becomes:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} -\frac{h}{4\pi} & -i\frac{h}{4\pi} \\ i\frac{h}{4\pi} & -\frac{h}{4\pi} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

From the first row, \( -\frac{h}{4\pi} \psi_1 - i\frac{h}{4\pi} \psi_2 = 0 \), which simplifies to \( \psi_1 = -i \psi_2 \). Taking \( \psi_2 = 1 \), the eigenvector is:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

For \( a = -\frac{h}{4\pi} \), the matrix \( A_y - aI \) becomes:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \frac{h}{4\pi} & -i\frac{h}{4\pi} \\ i\frac{h}{4\pi} & \frac{h}{4\pi} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

From the first row, \( \frac{h}{4\pi} \psi_1 - i\frac{h}{4\pi} \psi_2 = 0 \), which simplifies to \( \psi_1 = i \psi_2 \). Taking \( \psi_2 = 1 \), the eigenvector is:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Thus, the eigenfunctions are:

\[
\psi_1 = \begin{bmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \psi_2 = \begin{bmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Analysis of the Options
- **Option A**: This claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \), and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).

- **Option B**: This claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \), and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

- **Option C**: This states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) is a multiple of the identity matrix, so any eigenstate of \( A_y \) is also an eigenstate of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so their eigenfunctions are distinct.

- **Option D**: This states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is ambiguous but likely incorrect because the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form a basis for the space, but the matrix \( A_y \) is typically expressed in the standard basis (e.g., \( |0\rangle, |1\rangle \)).

### Conclusion
The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \).

**Answer: C**
