Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question is about selecting suitable reagents for two reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when I add NaCN, which is a nucleophile, I'm thinking about substitution reactions. But wait, NaCN in a protic solvent maybe? Or perhaps under specific conditions.

Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone. Adding a cyanide nucleophile... Oh! I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. So, the NaCN would act as the nucleophile here. But wait, what's the role of reagent A here? Let me think. Oh, maybe it's about the reaction conditions—like acid catalysis?

If the reaction is acid-catalyzed, then the ketone would be protonated, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. Then, the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon, opening it up. So then, after the nucleophilic attack, we would get an addition product. Let me draw this in my mind. Butan-2-one has a carbonyl group, and adding CN- would form a cyanohydrin. Because the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, cyanohydrin formation, right. Cyanohydrin is when a ketone (or aldehyde) reacts with cyanide ion to form a geminal diol nitrile, I think.

But wait, how does that work? So the ketone (butan-2-one) would react with NaCN in the presence of an acid catalyst. Because without acid, the nucleophilic attack might not happen efficiently. So reagent A is probably H3O+ or another acid. Looking at the options, let's see. The options for A are H3O+ and NaHSO3. Wait, H3O+ is a strong acid, like from HCl or H2SO4.

So, in the first reaction, the ketone plus NaCN plus acid (like H3O+) would form the cyanohydrin. That would generate a secondary alcohol and a nitrile group on the same carbon. So that fits the product given.

So for the first part, A is H3O+. So looking at the options, options A, B, and C have A as H3O+ or NaHSO3. Hmm. So if A is H3O+, then options A and B are candidates.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, so the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

Nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions to form carboxylic acids. The typical conditions are either acidic or basic, but in some cases, you might need a strong acid or base. Oh, right, I think that strong acid conditions are used for hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait, there's another possibility—maybe using H2O and some catalyst.

Wait, the reaction is with reagent B, which is H2O. So perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. Or maybe it's a hydrolysis with H2O and an acid as a catalyst.

Wait, but nitrile hydrolysis—under acidic conditions, you typically have H3O+ and heat. For example, using H2SO4 (which provides H+ and water) and heating. Alternatively, in basic conditions you might use H2O and NaOH, but that would give a sodium salt which then needs acid to protonate.

Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid, so maybe the hydrolysis is under acidic conditions. So reagent B could be HCl. Because HCl provides H+ and Cl- as the counterion. So the reaction would be: nitrile + H2O + H+ → carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options for B, the options are HCl or CH3COOH. So if B is HCl, that makes sense for the second reaction.

Wait, but let's think again. The starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. When the nitrile is hydrolyzed under acidic conditions, it would form a carboxylic acid. So the product would be 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the reaction conditions would be acid (H+) and water.

So for the second reaction, reagent B would be HCl (option A or C). Because HCl is a strong acid, providing the H+ needed for hydrolysis.

Now, putting it together:

First reaction: A = H3O+ (so options A, B). Second reaction: B = HCl (so options A and C).

So looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. Option C is A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.

Wait, but why would NaHSO3 be used? NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a mild reducing agent, right? Or perhaps it's used in other reactions. Oh, wait, the first reaction is a nucleophilic addition. So in the presence of an acid, like H3O+.

But wait, could NaHSO3 be used in some other context? Maybe in a different reaction mechanism. I'm not sure. Let me think again about the first reaction.

Butan-2-one plus NaCN. Under acidic conditions, the ketone is protonated, making it more electrophilic. The CN- attacks, forming the cyanohydrin. So the product is a secondary alcohol (from the CN-) and a nitrile group. So that's straightforward.

So reagent A is H3O+, which is option A or B. So then, the second reaction's reagent B is HCl, making option A or C the possible correct choices.

Wait, the options are:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So option A has A as H3O+ and B as HCl. That would fit both reactions.

But let me double-check the second reaction. If B is HCl, then the conditions are acidic. So nitrile plus HCl and water would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. Yes, that sounds right.

So the correct reagents are A= H3O+ and B=HCl, which is option A.

Wait, but wait another thought. In the second reaction, the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. But when you hydrolyze a nitrile adjacent to an alcohol group, would the conditions affect anything else, like the alcohol? Hmm, but the product is a carboxylic acid, so the hydroxyl group stays as it is. So the conditions shouldn't oxidize the alcohol or anything.

So yes, the second reaction is a hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid, which typically uses strong acid (like H2SO4 and heat) or HCl. So HCl as reagent B makes sense.

So the correct option is A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.


The first reaction involves the nucleophilic addition of NaCN to butan-2-one (a ketone) to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This reaction requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl group, making it more electrophilic for the cyanide ion to attack. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the suitable reagent for this step.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid, which typically requires acidic conditions. HCl, a strong acid, provides the necessary H⁺ ions for this reaction.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH (a weak acid) is not strong enough for the second reaction.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction, as it is not an acid catalyst for nucleophilic addition.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Neither reagent is suitable for either reaction.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
