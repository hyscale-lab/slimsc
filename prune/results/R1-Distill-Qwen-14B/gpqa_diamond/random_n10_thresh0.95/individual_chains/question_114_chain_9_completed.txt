Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the options provided. The reactions are:

1. Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.
2. 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that nitrile groups can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. Let me think about each reaction step by step.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, the structure here... So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? When it reacts with NaCN, which is a nucleophile. Oh wait, I think this is a nucleophilic addition to the ketone.

Wait, but wait. In the presence of an acid catalyst, right? Because ketones reacting with CN- usually require some kind of acid catalysis. So NaCN is the source of CN-, but under what conditions? Oh, maybe it's a substitution or addition.

Wait, but butan-2-one + NaCN – I think this is a ketone undergoing a nucleophilic addition. So the ketone would have the carbonyl group, and the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon. Then, after the addition, you get some sort of intermediate. But in this case, the product is a nitrile and an alcohol. Oh wait, maybe it's a hydrocyanation or something else.

Wait, but butan-2-one has the structure (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with HCN, it adds to the carbonyl to form (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Then, under certain conditions, that might dehydrate or further react. But in this case, the product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure.

Butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CN, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait. Wait, butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile on the end. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that would be a four-carbon chain, with a nitrile group on carbon 1, a hydroxyl and methyl group on carbon 2. So structure is CH2(C(OH)(CH3))CN. Hmm, wait, that would make it 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

But wait, how does that form from butan-2-one and NaCN? Wait, maybe the mechanism is a two-step process: first, the addition of HCN to the ketone, forming a cyanohydrin. Because when a ketone reacts with HCN in the presence of an acid catalyst, it forms a cyanohydrin. The product would have an alcohol and a nitrile group.

So, the reaction of a ketone with HCN (acid catalyzed) gives a cyanohydrin. But wait, in this problem, the reagent is NaCN, not HCN. So perhaps the solution is that NaCN in the presence of an acid (like H3O+) acts as the source of CN- and the acid provides the H+ for the reaction.

So, NaCN is providing the cyanide ions, and reagent A is the acid catalyst. So A should be H3O+ or another acid.

Looking at the product, it's a cyanohydrin, which comes from the addition of HCN to the ketone. So the first step is that butan-2-one reacts with HCN (from NaCN and acid) to form the cyanohydrin, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

So for the first reaction, A is probably H3O+ (acid). So looking at options, which options have A as H3O+? Options A and B.

Now moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. And the reagent is B, which is H2O. The product is the corresponding butanoic acid. So, this looks like a hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.

Nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. In this case, the starting material has a hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile. Wait, so in the molecule, it's -C(OH)(CH2CH2Ph)CN. When this undergoes hydrolysis, the nitrile group (-CN) becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH). 

But wait, under what conditions does this happen? Nitrile hydrolysis typically requires either strong acid or strong base. Another thing to consider is the presence of water as the solvent here. Wait, the question says reagent B is H2O. Hmm, maybe it's in the presence of an acid or base catalyst.

Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid, so likely the hydrolysis is under acidic conditions. Alternatively, sometimes nitriles are hydrolyzed in the presence of H2O and acid to form carboxylic acids. So what's the usual reagent for this?

I recall that when nitriles are treated with water under acidic conditions (like H2SO4 and heat), they hydrolyze to carboxylic acids. Alternatively, under basic conditions, they might form carboxylates which can be acidified.

In the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is H2O. So perhaps the reaction is using H2O with an acid catalyst. So in the options, B would be an acid. Let's look at the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: B = HCl. So HCl is a strong acid. So if the reaction uses HCl as the catalyst, that would make sense.

Option B: B = CH3COOH. So acetic acid, a weaker acid.

Option C: B= HCl, A= NaHSO3. But earlier, we thought A is H3O+.

Option D: B=CH3COOH, A= NaHSO3.

Wait, the second reaction is in the presence of H2O and reagent B. So if B is HCl (a strong acid), the nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid.

So for the second reaction, B must be a strong acid like HCl. Looking back, the options: options A and C have B as HCl.

Wait, but in the first reaction, which option has A as H3O+ and B as HCl? Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

So if that's the case, then option A would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me think again. The first reaction is butanone + NaCN + A → product. So A is the acid. So that would be H3O+.

The second reaction is the cyanohydrin (with OH and CN groups) reacting with H2O and B. So for the nitrile to become a carboxylic acid, under what conditions?

Wait, another thought: the presence of a hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile. So maybe the molecule is set up for some kind of oxidation. But I think in this case, it's hydrolysis.

Wait, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids using strong acid and water. So in the presence of HCl and H2O, the nitrile becomes a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, maybe the H2O is the solvent, and the acid is the catalyst. So if B is HCl, that's the acid.

So looking back at the options, the correct pair would be A = H3O+ and B = HCl, which is option A.

Wait, but another possibility: the second reaction uses a different acid. Let me think again.

In the first reaction, A is H3O+. So the reagent is an acid. So the first reaction is a nucleophilic addition of CN- to the ketone, which is acid-catalyzed, forming the cyanohydrin.

The second reaction is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. So it's likely that this is done under acidic conditions, using HCl as the catalyst.

So option A says A is H3O+ and B is HCl.

Wait, but why is option C an option? Let me check: option C has A as NaHSO3. What's that? Sodium bisulfate is a source of H+ and SO4^2-.

Wait, but in the first reaction, if A were NaHSO3, it would provide H+ (acid) as well. So perhaps that's also possible. But in the options, option C has B as HCl, so for the second reaction, the nitrile would be hydrolyzed with HCl.

So if both reactions are using H+ as a catalyst, then either option A or C could be possibilities.

Wait, but in the first reaction, NaCN and H3O+ (acid) would generate HCN, which adds to the ketone.

Alternatively, if you have NaCN and NaHSO3 (which is an acid), that could also allow the same reaction. So which is more likely?

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: looking at the product of the first reaction. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That's a cyanohydrin, which is formed by the addition of HCN to the ketone. So the process is the acid-catalyzed addition of HCN.

HCN is typically used with an acid catalyst, like H2SO4, H3O+, etc. So in this case, NaCN provides the CN-, but to form HCN, you need some acid. So A is the acid, which is H3O+.

So the first reaction uses H3O+ as A, which is in options A and B.

The second reaction uses HCl as B, which is in option A.

So option A would have reagents H3O+ and HCl.

But wait, option C has A as NaHSO3, which would supply H+ and SO3^2-? Wait, no, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which in acidic conditions (like in solution) would donate H+.

But I think H3O+ is more straightforward as the acid for the first reaction.

So, putting it all together, option A seems correct. But let me check the other options.

Option D has B as CH3COOH. So the second reaction would be in the presence of acetic acid. But for nitrile hydrolysis to acid, I think a stronger acid like HCl is more effective. So option A is more likely for the second reaction.

Wait, another thought: maybe the second reaction uses a different method. For example, if the nitrile is adjacent to an alcohol, maybe it's a different kind of reaction, like elimination followed by something else. But I don't think so. The product is a carboxylic acid, which suggests hydrolysis.

So I think the correct reagents are A=H3O+ and B=HCl, which is option A.


The problem involves two reactions, and the goal is to determine the correct reagents (A and B) from the given options. Here's the analysis:

### Reaction 1:
**Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**

Butan-2-one is a ketone, and NaCN provides cyanide ions (CN⁻). The product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, is a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrins are typically formed by the nucleophilic addition of HCN to ketones, which requires an acid catalyst. In this case, NaCN acts as the source of CN⁻, and reagent A must provide the acidic environment to facilitate the reaction. Therefore, A is likely **H₃O⁺** (acid).

### Reaction 2:
**2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**

The starting material is a nitrile-containing compound, and the product is a carboxylic acid. This indicates the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Nitrile hydrolysis typically requires water and an acid or base catalyst. Since the product is a carboxylic acid, the reaction likely occurs under acidic conditions. Among the options, **HCl** (a strong acid) is the most suitable choice for B.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  - H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first reaction as an acid catalyst. HCl is suitable for the second reaction as a strong acid catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis. This option is consistent with both reactions.

- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  - While H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first reaction, CH₃COOH (a weak acid) is less effective for the hydrolysis of nitriles compared to HCl. This makes option B less likely.

- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  - NaHSO₃ can act as an acid, but H₃O⁺ is more straightforward and commonly used for the first reaction. This makes option C less favorable.

- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  - Similar to option C, NaHSO₃ is less commonly used for the first reaction. Additionally, CH₃COOH is a weak acid and less effective for the second reaction. This makes option D unlikely.

### Conclusion:
The most suitable reagents are **A = H₃O⁺** and **B = HCl**, which correspond to **Option A**.

Answer: A
