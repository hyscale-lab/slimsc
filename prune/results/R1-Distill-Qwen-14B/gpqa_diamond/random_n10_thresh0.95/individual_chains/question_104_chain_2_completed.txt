Okay, so I have this astronomy question in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and understand what's being asked.

The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Two stars with the same mass as the Sun each have a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The key data points are the periodic shifts in their spectral lines: Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm. I remember that the RV method detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. The shift relates to the mass of the planet and the star's velocity in its orbit around the barycenter. Since both stars have the same mass (like the Sun), and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), the velocity of the star would depend on the planet's mass and the orbital period.

Wait, but wait. The RV method gives us the velocity of the star, right? The formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is given by K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )) * (1 / (2π)) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(2/3) )). But since M_p is much less than M_*, which is solar mass, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so we can ignore M_p in the denominator. Also, since the orbits are circular, e=0, so the denominator terms are 1. So the formula simplifies. Let me think, the simplified version is K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_* )^(2/3) )) ), but since M_p << M_*, 1 + M_p/M_* ≈ 1, so it's approximately K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(2π)) )^(1/3). Wait, maybe I'm getting this a bit wrong. Alternatively, another approach: the formula for K is often written as K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ]^(1/3) ) * [1/(2π)]^(1/3) ) * [1/( (a (1 + M_p/(M_*)) ) ) ]? Hmm, maybe a better approach is to think about the relation between the velocity semi-amplitude and the orbital period.

Wait, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much less than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and M_p sin i ≈ M_p (assuming sin i is close to 1). So K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * M_p / ( M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, but I'm trying to relate K to the period P. Since both stars have the same mass and both planets have the same mass, the ratio K1/K2 can be simplified.

Wait, no. Wait, both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so M_p1 ≈ M_p2. The stars have the same mass, M_*1 = M_*2. So when considering K1 and K2, since they're the same, the only variable left is the period. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)).

Wait, but let me write it more properly. The formula for K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) ) * (1) / (P^(1/3) )^{-1} ? Let me think again. Let me get the formula right.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / ( (2π)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * ( 1 / ( (a (1 + M_p/(M_*)) ) ) )

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I've read that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (28.4 m/s) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_jup) ) * ( (P / (yr)) )^(-1/3) ) * ( (M_* / M_sun )^(-2/3) ) ) / ( (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) )

But since M_* is much larger than M_p, 1 + M_p/M_* ≈ 1, so we can ignore it. So, K ≈ 28.4 m/s * (M_p / M_jup) * (P / yr )^(-1/3) * (M_* / M_sun )^(-2/3 )

Wait, but in this problem, M_p1 ≈ M_p2, and M_*1 = M_*2 = M_sun. So the only variable is P.

So K1 / K2 = ( (P2 / P1 ) )^(1/3 )

Wait, let me correct that. Because K ∝ P^(-1/3), so (K1)/(K2) = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Wait, let's think. Since K is proportional to P^(-1/3), K1 = C * P1^(-1/3), K2 = C * P2^(-1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

But in our case, the given K1 is 5 mA, K2 is 7 mA. Wait, no: the question says, for Planet #1, the shift is 5 mA, and for Planet #2, it's 7 mA. So K1 =5, K2=7.

So (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Wait, because K1/K2 = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

So (5/7) = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

So to find P2/P1, cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

Wait, no, because (K1/K2) = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 ). So P2/P1 = (K1/K2 )^3.

Wait, let me double-check. Let me write the formula again.

K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) )

So K = constant * (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

So K1 / K2 = [ (M_p1 / M_*1^(2/3) ) * (1 / P1^(1/3) ) ] / [ (M_p2 / M_*2^(2/3) ) * (1 / P2^(1/3) ) ]

But M_p1 ≈ M_p2, and M_*1 = M_*2, so it simplifies to (K1/K2) = (P2^(1/3) ) / (P1^(1/3) )

So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Which can be rearranged to (K1/K2 )^3 = P2 / P1.

Wait, but wait: if K1 < K2, then (K1/K2)^3 is less than 1, so P2 is less than P1. That would mean that Planet #2 has a shorter orbital period than Planet #1. But the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1.

Wait, no, wait. The question says, 'how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?' So we're looking for P2/P1.

Wait, let's compute this.

Given K1 =5, K2=7.

So K1/K2 =5/7 ≈ 0.7143.

So (K1/K2 )^3 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2 )^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the period of #2 is shorter than #1 by about a factor of 0.36. So the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1, which would be P2/P1 = 0.36. So that would be approximately 0.36 times, which is less than 1. So the period of #2 is shorter than #1, and the ratio is about 0.36. So the answer would be ~0.36.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36.

Wait, but wait again. Let me make sure I didn't get the ratio reversed. The question is, how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So P2 is x times larger than P1. So x is P2/P1.

From our calculation, P2/P1 ≈ (5/7)^3 ≈ 125/343 ≈ ~0.364. So x is ~0.36, meaning P2 is about 0.36 times P1, so it's shorter, not longer. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is asking how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. So the answer would be 0.36 times as long. So the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me think about the formula again. Because when K increases, the velocity semi-amplitude is higher, which implies the star is moving faster, which would suggest a shorter period? Because a higher velocity would imply a more massive planet, but in this case, the planet masses are the same. So higher K would imply a shorter period, because the star is moving faster in its orbit, which for the same mass planet, would mean a tighter orbit, hence shorter period.

Wait, but in our case, K is higher for planet #2 (7 mA vs 5 mA). So Planet #2 has a higher K, which means a shorter period. So P2 < P1. So the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1. So when the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1, the answer would be about 0.36 times as long, meaning it's about 36% of P1. So the answer is about 0.36 times longer, which is option A.

So the answer should be A.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV semi-amplitude is given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies that \( K_1 / K_2 = (P_2 / P_1)^{1/3} \). Rearranging, we find:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

From the problem, Planet #1 has a spectral line shift of 5 milliangstroms (\( K_1 = 5 \)), and Planet #2 has a shift of 7 milliangstroms (\( K_2 = 7 \)). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
