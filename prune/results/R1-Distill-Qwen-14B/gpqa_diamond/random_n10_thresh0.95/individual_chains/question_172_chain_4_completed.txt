Okay, so I've got this question about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I need to figure out which equation correctly relates the effective temperatures of the two stars, T1 and T2.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, I remember that in stars, if the temperature is higher, the atoms are more likely to be excited to higher energy levels because of the thermal energy. So star_1 must be hotter than star_2? Because more excitation means higher energy levels are more populated.

Wait, but the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, that's the same as k (Boltzmann constant) because k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So maybe that's a clue.

Since the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), I can use the Boltzmann equation for the distribution of energy levels. The Boltzmann factor says that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula is n_upper/n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)).

In this case, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So let's denote n1 as the population in star_1 and n2 as in star_2. So n1 = 2 * n2.

Wait, but the problem says that the energy difference is the same for both stars because it's the same transition, same atoms. So ΔE is the same for both.

So for star_1: n1 = (g) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) where g is the statistical weight (maybe it's the same for both stars since it's the same atoms, so g1 = g2).

Similarly, for star_2: n2 = g * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

So the ratio n1/n2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let me double-check. The ratio is exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ). Because when you subtract the exponents, the denominator is T for each.

But according to the question, n1/n2 = 2. So:

2 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

But wait, I think I got the ratio backward. If n1 is the excited state in star_1, and n2 is in star_2, then the ratio is n1/n2 = 2. So:

2 = exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Hmm, wait wait, let me think about the exponents. The Boltzmann factor is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So for the ratio, it's (upper)/(lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So when you take the ratio n1/n2, which is (upper_1)/(upper_2), wait no, wait. No, n1 is the population in star_1 for a certain level, and n2 is the same level in star_2. So the ratio of their populations is n1/n2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

So 2 = exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

But wait, wait. Actually, the ratio is n1/n2 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) )

Wait, let me check that again. Let's say for star_1, the ratio is n_upper_1 / n_lower_1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star_2, n_upper_2 / n_lower_2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But in this problem, we are comparing the same energy level in both stars. So wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait no, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So for a particular energy level, say level E, the number of atoms in that level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So n1(E) = 2 * n2(E).

But using the Boltzmann distribution, n(E) is proportional to exp( -E/(k T) ) multiplied by the statistical weight. So, assuming the statistical weights are the same for both stars (same element, same transition), the ratio n1(E)/n2(E) = exp( -E/(k T1) ) / exp( -E/(k T2) ) ) = exp( E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, but the energy difference is ΔE = E_upper - E_lower. Oh wait, maybe I'm looking at the transition, so ΔE is the difference between the two energy levels involved. But in the question, the specific energy level is one level, so perhaps I'm looking at the population in that level relative to the ground state.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is comparing the excitation of a specific level, so for a given level E, n(E) is given by the Boltzmann factor.

But regardless, the ratio n1/n2 is 2, so:

2 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, wait, but wait. Let me get this right. n1 = 2 * n2.

n1 = g * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

n2 = g * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So n1/n2 = exp( (ΔE/k)(1/(T2) -1/(T1)) )

So:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

But ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly the value of k. So ΔE = k. Let me plug that in.

Yes, because k is 1.38e-23 J/K, and ΔE is given as that. So ΔE = k.

So substituting:

ln(2) = (k / k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Simplify:

ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

But that can be rewritten as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 * T2 )

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So, ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1*T2 )

So the correct option is D.


To determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of the two stars, we use the Boltzmann distribution. The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels, \( \Delta E \), is given as \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which matches the value of the Boltzmann constant \( k \).

The Boltzmann distribution relates the populations of two energy levels as:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
\]

where \( n_1 \) and \( n_2 \) are the populations of the energy level in star_1 and star_2, respectively. Since \( n_1 = 2n_2 \), we have:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E = k \) (as given in the problem):

\[
\ln(2) = \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. Therefore, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
