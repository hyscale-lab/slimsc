Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let's see. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you titrate it with a strong base like NaOH, you get a buffer solution until the equivalence point. After that, it's the salt of the weak acid and water, so it will be basic.

The question says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the first thing I should probably calculate is the new concentration after dilution.

Wait, dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 would be (M1 * V1) / V2. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, and V2 is 40 cm³ because we added 20 cm³ of water. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40. Let me calculate that: 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Then, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the question asks about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, the 25% titration point refers to the point where 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So I need to find the pH at that point and then at the equivalence point.

Let me first tackle the 25% titration.

At 25% titration, how many moles of NaOH have been added? Let's see. The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) in the diluted solution would be Molarity * Volume in liters. So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Because 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, but wait, the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So 0.025 * 0.04 is 0.001 moles of CH3COOH.

25% titration means 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of NaOH have been added. Since NaOH is a strong base, it will react with the acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio.

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, moles of CH3COOH initially: 0.001 mol. Moles of NaOH added: 0.00025 mol. So moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed: 0.00025 mol.

So now, the solution is a buffer solution of acetic acid and acetate. The pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5. Let me compute pKa: log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5) = 0.267 + (-5) = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Then, [A^-] is 0.00025 mol, and [HA] is 0.00075 mol. So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333.

So log(1/3) is log(0.3333) which is approximately -0.477. So pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) = 4.256. Rounded to two decimal places, that's around 4.26.

Wait, but wait, the volume is important here. Because after adding some NaOH, the total volume changes. Oh right, but wait, in the buffer solution, the concentrations are in terms of moles divided by the total volume. But when using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, the ratio of
