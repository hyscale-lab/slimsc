Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm. The problem is about calculating the minimum energy of a system of charges. I remember that when dealing with charges, potential energy comes into play, especially when they're arranged in a certain way.

So the setup: there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, which is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2 times that, so 3.204 x 10^-19 C. But wait, I think the total charge might matter, but for potential energy, it's more about the interactions between individual pairs.

Now, the system: 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. Oh, so the 13th is at the center, and the other 12 are all at the same distance from it.

Wait, so the 13th charge is fixed at P. So the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. I'm trying to visualize this. So maybe all 12 are arranged in a sphere around P? Or perhaps they're all on the same point? But the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So they might be arranged in some configuration, but their exact arrangement might not matter when it comes to calculating the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy of the system. So I think this is a problem about finding the electrostatic potential energy. For a system of charges, the potential energy is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions.

But wait, in this case, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So, when we bring the 12 charges to their positions, each is at distance 2 meters from P. So the potential energy would be due to the interactions between the 13th charge and each of the 12, plus any interactions between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but wait. The problem says it's an isolated system. So all the charges are in the system, and we have to consider all their mutual interactions.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed. So perhaps when calculating the potential energy, we have to consider the work done against the electric field of the fixed charge when bringing each of the 12 charges into place. Also, the 12 charges, once placed, will exert a potential among themselves, so their interactions contribute to the total potential energy.

Alternatively, in the problem, the 13th is fixed, so the potential energy due to the 12 charges each interacting with it would be considered. Also, the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves. But wait, if the 12 charges are each at 2 m from P, but also, are they placed symmetrically? Like on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m. So each of them is 2 m away from P, but their distance from each other could vary depending on their arrangement. But the problem says the 12 charges are "constrained" to stay at 2 m from P. So maybe their positions are fixed, but their mutual distances could vary. Hmm, but when finding the minimum energy, perhaps the arrangement that minimizes the potential energy would have the 12 charges as close as possible to each other, but since they're constrained to be 2 m from P, their mutual distances would be determined by that constraint.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the system's potential energy. The potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges.

So the system has two kinds of interactions:

1. Between the fixed charge (at P) and each of the 12 charges at 2 m away.
2. Between each pair of the 12 charges.

Wait, but the 12 charges are identical and each is at 2 m from P. So for the first part, each of the 12 charges interacts with the fixed charge. Since the 13th is fixed, when you bring each of the 12 charges into place, the potential energy added is the work done against the electric field of the fixed charge.

Wait, but when the 13th is fixed, perhaps the potential energy contribution from each of the 12 charges is (2e)*(2e)/(4πε0 * r), where r is 2 m. And since there are 12 such charges, the total would be 12 times that.

But wait, no. Because the potential energy between two charges is U = (k q1 q2)/r. So for the fixed charge and each of the 12, each pair contributes (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2). So each pair contributes k*(4e²)/(2), which is 2k e². So with 12 such pairs, that's 12 * 2k e² = 24 k e².

Wait, but wait a second. The fixed charge is at P, and each of the 12 is at 2 m. So each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy of (k*(2e)^2)/2, right? So each pair (13th and one of the 12) contributes U = k*(2e)^2 / (2m), since r is 2 m.

Wait, let me define k as 1/(4πε0), which is approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

So each such pair contributes U = (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2 * 2) ? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, no. The distance is 2 m, so r is 2. So for each pair (13th and one of the 12), the potential energy is (k)*(2e)*(2e)/(2). So that's (k * 4e²)/2 = 2k e².

Since there are 12 such pairs, the total U1 is 12 * 2k e² = 24 k e².

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, when you bring each charge into place, the potential energy added is (k q1 q2)/r. So for each of the 12 charges, q1 is 2e, q2 is 2e, and r is 2 m. So each contributes (k * (2e)(2e))/2 = (4 k e²)/2 = 2 k e². So 12 of them would be 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Now, the second part is the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves. Since they are each at 2 m from P, but their mutual distances would determine their own interactions. For example, if they are placed on a sphere of radius 2m, each pair would be separated by a distance that depends on the angle between them, but the minimum potential energy would be when the charges are as close as possible. Wait, but wait, in a system of identical charges, the potential energy is minimized when they are as far apart as possible, because the potential energy is positive when like charges are separated (since U is positive for repulsion). Wait, no, wait: for positive charges, the potential energy is higher when they are closer, because you have to do work against their repulsion to bring them closer. Hmm, so the minimal potential energy would actually be when they are as far apart as possible, but in this problem, their positions are fixed at 2 m from P. So their mutual distances are constrained by the geometry, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that's impossible because they're constrained to be 2 m apart. Wait, no, they're each at 2 m from P, but their mutual distances could vary. But regardless, calculating the sum of all mutual interactions between the 12 charges would be complicated because we'd have to know the exact arrangement. But perhaps in the problem, the 12 charges are all fixed in place, so their mutual potential energy is considered as part of the system.

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem says the system is isolated, so all interactions are considered. But perhaps the 12 charges are all at a distance of 2 m from P, but their mutual distances are whatever they are. Hmm, but without knowing the exact positions, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 and the fixed charge. Or maybe the potential energy between the 12 charges is not considered because they are all at the same point. Wait, no, that can't be. If all 12 are at the same point, which is 2 m from P, then each of them would be 0 meters apart from each other. That would mean their mutual potential energy is very high, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the problem assumes that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is 2 m from P, but their mutual distances are such that they form a regular dodecahedron or something, but that's not given.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the 12 and the fixed charge, and not their mutual interactions. Because in that case, the calculation would be simpler, and match one of the options.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 5.645e-26 J, option B is about half that, etc.

So let me compute the first part: the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12.

Each pair contributes (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2 m) = (k *4 e²)/2 = 2 k e².

So for 12 pairs: 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Wait, but wait, another approach. The potential energy between two point charges is U = (k q1 q2)/r.

So for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy relative to the fixed charge is U = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2) ) = (4 k e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

So 12 charges: 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Now, what's the value of k? 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So let's compute 24 * k * e².

e is 1.602e-19 C.

So e squared is (1.602e-19)^2 = approximately 2.566e-38 C².

So 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

8.988e9 = 8.988 x 10^9

2.566e-38 = 2.566 x 10^-38

Multiply them: 8.988 * 2.566 ≈ let's compute that.

8 * 2.566 is about 20.528, 0.988 * 2.566 ≈ approx 2.534. So total around 23.062.

So 23.062 x 10^(9-38) = 23.062e-29.

Wait, 10^9 * 10^-38 = 10^-29.

So 23.062e-29 is 2.3062e-28.

Then multiply by 24: 24 * 2.3062e-28 = ?

24 * 2.3062 = approximately 55.3488.

So 55.3488e-28 = 5.53488e-27 J.

Wait, but wait, that's just the potential energy from the first part, the interaction between the 13th and the 12 others. But we also have to consider the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, I think I might have missed that. Because each of the 12 charges also interacts with each other, so their mutual potential energy must be considered as well.

Hmm, so the total potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies from the fixed charge and the 12 others, plus the potential energies between all pairs of the 12.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy, so maybe that implies that we arrange the 12 in a way that minimizes the total potential energy. But without knowing their arrangement, perhaps the problem is only considering the fixed charge's interactions, or perhaps it's a simplification.

Wait, but looking back at the question, it says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So their positions are fixed relative to P, but their mutual distances vary. However, calculating all their mutual interactions would be complicated without knowing their exact arrangement.

But wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12, and not the potential energy between the 12. Because maybe the 12 are at the same point, which would make their mutual distances zero, leading to infinite potential energy, which is impossible. So perhaps the 12 are arranged such that their mutual potential energy is zero? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the 12 are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are all equal, perhaps forming a regular polygon or something, but without knowing that, it's hard to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12, not their mutual interactions. Let me see what the possible answers are.

In the initial calculation, without considering the 12's mutual energy, we got approximately 5.534e-27 J. But looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher than that. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate the first part more accurately.

Compute 24 * k * e².

k = 8.988e9 N m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 ≈ 2.566e-38 C².

So 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

Let me compute 8.988 * 2.566: 8 * 2.566 is 20.528, 0.988 * 2.566 ≈ 2.534. So total ≈ 23.062.

So 23.062e9-38 = 23.062e-29 = 2.3062e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.3062e-28 = 55.3488e-28 = 5.53488e-27 J.

So that's the first part: 5.53488e-27 J.

But we also have to consider the potential energy between the 12 charges.

Each pair among the 12 contributes U = (k * (2e)^2 ) / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between two of the 12 charges.

But without knowing r_ij, it's tricky. However, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that each is as far as possible from the others, but constrained to 2 m from P. Alternatively, maybe they are all placed on the same point, but that would cause their mutual distance to zero, leading to infinite potential energy, which isn't possible.

Wait, but maybe the 12 charges are arranged in a regular dodecahedron around P, each at 2 m from P. In that case, the distance between any two adjacent charges would be calculated using the formula for the edge length of a regular dodecahedron, but that's complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the distance between any two charges in such a configuration is 2 m multiplied by some factor, but without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are all at the same point, which would mean that their mutual potential energy is (12 choose 2) * (k (2e)^2 ) / 0, but division by zero isn't possible, so that can't be the case. So perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered zero, but that doesn't make sense because like charges repel.

Wait, maybe the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are so spread out that their mutual distances are effectively infinite, so their mutual potential energy is negligible. But that doesn't seem right, because 12 same charges at 2 m from a central point would have a finite mutual potential energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem only considers the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12, and not their mutual interactions. So the total U would be 5.534e-27 J, which is approximately 5.535e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher than this. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge, but double-counting or something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy of (k*(2e)^2)/2. So for each charge, that's (8.988e9 * (3.204e-19)^2 ) / 2.

Wait, let's compute that exactly.

(2e)^2 = 4e².

So U per charge is (k *4e²)/(2) = 2 k e².

So for 12 charges, that's 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

So same as before, U = 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, let me compute this again:

e = 1.602e-19 C.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = approx 2.566e-38 C².

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So 24 * k * e² = 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Let me compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 first.

8.988e9 = 8.988 x 10^9.

2.566e-38 = 2.566 x 10^-38.

Multiply: 8.988 * 2.566 ≈ 23.062.

10^9 * 10^-38 = 10^-29.

So 23.062e-29 = 2.3062e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.3062e-28 = 55.3488e-28 = 5.53488e-27 J.

So that's the potential energy due to the fixed charge and the 12.

Now, what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves?

Each pair contributes U = (k*(2e)^2)/r_ij.

But without knowing r_ij, it's hard to compute. However, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are all 2 m as well, but that's not possible because they're all at the same distance from P, but that would require them to lie on a sphere, but their mutual distances would vary.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are all the same, but that's only possible in certain configurations. For example, if the 12 charges are placed at the vertices of a regular icosahedron with radius 2 m, their mutual distances would be the same. But I'm not sure what that distance would be.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to consider only the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12, and not their mutual interactions. So in that case, the total potential energy is 5.534e-27 J. But looking at the options, that's not one of them. The closest option is C) 7.056e-27.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check.

Wait, 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, (1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2 * 10^-38 = 2.566e-38.

8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 23.062e-29 = 2.3062e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.3062e-28 = 55.3488e-28 = 5.53488e-27 J.

Hmm, but that's not matching any option. Wait, looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is about five times larger than this. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me recompute.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

(2e)^2 = 4e² = 4 * (1.602e-19)^2 = 4 * 2.566e-38 = 1.0264e-37 C².

So U per pair is (8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37) / 2 = ?

Wait, because each pair is 2 m apart. So per pair, the U is (k * (2e)^2 ) / r. So for each of the 12 pairs (13th and each of the 12), it's (8.988e9) * (4e²) / 2.

Wait, 4e² is 4 * (1.602e-19)^2 = 4 * 2.566e-38 = 1.0264e-37.

So per pair, U = (8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37) / 2.

Let me compute 8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37.

8.988e9 = 8.988 x 10^9.

1.0264e-37 = 1.0264 x 10^-37.

Multiply them: 8.988 * 1.0264 ≈ approx 9.232.

10^9 * 10^-37 = 10^-28.

So 9.232e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.616e-28.

That's per pair. So 12 pairs would be 12 * 4.616e-28 = 55.392e-28 = 5.5392e-27 J.

Same as before.

So that's about 5.54e-27 J. But none of the options match that exactly.

Looking back at the options:

A)5.645e-26

B)2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330

Wait, so option C is 7.056e-27 J.

Hmm, which is about 1.27 times higher than our calculated value of 5.54e-27.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Wait, perhaps I should be considering all possible pairs including the 12 and the 13th. Wait, no, because in that calculation, each of the 12 is paired with the 13th, so that's 12 pairs.

But perhaps I need to consider that each of the 12 charges also interacts with the others. So the total U is U1 (between 13th and 12) plus U2 (between the 12).

So U_total = U1 + U2.

But without knowing U2, it's impossible to proceed. However, perhaps the problem is only asking for U1, so the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12.

But in that case, the answer would be approximately 5.54e-27 J. But option C is 7.056e-27, which is roughly 1.27 times that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to multiply by 12 instead of 24.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that each is 2 m from P, but their mutual distances are also 2 m. So each pair of the 12 is at 2 m from each other, but that's only possible if they're all at the same point, which would cause their mutual potential energy to be (12 choose 2) * (k*(2e)^2)/0, which is infinite. So that can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between each of the 12 and the fixed charge, but each pair is counted twice. So for 12 charges, each contributes 2k e², so 12 * 2k e² is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exponents.

Let me recalculate the numerical value.

Compute 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute each part step by step.

First, (1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2 x 1e-38 = 2.566e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 2.566e-38 * 8.988e9 = (2.566 * 8.988) x 10^(-38 +9) = 23.062e-29 = 2.3062e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.3062e-28 = 55.3488e-28 = 5.53488e-27 J.

Same as before.

So the potential energy from the 13th and the 12 is about 5.534e-27 J.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps the problem is intended to include the mutual potential energy of the 12 charges.

Wait, how many pairs are there among the 12 charges? It's the combination of 12 taken 2 at a time, so 12C2 = 66 pairs.

Each pair contributes U = k*(2e)^2 / r_ij.

But without knowing r_ij, perhaps the problem assumes that each pair is at a distance of 2 m from each other, but that's not possible because all 12 cannot be at the same point as each other and 2 m from P.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that all 12 are arranged such that their mutual distances are also 2 m, but that's impossible in 3D space without overlapping. So perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy from the fixed charge, and the options are incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think differently.

Another approach: The potential energy of the entire system is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

So the system has 13 charges. The potential energy is the sum over all pairs.

But the 13th charge is fixed, so we calculate the potential energy between it and each of the 12. Then, we calculate the potential energy between each pair of the 12.

So U_total = U_13 + U_12.

Where U_13 is the potential energy between the 13th and the 12, and U_12 is the potential energy between the 12.

Now, U_13 = 12 * (k*(2e)^2 ) / 2 = 12 * (k *4e²)/2 = 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

U_12 is the sum over all pairs among the 12. Each pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/r_ij. But without knowing r_ij, we can't compute this. So perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is zero, but that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are at a distance where their mutual potential energy is negligible compared to U_13. So the minimum energy would be U_13, but that doesn't seem to fit with the options.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J. Let me compute what that would correspond to.

7.056e-27 J = 7.056e-27 J.

If U_13 is 5.534e-27, then perhaps U_12 is adding another 1.5e-27, making the total around 7e-27.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is only considering U_13, but I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying and only considering the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12, but only once. So for each of the 12, the potential energy is (k*(2e)^2)/2, so 12 * (k*4e²)/2 = 12 * 2k e² = 24 k e².

Which gives the same 5.534e-27 J.

But that's not matching any option except perhaps option C if I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of exponents. Let me recompute 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

(1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

So 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = (8.988 * 2.566) x 10^9 x 10^-38 = 23.062 x 10^-29 = 2.3062e-28.

Now multiply by 24: 24 * 2.3062e-28 = 55.3488e-28 = 5.53488e-27 J.

So the value is approximately 5.535e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C)7.056e-27, but that's about 1.27 times higher.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I used the correct charge. The problem states each charge has 2e, so 2e each, and the 13th is also 2e.

Wait, wait a minute, in my calculation, I considered (2e)^2, but perhaps I should have used 2e for each charge. So each pair between the 13th and the 12 is (2e)*(2e) = 4e². So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the charges as +2e or -2e, but since they're identical, it doesn't matter for the potential energy calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the total potential energy including the 13th charge's self-energy, but that's not relevant here as the 13th is fixed.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent when converting 10^-29 to 10^-28.

Wait, 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 23.062e-29 = 2.3062e-28.

Yes, that's correct.

So, perhaps the problem is expecting only the potential energy between the 13th and the 12, leading to 5.534e-27 J, but that's not an option.

Wait, the options are:

A)5.645e-26

B)2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330.

Hmm. So option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 1.27 times higher than our calculation. So perhaps I missed a factor of 1.27 somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should be using the charge of 2e for each, but in the calculation, perhaps I used e instead of 2e. No, I think I used 2e correctly.

Wait, let me try to compute 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 more precisely.

Compute 1.602e-19 squared:

1.602 * 1.602 = (1.6)^2 = 2.56, plus 0.002^2 is negligible, so about 2.566.

So 2.566e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 2.566e-38 * 8.988e9 = ?

2.566 * 8.988 ≈ 23.062 as before.

So 23.062e-29.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 23.062e-29 = 553.488e-29 = 5.53488e-27 J.

Hmm. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges contributes (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2), so 12 * (4 k e²) / 2 = 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

But maybe I should consider that each pair is counted twice in the sum. No, in the sum over all pairs, each pair is considered once.

Wait, no, in the sum over all pairs, each pair is considered once. So for the 13th and the 12, it's 12 pairs, and for the 12, it's 66 pairs.

But perhaps the problem is only asking for the potential energy between the 13th and the 12, and not the mutual energy. So in that case, the answer would be approximately 5.53e-27 J, but that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think about another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 13th charge is fixed, so when calculating the potential energy, we only consider the work done to bring each of the 12 charges from infinity to their positions, which is U = (k (2e) (2e))/ (2 m) for each. So 12 * (k (4e²)/(2 m)).

Which is 12 * (2 k e²) =24 k e².

Which gives the same 5.53e-27 J.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is using a different value for k, like 9e9 instead of 8.988e9.

Let me try that.

k = 9e9 N·m²/C².

So 24 * 9e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute 9e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 =9e9 * 2.566e-38 = 23.094e-29 = 2.3094e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.3094e-28 = 55.4256e-28 = 5.54256e-27 J.

Still, that's roughly the same as before.

Hmm. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the number of pairs.

Wait, perhaps each of the 12 charges interacts with the 13th, so 12 interactions, and each contributes (k * (2e)^2 ) / 2.

So 12 * (8.988e9 * (3.204e-19)^2 ) /2.

Wait, 3.204e-19 C is 2e.

So (2e)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 = 1.0264e-37 C².

So 8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37 = 9.232e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.616e-28.

Multiply by 12: 55.392e-28 =5.5392e-27 J.

Same as before.

So perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 5.539e-27 J, but none of the options match that. The closest option is C)7.056e-27, which is about 1.27 times higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for e, such as 1.6e-19 C instead of the precise 1.602e-19. Let's try that.

e = 1.6e-19 C.

Then e² = 2.56e-38.

So 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.56e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 * 2.56e-38 = (8.988 *2.56) x 1e9 x 1e-38 =23.02 x 1e-29 = 2.302e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 *2.302e-28 =55.248e-28=5.5248e-27 J.

Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the sum of each charge's contribution, including the 13th.

Wait, but the 13th is fixed, so perhaps it's not considered in terms of potential energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum potential energy when the 12 charges are arranged in a way that minimizes the total potential energy, including their mutual interactions. But without knowing the arrangement, it's impossible to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged such that their mutual distances are the same as the distance from P, which is 2 m. But that's not possible unless they're all on a sphere of radius 2 m, but their mutual distances would vary.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to only consider the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12, and the answer is 5.53e-27 J, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake in units.

Wait, the problem says the minimum energy. Potential energy is minimized when the charges are as far apart as possible. So if the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are as large as possible, perhaps their mutual potential energy is negative (if the charges are negative). Wait, but in our case, the charges are 2e, so positive. So the mutual potential energy would be positive, meaning it's higher when the charges are closer. Wait, but the problem asks for the minimum energy, which would correspond to the highest possible potential energy? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, for positive charges, the potential energy is positive when they are separated, and higher when they are closer. So to minimize the potential energy, you want the charges to be as far apart as possible.

But if the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, their mutual distances would be determined by their arrangement. The minimum potential energy would be when the mutual potential energy is as small as possible, which for positive charges would be when they are as far apart as possible. So perhaps arranging them in a way that each is as far as possible from the others, given the 2 m constraint.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's impossible to compute the mutual potential energy.

Given that, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12, leading to U =5.53e-27 J, but none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Let's think about the potential at point P due to the 12 charges.

The potential at P due to each of the 12 charges is V = k*(2e)/(2) = k e.

So the total potential at P is 12 * k e.

Then, the potential energy of the 13th charge (2e) placed at P is U13 = q * V = 2e * (12 k e) = 24 k e².

Which is the same as earlier.

So U13 = 24 k e².

Which gives the same value as before, 5.534e-27 J.

Hmm.

Since none of the options match this, perhaps the problem is intended to have the answer option C)7.056e-27, which is about 1.27 times higher than our calculated value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the potential energy using the formula U = (k q1 q2)/(r), but with all 13 charges.

Wait, no, the 13th is fixed, so only 12 pairs contribute.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between each pair, including the 13th, but that's what I did before.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each charge contributes (k q^2)/(2r), where r is 2 m. So for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy is (k (2e)^2)/(2*2) )= (4 k e²)/(4) )= k e².

So 12 charges contribute 12 * k e².

Which is 12 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.306e-28.

Multiply by 12: 27.67e-28 = 2.767e-27 J.

Which is about 2.77e-27 J. But that's still not matching any option.

Wait, but that would be if each pair contributes (k q^2)/(2r). But I thought each pair contributes (k q1 q2)/r.

Wait, perhaps the formula is ½ (k q^2)/r per charge, leading to (1/2) * 12 * (k (2e)^2)/(2).

Which would be (1/2)*12*(4 k e²)/(2) )= (1/2)*12*(2 k e²) )= 12 k e².

Which is 12 *8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 12 * 2.306e-28 = 27.67e-28 = 2.767e-27 J.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is being placed in the field of the others, leading to a different calculation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the sum of all possible pairs, but only the ones involving the fixed charge.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the 13th charge's potential energy is being considered as the sum of the work done by all the 12 charges, which would be 12 * (k (2e)^2)/(2 m) ), which is 24 k e².

Which is 5.534e-27 J.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for k. Let me check.

k = 1/(4πε0) = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

If I use k=9e9, then 24 * 9e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Which is 24 *9e9 * 2.566e-38.

Compute 9e9 *2.566e-38 = 23.094e-29 = 2.3094e-28.

Multiply by 24: 55.4256e-28 =5.54256e-27 J.

Still the same.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using e as 1.6e-19 C, which would make e²= 2.56e-38.

So 24 *8.988e9 *2.56e-38.

8.988e9 * 2.56e-38 = 23.02e-29 =2.302e-28.

Multiply by 24: 55.248e-28=5.5248e-27 J.

Still no option matches.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The calculation seems correct, but none of the options match. Perhaps the intended answer is option C)7.056e-27, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12 as (k (2e)(2e))/(2 m), but multiplied by 12.

Which gives 12*(4 k e²)/(2*2) )= 12*(k e²)/2 =6 k e².

Wait, that would be 6 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 =2.306e-28.

Multiply by 6: 13.836e-28=1.3836e-27 J.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from P, but the distance between any two is 4 m, which would be the diameter of a sphere with radius 2 m. So each pair of the 12 is 4 m apart.

So for the mutual potential energy between the 12, each pair contributes (k (2e)^2 ) /4.

So for 66 pairs, U_12 =66*(4k e²)/4 =66 k e².

So U_12 =66 *8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Compute 66 *8.988e9 =6.007e11.

Multiply by 2.566e-38: 6.007e11 *2.566e-38 =1.539e-26.

So U_12=1.539e-26 J.

And U_13=5.534e-27 J.

So total U =1.539e-26 +5.534e-27 =1.539e-26 +0.5534e-26 =2.092e-26 J.

Hmm, that's about 2.09e-26 J. But the options don't have that either.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are 2 m, but that would require the charges to be at the same point, leading to infinite potential energy.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe the intended answer is option C)7.056e-27 J, but I can't see how to get that from the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering each pair between the 12 charges as being 2 m apart, which is only possible if they are all at the same point, which isn't possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is mistakenly considering the potential energy as (k (2e)^2 )/(2 m) multiplied by 12*12, which would be 144 pairs, but that would be incorrect as it would double count and include the 13th charge.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for potential energy as (k q^2 )/(r) multiplied by n, where n is the number of charges, but that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the value of 7.056e-27 and see what calculation leads to it.

7.056e-27 J =7.056e-27.

Let me compute what 24 *k *e² would be to reach this value.

k=8.988e9.

So 24 *8.988e9 *e² =7.056e-27.

So e² = (7.056e-27 ) / (24 *8.988e9 )

= 7.056e-27 / (215.712e9 )

=7.056e-27 / 2.15712e11 = approximately 3.268e-38.

But e² is (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38, which is not 3.268e-38.

So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm not sure. Maybe the problem intended to ignore the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges, and the correct answer is 5.53e-27 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C)7.056e-27 J.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the number of pairs. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is 2 m from P, but they are all at the same point, so their mutual distance is zero, leading to infinite potential energy. But that's impossible, so perhaps the problem is not considering their mutual interactions.

In that case, the potential energy would be U=5.53e-27 J, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the sum of each charge's individual potential energy, which would be U=12*(k*(2e)^2)/(2), leading to 24 k e².

Which is the same as before.

Hmm.

Well, I think I've spent a lot of time on this, and perhaps the intended answer is option C)7.056e-27 J. But I'm not sure why. Maybe I should go with that.


The problem involves calculating the minimum energy of a system of 13 identical particles, each with charge \( 2e \), where 12 of the charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a fixed charge at point \( P \). The total potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all pairs of charges.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Potential Energy Between the Fixed Charge and the 12 Charges**:
   - Each of the 12 charges interacts with the fixed charge at \( P \). The potential energy for each pair is given by:
     \[
     U = \frac{k \cdot (2e) \cdot (2e)}{2} = \frac{4 k e^2}{2} = 2 k e^2
     \]
   - Since there are 12 such pairs, the total potential energy contribution is:
     \[
     U_{13} = 12 \cdot 2 k e^2 = 24 k e^2
     \]
   - Substituting \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \) and \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \):
     \[
     U_{13} = 24 \cdot 8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2
     \]
     \[
     (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38}, \quad 8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot 2.566 \times 10^{-38} = 2.3062 \times 10^{-28}
     \]
     \[
     U_{13} = 24 \cdot 2.3062 \times 10^{-28} = 5.53488 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
     \]

2. **Potential Energy Between the 12 Charges Themselves**:
   - The 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from \( P \), but their mutual distances are not specified. Calculating the exact potential energy between all pairs of the 12 charges requires knowledge of their arrangement, which is not provided. Without this information, the mutual potential energy cannot be computed explicitly.

3. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated potential energy \( U_{13} \) is approximately \( 5.535 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \).
   - Among the given options, the closest value is \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \), which is about 1.27 times higher than the calculated value. This discrepancy might arise from approximations or assumptions in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
The problem likely intends for the total potential energy to include only the interactions between the fixed charge and the 12 charges, as the mutual potential energy of the 12 charges cannot be determined without additional information. Based on the options provided, the closest match is:

**Answer: C**
