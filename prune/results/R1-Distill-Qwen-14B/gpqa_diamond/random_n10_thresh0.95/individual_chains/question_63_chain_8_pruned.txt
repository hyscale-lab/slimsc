Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I need to figure out what momentum a photon should have for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. But wait, the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels. So the fundamental state would be the state with the lowest rotational and vibrational energies.

Now, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state. I think the next state would be the first excited state. But which quantum number changes here? Since it's the lowest possible energy increase, maybe the photon causes a change in either the rotational or vibrational state, whichever requires the least energy.

Wait, I should clarify. The question is about switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the molecule will absorb a photon that causes the smallest possible energy increase. That would mean we're looking for the photon with the energy corresponding to the smallest transition possible in either rotation or vibration.

Let me think about the energy levels for rotation and vibration in a diatomic molecule. For rotation, the energy levels are quantized and given by something like E_rot = B * J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant and J is the rotational quantum number. For vibration, it's E_vib = (n + 1/2) * h * w, where n is the vibrational quantum number and w is the angular frequency.

The fundamental state is the lowest energy, so that would be J=0 and n=0. The next state would either be J=1 (rotationally excited) or n=1 (vibrational excited). But which transition would require less energy? I need to compare the energy differences.

The energy difference for a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is ΔE_rot = B*(1*(1+1) - 0*(0+1)) = 2B.

The energy difference for a vibrational transition from n=0 to n=1 is ΔE_vib = h * w.

So, the photon's energy must match either of these. But wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and it's switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one with the smallest ΔE. Therefore, whichever is smaller between 2B and h*w will determine the photon's energy.

So first, I need to calculate both 2B and h*w and compare them.

Wait, but the options given are all in terms of momentum, not energy. Photons have energy E = pc, where p is momentum and c is the speed of light. So once I find the required energy, I can find p by dividing by c.

Let me compute h*w first. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J*s. The angular frequency w is given as 4e14 rad/s. So h*w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Now, B is the rotational constant. The formula for B is (h/(8 π² μ R²)), where μ is the reduced mass of the molecule, and R is the bond length.

So μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 amu * 2 amu)/(22 amu). Wait, but I need to convert amu into kg for SI units.

1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So,

Mx =20 * 1.66e-27 kg =3.32e-26 kg.

My =2 *1.66e-27 kg=3.32e-27 kg.

So μ = (3.32e-26 kg *3.32e-27 kg)/(3.32e-26 +3.32e-27) kg.

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 3.32e-26 *3.32e-27 = (3.32)^2 *1e-53 = approx 11.02 *1e-53 = 1.102e-52 kg².

Denominator: 3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27 = 3.32e-26 (1 +0.1) )=3.32e-26 *1.1=3.652e-26 kg.

So μ = 1.102e-52 / 3.652e-26 kg = approximately 3.018e-27 kg.

Then, B = h/(8 π² μ R²).

R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R=2e-10 m.

Compute R²: (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So B = (6.626e-34 J s) / (8 π² * 3.018e-27 kg *4e-20 m² )

Let me compute denominator first: 8 * π² ≈ 8*9.87≈78.96.

So 78.96 *3.018e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =78.96 *3.018e-27 = approx 238.3e-27 =2.383e-25, then multiplied by4e-20 → 2.383e-25 *4e-20 =9.53e-45.

So B ≈6.626e-34 /9.53e-45 ≈ 6.626e-34 /9.53e-45 = approximately 6.95e10 J.

Wait, that seems really high. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate the denominator. Maybe I messed up the exponents.

Wait, denominator is 8 π² * μ * R².

μ=3.018e-27 kg.

R²=4e-20 m².

So μ * R² =3.018e-27 *4e-20 =12.072e-47 =1.2072e-46 kg·m².

Multiply by 8 π²: 8 π² is approximately 78.96.

78.96 *1.2072e-46 = approximately 95.35e-46 =9.535e-45.

So denominator is 9.535e-45.

So B =6.626e-34 /9.535e-45 ≈ (6.626 /9.535) * 1e10 → approx 0.695 *1e10 → ~6.95e9 J.

Wait, 6.95e9 J? That's 6.95 gigajoules? That can't be right because it's way higher than the energy of the photon. Wait, something's wrong here. Did I make a mistake in unit conversions?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, let's recompute B step by step.

B = h/(8 π² μ R² )

h =6.626e-34 J·s.

μ=3.018e-27 kg.

R=2e-10 m, so R²=4e-20 m².

So 8 π² μ R² =8 * (π^2) *3.018e-27 kg *4e-20 m².

Compute 8 * π² ≈ 8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568.

Then, 78.9568 *3.018e-27 = let's compute 78.9568 *3.018e-27.

3.018e-27 *78 ≈ 2.355e-25.

78.9568 *3.018e-27 ≈ approx 2.38e-25.

Then, 2.38e-25 *4e-20 =9.52e-45.

So denominator is 9.52e-45.

B=6.626e-34 /9.52e-45 = (6.626 /9.52) *1e10 → approximately 0.696 *1e10 =6.96e9 J.

Wait, that's about 6.96e9 J, which is 6.96 gigajoules. That's way higher than the vibrational energy, which was 2.65e-19 J. So 2B would be about 1.39e10 J, which is way bigger than 2.65e-19 J.

That can't be right. There's a mistake somewhere.

Wait, no, wait. Maybe I mixed up the rotational energy with the vibrational energy. Wait, rotational energy levels are much lower than vibrational? Or higher?

Wait, the rotational constant B is the rotational energy per unit of J(J+1). So for J=0, E=0. J=1, E=B*2. So B is in Joules. But vibrational energy is (n + 1/2) h w. So if h w is about 2.65e-19 J, then B is about 6.96e9 J, which is way higher. That would mean that the rotational energy is much higher than the vibrational. That can't be right, because in reality, rotational energy is lower than vibrational for diatomic molecules.

Wait, maybe I messed up in calculating B. Let me recheck.

The formula for B is h/(8 π^2 μ R^2).

Wait, another way to write B is (h)/(8 π² μ R²).

Wait, perhaps I forgot that h is in J·s, and the units would be J/(s) perhaps? No, wait, units for B: the formula is correct. Let me compute the denominator again.

Wait, let's compute 8 π² μ R².

μ=3.018e-27 kg.

R=2e-10 m → R²=4e-20 m².

So μ R²=3.018e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =1.2072e-46 kg m².

Multiply by 8 π²: 8 * (π^2) ≈78.96.

78.96 *1.2072e-46 = approx 78.96 *1.2072e-46 = let me compute 78.96 * 1.2072.

78 *1.2 is 93.6, 0.96*1.2=1.152 → total approx 94.75, plus 78*0.0072=0.5616, and 0.96 *0.0072=0.006912 → total 94.75 +0.5616 +0.006912=≈95.3185. So it's 95.3185e-46 =9.5318e-45.

So 8 π² μ R² =9.5318e-45 kg m²/s²? Wait, no, wait. B is in Joules per J(J+1) unit. Let me think about the units.

Wait, B has units of Joules. Let me see:

h has units of J·s.

Denominator: 8 π² μ R² has units of kg·m².

So B= (J·s) / (kg·m²) ) → J·s/(kg·m²) → (kg·m²/s²) * s )/( kg·m²) ) → (kg·m²/s² * s )/(kg·m²) ) → ( kg·m²/s ) ) / (kg m²) ) → 1/s. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, let me redo.

Wait, J is kg·m²/s². So h is J·s = kg·m²/s.

Denominator is kg·m².

So B = [ kg·m²/s ] / [ kg·m² ] → (kg·m²/s) / (kg m²) ) → 1/s.

Wait, that makes sense because the rotational energy is E = B J (J+1), so B should have units of 1/s, because J is dimensionless. Oh! So my earlier calculation must have a unit error. I thought B was in J, but actually it's in 1/s.

Wait, so if B is 6.96e9 1/s, then 2B would be 1.392e10 1/s, which is the rotational energy per J(J+1).

But wait, the energy E_rot = B J (J+1) → so when J=1, E_rot =2B = 2 * (something in 1/s) → but energy is in Joules. So E_rot = B * J(J+1) * h? Or maybe I messed up the formula.

Wait, actually, the correct formula is E_rot = (ħ² / 2I) * J (J+1), where ħ is h/(2π), and I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the formula for B. Let me clarify.

The rotational constant B is defined as B = ħ²/(2 I), where I is the moment of inertia. ħ is h/(2 π), so B = (h²)/(8 π² I), and I = μ R².

So yes, B = h²/(8 π² μ R²). Oh wait, earlier I used h in the numerator, but B is h squared over denominator. So that's where I went wrong.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the formula. Let me re-express B correctly.

B = (h^2) / (8 π² μ R² )

Wait, so I think I forgot to square h, I used h instead of h squared. That was the mistake.

So let's redo the calculation.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx (6.626)^2 = ~43.9, so 43.9e-68 =4.39e-67 J² s².

Denominator: 8 π² μ R².

As before, μ R² is 3.018e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =1.2072e-46 kg m².

8 π² ≈78.96.

So denominator:78.96 *1.2072e-46 =9.5318e-45 kg m².

So B = (4.39e-67 J² s²) / (9.5318e-45 kg m² )

Wait, but J is kg m²/s², so J² is kg² m^4/s^4.

So units:

( kg² m^4/s^4 * s² ) ) / ( kg m² ) → ( kg^2 m^4 s^2 ) / ( kg m^2 s^4 )) → (kg m^2)/(s^2). Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm overcomplicating the units.

But back to the calculation. So B = (4.39e-67) / (9.5318e-45) ) → approximately 4.39e-67 /9.53e-45 = (4.39/9.53) * 1e-22 ≈0.46e-22 → 4.6e-23 1/s.

Wait, because 4.39e-67 /9.53e-45 = approx 4.39/(9.53) * 1e-22 → yes, about 0.46*1e-22 → 4.6e-23 s^-1.

So B is about 4.6e-23 1/s.

Then, 2B would be approximately 9.2e-23 1/s.

Wait, but what's the energy difference for a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1? The energy difference is E_rot = B * J (J+1) - B *0(0+1) → B*(2) -0 = 2B. But since B is in 1/s, the energy is 2B * h-bar? Or wait, maybe I should think of E_rot in terms of h.

Wait, no, the formula E_rot = B J (J+1) where B has units of cm^-1 (wavenumbers) or in terms of energy? No, wait, if B is in 1/s, then E_rot = B * J (J+1) would be in 1/s * (dimensionless) → 1/s, but that's not energy. So I must be missing a constant.

Ah, right, I think the correct formula is E_rot = h * B * J (J+1) / (2) ? Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, the standard rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ² / (2I)) * J (J+1) = B * J (J+1) where B = ħ²/(2I) = (h^2/(4 π² I))/ (2I) ? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula E_rot = (h c B) * J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1, but this might complicate things more.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the rotational energy in terms of the rotational constant in Joules.

Wait, I think I need to express B correctly. Let me look up the formula.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (h²/(8 π² I)) * J (J+1) ), where I is the moment of inertia.

So for J=0, E_rot=0. For J=1, E_rot = (h²/(8 π² I)) * 2.

So the energy difference ΔE_rot = 2*(h²/(8 π² I)) = h²/(4 π² I).

Wait, but I is μ R². So ΔE_rot = h²/(4 π² μ R²).

So let's compute this.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

μ=3.018e-27 kg.

R=2e-10 m.

So compute denominator:4 π² μ R² =4 * π^2 *3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

Compute R² again: (2e-10)^2=4e-20 m².

So 4 * π² ≈39.478.

39.478 *3.018e-27 = approx 39.478 *3e-27 ≈1.184e-25, but more accurately 3.018e-27 *39.478 ≈3.018 *39.478e-27 = approx 119.4e-27 =1.194e-25.

Then multiply by R² (4e-20 m²):

1.194e-25 *4e-20 =4.776e-45 kg m².

So denominator is 4.776e-45 kg m².

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

So ΔE_rot = (4.39e-67 J² s²) / (4.776e-45 kg m² )

Wait, but the units don't seem right. Because the denominator is kg m², and the numerator is J² s².

But J is kg m²/s² → so J² s² = kg² m^4/s².

So putting together:

( kg² m^4 / s² ) * s^2 / ( kg m² ) ) → kg m².

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, perhaps I'm making a mistake in unit analysis. Maybe it's better to compute the numerical value and see.

So ΔE_rot = h²/(4 π² μ R²) = (6.626e-34)^2 / (4 π² *3.018e-27 * (2e-10)^2 )

Compute denominator: 4 π² =39.478, 3.018e-27, 4e-20 (since (2e-10)^2=4e-20), so denominator is 39.478 *3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 39.478 *3.018= approx 119.07, multiplied by 4=476.28, so 476.28e-47 → 4.7628e-45.

So denominator=4.7628e-45.

So numerator= (6.626e-34)^2=4.39e-67.

So ΔE_rot=4.39e-67 /4.7628e-45 = approx 9.216e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference, ΔE_vib, is h*w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

So now compare 9.216e-23 J (rotational transition) vs 2.65e-19 J (vibrational).

Which is smaller? 9.216e-23 is much smaller than 2.65e-19, which is about 2650 times larger.

So the smallest energy transition is the rotational one. So the molecule will absorb a photon that provides the energy needed for the rotational transition, from J=0 to J=1.

Therefore, the photon's energy E_photon should be equal to ΔE_rot =9.216e-23 J.

But the question asks for the momentum of the photon. Since E_photon = pc (because for photons, E=pc), then p= E_photon /c.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p= 9.216e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = (9.216e-23) /3e8 =3.072e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, that's not matching any of the options given. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 1.9e-28 N s

B) 2.3e-27 N s

C) 1.1e-27 N s

D) 1.4e-28 N s

Wait, my calculation gives p≈3.07e-31 kg m/s. But none of the options are close to that. Hmm, where did I go wrong?

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, ΔE_rot = h²/(4 π² μ R²) = (6.626e-34)^2 / (4 * (pi^2) * 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 )

Let me compute denominator again:

4 * pi^2 ≈39.478.

39.478 *3.018e-27 =39.478 *3.018= approx 119.07, so 119.07e-27 kg.

Multiply by (2e-10 m)^2 =4e-20 m².

So denominator =119.07e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =476.28e-47 kg m² =4.7628e-45 kg m².

So numerator is (6.626e-34)^2 =4.39e-67 (J s)^2.

Wait, J is kg m²/s²
