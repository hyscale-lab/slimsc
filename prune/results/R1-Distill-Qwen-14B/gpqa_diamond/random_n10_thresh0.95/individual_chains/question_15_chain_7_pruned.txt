Alright, so I've got this question here about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down. I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, as well as the planet's orbital distance.

The question says we have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies the calculations.

The host stars have the same radii, but the star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. Wait, but if their radii are the same, does that affect other factors? I think the star's mass affects the planet's orbit. Oh right, Kepler's third law might come into play here.

Transit probability is all about the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The formula I recall is something like the probability P = (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, since these are Earth-like planets, their radii are similar to Earth's, so maybe R_planet is much smaller than R_star and can be neglected. So maybe P is approximately R_star / a. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

Wait, another thought: the probability of transit is actually proportional to (R_star / a) * (something else?), maybe the ratio of the planet's orbital size? Or perhaps it's just R_star / (a). Hmm. Let's get back to the variables.

We need to find which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The probability depends on the size of the star relative to the planet's orbital distance. The closer the planet is to its star (smaller a), the higher the probability because the orbital plane is more likely to align with our line of sight.

So, the formula I think is P = (R_star * 2) / (a * sqrt(1 - e²)), but since both orbits are circular, e is zero, so it's just (2 R_star) / a. Wait, no, maybe it's more like (R_star / a) multiplied by something else. Oh wait, maybe the transit probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet << R_star, it's approximately R_star / a. So higher R_star and lower a increase the probability.

But wait, the formula I found in my notes is P ≈ (R_star) / (a (1 - (R_star / a)^2)^(1/2)) )). Wait, that can't be right. Maybe it's a different approach. Alternatively, the probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the orbital distance, or the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital radius, scaled by the orbital inclination. Hmm, perhaps the actual formula is (R_star / a) multiplied by the solid angle. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, I think the standard transit probability for a randomly oriented orbit is P = (R_star / a) * (1 + (R_planet / R_star)), but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, this becomes approximately 2 R_star / a (because R_planet is much smaller, so 1+something tiny ≈ 1, but maybe I'm misremembering the exact formula... Alternatively, I might have gotten the formula wrong.

Wait, let's think in terms of geometry. The transit occurs when the planet's orbit is edge-on enough relative to our line of sight. The probability is the ratio of the size of the star to the size of the orbit (in some way). The formula I think I remember is P = (R_star / a) * (1 / sin i), but wait, no, that's not right because inclination i is a factor in whether the transit occurs, not the probability. Hmm, perhaps the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, multiplied by another factor.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_star / a) * (1 + (R_planet / R_star)) / (sqrt(1 - e²)) ). Since both are circular orbits, e=0, so the denominator becomes 1. And since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, the term (1 + R_planet/R_star) is approximately 1. So the probability is approximately (R_star / a).

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Another source I recall says that the transit probability is proportional to (R_star + R_planet) / (a * sqrt(1 - e²)), but again, since e is 0, it's (R_star + R_planet)/a. But for Earth-like planets, R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so it's roughly R_star/a.

So in this case, the probability is higher when R_star is larger or when a is smaller.

Now, let's get the given data:

- Both stars have the same radius. So R1 = R2 = R.

- The mass of Planet_1's star is twice that of Planet_2's star. So M1 = 2 M2.

- Orbital periods: P1 = P_1, P2 = 3 P_1.

Wait, no, the question says "the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2." So P1 = (1/3) P2. Alternatively, P2 = 3 P1.

But using Kepler's third law, P² is proportional to a³/(M_star). So for each planet, a^3 = (G M_star P²)/(4 π²).

Wait, but for each planet, we can relate a to M_star and P.

So for Planet_1, a1³ = (G M1 (P1)^2)/(4 π²)

For Planet_2, a2³ = (G M2 (P2)^2)/(4 π²)

But since P2 is three times P1, P2 = 3 P1.

So substituting, a2³ = (G M2 ( (3 P1)^2 )) / (4 π² ) = G M2 9 P1² / (4 π² )

Compare to a1³: (G M1 P1² )/(4 π² )

So a2³ / a1³ = (9 M2 ) / (M1) )

But M1 is twice M2, so M1 = 2 M2.

So a2³ / a1³ = (9 M2 ) / (2 M2) ) = 9/2.

So a2 = a1 * (9/2)^(1/3).

Compute (9/2)^(1/3): 9/2 is 4.5, cube root is approximately 1.65. So a2 ≈ a1 * 1.65.

So a1 is the semi-major axis for Planet_1, a2 is for Planet_2.

Now, the transit probability for each planet is approximately R_star / a.

Since both stars have the same radius, R1 = R2 = R.

So P1 ~ R / a1

P2 ~ R / a2

So the ratio of P2 to P1 is (R/a2) / (R/a1) ) = a1/(a2) = 1 / (a2/a1) ) = 1/1.65 ≈ 0.606.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if a2 is larger than a1, then R/a2 is smaller than R/a1, implying P2 < P1. So Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting.

Wait, but let me double-check the math.

From Kepler's law, for each planet, a³ ∝ (M_star) * P².

So a1³ = (M1 / M_sun) * (P1 / year)^2 * some constant.

Similarly for a2.

But in our earlier calculation, we found that a2 = a1 * (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ a1 * 1.65. So a2 is larger than a1.

So the planet with the shorter period is closer to its star (since for a given mass, shorter period means smaller a, from Kepler's law).

So Planet_1's star is more massive, but Planet_2 has a longer period, so a2 is larger.

So, back to transit probability.

P1 is proportional to R / a1.

P2 is proportional to R / a2.

But a2 is approximately 1.65 * a1.

So P2 = R/(1.65 a1) = (R/a1) * (1/1.65) = P1 * (1/1.65).

So P2 is about 0.606 times P1.

Wait, but that would mean Planet_1 has a higher probability. So the researchers should observe Planet_1, which has a higher transit probability.

Wait, but let's think about the options. The options are about which planet has higher probability.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to 1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to 2.7 times higher.

Wait, my calculation said that P1 is about 1.65 times larger than P2. Because P1 = R/a1, P2 = R/(1.65 a1). So P1/P2 = 1.65. So the probability for Planet_1 is about 1.65 times higher. So the researchers would prefer Planet_1.

Which option matches that? Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

So the answer should be C.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the math again.

We have:

a2 = a1 * (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ a1 * 1.65.

So a2 is approximately 1.65 a1.

So a1 = a2 / 1.65 ≈ 0.606 a2.

Thus, P1 = R/a1 = R/(0.606 a2) ≈ 1.65 R/a2.

P2 = R/a2.

So P1 is about 1.65 times P2.

So P1 is higher, so they should observe Planet_1, and it's 1.65 times more probable. So the correct option is C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is approximately proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.
