Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The first part of the reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, wait, I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's probably some kind of nucleophilic substitution or addition. Let me think. Oh, right! The formation of a cyanohydrin. I think that's when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion (like from NaCN) to form a cyanohydrin. So the reaction is adding CN- to the carbonyl group.

So for the first reaction, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) would react with NaCN. But what's reagent A here? The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, the cyanide would attack the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen would get a proton? Or wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me visualize butan-2-one: it's (CH2CH3)2CO. When it reacts with HCN or CN-, it forms a cyanohydrin. The product would be (CH2CH3)2C(OH)CN? But wait, the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure.

Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no, wait. Butanenitrile is four carbons with CN at the end. 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have the structure CH2(C(OH)(CH3))CH2CN? Wait, maybe I got the numbering wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Wait, but butanenitrile is four carbons, so maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or is it (CH3)2C(OH)CN? No, wait, butane is four carbons, but the nitrile is at the end. So maybe the structure is CH2CH2CN with a hydroxyl and methyl group on the second carbon.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction. The reaction between a ketone and HCN (or NaCN in a protic solvent) gives a cyanohydrin. The mechanism is nucleophilic addition: the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, the carbonyl oxygen becomes O- which then gets a proton to form OH. So the product is a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached.

But in the first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, but butanenitrile is four carbons, so the CN is on the end. Let me count: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the nitrile is on carbon 4? Wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, so carbon 4 is the CN end. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2-CH(C(OH)(CH3))-CH2-CN? No, that's five carbons. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the structure. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3)2COHCH2CN. No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with HCN, the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So that would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, perhaps? Wait, no, because butanenitrile would have four carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be:

CH2-CH(C(OH)(CH3))-CH2-CN? No, that would be five carbons. Wait, perhaps it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN, but that's four carbons (butane has four), but with substituents. So, butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CN, so the nitrile is on the end. So, substituting the butanone, which is (CH3)2CO, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. Wait, that's three carbons, not four. So perhaps I made a mistake in the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile, but the question says 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck on that. Let's think about the reagents. The first reaction uses NaCN and reagent A. So NaCN is a source of CN- ions. The reaction is with a ketone, so it's a nucleophilic addition. The product is a cyanohydrin. But in this case, the product is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached. 

But the formation of a cyanohydrin typically requires an acid catalyst. Because the reaction is between a carbonyl and HCN (or CN-), but to make it proceed, an acid catalyst is used to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. So reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+ (which is H+ in solution), or maybe H2SO4 or another acid.

Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3. Hmm, why would NaHSO3 be a reagent here? NaHSO3 is a source of HSO3^- and Na+ ions. Wait, but HSO3^- is a weaker acid than H3O+ (which is just H+). Not sure about this yet.

So for the first reaction, A is an acid, probably H3O+.

The second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B, which is H2O, to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

How does that happen? Nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids. The typical reagents for this are strong oxidizing agents. One common method is using a strong acid like HCl with heat, or using a mixture of KMnO4 and HCl under reflux. Alternatively, in some cases, H2O with certain catalysts might not be enough, but perhaps if the nitrile is adjacent to a good leaving group, or under acidic conditions.

Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid, so the CN must be oxidized. So in the second reaction, the nitrile is oxidized to a carboxylic acid. But wait, the reagent B is H2O. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Or maybe B is another reagent, and the question lists B as H2O. Wait, looking back: the question says "reagent B (H2O)", so B is H2O. But that can't be right because simply adding water won't oxidize a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. So perhaps I misread. Let me check the question again.

The second reaction: [compound] + B (H2O) --> [another compound]. Oh, wait, no. The description says B is H2O. So the reagent B is water. But how does that lead to oxidation?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Another possibility: Maybe the cyanide is first hydrolyzed under acidic conditions to produce a carboxylic acid. So, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under acidic conditions, but that usually requires heat and a strong acid, perhaps with a catalyst. Alternatively, using H3O+ as a catalyst.

Wait, the second reaction is the nitrile group converting to a carboxylic acid group. So the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid. The conditions for this usually involve strong acidic hydrolysis. For example, using a strong acid like HCl, H2SO4, and heat. Alternatively, using a mixture of H2O with an acid catalyst like H2SO4.

Looking at the options, the second reagent B is either HCl or CH3COOH, or HCl or CH3COOH again. So, for the second reaction, the reagent B is either HCl or acetic acid.

Wait, but in the reaction, it's B (H2O), so the reagent is water. Oh wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The question says:

"2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid"

Wait, perhaps B is H2O in the presence of another reagent. Or maybe B is H2O under certain conditions. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, if the nitrile group is adjacent to an -OH group, perhaps it's more reactive. So the nitrile is in a position where it can be oxidized. Wait, but the question is about hydrolysis, not oxidation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrolysis under acidic conditions.

Wait, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids using a strong acid and heat. For example, HCl with heat. Alternatively, using H2O and a catalyst like H2SO4.

So in the second reaction, the reagent B is H2O, but perhaps in a strongly acidic condition. So the reagents would be H3O+ or H+. But looking at the options, the possible B's are HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the reactions. Let me think: The first step is the formation of a cyanohydrin, which requires acid catalysis. So reagent A is acid, like H3O+.

The second step is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. For this, the conditions are strong acid and heat. So the reagent B would be HCl (a strong acid) or maybe H2SO4. But looking at the options, B is either HCl or acetic acid (which is a weaker acid).

So, putting it together, the first reaction uses H3O+ as A, and the second reaction uses HCl as B.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl → this would fit.

Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH → B is acetic acid, which is less strong. Maybe not sufficient for the hydrolysis.

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl → I'm not sure why NaHSO3 would be used in the first reaction.

Option D: A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH → same here.

So the correct reagents would be A is H3O+ and B is HCl. That's option A.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction proceeds via nucleophilic addition of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) to the carbonyl group of the ketone, followed by protonation of the oxygen to form the hydroxyl group. Acid catalysis is typically required to facilitate this process by protonating the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the suitable reagent for this step.

The second reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This requires strong acidic hydrolysis, often achieved using HCl under heat. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is a weaker acid and is less effective for this transformation. Therefore, HCl is the appropriate reagent for this step.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both steps.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first step, CH₃COOH is not strong enough for the second step.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not typically used for cyanohydrin formation, making this option incorrect.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Both reagents are unsuitable for their respective steps.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
