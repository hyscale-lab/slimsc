Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The question is about the minimum energy of an isolated system of 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, and their mass is negligible. So, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that the electric potential energy of a system of charges is calculated based on their positions relative to each other. Since the system is isolated, we don't have to worry about external fields, I think.

Wait, all the particles are identical and have the same charge, 2e each. So each charge is positive because e is the elementary charge, which is positive. But wait, 2e could be positive or negative, but I think in this context it's positive. So all 13 charges are positive.

The 13th charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of these 12 charges is 2 meters away from the fixed charge. But what about the interactions between the 12 charges themselves?

Oh right, because when calculating the potential energy of the entire system, I have to consider all pairs of charges. So the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies due to each pair.

Let me think: The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². But wait, since all the charges are the same, each pair will contribute similarly.

So the system consists of 12 charges around a central fixed charge, and those 12 are each 2 meters away. But the 12 charges are themselves all at 2 meters from P, but how are they arranged relative to each other? Are they all at the same point? Or are they arranged in a sphere?

Wait, the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. Oh, that doesn't specify their arrangement. But for the potential energy, the distances between the charges themselves matter. Oh, wait, but if they're all at the same point, then the distance between any two charges would be zero, leading to infinite potential energy? That can't be right, so maybe they are arranged in a way where each is 2 meters from P but placed on a sphere or something, but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, that's a problem because without knowing the distances between the 12 charges, I can't compute their mutual potential energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the 12 charges are fixed at points that are all 2 meters from P, but the distances between the charges are not relevant because they are constrained, and perhaps their mutual interactions are considered in some way. Hmm, but no, because the problem says the system is isolated, so all their interactions need to be considered.

Wait, perhaps the way to model this is that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that they are each 2 meters from P, but the distance between any two charges is much larger, but I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe they are all at the same point, but that would lead to them being at zero distance from each other, which isn't possible.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So they are each at a distance r = 2 m from P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, each of the 12 charges is at the same distance from the central charge.

But what about the potential energy between the 12 charges? Because when you have multiple charges, the potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

Wait, but if the 12 charges are fixed at 2 m from P, perhaps their mutual distances are not given, so maybe we can treat them as point charges at a particular configuration. But without knowing their arrangement, it's impossible to compute their mutual potential energy.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So maybe the configuration that gives the minimum potential energy is when all the 12 charges are as close as possible to each other, but that doesn't make much sense because all are positive and would repel each other. Wait no, actually, for minimum potential energy, the system would arrange itself in a way that the potential energy is the least possible. Since all charges are positive, the potential energy would be minimized when the charges are as far apart as possible. Hmm, wait, but in this case, the charges are constrained to stay at a fixed distance from P. So perhaps the potential energy due to the mutual interactions can't be minimized further because their positions are fixed?

Alternatively, perhaps the only consideration is the potential due to the fixed charge at P and the surrounding 12. But that would be incorrect because the potential also includes all the interactions between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but the problem statement says each charge is 2 meters from P. So the 12 are all at 2 meters from P. But that doesn't necessarily mean that each is 2 meters away from each other. So the distance between any two of the 12 charges is not given, but perhaps they are arranged in a way that each is 2 m from P but located at various points on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m.

But without knowing the exact positions, perhaps we can't compute their mutual potential energy. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the 12 charges are at the same point. But no, that would make their mutual potential energy infinite, which isn't acceptable.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the central charge, and not considering the interactions between the 12 charges. But that can't be correct because the potential energy of the system includes all pairs.

Wait, but the problem says the system is isolated. So perhaps all the charges are moving, but in this case, the 12 are constrained at 2 m from P, so their positions are fixed relative to P, but their mutual positions are variable, but the problem doesn't give information about that. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, the problem asks for the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps the configuration that minimizes the potential energy would be where the mutual potential energies are minimized, but since all charges are positive, the potential energy would be minimized when they are as far apart as possible. But without knowing the arrangement, I can't compute that.

Wait, but perhaps the 12 charges are all placed at a single point 2 meters from P. But that would mean that all 12 are co-located at 2 meters from P. But that would cause the distance between any two of them to be zero, which would result in an infinite potential energy, which is impossible. So that can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that they are each at 2 meters from P but distributed in a way that the mutual distances are as large as possible, which would minimize their mutual potential energy. But without knowing the exact arrangement, I'm not sure how to proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the central charge, and not the interactions among the 12. But that would be incorrect because the system's total potential energy includes all pairs.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to approach it step by step.

First, let me list all the pairs:

- The central charge (fixed at P) interacts with each of the 12 charges.
- Each of the 12 charges also interacts with every other charge.

So the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energy from the central charge and the 12 others, plus the potential energy from all the pairs among the 12.

So U = U_central + U_12pairs.

Let me compute each part.

First, U_central: each of the 12 charges is at distance r = 2 m from P. Each has charge 2e, and the central charge is 2e as well.

Wait, wait, the central charge is fixed at P. So the central charge is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e, so each pair between the central and a surrounding charge contributes (k*(2e)*(2e))/r.

So the potential energy between the central charge and each surrounding charge is (k*(2e)^2 )/(2 m). Since there are 12 such pairs, U_central = 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2).

Wait, but wait: No, each pair is counted once. But in this case, the central charge is interacting with each of the 12, so 12 pairs in total.

So U_central = 12 * (k*(2e)*(2e)) / (2 m) )

Wait, because each surrounding charge is 2e and the central is 2e, so each contributes 2e * 2e.

Wait, but the formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = (k q1 q2)/r.

So for each of the 12 surrounding charges and the central one, U_i = k (2e)(2e) / (2) = k (4 e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

So 12 of these would be U_central = 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Wait, but wait, another thought: when you have a fixed charge and another charge moving towards it, the potential energy is calculated as bringing the charge from infinity to that point. So perhaps that's the right approach.

But wait, the central charge is fixed, so when the surrounding charges are brought into place, each contributes to the potential energy based on their positions relative to the central charge.

So yes, U_central = 12 * (k (2e)(2e) ) / 2 m.

Which is 12 * (4 k e²) / (2) = 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Now, the other part is U_12pairs, the potential energy between the 12 surrounding charges.

Each pair among the 12 contributes U_ij = k (2e)(2e) / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between charge i and charge j.

But without knowing r_ij, how can I compute this? Hmm, maybe the minimal energy is achieved when the mutual potential energy is as small as possible.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy of the system. Since all charges are positive, the potential energy between any two positive charges is repulsive. So to minimize the total potential energy, we need to maximize the distances between each pair of the 12 charges.

But since the 12 charges are constrained to stay 2 m from P, perhaps their mutual distances are at a minimum. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because if they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, then their positions are fixed on a sphere of radius 2 m.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a regular dodecahedron or another symmetric shape around P. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's impossible to compute their mutual distances.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So perhaps the minimal energy is when the 12 charges are arranged in a way that the mutual potential energy is minimized, which would be as far apart as possible. But since they are all on a sphere of radius 2 m, the maximum separation would be placing them as far apart as possible on the sphere. But without knowing their exact positions, we can't compute the exact mutual distances.

Wait, this seems like a dead end. Maybe the problem is intended to ignore the mutual interactions between the 12 charges and only consider their interactions with the central charge. But that would be an oversight, but perhaps that's what I'm supposed to do.

Alternatively, maybe the 12 charges are all at the same point, but as I thought earlier, that would lead to infinite potential energy, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is treating the 12 charges as if they are far apart from each other, but that's not stated.

Wait, maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges can be considered negligible. But that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the central charge and the 12, not the mutual energy among the 12 themselves.

But that would be incorrect because the total potential energy of the system includes all pairs. So if I exclude that part, I would be missing a significant portion.

Wait, but looking back at the options, the numbers are on the order of 1e-26 J. Let's compute the U_central part and see what we get.

So U_central = 24 k e².

Let me compute that.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.602e-19 C.

So e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = approx 2.566e-38 C².

So U_central = 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

8.988e9 is approximately 9e9.

9e9 * 2.566e-38 = 9 * 2.566 = 23.094, and exponents: 1e9 * 1e-38 = 1e-29.

So 23.094e-29 = 2.3094e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.3094e-28 = approx 55.426e-28 = 5.5426e-27 J.

Wait, but that's just the U_central part. If we add the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges, that would add more energy. But if the problem is considering only U_central, then the answer would be around 5.5e-27 J, but looking at the options:

Option C is 7.056e-27.

Hmm, that's 7e-27, which is higher than what I calculated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate U_central accurately.

U_central = 12 * (k * (2e)^2) / r.

Wait, (2e)^2 is 4 e².

So for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy is (k * 4 e²) / 2 meters.

So each contributes (4 k e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

12 charges: 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Wait, another way: 12 * ( (8.988e9) * (4 * (1.6e-19)^2) ) / 2.

Compute each part:

4 * (1.6e-19)^2 = 4 * 2.56e-38 = 1.024e-37.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * 1.024e-37 ≈ (8.988 * 1.024) e-28.

8.988 * 1.024 ≈ 9.20 (since 8.988 * 1 = 8.988, 8.988 *0.024= ~0.2157; total ≈ 9.20).

So 9.20e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.6e-28.

Multiply by 12: 55.2e-28 = 5.52e-27 J.

So U_central is approximately 5.52e-27 J.

But looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher.

So perhaps I'm missing the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges.

Wait, let's think about that.

Each of the 12 charges is 2e. The potential energy between any two is U_ij = k (2e)(2e) / r_ij.

But without knowing r_ij, I can't compute each term. But perhaps the minimal energy configuration is when the 12 charges are as far apart as possible, which would minimize the repulsion, but that's not correct because since the charges are positive, the potential energy would be higher when they are closer. Wait, no: for positive charges, potential energy is higher (more positive) when they are closer, so to minimize the total potential energy, you would need to maximize the distances between each pair. But for the system, the minimal energy would be when each pair is as far apart as possible.

But without knowing the actual distances, I can't compute U_12pairs.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a regular icosahedron or something, making all the mutual distances equal. But that's making an assumption not stated in the problem, so perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is on the surface of a sphere of radius 2m, and the distance between any two is 4 meters apart? No, that can't be because on a sphere of radius 2m, the maximum possible distance between any two points is 4m (diametrically opposite). But that would be for only a few pairs.

Wait, perhaps the minimal potential energy is when the 12 charges are equally spaced on the sphere, so that the average distance between each pair is... Hmm, this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is negligible compared to the central charge's contribution. But given that U_central is 5.5e-27 J, the mutual potential energy might be on a similar scale.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is treating the 12 charges as if they are all located at P as well. But then the central charge would be 13*2e, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 others, and not the others' mutual energy. But that would be incorrect, but maybe that's what the problem expects.

So if I proceed with that, the U would be 5.52e-27 J, which is close to option C (7.056e-27), but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate U_central more accurately.

k = 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

Each surrounding charge is 2e, so q1 = 2e, q2 = 2e.

r = 2 m.

Each pair contributes U = (k * q1 q2)/r = (8.988e9) * (2e)(2e) / 2.

Which is (8.988e9) * (4 e²) / 2.

Simplify: 8.988e9 * 4e² / 2 = 8.988e9 * 2e².

So per charge: 2 * 8.988e9 * e².

Wait, no: 4e² / 2 is 2e². So yes, per charge it's 8.988e9 * 2e².

Wait, e is 1.602e-19 C.

So e^2 = (1.602e-19)^2 = approx 2.566e-38 C².

So per charge, U_i = 8.988e9 * 2 * 2.566e-38.

Wait, wait, no. Let me re-express:

Each of the 12 charges contributes (k * (2e)^2)/(2) = (8.988e9) * (4 e²) / 2.

Which simplifies to (8.988e9) * (2 e²) = 17.976e9 * e².

But e² is 2.566e-38.

So 17.976e9 * 2.566e-38 = (17.976 * 2.566) * 1e-29.

17.976 * 2.566 ≈ let's compute 17 * 2.5 = 42.5, 0.976*2.5=2.44 → 44.94. But more accurately:

17.976 * 2.566:

Break it down:

2.566 * 17 = 43.622

2.566 * 0.976 ≈ 2.566 *1 = 2.566 → but 0.976 is 1-0.024 → so 2.566 - (2.566 * 0.024) → 2.566 - 0.0616 = 2.5044.

So total is 43.622 + 2.5044 ≈ 46.1264.

So 46.1264e-29 = 4.61264e-28 J per charge.

Wait, but wait, each charge is 2e, so I think I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, each U_i is (k * (2e)^2) / 2.

Which is k *4e² / 2 = 2 k e².

So 2 *8.988e9 * (e)^2.

So 2 *8.988e9 = 17.976e9.

e^2 is (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

Multiply 17.976e9 * 2.566e-38 → 17.976 * 2.566 ≈ 46.126 → 46.126e-29 = 4.6126e-28 J per charge.

Multiply by 12: 12 *4.6126e-28 = 5.535e-27 J.

So U_central = ~5.535e-27 J.

Now, the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is U_12pairs.

Each pair contributes U_ij = k (2e)(2e)/r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between charge i and j.

But without knowing r_ij, I can't compute it. So perhaps the problem is designed to ignore this part, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is equidistant from every other. For example, if they are arranged in a regular icosahedron around P, each at 2 m from P. But then the distance between any two charges would be determined by the geometry, but I'm not sure of the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are 2 m as well, but that can't be because the distance from P is 2 m, so maximum possible mutual distance is 4 m (diametrically opposite), but that's just a few pairs.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are larger, but that's not possible because all are at 2 m from P.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy with the central charge, and the mutual potential between the 12 charges is zero, but that's not correct.

Hmm, another approach: perhaps the system's energy is considered to be just the work done in assembling the charges. But again, without knowing the mutual distances, it's impossible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges, and only consider their potential energies with the central charge. So the total energy would be ~5.5e-27 J. But looking at the options, none have that value. The closest is option C, 7.056e-27, which is about 30% higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating U_central. Let me recheck.

Wait, another way: the potential energy between the central charge and one of the 12 is U = (k * (2e)^2) / 2.

So per charge: (8.988e9) * (4 * (1.6e-19)^2) / 2.

Compute (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38.

Multiply by 4: 1.024e-37.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 *1.024e-37 = 9.204e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.602e-28 per charge.

Multiply by 12: 55.224e-28 = 5.5224e-27 J.

So about 5.52e-27 J.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option C, 7.056e-27.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 3/2 or something. Wait, maybe the system's potential energy is not just the sum of each charge and the central one, but includes the central charge's self-energy as well? No, self-energy is not considered in the potential energy of a system of charges; only interactions between distinct charges.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 13th charge is fixed, so the work done in bringing each of the 12 charges to their positions is considered. So each charge is brought from infinity to their position, which is 2 m from P.

So the potential energy for each is (k * 2e * 2e) / 2.

That would give 12 times that value, as I did earlier.

But if that's the case, then the total is ~5.5e-27 J.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy between the 12 charges and the central one, but I need to consider all possible pairs, including the central charge and each of the 12.

But I already did that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Let me think: the central charge has 12 interactions, each between itself and a surrounding charge. So 12 terms, each contributing (k (2e)^2)/(2).

So that's correct.

But what about the mutual potential between the 12 charges?

If we were to consider that, then each pair among the 12 would contribute (k (2e)^2)/r_ij.

But without knowing r_ij, I can't compute that. So perhaps the minimal energy occurs when r_ij is as large as possible, which would minimize each U_ij (since U is positive, making the total energy as small as possible, but it's still a positive contribution).

But without knowing the arrangement, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that would make r_ij zero, leading to infinite energy, which isn't possible. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual potential energy, and the correct answer is 5.5e-27 J. But none of the options are close to that except maybe option C, which is 7.056e-27.

Wait, let me compute 7.056e-27 divided by 5.5e-27: that's about 1.28. So more than 25% higher.

Hmm, another thought: perhaps I missed a factor of 1/2 somewhere. Because in calculating the potential energy for a system, each pair is counted once, but perhaps I need to multiply by a different factor.

Wait, no. When I have 12 charges, the number of pairs is (12 choose 2) = 66 pairs. So if each pair contributes (k (2e)^2)/r_ij, then the mutual potential energy would be sum of all 66 terms.

But without knowing each r_ij, I can't compute the sum.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is intended to have all the 12 charges at the same point, which would make r_ij=0 for all i≠j. But that would make the mutual potential energy infinite, which is impossible. So that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are all 2 m, but that's not possible because they are already 2 m from P. They can't all be 2 m apart from each other as well.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering each of the 12 charges as being 2 m from P and their mutual distances as 2 m as well, but that's only possible for a few charges.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12, but not the mutual energy. So the total energy is 5.5e-27 J, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Wait, perhaps the potential energy is calculated as the work done in assembling the system, but perhaps the central charge is considered as being in place, and the 12 others are brought into place.

In that case, the potential energy would be the sum of bringing each charge into place, considering the potential due to all the charges already in place.

But wait, when bringing the first charge, there's no existing charge except the central one.

Wait, but the central charge is fixed. So when placing each of the 12 charges, the potential they experience is due to the central charge and any previously placed surrounding charges.

So the first surrounding charge is placed; it feels the potential from the central charge. The second charge feels the central charge and the first surrounding charge, and so on.

So the total potential energy would be the sum of bringing each charge one by one, each time considering the potential due to the central charge and the previously placed charges.

But this approach would be more accurate but more complicated.

Let me try to compute that.

The potential energy U is the sum over each charge of the work done to bring it into place.

Each charge has a charge of 2e.

The central charge is 2e, fixed at P.

When placing the first surrounding charge: it's brought from infinity to 2 m from P. The potential at that point is due to the central charge, which is V = k*(2e)/(2 m) = (8.988e9) * (2e) / (2) ) = 8.988e9 * e /1.

e is 1.6e-19 C.

So V1 = 8.988e9 * 1.6e-19 = approx 1.438e-9 J/C.

The work done to bring the first charge is q * V = (2e) * V1.

Wait, no: the potential energy U1 is q * V, where q is the charge being brought, and V is the potential at the point caused by the existing charges.

So U1 = (2e) * (k*(2e)/(2)) ) = 2e * (k*(2e)/2) = (2e * k * 2e )/(2) ) = (4 e² k )/(2) ) = 2 e² k.

Which is the same as before.

Now, when placing the second charge, the potential at the point is due to the central charge and the first surrounding charge.

So V2 = V_central + V1_surrounding.

V_central = k*(2e)/2 = same as before.

V1_surrounding = k*(2e)/r, where r is the distance between the first and second surrounding charges.

But without knowing r, I can't compute V2.

Hmm, so this approach also leads me to the same problem: without knowing the distances between the 12 surrounding charges, I can't compute the total potential energy.

Given that, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual potential energy, and only consider the central charge's contribution.

In that case, the answer would be ~5.5e-27 J, but that's not one of the options. The options given are:

A) 5.645 x 10^-26

B) 2.822 x 10^-26

C) 7.056 x 10^-27

D) 122.330

Looking at these, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.8 times higher than my calculated 5.5e-27.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me check again.

Wait, U_central = 12 * (k * (2e)^2 ) / 2.

Which is 12 * (8.988e9 * 4e²) / 2.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute (2e)^2 =4e².

So per charge, the potential energy is (k * 4e² ) / (2 m).

So 8.988e9 *4e² /2.

Compute 8.988e9 *4 = 35.952e9.

Divide by 2: 17.976e9.

Multiply by e²: (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

So 17.976e9 * 2.566e-38 = let's compute 17.976 *2.566 = let's calculate.

17 *2.566 = 43.622.

0.976 *2.566 ≈ 2.504.

Total ≈46.126.

So 46.126e-29 = 4.6126e-28 J per charge.

Multiply by 12: 4.6126e-28 *12 =55.351e-28=5.535e-27 J.

Hmm, so again, 5.535e-27 J.

But none of the options match this exactly. The closest is option C:7.056e-27, which is about 28% higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 3 in the number of pairs.

Wait, another thought: the 12 charges contribute 12 pairs with the central charge, and each pair is counted once. So that's correct.

But perhaps the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is being accounted for, and in this case, all their mutual distances are 2 m.

Wait, but if each of the 12 charges is 2 m from P, and their mutual distances are also 2 m, which would only be possible if they are arranged in a regular polygon around P, but that's not possible for 12 charges.

Wait, perhaps each surrounding charge is 2 m from P and also 2 m from every other surrounding charge. But that's impossible because in 3D space, you can only have a few points where each is equidistant from all others.

But assuming that, the number of mutual pairs would be (12 choose 2) =66 pairs, each contributing (k*(2e)^2)/2.

So U_12pairs =66 * (k *4 e²)/2 = 66 * 2 k e² = 132 k e².

Which is 132 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute that:

132 *8.988e9 = 1.186e12.

(1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

Multiply:1.186e12 * 2.566e-38 = 3.038e-26.

Multiply by 2: wait no, wait.

Wait, no, the calculation for U_12pairs is 66 * (k *4e²)/2 = 66 * (8.988e9 *4e²)/2.

Wait, but wait: 4e² is 4*(1.602e-19)^2 =4*2.566e-38=1.026e-37.

Then, (8.988e9) *1.026e-37 = 9.23e-28.

Divide by 2:4.615e-28.

Multiply by 66:4.615e-28 *66 = 3.045e-26 J.

So U_12pairs is 3.045e-26 J.

Adding this to U_central (5.535e-27 J):

Total U =5.535e-27 +3.045e-26 =3.6e-26 J.
