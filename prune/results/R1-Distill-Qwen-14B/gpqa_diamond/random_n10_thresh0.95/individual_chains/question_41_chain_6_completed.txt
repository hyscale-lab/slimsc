Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I remember that when dealing with light moving through different media, the index of refraction plays a role. But wait, the glass is moving too—oh right, this is probably about relative motion and how different frames of reference affect measurements.

The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index n, and the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer. So the observer is in the lab frame, right? And the glass is moving through that frame.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So the glass is moving in the same direction the light is going. The light is inside the glass, which is moving towards the observer. So the observer would see the light moving at a certain speed. But I'm trying to remember if the speed of light in a medium is affected by the motion of the medium itself. Wait, from what I recall, in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, but this is when we're talking about a vacuum. But here, it's inside a medium, so maybe different rules apply.

Wait, no—wait, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. So normally, when the medium is stationary relative to the observer, the light's speed is c/n. But if the medium is moving, does that affect the observed speed? Hmm, I'm not sure. Because in the lab frame, the glass is moving, so the light's speed relative to the lab might change.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the lab frame. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, and the light inside has speed v_light = c/n relative to the glass. Wait, but from the lab's perspective, the light's speed isn't just v_light + v_glass, right? Because velocities don't just add in that way when dealing with light. Oh wait, no, because light speed is always c regardless of the medium's motion? Or does that only apply to a vacuum?

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. In a vacuum, if I'm moving towards a light source, I still measure the speed as c. But in a medium, things are different because the medium itself affects the speed. Wait, no—special relativity says that the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, regardless of the source's motion. But when the medium is moving, does that change the speed as observed?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. The question is about the speed of the light in the glass relative to the lab. So, I think the speed of light in the glass is v = c/n, but when the glass is moving at v_glass = v, the lab observer would see a different speed.

But wait, how do Galilean transformations apply here? Because in non-relativistic mechanics, velocities add linearly. So if the glass is moving at v, and the light in the glass is moving at c/n relative to the glass, then in the lab frame, the speed would be v_light = c/n + v?

But wait, that can't be right because if the glass is moving towards the observer, the light's speed as observed could be higher than c/n. But wait, wait, no—because in the lab frame, the glass is moving, so the light's speed would be c/n plus the glass's speed. But that would make the speed exceed c if v is significant enough, which is impossible because nothing can go faster than light.

Wait, so perhaps the Galilean addition isn't applicable here because we're dealing with light, so we have to use relativistic velocity addition. Oh right, because when velocities are a significant fraction of c, Galilean addition doesn't hold.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c²). But wait, in this case, u is the speed of light in the glass as observed in the glass's frame, and we need to find the speed as observed in the lab frame.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The glass's frame is moving at velocity v with respect to the lab. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed u = c/n. So, in the lab frame, what's the speed of the light?

So applying the relativistic velocity addition formula, the lab frame would see the light moving at u' = (u + v_glass) / (1 + (u * v_glass)/c² )

Wait, but wait, the direction matters. If the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, then I think the signs would be: u is positive (same direction as v_glass). So let's set u = c/n, and v_glass is the speed of the glass relative to the lab. Wait, but in the problem statement, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well. So the direction is same.

Wait, no, the beam is propagating through the glass, which is moving towards the observer. So in the glass frame, the light is moving at c/n towards the observer. The glass is moving towards the observer at v in the lab frame. So the lab would see the light's speed as higher than c/n because the glass is moving in the same direction as the light.

But wait, using the relativistic formula, u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² )

But u is c/n, and v is the velocity of the glass relative to lab, which is v in the same direction as u. So plugging in u = c/n and v = v, we get:

u' = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)).

So the numerator is (c + n v)/n.

Denominator is (n c + v)/ (n c) )? Wait no, denominator is 1 + (v (c/n)) / c² ) = 1 + v/(n c )

So,

u' = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ 1 + v/(n c) ]

Hmm, let's factor numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (c + n v)/n

Denominator: (n c + v )/(n c )

So when we divide, it's:

[ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c/(n c + v) ) ]

The n's cancel:

(c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

Hmm, that's (c(c + n v)) / (n c + v )

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Let me see if there's a simplification.

Wait, perhaps I can factor out c from the numerator and denominator. Let's see:

Denominator: n c + v = c (n + v/c )

Numerator: c (c + n v) = c^2 + n c v

Wait, perhaps not helpful.

Wait the options don't have c in them, since they take c=1. So let's substitute c=1.

So, u' becomes:

(1 + n v) * 1 / (n *1 + v ) 

Because when c=1, denominator is n*1 + v.

Wait that's (1 + n v) / (n + v )

So that would be option A) (1 + n v)/(n + v )

Wait, but wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, I applied the velocity addition formula correctly? Let me recap:

In the glass frame, the speed of light is u = c/n. The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame, same direction as the light. So the lab frame measures the speed as:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v) / c² )

With u = c/n, v = v.

Substituting, (c/n + v) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator: 1 + (v/(n c) )

So, (c + n v)/n / (1 + v/(n c) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n c:

Numerator: (c + n v) * c

Denominator: n c + v

Wait, because 1 * n c is n c, and v/(n c) * n c is v.

So the numerator is (c^2 + n v c )

Denominator becomes n c + v.

Wait, but with c=1, that's (1 + n v ) / (n + v )

Which matches option A.

But wait, wait another thing. Is the velocity addition formula applicable here? Because the medium is moving and light is in the medium. So perhaps I should think differently. Special relativity says that the speed of light is c in any inertial frame, but that's in a vacuum. But when the light is in a medium of index n, its speed is c/n in that frame. So in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n. Then, when the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, what's the speed of the light in the lab's frame?

Hmm, this seems to be the same scenario I considered earlier, so the same velocity addition applies. So I think my initial approach is correct.

So the answer should be option A.


To determine the speed of light in a glass medium relative to a laboratory frame, we analyze the situation using relativistic velocity addition. The light beam propagates through the glass with an index of refraction \( n \), and the glass itself is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, toward the observer. 

In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( u = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( c \) is the speed of light in a vacuum. To find the speed of light in the laboratory frame, we apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( u = \frac{c}{n} \) and \( v = v \), we get:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right) v}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right) v}{c^2} = 1 + \frac{v}{n c}
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n c}}
\]

To simplify further, multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n c \):

\[
u' = \frac{c + n v}{n + v}
\]

Since the problem specifies \( c = 1 \), the final expression becomes:

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option **A**. The other options do not align with the relativistic velocity addition formula or the given conditions.

**Answer: A**
