Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about the luminosities of two stars. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. But wait, the main thing here is the luminosity, right?

They mentioned that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength is where the star emits most of its light. I remember from the blackbody radiation that the peak wavelength is related to the temperature. The formula I think is Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is same, T is same.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the stars' radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. Oh, right, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, and moving away is redshifted. But the peak wavelength they observed is the same for both stars. Hmm, so does that mean their actual temperatures are the same after accounting for Doppler shift?

Because the observed peak wavelength is when you account for the star's velocity. So Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Let me think about how that affects the wavelength. The Doppler formula for wavelength shift is something like λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, if the star is moving towards us (v_r negative?), or away?

Wait, the radial velocity is given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. So Star_1 is at rest relative to us, and Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s? Or wait, radial velocities are measured as positive when moving away, I think. So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, it's moving away. But the observed peak wavelength for both stars is same.

Wait, but the stars' rest frame peak wavelengths would be different because of their velocities. So the observed peak wavelength is the same, but their actual temperatures (rest frame) would be different.

Wait, let me get this straight. Suppose the rest frame of Star_2 has a peak wavelength λ2. But because it's moving away, its observed λ2' would be longer (redshifted). So λ2' = λ2 * (1 + v2/c). Similarly, Star_1 is at rest, so λ1' = λ1. But the problem says λ1' = λ2' = same. So λ1 = λ2 * (1 + v2/c). So λ1 is longer than λ2 because v2 is positive (moving away), so (1 + v2/c) is greater than 1, so λ2 = λ1/(1 + v2/c).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let's think again. Let me denote the rest frame peak wavelengths as λ1_0 for Star_1 and λ2_0 for Star_2. Star_1 is stationary, so its observed λ1_obs is λ1_0. Star_2 is moving away, so λ2_obs = λ2_0 * (1 + v2/c).

But the problem says λ1_obs = λ2_obs. So λ1_0 = λ2_0*(1 + v2/c). So λ2_0 = λ1_0 / (1 + v2/c).

Since λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature, T = b / λ_max. So for Star_1, T1 = b / λ1_0. For Star_2, T2 = b / λ2_0 = b * (1 + v2/c) / λ1_0. So T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

Wait, that's interesting. So Star_2's rest frame temperature is higher than Star_1's? Because it's moving away, so the observed wavelength is longer, implying that the rest frame wavelength is shorter, meaning higher temperature.

Wait, no. Let's think in terms of observed and rest.

Star_1 is at rest, so λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

Star_2 is moving away, so λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c).

They have the same observed λ_max, so λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c).

So λ2_rest = λ1_rest / (1 + v2/c).

Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T, T is proportional to 1/λ_max. So:

T1 = b / λ1_rest.

T2 = b / λ2_rest = b * (1 + v2/c) / λ1_rest = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

Wait, but that would make T2 higher than T1. Because (1 + v2/c) is a number greater than 1. So, Star_2 is hotter in its rest frame than Star_1.

Wait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive because Star_2 is moving away. But the observed λ_max is the same, so in their rest frames, they have different λ_max. So T1 and T2 are different.

Wait, but according to the problem, the observed wavelengths are the same. So the rest frame λ is different. Hence, the temperatures are different.

So now, the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4π R² σ T^4. So L is proportional to R² T^4.

So for Star_1, L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4.

For Star_2, L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4.

The question is to find the factor by which L1 is greater than L2. So L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4).

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5.

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c), so T2 = T1 * (1 + 700e3 / c).

Wait, wait. v2 is given as 700 km/s. Let me calculate (v2/c). The speed of light c is about 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.02333.

So 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.02333.

Thus, T2 = T1 * 1.02333.

So now, let's compute L1/L2.

L1/L2 = ( (R1/R2)^2 ) * (T1 / T2 )^4.

Substituting R1/R2 = 1.5, and T2 = T1 * 1.02333 → T1/T2 = 1 / 1.02333 ≈ 0.977.

So:

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (0.977)^4.

Let me compute each part.

1.5^2 = 2.25.

(0.977)^4. Let me compute 0.977^2 first. 0.977 * 0.977 ≈ 0.9545. Then square that: 0.9545^2 ≈ 0.9112. So approximately 0.9112.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9112 ≈ let's calculate 2.25 * 0.9 = 2.025, and 2.25 * 0.0112≈0.0252. So total ≈ 2.025 + 0.0252 = 2.0502. Wait, but that's not matching the options. The options are all around 2.2, 2.3, etc.

Wait, did I get that right? Because that would mean L1 is about 2.05 times L2, but the options are all higher. Hmm, maybe I messed up the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the T1 and T2 relation. Let me re-express that.

From earlier: T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c). Because when a star moves away, the observed wavelength is longer, so the rest wavelength is shorter, so higher T. So yes, T2 is higher.

So T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c).

Wait, no, earlier calculation was T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c). So T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c).

Wait, perhaps I should re-express L1/L2 in terms of T2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the relationship. Let me go back.

We have:

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c).

Because λ1_obs = λ1_rest = λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c).

So λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c) → λ2_rest = λ1_rest / (1 + v2/c).

Since λ is inversely proportional to T, T = b / λ.

So T1 = b / λ1_rest.

T2 = b / λ2_rest = b * (1 + v2/c) / λ1_rest.

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

Ah, correct. So T2 is larger than T1.

Thus, in the luminosity equation, T1 is in the numerator (since L is proportional to T^4), but T2 is larger, so that would reduce L1 compared to L2? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, no. L1 is proportional to T1^4, and L2 is proportional to T2^4.

So because T2 > T1, L2 would be larger, but Star_1's radius is larger.

So L1 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 * L2.

Wait, more accurately, L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4).

So R1/R2 = 1.5 → (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v2/c) ≈ 1/1.02333 ≈ 0.977.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.977)^4 ≈ 0.911.

So 2.25 * 0.911 ≈ 2.05. But the options start at ~2.23, which is higher.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the velocity term. Wait, is the Doppler shift formula correct?

Wait, the Doppler formula is often written as λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r/c), where v_r is positive if moving away.

But another version I've seen is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt[(1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c)], which is the relativistic Doppler effect. But for small velocities (like 700 km/s, which is much less than c), the non-relativistic approximation is good enough.

So the non-relativistic approximation is λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r/c).

So that part seems correct.

But wait, maybe I should calculate (1 + v2/c) accurately.

v2 is 700 km/s.

c = 3e5 km/s. So v2/c = 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

So (1 + v2/c) = 1.023333.

So T2 = T1 * 1.023333.

So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (1/(1.023333))^4.

Wait, (1/(1.023333)) is approximately 0.977.

So, (0.977)^4. Let me compute that more accurately.

Compute 0.977^2:

0.977 * 0.977 = ?

Let me compute:

0.977 * 0.977.

= (1 - 0.023) * (1 - 0.023)

= 1 - 2*0.023 + (0.023)^2.

= 1 - 0.046 + 0.000529 = 0.954529.

Then square that to get (0.977)^4:

(0.954529)^2.

= (0.954529)^2.

Let me compute 0.954529 * 0.954529.

Approximate:

0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025.

But more accurately:

Let me compute 954529 * 954529, but wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 954529^2.

Wait, perhaps using (a - b)^2 where a=954529 and b= a - something. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach.

Wait, 0.954529 is approximately 0.9545.

So 0.9545^2 = ?

Well, 0.95^2 is 0.9025.

0.0045^2 is 0.00002025.

And cross terms: 2*(0.95)(0.0045) = 0.00855.

So total is 0.9025 + 0.00855 + 0.00002025 ≈ 0.91107.

So (0.9545)^2 ≈ 0.91107.

So (0.977)^4 ≈ 0.91107.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.91107 ≈ 2.050.

But the options are all above 2.2. So something's not adding up.

Wait, maybe I messed up the Doppler shift. Let me think again.

Wait, the star is moving away, so the observed wavelength is longer. So the rest wavelength is shorter. So the star's rest wavelength is smaller, meaning higher temperature.

But wait, wait. The observed peak wavelengths are the same. So for Star_1, λ1_rest = λ_obs.

For Star_2, λ2_rest = λ_obs / (1 + v2/c).

So, λ2_rest = λ1_rest / (1 + v2/c).

Which means λ2_rest is less than λ1_rest, so T2 is higher than T1. Because T is inversely proportional to λ.

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

So when calculating L1 and L2, L1 = 4π R1^2 σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2^2 σ T2^4 = 4π (R2)^2 σ (T1 (1 + v2/c))^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / (T1^4 (1 + v2/c)^4 )) )

Which simplifies to (R1/R2)^2 / (1 + v2/c)^4.

Wait, that's different from what I did earlier. Oh wait! I think I messed up the ratio earlier. Earlier, I had L1/L2 = (R1^2/R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4). But since T2 = T1*(1 + v/c), T2^4 = T1^4 (1 + v/c)^4. So T1^4 / T2^4 = 1/(1 + v/c)^4.

So the correct ratio is (R1/R2)^2 * [1/(1 + v/c)^4 ].

So R1/R2 is 1.5, (1.5)^2 is 2.25.

(1 + v/c) is approximately 1.023333.

(1.023333)^4: let's compute that.

We can compute 1.023333^2 first.

1.023333^2: 1.023333 * 1.023333.

= 1 + 2*(0.023333) + (0.023333)^2.

= 1 + 0.046666 + 0.000544.

≈ 1.04721.

Then square that to get the fourth power:

1.04721^2 ≈ ?

1.04^2 = 1.0816.

But 1.04721 is a bit higher. Let's compute:

1.04721 * 1.04721.

= (1 + 0.04721)^2.

= 1^2 + 2 * 1 * 0.04721 + (0.04721)^2.

= 1 + 0.09442 + 0.002229.

≈ 1.09665.

So (1.023333)^4 ≈ 1.09665.

So 1/(1.09665) ≈ 0.9119.

So now, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9119 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9119.

Let me compute 2.25 * 0.9119.

2 * 0.9119 = 1.8238.

0.25 * 0.9119 = 0.227975.

Total: 1.8238 + 0.227975 ≈ 2.051775.

So approximately 2.05.

But none of the options are near 2.05. The options are A: ~2.25, B: ~2.32, C: ~2.35, D: ~2.23.

Wait, that's a problem. So either I'm making a mistake, or perhaps I missed a factor.

Wait, maybe I inverted the ratio. Let's see.

Wait, L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4).

But T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

So T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v2/c).

So (T1/T2)^4 = [1/(1 + v2/c)]^4.

So, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * [1/(1.02333)]^4.

Which is 2.25 * [ (1/(1.02333))^4 ].

Wait, 1.02333^4 is approximately 1.09665 as before.

So 1/ 1.09665 ≈ 0.9119.

So 2.
