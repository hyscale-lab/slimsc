Okay, so I've got this question here about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the layer of a star where photosynthesis happens, but wait, no, that's plants. Oh right, the photosphere is the outer part of a star's atmosphere where most of the light is emitted. So the question is about two stars, star_1 and star_2. 

The problem says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. Oh, right, the excitation level relates to the energy states of the atoms. So if they're twice as excited, maybe the population in a higher energy state is higher in star_1.

The energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Hmm, I think that's the energy ΔE needed for the transition between those energy levels. 

The question is about finding the correct equation relating the effective temperatures T1 and T2 of the two stars, assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). LTE means that each small volume of the star's photosphere is in thermal equilibrium, and the properties can be described by a single temperature.

I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy states is given by the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The ratio of the populations (n_upper / n_lower) is equal to (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights, ΔE is the energy difference, and k is the Boltzmann constant.

In this case, the problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, what does that mean? Oh, perhaps the population ratio in star_1 is higher. Let me think. Let's say for a specific transition, the number of atoms in the upper level (n_u) relative to the lower level (n_l) is given by (n_u / n_l) = (g_u / g_l) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)).

But the problem states that in star_1, the excitation is twice as much as in star_2. Maybe for star_1, (n_u1 / n_l1) = 2 * (n_u2 / n_l2). Or perhaps the excitation is higher, meaning a higher proportion of atoms are in the upper energy level. 

Alternatively, maybe the excitation energy itself is double, but I think that's not the case. The energy difference is given as a fixed value, 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE is the same for both stars because it's the same energy level transition in iron atoms.

Wait, but the energy levels themselves aren't changing; it's the excitation, which refers to the population in the higher energy state. So for each star, the ratio of the upper to lower state populations depends on their temperatures.

Let me define variables. Let me call (n_u / n_l) for star_1 as R1 and for star_2 as R2. The problem says R1 = 2 R2. Or wait, wait. The question says "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So perhaps the excitation refers to the number of atoms in the excited state. So if star_1 has twice the excitation, then R1 = 2 R2.

But wait, the Boltzmann factor for R is (g_u/g_l) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Let's assume that the statistical weights are the same for both stars, which they are because it's the same element and same transition. So g_u and g_l are constants for both stars. So R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )? Wait no. Let's see.

Wait, R1 = (g_u/g_l) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), R2 = (g_u/g_l) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So taking R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) because when you divide R1 by R2, the (g_u/g_l) cancels out, and the exponents subtract. So R1/R2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the signs. Let me re-calculate. 

R1 = (g_u/g_l) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, R2 = (g_u/g_l) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

The problem states that R1 = 2 R2. So R1/R2 = 2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Taking natural logarithm on both sides:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

Wait, but that's the same as [ΔE/(k)] ( (T1 - T2) )/(T1 T2) )

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So putting that together:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] ( (T1 - T2) )/(T1 T2) )

But wait, the equation in the options don't have ΔE or k. So maybe we can rearrange the equation to express T1 and T2 in terms of each other.

Wait, but the problem states that the energy difference ΔE is the same for both stars, right? So in the equation, the left side is ln(2), and the right side is (ΔE/k) multiplied by (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

But the options don't have any ΔE or k. So perhaps the equation can be rearranged to eliminate ΔE. Hmm, perhaps we can express the ratio of temperatures in another way.

Alternatively, maybe we can rearrange the equation to get (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = (k ln 2) / ΔE.

Wait, but how does that relate to the options?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more about the excitation being higher, which could mean that the temperature is higher because higher temperature leads to more excitation. So if star_1 has higher excitation, it must be hotter than star_2. So T1 > T2.

But looking at the options, which one would fit the equation ln(2) = something involving (T1 - T2) over T1 T2.

Looking back, the equation I derived after taking logs is:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * ( (T1 - T2) ) / ( T1 T2 )

But none of the options have ΔE or k. So perhaps the question is not expecting us to include ΔE, or maybe the given equation is correct without the constants. That seems a bit odd, but perhaps the options are simplified.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the ratio of the temperatures leading to the excitation ratio. Wait, the problem doesn't give the actual temperatures, just the relation between R1 and R2.

Wait the options give ln(2) equals various expressions involving T1 and T2. So the correct equation from my derivation is:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But the options don't have any ΔE or k. So perhaps the equation can be expressed as:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = (k ln(2)) / ΔE

But I don't think that's one of the options either. Wait, looking at the options:

Option D says ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ]

Which would be the case if (ΔE/k) = 1.

But in reality, (ΔE/k) is a specific value, not necessarily 1.

So this suggests that perhaps the options are assuming that (ΔE/k)= some constant, but more likely, I think I might have made a mistake in the derivation.

Wait, let's go back. The Boltzmann equation is (n_u / n_l) = (g_u/g_l) exp( - (E_u - E_l)/(k T) )

E_u - E_l is ΔE, which is positive.

So, R = (n_u /n_l) = (g_u/g_l) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So for star_1, R1 = (g_u/g_l) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2, R2 = (g_u/g_l) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which can be written as exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, so R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) ( (T1 - T2) )/(T1 T2) ) )

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So the equation becomes:

R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

But since R1 = 2 R2,

2 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

Taking ln both sides,

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which is the same as:

ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] * (ΔE / k )

But none of the options have ΔE or k. So perhaps the question is assuming that (ΔE/(k)) is 1. But that would only happen if ΔE = k. Let's compute ΔE and k to see.

Wait, the given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. Let me check the value of the Boltzmann constant k.

k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, wait! 1.38e-23 J is exactly the value of k multiplied by 1 K. Because k = 1.38e-23 J/K, so k * 1 K = 1.38e-23 J.

So ΔE = k * (some temperature). Wait, let's compute here.

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J = k * T_effective? Let me compute: For some temperature T, k*T = 1.38e-23 J * T (in K) = 1.38e-23 * T J.

But wait, if ΔE = k*T, then (ΔE)/(k) = T. Wait, that's a good point.

Wait, in our equation:

ln(2) = [ (ΔE / k ) * (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2 )

But if ΔE = k * T, then (ΔE/k) = T. So substituting, the equation becomes:

ln(2) = [ T * (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2 )

Wait, but that doesn't make much sense because T is a third variable, the temperature difference or something. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is that in the equation,

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But since ΔE = k * T, where T is the temperature needed for that energy, but wait, that might not be the case here. Alternatively, perhaps when I plug ΔE = k * (something), I can get an equation without ΔE.

Wait, perhaps the given ΔE is equal to k*T0, where T0 is some characteristic temperature. So ΔE = k T0.

Then, substituting ΔE = k T0 into the equation:

ln(2) = (k T0 / k) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Which simplifies to:

ln(2) = T0 * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

But since T0 is a constant (as it's given), how does that relate to the options? The options don't have any constants, like T0.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think again: The options are about the form of the equation for ln(2).

From the Boltzmann equation, we have:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * ( (T1 - T2) )/( T1 T2 )

But since ΔE = 1.38e-23 J and k is 1.38e-23 J/K, so ΔE =k * T, where T=1 K.

Wait, yes! Because k = 1.38e-23 J/(K), so when T is 1 K, k*T = 1.38e-23 J. Exactly.

So ΔE = k * 1 K. So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So substituting back into the equation:

ln(2) = (1 K) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Because 1 K multiplied by (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) K^{-1} ? Wait, no. Let me check the units.

Wait, (T1 - T2) is K, denominator T1 T2 is K^2, so overall, (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) has units K^{-1}.

But the left side is ln(2), which is dimensionless. So the equation can only hold if the term on the right is unitless, which it is because (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) is in K^{-1}, but multiplied by K (from ΔE/k=1 K) gives (K^{-1} * K ) = unitless.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the units, but perhaps it's not necessary for this problem.

So, ln(2) equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ). Looking at the options, option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So that matches.

So the correct equation is option D.


The problem involves two stars, star_1 and star_2, where the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). Assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the relationship between the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) can be derived using the Boltzmann distribution.

The Boltzmann equation relates the ratio of populations of atoms in two energy levels as:

\[
\frac{n_u}{n_l} = \frac{g_u}{g_l} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_u \) and \( g_l \) are the statistical weights, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the ratios of populations are:

\[
R_1 = \frac{n_{u1}}{n_{l1}} = \frac{g_u}{g_l} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
R_2 = \frac{n_{u2}}{n_{l2}} = \frac{g_u}{g_l} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the ratio \( R_1 / R_2 \), the statistical weights cancel out, leaving:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

The problem states that \( R_1 = 2 R_2 \), so:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

The Boltzmann constant \( k \) is approximately \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), and the given \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). Thus, \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \). Substituting this into the equation simplifies it to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D, which states:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct equation is:

**Answer: D**
