Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The problem says: Let |alpha> be the state describing an electron, such that it is proportional to (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij = hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Also, find the average value of that operator.

The options are A to D, each with probabilities and an average. Hmm.

First, I think I should find the state |alpha> normalized. Because it's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, I need to compute the normalization factor.

The state vector is in the z-basis. So, |alpha> is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are orthonormal. So the normalization is the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). Let's compute the magnitudes.

For (1+i): |1+i| = sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2).

For (2-i): |2-i| = sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 +1) = sqrt(5).

So the squared norm is (sqrt(2))^2 + (sqrt(5))^2 = 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, no, wait: no, the normalization is 1/sqrt(7), right? Because the original state is proportional to those terms, so the actual state is that divided by sqrt(7).

So now, I need to find the probabilities of measuring the electron in each eigenstate of the operator whose matrix is Aij. The matrix A has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So it's a 2x2 matrix.

Wait, so for a 2x2 matrix, the elements are:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
      [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, no, because for i and j being the row and column indices. So A_11 = 0, A_12 = hbar/2, A_21 = hbar/2, and A_22=0.

Hmm. So the operator A is represented by this matrix. I need to find its eigenstates because the measurement probabilities depend on the projection of |alpha> onto these eigenstates.

Wait, no, actually, the problem says the operator's eigenstates are the ones to measure the probabilities for. So the operator's eigenstates form a basis, and I need to find the probability that the state |alpha> is in each of those eigenstates.

So first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A.

Wait, A is a 2x2 matrix. Let's compute its eigenvalues. The characteristic equation is det(A - λ I) =0.

The matrix A - λ I is:

[ -λ, hbar/2 ]

[ hbar/2, -λ ]

The determinant is (λ^2) - (hbar/2)^2 = 0. So λ^2 = (hbar^2)/4, so λ = ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2. So the eigenstates are for +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Wait, but wait a second. The eigenstates are orthogonal. Let me find them.

For λ = hbar/2:

(A - (hbar/2) I) |v> = 0.

The matrix becomes:

[-hbar/2, hbar/2 ]

[hbar/2, -hbar/2 ]

Which simplifies to equations:

(-hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0

(hbar/2) v1 + (-hbar/2) v2 = 0

Which are the same equation: v1 = v2.

So the eigenvectors are all vectors where v1 = v2. So normalized, they can be (1,1)/sqrt(2) or similar.

Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2:

(A - (-hbar/2) I) |v> =0 → [ (hbar/2) , hbar/2 ] and [ hbar/2, hbar/2 ]

So the equation is (hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 =0 → v1 = -v2.

So the eigenvectors are (1, -1)/sqrt(2) or similar.

So the eigenstates are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Or something like that, but normalized.

Wait, but wait: the way I wrote, the eigenstates are in the z-basis. So the operator A's eigenstates are |+> and |-> as I have.

So the state |alpha> is in the z-basis, and the eigenstates of A are |+> and |->, which are superpositions of |up> and |down> .

So to find the probability of measuring each eigenvalue, I have to project |alpha> onto |+> and |->.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express |alpha> in terms of the |+> and |-> basis.

Let me think: since |+> and |-> form an orthonormal basis, I can express |alpha> as a linear combination of them.

So, let me write |alpha> = a |+> + b |->.

The coefficients a and b will give me the amplitudes, and the probabilities will be |a|^2 and |b|^2.

So, let's compute a and b.

First, express |+> and |-> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)

|-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, |alpha> = c1 |+> + c2 |->.

Expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, this would be:

|alpha> = [c1 (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) ) ] + [ c2 (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) ) ]

= [ (c1 + c2)/sqrt(2) ) ] |up> + [ (c1 - c2)/sqrt(2) ) ] |down> 

But from earlier, we know |alpha> is equal to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> , all over sqrt(7).

So, equating the coefficients:

( (c1 + c2 ) / sqrt(2) ) = (1+i)/sqrt(7)

( (c1 - c2 ) / sqrt(2) ) = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

So, we have two equations:

(c1 + c2 ) = (1+i) / sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)

(c1 - c2 ) = (2 - i) / sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)

Wait, wait. Let me correct that.

Wait, (c1 + c2)/sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7).

Multiply both sides by sqrt(2): c1 + c2 = (1+i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = (1+i) sqrt(2/7).

Similarly, (c1 - c2)/sqrt(2) = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Multiply both sides by sqrt(2): c1 - c2 = (2 -i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = (2 -i) sqrt(2/7).

So now, we have two equations:

c1 + c2 = (1+i) * sqrt(2/7)

c1 - c2 = (2 -i) * sqrt(2/7)

We can solve for c1 and c2 by adding and subtracting these equations.

Adding the two equations: 2 c1 = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7) 

→ 2 c1 = (3) sqrt(2/7)

→ c1 = (3/2) sqrt(2/7) = (3 sqrt(2) )/(2 sqrt(7)) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Wait, because sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = sqrt(14)/7 → Wait, let me compute:

Wait, sqrt(2/7) is sqrt(14)/7? Let me see: sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = sqrt(2/7) = same as sqrt(14)/7? Wait, sqrt(ab) = sqrt(a) * sqrt(b), so sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) is sqrt(2/7). Alternatively, sqrt(2/7) is sqrt(14)/7 because sqrt(14) is sqrt(2*7) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(7). So sqrt(14)/7 = sqrt(2)/sqrt(7). So yeah, same thing.

So c1 = (3/2) * (sqrt(14)/7 ) ? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, sqrt(2/7) is sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = sqrt(14)/7 because sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)/7 = sqrt(14)/7.

So sqrt(2/7) = sqrt(14)/7.

So c1 = (3/2) * (sqrt(2/7)) ) = (3/2) * (sqrt(14)/7) ) = 3 sqrt(14) / (14) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Wait, let me compute that numerically. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to leave it as expressions for now.

So c1 = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Wait, no: 3/2 * sqrt(2/7) = 3/(2) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = [3 sqrt(2) ]/(2 sqrt(7)).

Hmm, perhaps I can rationalize the denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to proceed with the equations.

So from the two equations:

c1 + c2 = [ (1+i) sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7 )

c1 - c2 = [ (2 -i) sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7 )

Let me add and subtract.

Add: 2c1 = ( (1+i) + (2 -i) ) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7 )

= (3) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7 )

So c1 = 3/(2) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7 )

= (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, subtract the two equations:

2 c2 = ( (1+i) - (2 -i) ) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7 )

= ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7 )

So c2 = ( (-1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2) ) / (2 sqrt(7) )

So now, the coefficients a and b are c1 and c2.

So the probabilities are |c1|^2 and |c2|^2.

Compute |c1|^2:

c1 = 3 sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)).

So |c1|^2 = (9 * 2 ) / (4 *7 ) ) → 18/(28 ) = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Similarly, |c2|^2:

c2 = [ (-1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7) )

The magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + 2^2 ) * (2) / (4 *7 )

= (1 +4 ) * 2 /28 → 5 * 2 /28 → 10/28 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, wait: Wait, let's compute it correctly.

Wait, the coefficient c2 is [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)).

So the magnitude squared is [ ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) * (sqrt(2))^2 ] / [ (2 sqrt(7))^2 ]

→ [ (1 +4 ) * 2 ] / [ 4 *7 ]

→ (5 * 2 ) / 28 → 10/28 =5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, but 5/14 is approximately 0.357, and 9/14 is approximately 0.6429. So the probabilities are about 64.3% and 35.7%.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36. That seems to match our calculations (9/14 is approximately 0.6429, which rounds to 0.64; 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded to two decimal places.)

So the probabilities would be approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, the average value of the operator A.

The average value is given by <alpha| A |alpha>.

But wait, since A is an observable, the average is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities.

Because the operator A has eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2. So the average is:

< A > = (probability of +hbar/2 ) * (hbar/2) + (probability of -hbar/2 ) * (-hbar/2 )

= [ (9/14) * (hbar/2) ) ] + [ (5/14) * (-hbar/2) ) ]

= (9/14 -5/14) * hbar/2

= (4/14) * hbar/2

= (2/7) * (hbar/2 )

= (hbar) /7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the average is hbar/7. So the probabilities would be 0.64 and 0.36, which matches our earlier calculation.

So the correct answer would be option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

Wait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Wait, when I computed |c1|^2: c1 is (3 sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(7)).

So |c1|^2 is (9 * 2 )/(4 *7 ) → 18/28 → 9/14 ≈ 0.642857, which is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places. So that seems correct.

Similarly, |c2|^2 is ( (-1 +2i) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) ) → the magnitude squared is (1^2 + 2^2 ) * 2 / (4 *7 ), so (5) *2/(28 )=10/28=5/14≈0.3571, which is 0.36 when rounded.

So the average is (9/14)(hbar/2) - (5/14)(hbar/2) ) = [4/14] (hbar/2) ) = (2/7)(hbar/2) )= hbar/(7). So yes.

So the option A is the correct one.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}},
\]
where the normalization factor is \(1/\sqrt{7}\), obtained by summing the squared magnitudes of the coefficients \((1+i)\) and \((2-i)\).

Next, we consider the operator \(A\) with matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of \(A\) are \(\pm \frac{\hbar}{2}\), and the corresponding eigenstates are:
\[
|+\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates \(|+\rangle\) and \(|-\rangle\), we express \(|\alpha\rangle\) in terms of these eigenstates:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = a|+\rangle + b|-\rangle.
\]
Substituting \(|+\rangle\) and \(|-\rangle\) into \(|\alpha\rangle\), we equate coefficients and solve for \(a\) and \(b\). After normalization, the probabilities are:
\[
P(+\rangle) = |a|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-\rangle) = |b|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Finally, the average value of the operator \(A\) is calculated as:
\[
\langle A \rangle = P(+\rangle) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-\rangle) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Substituting the probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} - \frac{5}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{4}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) 0.64, 0.36, and \(\hbar/7\).**
