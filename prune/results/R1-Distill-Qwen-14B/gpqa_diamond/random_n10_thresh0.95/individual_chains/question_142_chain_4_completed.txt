Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located geometrically in the qubit space. Hmm, density matrices... I remember they're used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. 

The given density matrix is ρ = 1/2 (|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, that's the maximally mixed state for a qubit. So, when a qubit is in a completely mixed state, it's like it's in a classical mixture of |0> and |1>, each with equal probability. 

Now, the question is about its geometrical position. I'm a bit fuzzy on how density matrices relate to points in space. I remember something about the Bloch sphere, which is used to represent qubit states. Pure states are on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states are inside. 

The Bloch vector representation comes into play here. For a single qubit, any state can be represented as a vector in a 3D space, the Bloch sphere. The density matrix can be written in terms of this vector. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector (r_x, r_y, r_z). 

Let me write down the general expression for ρ. The identity matrix I is 2x2, and the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So, I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. Then, when I divide by 2, each term contributes to the density matrix. 

Wait, the given ρ is 1/2 (|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me compute each term. |0><0| is a matrix with 1 at (1,1) and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is 1 at (2,2). So adding them gives a diagonal matrix with entries 1 and 1. Then, multiplying by 1/2, the ρ matrix is diagonal with 1/2 and 1/2. So ρ = [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. 

Now, comparing this to the general form. The general form is (I + r·σ)/2. Let me compute that. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So (I)/2 is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. Then the other terms are (r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. 

Let me write out the Pauli matrices. σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when I add r·σ, it'll be [[(r_z + 1), r_x - i r_y], [r_x + i r_y, (r_z - 1)]]]. Then, when I divide by 2, each element is divided by 2. 

So putting it all together, the general density matrix is:
[[ (1 + r_z)/2 , (r_x - i r_y)/2 ],
 [ (r_x + i r_y)/2 , (1 - r_z)/2 ] ]

Now, our ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. Comparing element-wise. The off-diagonal terms must be zero. So (r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0. That implies both r_x and r_y are zero because the denominator is non-zero. 

Looking at the diagonal elements: (1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2. Solving this gives 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0. Similarly, the other diagonal element is (1 - r_z)/2 = 1/2. Which also gives r_z = 0. 

So the Bloch vector r has components (0, 0, 0). That means the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. Wait, but wait a second. The origin in the Bloch sphere is the completely mixed state, which is exactly what this ρ represents. So yeah, that makes sense. 

So, looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which should be the correct answer. The other options don't make sense. For example, option A is (1,1,0), which would be a point on the Bloch sphere's equator, but the state here is completely mixed, so it's at the center. Option B is (0,0,1), which would be the state |0>, but that's a pure state, not the maximally mixed state. Option D is (1,1,1), which is a point outside the Bloch sphere, which can't be right because the Bloch vector's length can't exceed 1. 

So, I'm pretty confident the answer is C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state of a single qubit, where the qubit is in a classical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability. The density matrix is diagonal with entries \(\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\frac{1}{2}\), corresponding to the state 

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

In the Bloch sphere representation, the state of a qubit is described by a Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\), where the density matrix can be written as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

with \(I\) being the identity matrix and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) the Pauli matrices. For the given \(\rho\), the off-diagonal terms must be zero, which implies \(r_x = 0\) and \(r_y = 0\). The diagonal terms yield \((1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2\), which gives \(r_z = 0\). Thus, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the origin of the Bloch sphere.

This position at the origin represents the completely mixed state, which is consistent with the given density matrix. The other options are incorrect: 

- **Option A** (\(r = (1, 1, 0)\)) corresponds to a pure state on the Bloch sphere's equator.  
- **Option B** (\(r = (0, 0, 1)\)) corresponds to the pure state \(|0\rangle\).  
- **Option D** (\(r = (1, 1, 1)\)) is outside the Bloch sphere, which is not physically valid.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C**, as the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Answer: C
