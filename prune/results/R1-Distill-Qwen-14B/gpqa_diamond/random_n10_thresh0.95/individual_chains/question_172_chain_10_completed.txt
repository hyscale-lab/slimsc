Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

The question states that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And because the photospheres are in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), I think that means we can apply the Boltzmann equation here.

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy levels in a gas to the temperature. The formula I remember is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference is given as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. But wait, 1.38 is the value of Boltzmann's constant k, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, interesting. So ΔE = k*T * (some factor?), but wait no, ΔE is given as a specific value.

Wait, the situation is that in star_1, the population (n) of a higher energy level is twice that of star_2. Or is it the other way around? Let me re-read the question.

"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2". So, the excitation level is higher for star_1. So, the population of the excited state (n_i) in star_1 is twice that of star_2's excited state (n_j), for the same energy level.

Wait, no, wait. The question says they are in the same energy level? Or is the energy level different? Wait no, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, no, I think I misread that. Wait, no. The energy difference between the considered energy levels is 1.38e-23 J. So each star has atoms in a higher energy level (i) and a lower (j). So for both, the same ΔE is considered.

Wait no, wait, the energy difference between the considered energy levels is the same for both stars. So, for each star, the energy difference is ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

So for star 1, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another state) is (n_i1)/(n_j1) = 2, perhaps. Similarly, for star 2, (n_i2)/(n_j2) would be a different ratio. But wait, the question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So maybe n_i1 = 2 * n_i2. But I'm not sure if that's the right way to model it. Or perhaps it's the ratio n_i/n_j.

Wait, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. I think that probably refers to the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the number in the lower state. So for star_1, (n_i)/(n_j) is twice that of star_2's (n_i)/(n_j). Hmm, no, wait the question says that the specific energy level (i) is twice as excited. So perhaps n_i in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Or wait, perhaps when they say twice as excited, they mean that the ratio (n_i)/(n_j) for star_1 is twice that of star_2's ratio. Let me clarify.

The question says: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So for a specific energy level (say, level i), star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2. So n_i1 = 2 * n_i2. But wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's the ratio of n_i to n_j (the lower level) that's twice as high as in star_2. So (n_i1)/(n_j1) = 2 * (n_i2)/(n_j2).

But wait, no, the question says "twice as excited in a specific energy level", which might mean that the fraction in that specific level (i) is twice as high. But wait, in the Boltzmann equation, the ratio is between two energy levels. So perhaps the setup is that in star_1, the ratio (n_i)/(n_j) is twice as much as in star_2. Hmm, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level as compared to star_2. So, perhaps that the number of atoms in the higher energy level (i) relative to the lower (j) is twice as much.

So for star_1: (n_i1)/(n_j1) = 2 * (n_i2)/(n_j2).

Wait, but that may not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the actual excited state population in star_1 is twice that of star_2. But I think the first approach is correct because the question is about the excitation relative to another state.

So using the Boltzmann equation:

(n_i)/(n_j) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, no. The correct form is (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

Since E_i > E_j, the exponent is negative. But for small energy differences, maybe we can approximate it.

Wait, but for the given problem, let's proceed.

Let me denote:

For star_1: (n_i1)/(n_j1) = 2 * (n_i2)/(n_j2)

Hmm, wait, but the question says that the excitation is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2, so perhaps (n_i1)/(n_j1) = 2 * (n_i2)/(n_j2). Or wait, perhaps the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2, but that's not directly helpful because it depends on the total number of atoms. Instead, the ratio is what matters in the Boltzmann factor.

So, let me write the ratios for both stars.

Star_1: (n_i1)/(n_j1) = exp( -ΔE/(k T_1) )

Star_2: (n_i2)/(n_j2) = exp( -ΔE/(k T_2) )

But according to the problem, the excitation in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. So (n_i1)/(n_j1) = 2 * (n_i2)/(n_j2)

So substituting from the Boltzmann expressions:

exp( -ΔE/(k T_1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T_2) )

Wait, no. Because according to the problem statement, star_1's excitation is twice that of star_2, so (n_i1)/(n_j1) = 2 * (n_i2)/(n_j2). So the expression would be:

exp( -ΔE/(k T_1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T_2) )

Let me rearrange this.

Divide both sides by exp( -ΔE/(k T_2) ):

exp( -ΔE/(k T_1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T_2) ) ) = 2

This simplifies to exp( [ -ΔE/(k T_1) + ΔE/(k T_2) ]) = 2.

Factor out ΔE/(k):

exp( (ΔE/k) [ 1/(T_2) - 1/(T_1) ] ) = 2.

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

(ΔE/k) [ (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) ] = ln(2)

Hmm, let's compute this.

Wait, (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = (T_1 - T_2)/(T_1 T_2). Let me see:

1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So substituting:

(ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

We can write this as:

ln(2) = [ (ΔE)/(k) ) * (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ]

But wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k (since k = 1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k.

So substituting ΔE = k into the equation:

ln(2) = [ (k)/(k) ) * (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ]

Simplify (k/k)=1:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, checking the options:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2)

Yes, that's exactly what we have here.

So the correct equation is option D.


To determine the relationship between the effective temperatures of the two stars, we use the Boltzmann equation, which relates the populations of energy levels in a system in thermodynamic equilibrium:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of the higher and lower energy levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

The problem states that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice as high as in star_2 for the same energy level. This implies:

\[
\frac{n_{i1}}{n_{j1}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{i2}}{n_{j2}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann equation for both stars:

\[
\frac{n_{i1}}{n_{j1}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right), \quad \frac{n_{i2}}{n_{j2}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Equating the excitation ratios:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Dividing through by \(\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right)\):

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right) = 2.
\]

Simplifying the exponent:

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

The term \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\) can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Substituting this back:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Since \(\Delta E = k\) (given \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), which matches the value of \(k\)), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
