Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit puzzled. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, wait, what's C3h symmetry again? I remember that symmetry in molecules involves certain operations that leave the molecule looking the same. So, C3h symmetry probably refers to a certain type of symmetry element.

I think C3h is a type of molecular symmetry that includes a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), right? So, the molecule should have a three-fold rotation and a mirror plane that's horizontal. Alternatively, maybe the h refers to the mirror plane being horizontal, but I'm a bit rusty on the exact definitions.

Let me check. Oh, right, the C3h point group consists of a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane that is perpendicular to the rotation axis. So, any molecule with this symmetry would look the same after a 120-degree rotation around the axis and would also be symmetric with respect to this horizontal mirror plane.

The options given are four molecules, each with a different structure. The options are A, B, C, D, each corresponding to one of the molecules.

Let me look at each one.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. That's a mouthful. So, triphenyleno suggests three phenyl groups attached in some way. The structure is a trifuran, which is a compound with three furan rings connected. The numbering is a bit complicated, but I think the key is whether the molecule has three-fold symmetry.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. So, similar structure to A but with benzene rings attached.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. Wait, triisopropyl borate would have a boron atom connected to three isopropyl groups. So, structure-wise, it's a central boron with three identical isopropyl substituents. Since the isopropyl groups are all the same, the molecule might have some symmetry. How much?

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound, right? It's a norbornane derivative but with an amine group. Quinuclidine has a structure that's like a bridge bicyclic system. Wait, does it have any three-fold symmetry? I think quinuclidine has a three-fold axis of symmetry. Let me visualize it. It's a bicyclo[2.2.2] structure, which I believe has a C3 symmetry. But wait, does it also have a mirror plane that's horizontal?

Hmm, maybe I should recap each molecule's structure.

Triphenyleno[...]trifuran... I think that's a structure where three phenylene rings are connected to a trifuran. Wait, trifuran is three fused furans, right? So, perhaps the molecule is a tricyclic structure where each phenylene is attached to a furan ring.

Benzo[...]trifuran would have benzene rings attached. Triphenyleno is like three benzene rings attached at certain positions.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. The molecule is B with three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is symmetric. So, the molecule is symmetrical in the sense that all substituents are the same. So, the central B is attached to three identical isopropyl groups. Let's think about the symmetry. The molecule would be symmetrical in some way.

Wait, triisopropyl borane (assuming it's not the borate, which would have an oxygen) would have a trigonal planar structure around boron. So, the three isopropyl groups are arranged symmetrically. So, does this molecule have C3h symmetry?

Well, it has three identical groups arranged symmetrically. So, it should have a C3 axis, which is a three-fold rotation. But what about the mirror planes? Does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, the borate would have a central B connected to three isopropyl groups. So, the molecule's geometry would be trigonal planar around B. So, the molecule is symmetric in the plane (the mirror plane containing B and the substituents). Wait, but the mirror plane would pass through the B and each substituent.

Wait, maybe the molecule has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, that would fit C3h symmetry.

Wait, but wait. For a molecule to have C3h symmetry, it must have a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, for triisopropyl borate, is there a horizontal plane?

Alternatively, perhaps the mirror plane is vertical, not horizontal. Because the substituents are in the same plane as the central atom. So, the mirror plane would be vertical, cutting through the molecule. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Let me think visually. The molecule would have the boron at the center, with three isopropyl groups attached. The structure is flat, like a trigonal planar around B. So, a horizontal plane would slice through the B and the substituents. Wait, no, a horizontal mirror plane would be perpendicular to the C3 axis, perhaps.

Wait, the C3 axis is perpendicular to the mirror plane. So, for C3h symmetry, the rotation is about an axis perpendicular to the mirror plane. So, if the mirror plane is the horizontal one, then the C3 axis would be vertical.

In triisopropyl borate, the B is at the center, with three substituents in a trigonal planar arrangement. So, if the C3 axis is going through the B and the substituents are arranged in a plane, which would be the horizontal plane, then the mirror plane would be vertical.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting myself confused. Maybe I should think about specific examples.

What about quinuclidine? Quinuclidine has a bicyclo[2.2.2] structure. Let me draw it mentally: a bridge structure with two carbons on each bridge. The molecule has a three-fold axis of symmetry. So, if you rotate 120 degrees, it looks the same.

But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Or is the mirror plane vertical?

Wait, quinuclidine's structure is like a cube corner. Imagine three bridges meeting at a single point. Each bridge is a two-carbon bridge. So, the molecule is symmetric under 120-degree rotation, which is the C3 symmetry. Now, does it have a mirror plane?

In quinuclidine, I think there isn't a mirror plane because the molecule is chiral. Wait, no, wait. Quinuclidine is actually a meso compound, meaning it has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Oh! So quinuclidine has a plane of symmetry, which would be a mirror plane. So, if it has a C3 rotation axis and a mirror plane, which would make it C3h?

Wait, wait, but the mirror plane in quinuclidine might not be horizontal. Let me think about the structure. The molecule is bicyclo[2.2.2], so it's a very symmetrical structure. It has a three-fold axis, and there's a mirror plane that bisects the molecule. But is that mirror plane horizontal?

Hmm, alternatively, perhaps the mirror plane is vertical, cutting through the molecule. I'm not exactly sure, but quinuclidine is known to have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. So, it has a mirror plane, but whether it's horizontal or not.

Wait, the problem is about C3h symmetry. So, the combination of a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane. I'm not sure if quinuclidine has a horizontal mirror plane. Maybe the mirror plane is vertical.

Let me think about the other options. Option B is benzo[...]-trifuran. So, maybe that's a molecule with three benzene rings attached to a trifuran. Trifuran is a fused furan ring system. I'm not sure about the symmetry here. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps around a three-fold axis, then maybe it has C3h symmetry.

Option A is triphenyleno attached to a trifuran. So, again, a complex structure. If the substituents are arranged in a symmetric way, perhaps with three phenyl groups attached, maybe that creates a C3h symmetry.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each molecule's symmetry.

Triisopropyl borate: The structure is a trigonal planar around boron, with three isopropyl groups. So, it's symmetric with a C3 axis. But what about mirror planes? The molecule is symmetrical in the plane of the substituents, but is that a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, in this case, the plane containing the boron and the substituents would be the horizontal plane if the molecule is flat. So, the mirror plane would be horizontal. So, if the molecule has a three-fold rotation (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), then that would give it C3h symmetry.

Wait, but the structure of triisopropyl borate is flat? No, wait. Each isopropyl group is a substituent sticking out from the boron. So, the molecule is three-dimensional, but around the boron, each substituent is in a plane. So, the plane of the boron and substituents would be the horizontal plane if the molecule is sitting on the boron.

Wait, but that depends on how the molecule is oriented. Alternatively, the mirror plane could be vertical, cutting through the molecule, which would mean the mirror plane isn't horizontal. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the triisopropyl borate does not have a mirror plane, only the C3 axis. So, its symmetry would be D3h or Td or something else? Wait, no, the point group for a molecule with a C3 axis and no mirror planes would be D3, but if there are mirror planes, it might be D3h.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible point groups. C3h is a point group with a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So, any molecule with such symmetry would have that.

Quinuclidine, being a meso compound, has a mirror plane, but I think the mirror plane is vertical, not horizontal. Therefore, it might have C3v symmetry instead of C3h. C3v has a vertical mirror plane and a C3 axis.

So, if quinuclidine has a vertical mirror plane and a C3 axis, its point group is C3v, not C3h.

Then, triisopropyl borate: does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Let me imagine the molecule. The boron is at the center, connected to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is in a plane. If you look from above, the molecule is symmetrical, but if you look from below, would it have a horizontal mirror? Or maybe not.

Wait, the mirror plane would be the one that goes through the boron and the substituents, which would be a horizontal plane if the molecule is sitting flat. So, if triisopropyl borate has a horizontal mirror plane and a C3 axis, then it would fit C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps the mirror plane is vertical. For example, the molecule might have a vertical mirror plane cutting through one substituent, making the others mirror images. But with three substituents, the presence of multiple mirror planes complicates things.

Wait, another approach: which of these molecules is known for having C3h symmetry?

I remember that triisopropyl borane has a point group of D3h. Because it has a C3 axis, three vertical mirror planes, and a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, D3h has a horizontal mirror plane and a three-fold axis. So, if triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry, then it would have C3h symmetry as a component.

Wait, but the question is about C3h symmetry. So, if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it would also have C3h as part of its symmetry. But the question is asking which molecule has C3h symmetry, so maybe triisopropyl borate is the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused about the difference between C3h and D3h. Let me think. The D3h point group has a principal axis of C3, a horizontal mirror plane, and three vertical mirror planes. So, it's a higher symmetry than C3h, which only includes the C3 and the horizontal mirror plane.

So, if the molecule has D3h symmetry, it would certainly have C3h. But the question is which has C3h symmetry. So, perhaps the molecule doesn't have the vertical mirror planes, but just the C3 and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, but triisopropyl borate (option C) has three identical substituents, so it probably has more symmetry than just C3h.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the triphenyleno option (option A) has C3h symmetry. Let me think about its structure.

Triphenyleno attached to a trifuran. The trifuran is a system with three fused furan rings. So, if the substituents (the phenylene groups) are attached in such a way that they are symmetrically placed, perhaps the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

But I'm not exactly sure about that. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a trigonal planar fashion around a central point, then it would have a three-fold axis.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit tough. So, perhaps I should focus on which of the options is known to have C3h symmetry.

Quinuclidine is a well-known compound, and I recall that it has a three-fold axis but is a meso compound, meaning it has a plane of symmetry. So, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? I'm not entirely certain, but perhaps it's the triisopropyl borate that has the C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, the benzo[...]trifuran (option B) may have a three-fold symmetry. Let me think; if the substituents are attached at positions that allow a three-fold rotation, and a horizontal mirror plane, then it would fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, triphenyleno... but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, let me think of another approach. The question is about which molecule has C3h symmetry. So, I need to figure out which of these four has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

Quinuclidine (option D) has a three-fold axis but I think its mirror plane is vertical, so symmetry point group is C3v.

Triisopropyl borate (option C) is a trigonal planar molecule, so it's D3h symmetry, which includes C3h.

So, if the question is about C3h, then triisopropyl borate would have it.

But wait, I thought that the C3h point group is lower symmetry than D3h. So, a molecule with D3h symmetry would have C3h, but the question is which has C3h. So, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But wait, what about the other options.

Option B is benzo[...]trifuran. If that's a structure with three benzene rings attached to a central trifuran, perhaps arranged in a symmetric way. If each benzene is attached in a way that allows a three-fold rotation, then it would have C3 symmetry. Does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If the substituents are symmetrically placed, maybe it does.

But without exact structural knowledge, it's hard to say, but perhaps the benzo option is D3h as well.

Alternatively, the question might have an easier way to approach. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:
A) triphenyleno[...]trifuran
B) benzo[...]trifuran
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

I think triisopropyl borate has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane, making it C3h. Alternatively, if the mirror plane is vertical, perhaps it's C3v. But I thought it's D3h because of the multiple mirror planes.

Wait, no. Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar structure. So, the point group would be D3h. Because D3h has a C3 axis, a horizontal mirror plane, and three vertical mirror planes.

So, if the molecule is D3h, then it certainly has C3h symmetry, but the question is about which has C3h. So, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but the question is which has C3h symmetry. So, the molecule must belong to the C3h point group. Which of the options belong to that group?

Alternatively, perhaps none of them are D3h, but one of them is C3h.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of each option.

Option D: quinuclidine.

Quinuclidine has a three-fold axis and a mirror plane, but I think the mirror plane is vertical (C3v symmetry). So, it's not C3h.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. It has D3h symmetry, which includes C3h. So, it does have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but the question is which molecule has C3h symmetry. So, if a molecule has D3h, it would have C3h as a subset. So, triisopropyl borate would have C3h.

Alternatively, is the question asking about the highest symmetry? No, it's just asking which has C3h.

So, the answer would be option C.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. I'm probably mixing up some of the point groups.

Alternatively, maybe none of the options have C3h except one.

Wait, another approach: the only molecule with a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane is option C.

But wait, looking back at the options, the question lists four molecules, with options A, B, C, D. The correct answer is among them.

Wait, another thought: I think triisopropyl borate (option C) has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), making it C3h. So, option C would be the correct answer.

But wait, looking again, I think I might have gotten the point groups wrong. Let me quickly recap:

C3h: C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

D3h: includes C3, σh, and three vertical mirrors.

So, if a molecule has D3h, it would have C3h symmetry.

So, the triisopropyl borate (option C) has D3h symmetry. So, it does have C3h. Therefore, it's a candidate.

Which other option could have C3h?

Wait, the only other option I can think of is none of the others. So, the answer is option C: triisopropyl borate.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry elements. **C₃h** symmetry consists of a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Let us evaluate each option:

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule has three phenylene groups attached to a trifuran system. The trifuran suggests a fused ring structure, and the phenylene groups are likely arranged symmetrically. However, without explicit structural details, it is unclear whether this molecule has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Its symmetry cannot definitively be classified as **C₃h**.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule also features a trifuran system, but with benzene rings attached. Similar to Option A, the symmetry depends on the arrangement of the substituents. While it may have a three-fold rotation axis, the presence of a horizontal mirror plane is uncertain. Thus, it is not definitively classified as having **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option C: Triisopropyl borate  
Triisopropyl borate consists of a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups. The molecule has a trigonal planar geometry around the boron atom, which introduces a three-fold rotation axis (C₃). Additionally, the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that passes through the boron atom and the centers of the isopropyl groups. Therefore, this molecule satisfies the criteria for **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound with a bicyclo[2.2.2] structure. It has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a vertical mirror plane (σv), which places it in the **C₃v** point group. However, it does not have a horizontal mirror plane, so it does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion  
Among the given options, only **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) has both a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), making it the molecule with **C₃h** symmetry.

**Answer: C**
