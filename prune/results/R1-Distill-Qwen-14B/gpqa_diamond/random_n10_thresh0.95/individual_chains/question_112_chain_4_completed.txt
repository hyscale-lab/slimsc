Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that there's an electron in a state |alpha⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because the question says it's proportional, meaning we have to find the actual coefficients by normalizing.

Wait, right, normalization is when the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients equals 1. So the state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, but we have to divide by a normalization factor N so that ⟨alpha|alpha⟩ = 1.

So let me compute the normalization. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). The norm would be |1+i|² + |2−i|². Let me calculate each modulus squared.

|1+i|² is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2. Because (1+i)(1-i)=1 +1.

|2−i|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the total norm is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor N is sqrt(7). So the actual state is [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the next part is about measuring the eigenstates of another operator whose matrix representation is given. The matrix Aij is given such that Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So what's this matrix look like?

Wait, the matrix is 2x2 since we have |up> and |down> as the basis states. The indices i and j run over 1 and 2, perhaps. So when i≠j, Aij is ħ/2. So the matrix would be:

Row 1: [0, ħ/2]
Row 2: [ħ/2, 0]

Wait, no, because for i=1, j=2, it's ħ/2. Similarly, i=2, j=1 is ħ/2. The diagonal elements (i=j) are zero. So the matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

Hmm, what kind of operator is this? It's a 2x2 matrix with zero diagonal and non-zero off-diagonal elements. That looks familiar. Wait, the Pauli matrices have similar structures. Oh wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this matrix is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because A = (ħ/2) * sigma_x.

Yes, because sigma_x has 1s on the off-diagonal. So this operator A is (ħ/2) times sigma_x.

Wait, sigma_x is actually the Pauli X matrix, which is [[0,1], [1,0]]. So our operator A is (ħ/2) * sigma_x.

Now, the eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of A. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of sigma_x, just scaled by a factor. Therefore, the eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |−x⟩, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

So to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of A, we need to express |alpha⟩ in terms of the eigenbasis of A, and then the probabilities will be the square of the coefficients.

Alternatively, since A is proportional to sigma_x, perhaps we can diagonalize sigma_x and express |alpha⟩ in that basis.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the probabilities by finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A and then projecting |alpha⟩ onto those eigenvectors.

Wait, but A is (ħ/2) sigma_x, so its eigenvalues are (ħ/2)(±1) because sigma_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So the eigenvalues of A are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

But for the purpose of calculating probabilities, the actual eigenstates matter. So let me find the eigenvectors of A.

Alternatively, since sigma_x's eigenvectors are known. The eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) for eigenvalue +1, and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) for eigenvalue -1.

Wait, let me confirm. The sigma_x operator swaps the |up> and |down> states. So, for sigma_x |+x> = |+x>, let me compute it.

Wait, sigma_x |up> = |down>, sigma_x |down> = |up>. So the eigenstates should satisfy (sigma_x |v> )= ± |v>.

Let me write |+x> as a combination a|up> + b|down>.

Then sigma_x |+x> = a |down> + b |up> = (a)|down> + (b)|up> = (sigma_x |+x> ) = (+1)(a|up> + b|down> )

So, comparing:

a |down> + b |up> = a |up> + b |down> 

Wait, that's for eigenvalue +1. So that gives:

a |down> + b |up> = (a) |up> + (b) |down> 

Which implies that a = b, and b = a. So the eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) for +1, and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) for -1.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, when I apply sigma_x to |+x>, which is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), I get (|down> + |up>)/sqrt(2) = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) = |+x> again. So sigma_x |+x> = |+x> → eigenvalue +1.

Similarly, sigma_x acting on |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) gives (|down> - |up>)/sqrt(2) = - (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) = - |−x>. So eigenvalue -1.

So the eigenstates of A, which is (ħ/2) sigma_x, are the same as those of sigma_x. So |+x> and |−x>.

So to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A (i.e., |+x> and |−x>), we need to express |alpha> in terms of these states.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is in the z-basis, we can compute the overlap with |+x> and |−x> to get the coefficients, then the probabilities are the mod-squared of those coefficients.

So, let me write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) |up> + ( (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) |down>.

Expressed in the z-basis (|up>, |down>), but we need to write it in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

Wait, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),
|−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, let me express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

Let me write |alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |−x>.

So, to find c_+ and c_-, we can write:

c_+ = ⟨ +x | alpha ⟩,
c_- = ⟨ -x | alpha ⟩.

Let me compute c_+ first.

c_+ = (⟨ up | + ⟨ down | ) / sqrt(2) ) * |alpha> / sqrt(7)

Wait, no, |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> all over sqrt(7). So:

c_+ = [ (⟨up| + ⟨down| ) / sqrt(2) ) ] * [ ( (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ) / sqrt(7) ) ]

Which simplifies to:

= (1+i) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) + (2−i) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))
= [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] / (sqrt(14))
= (3) / sqrt(14)
Wait, because (1+i) + (2−i) = 3.

Wait, let me recheck: 1+i +2 -i = 3 +0i =3.

So, c_+ = 3 / sqrt(14).

Wait, but that's the coefficient. The probability is |c_+|², which is (3)^2 / (14) =9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, compute c_-.

c_- = ⟨ -x | alpha ⟩ = (⟨ up | - ⟨ down | ) / sqrt(2) ) * [ ( (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ) / sqrt(7) ) ]

So that's:

= (1+i) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) - (2−i) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))
= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14)
= [ (1−2) + (i +i) ] / sqrt(14)
= ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14)

So c_- is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

The probability is |c_-|² = [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1+4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.3571.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me calculate |c_+|² and |c_-|².

c_+ is 3/sqrt(14), so |c_+|² is 9/14 ≈0.642857 or about 0.64.

c_- is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14), so |c_-|² is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14=5/14≈0.3571.

Wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, and 9/14 is about 0.6428, which adds up to 14/14=1, so that's correct.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. Looking at the options, let's check.

Option A says 0.64 and 0.36, with average value ħ/7.

Hmm, but wait, what about the average value of the operator A?

The average value ⟨A⟩ is ⟨alpha| A |alpha⟩.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) sigma_x, and |alpha> is a spin-1/2 state, perhaps we can compute this expectation.

Alternatively, since we've already found the coefficients in the eigenbasis of A, we can compute ⟨A⟩ as the weighted sum of the eigenvalues.

Because in the eigenbasis, the expectation is sum (p_i * a_i ), where p_i is the probability and a_i are the eigenvalues.

The eigenvalues of A are ħ/2 and -ħ/2 for |+x> and |−x>, respectively.

So ⟨A⟩ = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = [ (9 -5)/14 ] * ħ/2 = (4/14)(ħ/2 ) = (2/7)(ħ/2 ) = ħ/(7).

So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. So that matches.

Wait, but let me make sure I computed the average correctly using another approach.

Another approach: compute ⟨alpha| A |alpha⟩.

So, since A is (ħ/2) sigma_x, and sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]].

Let me write |alpha> as a column vector in the z-basis. The state is ( (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2−i)/sqrt(7) )^T.

So (1+i)/sqrt(7) is the coefficient for |up>, and (2−i)/sqrt(7) for |down>.

The operator A can be represented as (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]].

So the expectation is (1/sqrt(7))^2 times the conjugate transpose of the vector multiplied by A times the vector.

Wait, because ⟨alpha| A |alpha⟩ = (1/7) times [ (1−i)* (2+i) + (2+i)(1−i) ) ] * (ħ/2).

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it step by step.

Compute ⟨alpha| A |alpha⟩:

= (1/sqrt(7))^2 * [ (1−i) ⟨up| + (2+i) ⟨down| ] * A [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ]

But A acts on the state as follows.

Wait, A is (ħ/2) sigma_x, so sigma_x |up> = |down>, sigma_x |down> = |up>.

So, A |alpha> = (ħ/2) ( |down> (1+i) + |up> (2−i) ) / sqrt(7).

Wait, let me compute it properly.

Wait, let me represent |alpha⟩ as vector v: v = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then, A is (ħ/2) * [ [0, 1], [1, 0] ].

So A v = (ħ/2) * [ (2-i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then, ⟨alpha| A |alpha> is v† A v = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1-i), (2+i) ] * (ħ/2) [ (2−i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Multiplying these:

= (ħ/2) * [ (1−i)(2−i) + (2 + i)(1 + i) ) ] / 7.

Let me compute each term.

First term: (1−i)(2−i) = 2(1) +1*(-i) -i*2 + i^2. Wait, no, better multiply:

(1−i)(2−i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i².

i² is -1, so 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Second term: (2+i)(1+i) = 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i =2 +2i +i +i² =2 +3i -1 =1+3i.

Adding these two terms: (1-3i) + (1+3i) = 2.

So the expectation is (ħ/2) * (2) /7 = (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7.

Which matches the earlier result. So yes, the average is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 (9/14) and 0.36 (5/14), and the average is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. So that should be the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization is determined by ensuring \( \langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = 1 \). The coefficients are \( 1+i \) and \( 2-i \), with their moduli squared being \( |1+i|^2 = 2 \) and \( |2-i|^2 = 5 \). The total norm is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \), so the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given as \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( 0 \) otherwise. This matrix is proportional to the Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix, with \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \). The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \), with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. Thus, the eigenstates of \( A \) are the same as those of \( \sigma_x \), with eigenvalues \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \).

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of \( A \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) basis. The coefficients are computed as:

\[
c_+ = \langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
c_- = \langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
P(+x) = |c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is computed as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14} \right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of \( A \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).**
