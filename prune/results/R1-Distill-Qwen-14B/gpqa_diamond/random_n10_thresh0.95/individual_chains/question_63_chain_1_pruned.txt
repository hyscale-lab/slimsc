Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator models, but this question mentions the non-rigid rotor model, which I'm a bit fuzzy on. Oh wait, the non-rigid rotor is also known as the rotation-vibration model, right? So it combines rotational and vibrational energy levels.

The problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So for vibration, that's the n=0 state, and for rotation, that's the J=0 state.

The question is about absorbing a photon that changes the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The next state after the fundamental would be the first excited state. But wait, in quantum mechanics, transitions can be either vibrational or rotational. Since the fundamental state is the lowest, the next state could be the first vibrational excited state (n=1) or the first rotational level (J=1). Oh right, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So which transition requires less energy: vibrational or rotational?

Wait, but the energy levels for rotation are quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. And for vibration, E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w. So the energy difference between the ground and first vibrational state is ΔE_vib = (1) h w. For rotation, moving from J=0 to J=1 would be ΔE_rot = B (2*1 +1 - 0) = 3B. So which one is smaller, 3B or h w? 

Wait, but the problem is a bit ambiguous. It says the molecule is in the fundamental state—so that's the lowest energy. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the first excited state, but whether that's a vibrational or rotational transition depends on their respective energy gaps. But I think the problem is implying that the photon causes a transition to the next state, which could involve either vibration or rotation, but probably the lowest energy photon would be the vibrational one, because typically w is a higher frequency than the rotational transitions. Or wait, maybe I should think about the possible transitions.

Wait, but the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the one with the lowest energy above the current state. So which transition gives the smallest energy increase?

If the molecule is initially in the fundamental state, which is n=0 and J=0, then the next possible states are either n=1, J=0 (vibrational excitation) or n=0, J=1 (rotational excitation), or even n=1, J=1 (both). But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, so I need to compare the energy differences of these possible transitions.

Wait, but the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the first excited state, regardless of whether it's vibrational or rotational. But which transition (vibrational or rotational) requires less energy?

I think the vibrational energy gap is typically larger than the rotational gap. Because the rotational constant B is usually smaller than the vibrational frequency w. Let me think: B is given by ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. I is μ r², μ is the reduced mass. Let's compute B and compare it to (1/2) h w, which is the vibrational energy spacing between n=0 and n=1.

So, let's compute both B and (1/2) h w.

The given data:
Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.
Bond length R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.
Angular frequency w =4e14 rad/s.

First, calculate the reduced mass μ.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40 / 22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ is 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ about 3.015. So μ ≈ 3.015e-27 kg.

Moment of inertia I = μ r² = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.015e-27 *4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg m².

Rotational constant B is ħ²/(2I). ħ is h/(2π), where h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J s. So ħ = 1.05457e-34 J s.

B = ( (1.05457e-34)^2 ) / (2 * 1.206e-46 )

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 *1.206e-46 ≈ 2.412e-46.

So B ≈ 1.112e-68 / 2.412e-46 ≈ approx 4.61e-23 J.

Wait, but energy in terms of J. Now, the energy for rotation transition from J=0 to J=1 would be ΔE_rot = B ( J=1 (J+1) - J=0 (0+1) )= B*(2 - 0) )? Wait, no. The energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1). So ΔE for J=0 to J=1 is E(1) - E(0) = B*(1*2) - B*(0) )= 2B.

So ΔE_rot = 2B. B is 4.61e-23 J, so ΔE_rot = 9.22e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference ΔE_vib = h w (n=1 - n=0) = h w. w is 4e14 rad/s. So h is 6.626e-34 J s.

So ΔE_vib = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Comparing ΔE_rot ≈9e-23 J and ΔE_vib ≈2.65e-19 J. The rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy should match the lower energy transition, which is the rotational one.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state. So the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is n=0 and J=0.

If the photon is absorbed, the molecule can transition either to a higher vibrational state (n=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). The question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy". So the next state would be the one with the smallest possible energy increment. So ΔE_rot is 9.22e-23 J, which is smaller than ΔE_vib which is 2.65e-19 J. So the lower energy transition is the rotational one. So the photon's energy should match the rotational energy gap, 2B.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake in calculating B. Let me recalculate B. Oh wait, B is the rotational constant which is in units of energy? Or wait, no, the rotational constant B is often given in cm^-1, but in terms of energy, it's in Joules. Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, the moment of inertia I is μ r², correct. And B is ħ²/(2 I). Ok, that's right. So I think the calculation was correct.

So in this case, the energy required for the rotational transition is lower. So the photon's energy should correspond to 2B.

Wait, but the question asks about the momentum of the photon. Momentum p of a photon is related to its energy E. E = p c, where c is the speed of light. So p = E/c.

So first, compute the energy needed, which is 2B, and then find p.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute 2B again.

B = ( (ħ)^2 )/(2 I )

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let's recalculate I and B accurately.

Compute μ:

Mx = 20 amu, My=2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 /22 ≈1.81818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg. So 1.81818 *1.6605e-27 ≈ let me compute that.

1.8 *1.6605 ≈ 2.989, so 3.018e-27 kg.

Wait, better precise:

1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 = ?

1.8 *1.6605 = 2.9889, but 0.01818 *1.6605 ≈ 0.03018. So total ≈ 2.9889 + 0.03018 ≈3.019e-27 kg.

r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

I = μ r² = 3.019e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.019e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2076e-46 kg m².

Now ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

B = ħ²/(2I) = ( (1.0545718e-34)^2 ) / (2 *1.2076e-46 )

Compute numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 ≈ 1.112, so 1.112e-68 J² s².

Denominator: 2 *1.2076e-46 =2.4152e-46.

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2.4152e-46) ≈ (1.112 /2.4152) )e-22 ≈ 0.4605e-22 =4.605e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.21e-23 J.

Energy of the photon E_photon = 9.21e-23 J.

Momentum p of photon is E / c, since E = pc. c is 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.21e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, they are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 N s range. Hmm, that's way off. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, 1 N s is equal to 1 kg m/s. So 3.07e-31 kg m/s is 3.07e-31 N s, which is way smaller than any of the options given. The options are in 1e-27 to 1e-28 N s. So I must have made a mistake.

Hmm, perhaps the approach is wrong. Maybe the question is about a vibrational transition, not rotational. Because the rotational momentum would be way too low.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the question is considering a vibrational transition because the rotational transitions are usually in the microwave region, which have lower energy, while vibrational are in IR. But in the options, the photon momenta are around 1e-27 Ns, which is about 1e-27 kg m/s. So E would be pc = (1e-27 kg m/s)(3e8 m/s) )=3e-19 J. Which is about 0.2 eV. Hmm.

Wait, let me recompute B and see if I did it right. Perhaps I made a mistake in calculation of B.

Wait, alternative approach: Maybe the model is the rotation-vibration coupling, so the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational. So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it can change either vibrational or rotational state.

But the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, so that's the lowest possible. The next state could be either the first rotational state or the first vibrational state, whichever requires less energy. So if the rotational transition requires less, then the photon must supply 2B. But why is my calculated 2B giving a much lower energy than the options suggest?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the photon causing both a vibrational and rotational transition. Wait, but that's more complicated. Or maybe it's the transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the next state which is (n=1, J=0), i.e., a vibrational transition.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated the vibrational transition, ΔE_vib was about 2.65e-19 J, which is way higher than the rotational transition's 9e-23 J. So if the molecule is in its fundamental state, the next possible state with the lowest energy would be the first rotational state (J=1), requiring 2B energy, which is 9.21e-23 J.

But the problem is that the photon's momentum from this energy would be 3e-31 N s, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the vibrational transition, which is much higher but matches the options.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is asking about the transition from the fundamental vibrational state (n=0) to the next vibrational state (n=1), but in the same rotational state (J=0). Or perhaps it's considering the fundamental as the combination of both, and the next state as the first excited vibrationally.

Wait, but the options are in the 1e-27 N s range, which is about 1e-27 kg m/s. Let's compute the momentum for the rotational and vibrational transitions.

If the photon's energy is 9.21e-23 J (rotational), then p = E/c = 9.21e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 N s. None of the options match that.

If the energy is 2.65e-19 J (vibrational), then p = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = approx 8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options:

A)1.9e-28

B)2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

Hmm, 8.83e-28 is closest to option A (1.9e-28), but that's about a factor of 4.5 difference. Alternatively, perhaps I did something wrong in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the vibrational energy difference again. E_vib = h w (n=1 - n=0) = h w (1) = 6.626e-34 J s *4e14 rad/s = 2.65e-19 J. So E = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E / c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = (2.65 /3) * 1e-27 = 0.883e-27 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A (1.9e-28) and D (1.4e-28). Neither is a perfect match, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I forgot to account for the zero-point energy. No, because the question is about the transition from n=0 to n=1, which is exactly h w. So that's correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is considering the transition within the rotational levels, but for a diatomic molecule modeled as a non-rigid rotor, which might have different selection rules. But I'm not sure that affects the energy calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the model requires considering both rotational and vibrational transitions, but I think the problem is more straightforward.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the next possible state, which could be J=1 and n=0 (rotational), or n=1 and J=0 (vibrational). But which one has lower energy?

The energy for J=1 transition is 2B, and energy for n=1 is h w. So if 2B < h w, the rotational transition is lower.

Earlier, I found 2B ≈9.21e-23 J, and h w ≈2.65e-19 J. So 2B is much smaller. So the rotational transition requires less energy, so the photon would have E=2B, p=2B/c.

But the calculated p is 3e-31 N s, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition, which would give a p of about 8.8e-28 N s, close to option A (1.9e-28) and D (1.4e-28). But 8.8e-28 is not among the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of B. Let me recalculate B more accurately.

Compute I = μ r².

μ = (20 * 2 )/(20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

μ = 1.81818 *1.66053906660e-27 kg ≈ let's compute.

1.81818 *1.66053906660e-27 ≈ (1.8 *1.660539e-27) + (0.01818 *1.660539e-27).

1.8 *1.660539e-27 = 2.98897e-27.

0.01818 *1.660539e-27 ≈0.03018e-27.

Total μ ≈3.019e-27 kg.

r = 2e-10 m.

I = μ * r^2 = 3.019e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.019e-27 *4e-20 m² = 1.2076e-46 kg m².

Now, ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s.

B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 *1.2076e-46 )

Compute numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 = 1.1120008e-68 J² s².

Denominator: 2 *1.2076e-46 = 2.4152e-46.

So B = 1.1120008e-68 / 2.4152e-46 = approx 4.605e-23 J.

2B = 9.21e-23 J.

So E_photon =9.21e-23 J.

p_photon = E_photon / c = 9.21e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 N s.

But this doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps the approach is wrong. Maybe the question is considering a different transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the next state (n=1, J=0), which is a pure vibrational transition. In that case, the energy would be h w, which is 2.65e-19 J, as before. So p_photon =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28. Those are much smaller than 8.83e-28. Hmm. So none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the reduced mass in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next vibrational state while also moving to a higher rotational state—like a combination. But that complicates things, and the question states "the next state with the lowest possible energy", which would be the one requiring the least energy, which should be the rotational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the photon causing a transition that includes both a vibrational and rotational change, but that's more involved and I don't think the question is that complex.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the energy difference in the rotation-vibration model.

The energy levels for a rotation-vibration model are given by:

E = E_vib + E_rot = (n + 1/2) h w + B J (J+1)

The fundamental state is n=0, J=0. The next possible state with the lowest energy is the one with either n=1, J=0 or J=1, n=0. Which has the lower energy?

Compute E for (n=1, J=0): E = (1 + ½) h w + B(0) = 3/2 h w.

Compute E for (n=0, J=1): E = (0 + ½) h w + B(1)(2) = (½) h w + 2 B.

The next state is the one with the lower E between these two.

So compare 3/2 h w and ½ h w + 2B.

Which one is smaller?

We know h w is 2.65e-19 J, and 2B is 9.21e-23 J.

Compute 3/2 h w = 3.975e-19 J.

Compute ½ h w + 2B = (1.325e-19) + (9.21e-23) ≈1.325e-19 J.

So 1.325e-19 is smaller than 3.975e-19. So the next state is (n=0, J=1), requiring energy 2B.

So the photon's energy is 2B, and p = 2B/c =9.21e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 N s.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the model.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is considering the transition from the fundamental state (n=0, J=0) to the state where both n=1 and J=1. But that would require more energy and wouldn't be the next lowest.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating B. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me compute B accurately.

I = μ r² =3.019e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.019e-27 *4e-20=1.2076e-46 kg m².

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s.

B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 *1.2076e-46 )

Let me compute numerator: 1.0545718e-34 squared.

(1.0545718)^2 = approx 1.112.

So numerator is 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 *1.2076e-46 =2.4152e-46.

So B = 1.112e-68 /2.4152e-46 = approx 4.605e-23 J.

Yes, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the Raman transition, which involves two photon processes, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the model being used is the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator, but even then, the calculations would be similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule transitions from the ground state to the next state, which could be a combination of both vibrational and rotational changes. But that would require more energy.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition, which would be 8.8e-28 N s, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the transition from the fundamental state (n=0, J=0) to the first excited vibrational state (n=1, J=0), which requires energy h w. But let's see:

E_photon = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p_photon = E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, the possible choices are A)1.9e-28, B)2.3e-27, C)1.1e-27, D)1.4e-28.

Hmm, none match exactly. But perhaps the calculation for B is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I have a mistake in the model.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the next state which is the first vibrational state, but in that case, the photon's energy is h w, which is 2.65e-19 J. So p=8.83e-28 Ns, which is not listed. So perhaps the question expects me to calculate based on the rotational transition, but the options don't match.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recompute B with precise values.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

μ = 1.81818 * 1.66053906660e-27 = let's compute:

1.81818 * 1.66053906660 = ?

Let me compute 1.81818 *1.660539.

Breaking it down:

1.8 *1.660539 = 2.989.

0.01818 *1.660539 = let's compute.

0.01 *1.660539 = 0.016605.

0.00818 *1.660539 ≈ approx 0.01361.

So total 0.016605 +0.01361 =0.030215.

So total μ =2.989 +0.030215 =3.019215e-27 kg.

r =2e-10 m.

I =μ * r² =3.019215e-27 *4e-20 =1.207686e-46 kg m².

Now, ħ=1.0545718e-34 J s.

B = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 *1.207686e-46 ) = ?

(1.0545718e-34)^2 =1.1120008e-68.

Denominator: 2 *1.207686e-46 =2.415372e-46.

So B = 1.1120008e-68 / 2.415372e-46 =4.605e-23 J.

So 2B =9.21e-23 J.

Photon energy E_photon=9.21e-23 J.

p_photon = 9.21e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 N s.

This is way smaller than the options given, which are around 1e-27 Ns.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the units for B. Because sometimes B is expressed in cm^-1, which is an energy unit when considering hc.

Wait, B is often given as (h c B) in wavenumbers. But no, the calculation is correct in terms of energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the rotational transition, but the photon's momentum is
