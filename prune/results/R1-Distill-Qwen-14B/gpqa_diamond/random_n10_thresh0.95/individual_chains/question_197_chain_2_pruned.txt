Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about identifying the product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are four different compounds, and I need to figure out which one is the correct product.

First, let's look at the given data: the IR and NMR spectra of Compound X. I'll start by interpreting these to determine the structure of X.

The IR data includes peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But more specifically, the broadness in that region (like a broad singlet) might suggest an O-H group, like in a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, it could be an alcohol or an amine, but the presence of a carbonyl peak might help determine that.

Then there's a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which is common in ketones, aldehydes, or carboxylic acids. Also, 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ might be aromatic C=C stretches, so the compound likely has a benzene ring.

Looking at the ¹H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is typical for an aldehyde proton. But wait, in a carboxylic acid, the -OH proton is usually broad, but that's around 10-12 ppm. Wait, but in this case, 10.5 is a bit lower than typical for a carboxylic acid, which is usually around 12 ppm. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde, which is about 9-10 ppm. Hmm, but the integration is 1H, so maybe it's an aldehyde, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but let me think again. Aldehydes typically have a peak around 9-10 ppm, and the splitting is a singlet because there's no adjacent protons (except maybe in some cases). But a broad peak here is a bit confusing. Carboxylic acids have a broad peak due to hydrogen bonding, but that's usually around 10-12 ppm. So 10.5 could fit either. Hmm.

Next, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). These are typical of para-substituted aromatic protons. So perhaps the benzene ring has two substituents in para positions. The protons at 8.0 would be the more deshielded (like meta to an electron-withdrawing group), while the 7.2 are less deshielded. Or maybe it's a substituent like a carbonyl group.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). These seem to indicate a branched alkyl chain. Let me think about the possible structure.

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a CH₂CH₂CH₃ group, but wait, triplet would be for a CH₂CH₂- something. Alternatively, it could be a methyl group attached to a CH₂. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a bit unusual. Wait, maybe it's a CH(CH2CH2CH3) group? Because a doublet of 3H would mean a methyl adjacent to a CH that has another group. Like, for example, a CH(CH3)2 group. Wait, no, that would be a singlet.

Wait, perhaps it's a secondary structure. Let me think: maybe a propyl group attached in a way that creates some branching. Alternatively, the 1.4 d (3H) could be a methyl group attached to a CH, which is attached to another CH₂. So maybe something like a butyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has a benzene ring with substituents and a side chain. Let's see.

The IR has a strong carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Let me consider what kind of carbonyl that would be. A carboxylic acid usually has a carbonyl around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹, but sometimes a bit higher. Alternatively, an ester or ketone. But the peak at 3400–2500 could also suggest an O-H stretch for a carboxylic acid (if the peak is broad). If it's a carboxylic acid, that would fit with the 10.5 ppm peak.

So, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carboxylic acid group and an alkyl chain.

Wait, the NMR shows a 10.5 ppm peak (maybe the -OH of a carboxylic acid). Then, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, which suggests a para-substituted benzene with an electron-withdrawing group (like a carbonyl). So perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a carbonyl-containing group, like a carboxylic acid.

So, maybe the structure is something like 4-(substituted)benzoic acid.

Wait, let me try to sketch this. The benzene has a substituent in para position. Let's say, a group like -COOH. So the substituent is a carboxylic acid group.

But then, looking at the other NMR signals, there's a CH₂ group (maybe the 2.9 ppm is a CH adjacent to something). Wait, 2.9 is a multiplet for 1H, which suggests perhaps a CH group attached to another CH₂.

Like, perhaps a chain like CH₂CH(CH2CH3) or something similar. Let me think about the integration:

- 10.5: 1H (maybe the -OH)
- 8.0 (2H), 7.2 (2H): aromatic protons, so four aromatic H, which suggests para substitution.
- 2.9 (1H): maybe a CH adjacent to another CH₂.
- 1.7 (2H): perhaps a CH₂ group attached to something.
- 1.4 (3H): a methyl group attached to perhaps a CH.
- 0.9 (3H): a terminal methyl, perhaps from a propyl chain.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to figure out the possible structure.

Assuming the aromatic part is a para-substituted benzene with a substituent R. Then, looking at the NMR:

The aromatic protons are a doublet each, which suggests that each set of protons is next to one substituent. So, for a para-disubstituted benzene, the protons are split into two doublets. So, that makes sense.

The substituent is a group that has a carbonyl. So maybe it's a benzoyl group, but more likely, it's a substituent attached to the ring that includes a carbonyl, like a carboxylic acid.

So, the substituent on the benzene is a -COOH group. Then, the other parts are the alkyl chain.

Looking at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH adjacent to a CH₂. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH₂ adjacent to another CH. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, which is also attached to something else. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a methyl group at the end of an ethyl chain.

Putting this together: perhaps the substituent is a -(CH₂)CH(CH2CH3)COOH group? Wait, not sure.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -(CH2)2CH(CH2CH3)COOH? Or perhaps it's a -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)COOH group attached to the benzene.

Wait, but wait. Let's think again. The substituent on the benzene could be a group like: -CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group attached to the ring, but with a branching.

Wait, the NMR shows a 1.4 d (3H), which would be a methyl group attached to a CH. The 2.9 m (1H) could be that same CH. The 1.7 m (2H) would be a CH2 group attached to that CH. And the 0.9 t (3H) would be a CH2CH2CH3.

So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Wait, but then where is the carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -COOH group attached to a branch. Like, something like -COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, maybe it's a benzene ring with a substituent that is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)COOH group. Let me try to draw this.

The benzene ring has a substituent R, where R is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH.

So, the structure would be: the benzene ring has a group that is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)COOH. Then, the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene via a methylene group, and then a branching to a methyl and a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR. The 10.5 ppm would be the -OH of the carboxylic acid. The aromatic protons are para to this substituent, which would cause them to be deshielded. The substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH group.

Wait, but the substituent would be attached to the benzene. So the structure would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a longer chain. Let me think about the NMR signals for that structure.

The -COOH would give the broad peak at 10.5 ppm.

The aromatic protons would be two doublets, as they're para to the substituent (so, substituent is in position 4, and the adjacent H would be in positions 2 and 6, and the next ones in 3 and 5, but that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, the substituent is in position 1, and the para position is position 4, but benzene is symmetric, so the substituent's position doesn't matter as much for the NMR as the substitution pattern.

The substituent chain is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH.

So, the CH2 would have protons adjacent to the benzene. The CH would have two adjacent CH2 groups (one from the benzene, and one leading to the CH(CH2CH3)). So the CH group would have a triplet or something else. But in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet of 1H, which could be the CH group.

Then, the CH2 attached to the benzene would have two protons, maybe as a quartet or triplet. But in the NMR, we see a 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) which could be the CH2 next to the CH.

The CH(CH2CH3) would have a methyl group attached, which is the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and the CH2CH3 would be the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

Wait, that makes sense. So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH attached to the benzene.

So the structure is benzene with a substituent at the para position, which is a -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)COOH group.

Wait, but let me double-check the NMR:

The benzene would have two sets of doublets: the protons ortho to the substituent would be more deshielded, maybe at 8.0 ppm, and the meta protons at 7.2 ppm. That fits with the NMR data.

The substituent: the -COOH gives the 10.5 ppm peak.

The CH2 attached to benzene: two protons at 1.7 ppm, which would be a triplet or quartet, but in the data, it's a multiplet. Hmm, maybe because it's next to a CH.

The CH group would have one proton at 2.9 ppm, and its attached CH2 would have two protons at 1.7 ppm. The CH(CH2CH3) has a methyl group at 1.4 ppm as a doublet, and the CH2CH3 has 0.9 ppm as a triplet.

So that structure seems to fit. So Compound X is 4-(3-methylbutanoyl)benzoic acid? Wait, maybe I should draw this.

Wait, another approach: the substituent could be a propanoic acid with some branching.

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group attached to the benzene with some branching. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)COOH group attached to the benzene.

So, overall, Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative with a substituent that has a branching.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. What does that reaction do?

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrohalogenation of alkenes. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, red phosphorus is used to convert carbonyl groups to alkanes in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that's with amines and heat.

Wait, another reaction: when a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) is treated with HX (like HI) in the presence of a reducing agent, perhaps it's a reduction. But red phosphorus and HI is a reagent for the hydroboration-oxidation? No, that's with BH3.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI might be part of the Clemmensen reduction, but that usually uses Zn(Hg)/HCl. Alternatively, red phosphorus with HI can be used to reduce carbonyl groups. Wait, I think that the reaction of a ketone with red phosphorus and HI would result in the formation of a secondary alcohol. Or wait, another possibility: the reduction of nitriles, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's a hydrohalogenation. No, wait. Let me think again: the presence of a carbonyl group in the starting compound. If X has a carbonyl group, then treating with red phosphorus and HI might reduce it.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recall. The reaction of a carbonyl with red phosphorus and HI is a known method for the formation of alkanes. For example, in the presence of a primary amine, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI can perform a substitution on certain groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's a way to reduce the carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) to an alcohol. Wait, but usually, that's done with something like NaBH4 or LiAlH4. Alternatively, hydroiodic acid can be a strong enough agent to protonate the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of the Arndt-Eistert reaction, but that's for carboxylic acids.

Wait, another angle: the starting compound has a carboxylic acid group. When treated with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the acid is converted into an alkane.

Wait, compound X is a carboxylic acid. Let me think, when a carboxylic acid is treated with HI and red phosphorus, what happens? I'm not exactly sure, but I remember that in some reactions, the carboxylic acid can be converted into an alkane. Or maybe it's a reduction.

Wait, but if you have a benzoic acid and you treat it with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the COOH group is converted into CH2-I. But that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl is reduced.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reactivity. Red phosphorus and HI are known to reduce carbonyl groups to CH₂ groups. Let's say that the carbonyl in X is a ketone. Then, upon treatment with HI and red phosphorus, the ketone would be reduced to an alcohol, but perhaps in this case, to an alkane.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, so let me think:

If X has a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid), and we treat it with HI and red phosphorus, what would happen?

Another possibility: the reaction is an acid-catalyzed hydration or something else, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. If the carbonyl is part of an ester or amide, but in our case, X is a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is converting the carboxylic acid into an alkane. Let me imagine that. The COOH group is converted into CH2. But how?

Wait, I think another approach is needed. Let me look at the options provided.

Options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, some are benzoic acids (A, C) and others are substituted benzene rings (B, D). So, the reaction must be converting the carbonyl group into something else.

If X is a benzoic acid derivative, the reaction might be a deoxygenation, removing the carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be a substitution of the hydroxyl group in the carboxylic acid. But that's not likely with HI and red phosphorus.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is converting the carboxylic acid into an iodide. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benz
