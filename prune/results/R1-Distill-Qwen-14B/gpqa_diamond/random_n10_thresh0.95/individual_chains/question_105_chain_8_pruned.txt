Okay, so I've got this question about stars with dark spots and how they affect the brightness measurements, and how that's similar to an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. Hmm. Let me try to break this down.

Alright, the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. So R_star is like 1 solar radius, right? The star has dark spots covering one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. Oh wait, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So if the star is a sphere, the surface area is 4πR². But since it's only one hemisphere, the area is 2πR². The filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere, so the spot area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². Wait, no, wait. Filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. Oh wait, no, the question says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area of the spots would be 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere. The hemisphere's area is 2πR², so spots cover 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². Right.

The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K. The spots are cooler, I think. Oh, the temperature difference is 1000 K. So if the star's Teff is 6000 K, then the spots are either 5000 K or 7000 K. Wait, spots are cooler, so 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K. So spots are at 5000 K.

The question is about photometric time-series observations. They show brightness variations due to rotation. So as the star spins, the spots come into and out of view. But because it's only one hemisphere with spots, the brightness variation would be periodic as the spots rotate into and out of the observed hemisphere. Wait, but if the star rotates, the spots would be on one side, then come into view, then go away. So the brightness would dip when a spot is facing us, but since it's a hemisphere, maybe it's a larger dip when the spot is visible.

But the situation resembles
