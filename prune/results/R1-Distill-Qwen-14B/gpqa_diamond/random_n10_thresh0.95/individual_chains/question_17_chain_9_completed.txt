Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution when it's in a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions like Ca²+.

The given data is 0.02 M concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex. The K for the complex is 5x10^10. Oh wait, K here is the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- (or something like that), right?

Wait, but the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So I think that means the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Since it's stochiometric, I suppose all the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex because the stoichiometry is 1:1. So the initial assumption might be that [Ca²+] is much less than 0.02 M, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The formation constant, K, is given by K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, if the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA²-, then that's the concentration of the complex. So the total concentration of EDTA and calcium in the solution is... Hmm.

Wait, but the EDTA is in the form of the complex. So the solution is made by adding Ca²+ and EDTA, which form the complex. But in this case, it's given that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So does that mean that all the Ca²+ and EDTA are consumed into the complex? Or is there excess?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's clarify. The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. I think that means the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. And since it's stochiometric, I guess the amount of Ca²+ and EDTA originally added are just enough to form the complex, with no excess. Or maybe there's no excess, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should model it.

So the reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-

The formation constant K is given as 5e10. Let's denote [CaEDTA²-] as 0.02 M. So, K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, if all the Ca²+ and EDTA are in the complex, then [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] would be zero, which can't be right because K is a large number but they wouldn't be zero. So perhaps there's a small amount of dissociation.

Ah, right, even if the complex is formed, a small amount can dissociate. So the concentration of Ca²+ is equal to the concentration of EDTA^4- because the reaction is 1:1. So, let me set up the variables.

Let’s let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions dissociated from the complex. Then, [Ca²+] = x, and [EDTA^4-] = x. The concentration of the complex [CaEDTA²-] is approximately 0.02 - x. But since K is very large, 5e10, the dissociation x will be very small compared to 0.02. So we can approximate [CaEDTA²-] ≈ 0.02.

So the equation becomes K ≈ (0.02)/(x * x) => x² = 0.02 / K.

Wait wait, K is 5e10. So x² = 0.02 / 5e10 = 2e-3 / 5e10 = 4e-13. Taking square root, x≈ 2e-6.5, wait wait, let me compute that correctly.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-6 squared is 1e-12. So 2e-6 squared is 4e-12. Wait, that's not matching 4e-13. Hmm, maybe I messed up the exponents.

Wait, let me compute 0.02 / 5e10. 0.02 is 2e-2. 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12, which is 0.4e-12, which is 4e-13. So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 would be about 6.32e-7. Oh wait, wait! 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. So 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the concentration of Ca²+.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't flip anything. Because the K is the formation constant, so the equation is correct. And since K is large, the dissociation is minimal, so the approximation is valid. So yeah, the calculation should be correct.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

Given that the concentration of the complex \([ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ]\) is 0.02 M, we assume the dissociation of the complex into \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) is minimal due to the large \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \). Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions dissociated from the complex. Since the stoichiometry is 1:1, \([ \text{EDTA}^{4-} ] = x\) as well. The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ]}{[ \text{Ca}^{2+} ][ \text{EDTA}^{4-} ]}
\]

Substituting \([ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\) and \([ \text{Ca}^{2+} ] = [ \text{EDTA}^{4-} ] = x\), we get:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which matches option C.

Answer: C
