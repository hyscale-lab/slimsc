Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow because I'm just starting to learn this stuff.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. The nucleus in question is X, which is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium. So, lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it's Li with 3 neutrons, that makes the isotope Li-6 because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So, the nucleus is Li-6, which I think is carbon? Wait, no, carbon is 6 protons. Oh wait, Li is 3 protons, so 3 + 3 neutrons is lithium-6.

Wait, no, the nucleus would be Li-6. So, the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus has a mass number of 6. So when they say nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons, its mass is the mass of Li-6.

The problem is to find the energy of the RHIC so that the speed v is 0.96c. So, I think I need to calculate the relativistic energy of this nucleus.

So, the energy in relativity is given by the total energy formula: E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But wait, the question gives the speed as 0.96c. So I can compute gamma first.

Let me compute gamma. So, v = 0.96c. Let me compute v squared over c squared: (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Take the square root of that, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me check: 0.28 times 3.5714. 0.28 * 3 is 0.84, 0.28 * 0.5714 is about 0.16 (since 0.28 * 0.5 is 0.14, and 0.28 * 0.0714 is about 0.02, so total 0.16). So 0.84 + 0.16 is 1. So yes, 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

So gamma is 3.5714 approximately. But wait, maybe it's better to compute more accurately. Let me compute 0.96 squared exactly. 0.96 * 0.96: 96*96 is 9216, so 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784. Hmm, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, so square root is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857... So approximately 3.5714.

But wait, sometimes it's better to keep more decimal places for accurate calculations. Let me see: 3.57142857. So maybe 3.5714 is sufficient for now.

Now, I need the rest mass of the nucleus, which is Li-6. The mass of a nucleus can be approximated using the mass of the individual nucleons. Each nucleon (pro
