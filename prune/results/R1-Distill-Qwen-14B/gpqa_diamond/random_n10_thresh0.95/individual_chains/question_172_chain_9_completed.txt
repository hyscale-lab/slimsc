Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Also, the energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. They’re asking which equation correctly relates the effective temperatures T1 and T2, assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar atmospheres, but I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. Right, the Boltzmann distribution equation. So the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by something like (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(kT) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference is E2 - E1 = ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. But wait, the question says star_1's atoms are twice as excited as those in star_2. So for star 1, the population in the higher energy level is twice that of star 2's in the same level. Or wait, no, maybe I should think about the ratio of the excited state to the ground state, or something like that.

Wait, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the ground state for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Let me get this straight. Let's denote n1 as the population of excited state in star_1, and n2 as in star_2. Then, the ratio (n1_star1)/(n1_star2) = 2. Or maybe the ratio (n_excited)/(n_ground) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Hmm.

But wait, the Boltzmann equation is (n2 / n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where n2 is the higher energy level. Oh wait, wait. Let me think again. The ratio n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE is E_upper - E_lower.

So in this case, say for star 1, the ratio is n1_upper / n1_lower = (g1_upper / g1_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ). Similarly for star 2, it's n2_upper / n2_lower = (g2_upper / g2_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

But the problem doesn't mention anything about the statistical weights, g, for star 1 and 2. So I think we can assume that the statistical weights are the same for both stars. Because they're both iron atoms, same element, same energy levels. So g1_upper/g1_lower = g2_upper/g2_lower. Let's call this term 'g' for simplicity. So the ratio for star 1 is g * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star 2, it's g * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

The problem states that for star_1, the excited atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Wait, actually, no, the problem says that the iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So does that mean that the ratio n_upper/n_lower is twice as much for star_1 compared to star_2?

Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. It says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the population in the excited state is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2. So for star_1, n_upper1 / n_lower1 = 2 * (n_upper2 / n_lower2 )

But wait, no. Wait, the problem says "twice as excited", which I think refers to the ratio of the populations. So if star_1's ratio is twice that of star_2, then (n_upper1/n_lower1) = 2 * (n_upper2/n_lower2 ).

But given that both stars have the same g factor (since it's the same element and energy levels), the ratio between the two stars would be:

(n_upper1/n_lower1)/(n_upper2/n_lower2) )= exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let me compute that ratio:

(n1_upper/n1_lower) / (n2_upper/n2_lower) ) = [g exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [g exp(-ΔE/(k T2)))] 

The g's cancel out, so it's exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, because:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) / exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Which is the same as exp( ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) )

Wait, let me compute that denominator:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the exponent is (ΔE/(k )) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the ratio (n1_upper/n1_lower)/(n2_upper/n2_lower) ) = exp( (ΔE (T1 - T2)) / (k T1 T2) )

But according to the problem, this ratio is 2. Because star_1's ratio is twice that of star_2's. So:

2 = exp( (ΔE (T1 - T2)) / (k T1 T2) )

Take natural log of both sides:

ln(2) = (ΔE (T1 - T2)) / (k T1 T2 )

But wait, wait. Let me double-check. The ratio is (n1_upper/n1_lower) / (n2_upper/n2_lower) ) = 2.

But earlier I called that ratio as 2, which equals the exponential term.

So, ln(2) = [ (ΔE (T1 - T2)) ] / (k T1 T2 )

Hmm, but in the options, I don't see any with ΔE in them. Oh wait, the given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, but perhaps k is known, and maybe it's a constant that can be canceled out.

Wait, but the question is about the equation relating T1 and T2, so the options are just expressions in terms of T1 and T2, without constants. So perhaps the equation can be rearranged to the form ln(2) equals some expression involving (T1-T2)/(T1 T2), maybe multiplied by ΔE/(k), but that's a constant.

Wait, but the problem includes the energy difference, but the options don't have any ΔE or k in them. So perhaps the equation can be written as ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But looking at the options, I need to see which one matches this structure.

Looking at the options, option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), but without the ΔE/k factor. So perhaps in this problem, ΔE/(k) is a constant, but the options don't show that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simplified, perhaps ΔE is such that ΔE/k = 1, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the ratio. Let me think again.

The problem states that "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2."

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding this. Maybe the excitation refers to the population in the higher energy level being twice as many in star_1 as in star_2.

So for the same energy level, n_upper in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But wait, no, that's not necessarily correct, because the total number of iron atoms would be different in each star as well. Or perhaps the ratio is for the same ion, same level, so the ratio for the same transition.

Wait, perhaps the way to model this is that the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the ground state for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So (n_upper1 / n_lower1) = 2 * (n_upper2 / n_lower2 )

Which brings us back to the same equation.

So then, as before:

ln(2) = [ (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2) ) ] / (T1 T2 )

But the options given are:

A) ln(2) = T2/T1

B) ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2)

C) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)^2

D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So in the equation I derived, ln(2) is proportional to (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ), but it's multiplied by (ΔE/(k)). But the options don't include any constants.

So perhaps the question assumes that (ΔE)/(k) is 1, which would make the equation ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which matches option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the Boltzmann factor in another way. Let me consider the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) for each star.

So, for star 1: n1_upper /n1_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1) )

For star 2: n2_upper /n2_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2) )

The problem says that n1_upper/n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower )

So,

(g exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) = 2 * (g exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) )

Cancel g,

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k T2)):

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = 2

Which is the same as exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2.

Taking ln of both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Which is:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2 )

So,

(ΔE/(k)) (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

But the options don't have ΔE or k, so perhaps the given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, but we can see what k is. Boltzmann's constant k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Wait, wait, wait! That's interesting. Because the given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k (Boltzmann's constant) at T=1 K. Because k = 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So, ΔE = k * 1 K.

So substituting back into the equation:

( (k * 1 K) ) / (k) ) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

Simplify (k cancels):

(1) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Which gives:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 )

So that's exactly option D.

So the correct equation is option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann distribution is used to describe the ratio of populations in two energy levels, given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_{\text{upper}} \) and \( g_{\text{lower}} \) are the statistical weights, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

For star 1 and star 2, the ratios of excited to ground state populations are:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = g \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}} = g \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right),
\]

where \( g \) is the same for both stars since they involve the same energy levels of iron atoms. The problem states that the excitation in star 1 is twice that of star 2, so:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions:

\[
g \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \cdot g \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Canceling \( g \) and dividing through:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Dividing both sides by \( \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right) \):

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Simplifying the temperature terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Additionally, the given \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) is exactly equal to \( k \) (Boltzmann's constant), so the equation simplifies correctly without additional constants.
