Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, right, parallax is a measure of distance in astronomy. I remember that the parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if something is farther away, its parallax is smaller. Like, plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs.

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So the number N of stars is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/plx^5.

But I need to relate this to distance. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So plx = 1/d. Let's substitute that into the equation.

So N is proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that exponent. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5. So 1 divided by (1/d^5) is d^5. Because 1/(1/d^5) equals d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but wait a minute. Parallax is in arcseconds, right? And when you have a distance d in parsecs, plx = 1/d. So yeah, that substitution makes sense.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So like, for each small increase in r (distance), how does the number of stars change? Or, more accurately, the differential number of stars per unit distance. Hmm, I need to think about that.

I think I need to find the number of stars per unit volume, or per some range, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, maybe I should model it mathematically.

Let me think of N as the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr. The volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πd² dr. So the number of stars in that shell is proportional to the volume, and perhaps some other factors like density.

Wait, but the question says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So maybe it's an average over a range, or perhaps the number per unit volume.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars is given by N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is some constant. Since plx is 1/d, N = k * d^5.

But wait, if N is the number of stars, then the number per unit distance would be dN/dr. So the derivative of N with respect to d. So let's compute that.

dN/dr = d(k d^5)/dr = 5k d^4.

Hmm, so the number of stars per unit distance (like the density) is proportional to d^4. But the question says, how does the number of stars change with distance, per unit range of distance. So maybe the number of stars in a thin shell (dN) is proportional to d^5, because N ∝ d^5, and dN is the change in N with dr. Wait, no, if N = k d^5, then dN = 5k d^4 dr. So the number of stars per unit distance (dr) is 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance would increase with d^4. 

Wait, but the options are in terms of r, not d. Oh, but I think in this context, r and d are the same, just variables for distance. So the number of stars per unit distance (per r) would go as r^4, because 5k r^4 dr. So the number of stars in a unit distance (per r) is proportional to r^4. So the answer would be option C, ~ r^4.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So if N varies as r^5, then the number per unit range (dr) would be dN/dr = 5 r^4. So the number of stars in each unit distance (per r) is proportional to r^4.

So looking back at the options:

A) r^3

B) r^5

C) r^4

D) r^2

So the answer should be C) ~ r^4.

Wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have N proportional to d^5, the number per unit volume (number per cubic parsec) might be what's relevant. Or perhaps the number in a given volume depends on d^something. Wait, maybe I should model it more accurately.

Let me think again. The number of stars in a region is given by N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Plx is 1/d, so N ∝ d^5.

But when you're looking at how many stars are in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr, the number would be (number per volume) multiplied by the volume of the shell. The volume of the shell is 4π d² dr. So N_shell = (number per volume) * 4π d² dr.

But if the number per volume is constant, then N_shell ∝ d² dr. But in the problem, it's given that the number varies as 1/plx^5. So perhaps the number per volume is proportional to d^5. That would make sense if the total number in a region is N ∝ d^5.

Wait, perhaps the number density (stars per cubic parsec) is varying with distance. Wait, number density n is N divided by volume. So if the total number N in volume V is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, which is d^5, then n = N/V = (k d^5) / ( (4/3 π R^3) ) ), assuming a sphere of radius R. But that complicates things, and the question doesn't give R.

Alternatively, maybe the number of stars is given per unit volume as being proportional to 1/(plx)^5, so n ∝ d^5. Because plx = 1/d, so 1/plx^5 = d^5. So n = number per volume = d^5.

But then, the number of stars in a thin shell of radius d and thickness dr would be n * 4π d² dr. So N_shell = (d^5) * 4π d² dr = 4π 4π d^7 dr. That seems a bit off, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial statement is that the number of stars in the region varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So if the region is a certain volume, then N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, N ∝ d^5. So as d increases, N increases as the fifth power.

But the question is about how the number changes per unit distance. So it's the derivative of N with respect to d. So dN/dd = 5 d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4, which is option C.

So the correct answer should be C) ~ r^4.


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), where \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), we can substitute \( \text{plx} \) into the equation to express \( N \) in terms of \( d \). Substituting \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), we find:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{d}\right)^5} = d^5
\]

This means the total number of stars \( N \) increases as \( d^5 \) with distance. To determine how the number of stars changes per unit distance, we compute the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \):

\[
\frac{dN}{dd} \propto 5d^4
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance (i.e., the rate of change of \( N \) with \( d \)) is proportional to \( d^4 \). Since the question asks for the relationship in terms of \( r \) (distance), the result remains the same, and the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).

Analyzing the options:

- **A) \( \sim r^3 \):** Incorrect, as the proportionality is \( r^4 \), not \( r^3 \).
- **B) \( \sim r^5 \):** Incorrect, as \( r^5 \) represents the total number of stars, not the number per unit distance.
- **C) \( \sim r^4 \):** Correct, as shown by the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dd} \propto r^4 \).
- **D) \( \sim r^2 \):** Incorrect, as the proportionality is \( r^4 \), not \( r^2 \).

Therefore, the correct answer is **C) \( \sim r^4 \)**.
