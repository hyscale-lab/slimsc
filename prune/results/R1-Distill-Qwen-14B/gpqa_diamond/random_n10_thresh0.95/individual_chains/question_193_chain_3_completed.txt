Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as 1 divided by parallax to the fifth power. So, like N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is, how does the number of stars change with distance per unit range of distance, r? The options are A to D, involving different powers of r.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. Or wait, let me think: the formula is distance (d) in parsecs is equal to 1 divided by the parallax (plx) in arcseconds. So d = 1/plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

So if the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/d, then substituting, N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that. 1/(1/d)^5 is equal to d^5. So N ∝ d^5. Wait, does that mean that the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance? But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that part.

Wait, maybe I should think about this in terms of differential number of stars. Like, how many stars are there between distance r and r + dr? So the number in a thin shell at distance r would be a function of r. Because the total number up to a distance d is the integral, but the question is per unit range, so probably it's about the differential.

Wait, the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, N ∝ d^5. So if d increases, N increases as the fifth power. But wait, the number of stars per unit volume, or per unit distance? Or is it the number of stars in a region as a function of distance.

Wait, maybe the initial statement says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So for a given region, perhaps the number of stars per unit volume (or per unit solid angle and distance) is given. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, let's think of it as the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d. So the number of stars per unit distance (like per parsec) would be N ∝ d^5. But wait, that doesn't sound right because as you go further, the number per unit distance would increase, which may not make sense since the universe isn't infinitely filled with stars. Wait, but maybe in this specific region, the density is such that the number increases with distance.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me take it step by step.

Given N ∝ 1/plx^5. Parallax plx is 1/d, so plx = 1/d. So 1/plx = d. Therefore, 1/plx^5 = d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

So the number of stars is proportional to d^5. So if I plot N against d, it's d^5. But the question is about how N changes with distance per unit range. Hmm. Wait, maybe the question is about the number of stars per unit volume, but more likely, it's the number of stars in a region as a function of distance.

Wait, another approach: the number of stars as a function of parallax is given. But parallax relates to distance. So to find how N changes with distance, we can express N in terms of d.

Given N = k / plx^5, where k is a constant. Since plx = 1/d, substitution gives N = k * (d)^5.

So N increases with d^5. So the number of stars per unit distance (like per parsec) would be proportional to d^4. Wait, because if you have N = k d^5, then the differential dN/dr would be 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (the rate of change) is proportional to d^4. But the question is asking per unit range of distance. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing it.

Wait the question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So maybe it's looking for the number of stars as a function of distance, so the density of stars as a function of r.

Wait, let me think in terms of differential number. The number of stars in a shell between r and r + dr would be N(r) dr = (something) * dr.

Wait, I think I'm getting tangled. Let me approach this differently. Since N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx = 1/d, then N ∝ d^5.

So as d increases, the number of stars increases as d^5. But wait, that's counterintuitive because if you go further away, there are fewer stars in a given volume, but maybe in this specific case, the density of stars is increasing so much that N increases with d^5. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the relation between the number of stars and distance. Since d = 1/plx, 1/plx^5 is d^5. So the number N is proportional to d^5.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit distance, like how many stars are there between r and r+dr. So perhaps the number of stars in a thin shell is proportional to N(r) dr = [d^5] dr. Wait, that would mean that the number of stars in that shell is proportional to d^5 dr. So the number per unit distance is d^5, which is proportional to r^5. So the number of stars per unit distance is increasing with r^5.

But wait, the options don't have r^5. Wait, option B is r^5. So according to this, the answer would be B.

Wait, but that's not matching with my initial thought. Because as you go further, each shell would have more stars than the previous. But in reality, stars are not infinitely dense at larger distances. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased differently. It says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So for a given parallax, N is 1/plx^5. But parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so that N is proportional to d^5. So if you have a larger distance, the number of stars increases, which is what the relation suggests.

But the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So perhaps we are to find dN/dr, which is the derivative of N with respect to r.

So N = k (d)^5, so dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the rate of change is proportional to d^4. So the number of stars increases with the fourth power of the distance. So the number per unit distance is proportional to r^4. So looking at the options, option C is r^4.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting conclusions. Earlier I thought the answer was B, but now I'm thinking it's C.

Wait, what's the exact wording of the question? It says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So it's about the number per unit range, which is the rate of change of N with r. So dN/dr.

So N ∝ d^5. Then, dN/dr is 5d^4. So the number per unit distance is proportional to r^4. So option C.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. The initial relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. But wait, if N is the number of stars in a region, perhaps the region's volume increases with distance. Or perhaps the number of stars in a fixed solid angle.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering a fixed solid angle. So the number of stars in a certain direction (fixed solid angle) as a function of distance is given. So the number counts as a function of distance.

In that case, the number of stars per unit volume would be a function. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let's think: the number of stars in a given solid angle (say, a magnitude's worth) is given. So that N = k / plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, N = k d^5.

But if we consider a thin shell at distance d, with thickness dr, then the volume of that shell is approximately 4π (d)^2 * dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be N_shell = (number density) * volume.

But wait, the number density might come into play here. So if N is proportional to d^5, perhaps the number density is varying.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it from another angle.

The number of stars (N) is proportional to 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, N = k d^5. So N increases as d^5. So as the distance increases, the number of stars in that region increases with the fifth power.

But the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range. So if I have a distance r, the number of stars in a region at that distance is proportional to r^5. But if I want to know how N changes as r increases by a small amount, that's the derivative dN/dr, which is 5 r^4.

So the number of stars per unit range (the rate of change) is proportional to r^4, which is option C.

So the correct answer would be C: ~ r^4.


To determine how the number of stars in a specific region of the sky changes with distance (per unit range of distance, \( r \)), we start with the given relationship: the number of stars \( N \) varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), such that \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting this into the relationship gives:

\[
N \propto d^5
\]

This indicates that the total number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. However, the question asks specifically about the rate of change of the number of stars per unit range of distance, which corresponds to the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto d^5 \), we find:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5d^4
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance (the rate of change) is proportional to \( r^4 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
