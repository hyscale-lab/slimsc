Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the problem again.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (which is the x-axis). The wave function of each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. So the wave function ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Interesting. And when measuring the position, none of the particles were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3.

The question is asking for the value of 'a'. The options are A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

Hmm. So I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So to find the probability of a particle being in a certain region, we integrate the square of the absolute value of the wave function over that region. Since all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3, the integral of |ψ(x)|² from 1 to 3 should be equal to 1 (as it's a normalized wave function).

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function given has an imaginary component, right? It's (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So ψ(x) = A - iB, where A is a/sqrt(1+x) and B is 0.5. The absolute square of ψ is then (A)^2 + (B)^2 because when you compute |ψ|², which is ψ*ψ, for a complex number, it's (A - iB)(A + iB) = A² + B².

So |ψ(x)|² = [ (a²)/(1+x) ) ] + (0.5)^2.

But wait, that's not exactly right. Let me compute it. ψ is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ* would be (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. Multiplying them: [a²/(1+x)] + i*(0.5 a / sqrt(1+x)) - i*(0.5 a / sqrt(1+x)) + (0.5)^2. The cross terms cancel out because i* -i* is zero. So |ψ|² is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.25).

Wait, that's a bit complicated. So the probability density is (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25.

But wait, that's the probability density. We need to integrate this from x=1 to x=3 and set it equal to 1 because the total probability must be 1.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me break that into two parts. First, the integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus the integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3, equals 1.

The integral of a²/(1+x) dx is a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to3. So that's a²*(ln(4) - ln(2)) )= a² ln(2).

The integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3 is 0.25*(3-1)=0.5.

So putting it all together: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Wait, because the total must be 1. So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2). Let me calculate that value.

Wait, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 divided by 0.6931 is approximately 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² = ~0.7213. Then a is the square root of that. Let me compute sqrt(0.7213). Sqrt(0.72) is about 0.8485. So approximately 0.85. Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my approach. Because the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Are we considering this as a valid wave function? Because wave functions must satisfy the normalization condition, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: the given wave function has a real part and an imaginary part. The modulus squared would be [ (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 ], right? Because when you take the complex conjugate, the imaginary part's sign flips, so when you multiply ψ* and ψ, the cross terms cancel, leaving the sum of squares.

Yes, that's correct. So the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral is as I calculated before. So a² must be 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213. a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. So
