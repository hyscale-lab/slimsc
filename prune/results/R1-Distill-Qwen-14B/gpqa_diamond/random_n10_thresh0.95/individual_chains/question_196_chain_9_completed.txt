Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, let me try to remember what I know about this. The question is about finding the maximum speed of a particle in a 1-dimensional harmonic oscillator under relativistic conditions. 

I recall that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the maximum speed v_max is sqrt(kA²/m), right? But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. But here we're in the relativistic scenario, so that formula must not be the correct answer. Looking at the options, option C is that formula, so I can probably rule that out.

Relativity comes into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. The problem gives c as the speed of light, so we must consider relativistic effects. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx², but in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore because of the gamma factor.

Wait, the force is F = -kx, which is the same as in classical Hooke's law. But when considering relativity, the equations of motion change a bit. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact form of the equations in relativistic cases. Let me think... Oh right, the relativistic harmonic oscillator equation might involve terms with gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

In the relativistic scenario, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by m c². The potential energy U is (1/2)k x² in the non-relativistic case, but I'm not entirely sure how it's treated here. Wait, wait. Maybe the approach is to consider energy conservation. At maximum speed, the potential energy is zero (since the oscillator is at the equilibrium point x=0, right?), so all energy is kinetic.

Wait no, wait. In a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is maximum when displacement is maximum, which is at x = A. So the maximum speed occurs when the oscillator passes through x = 0, where all the energy is kinetic. So in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when the potential energy is zero, and all the energy is kinetic. But wait, in the relativistic case, does that still hold?

Wait, maybe I should think about the energy. The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of kinetic and potential. But in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)k x². But wait, when I'm at maximum displacement x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic energy is zero. As the oscillator moves towards x=0, the potential energy decreases and the kinetic increases. In the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy at x=0 would be (1/2)k A², leading to v_max = sqrt( (k A²)/(m) ), but that's the non-relativistic case.

But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't just (gamma - 1) m c². Wait, because in relativity, the kinetic energy K is (gamma - 1) m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy E is gamma m c², which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. 

So, the total mechanical energy in the system, which is conserved, should be the sum of the rest mass energy plus the potential energy. Wait, no, because in relativity, the mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) isn't the same as the total energy. Or is it? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

In the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy E is (1/2)k A². Because at x=A, all energy is potential, and kinetic is zero. So E = (1/2)k A². Then, when the oscillator is at x=0, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v_max² = E = (1/2)k A², hence v_max is sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C.

But in the relativistic case, the dynamics are different. The potential energy is still (1/2)k x², but the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c². So when the oscillator is at x=0, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c², and the potential energy is zero (since x=0). But wait, the potential energy at x=A is (1/2)k A². So the total energy E is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement.

Wait, that makes sense. So E = gamma_rest m c² + (1/2)k A². But wait, no. Let me think again. At x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy is (1/2)k A². But in relativity, the total energy would include the rest mass energy and the potential energy. So E = m c² + (1/2)k A². Or wait, maybe E is just the potential energy plus the relativistic kinetic energy when moving.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator. I remember that the equation involves terms with velocity and acceleration, but I don't remember exactly. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can use energy conservation. At the point of maximum displacement, x = A, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy is the potential energy plus the rest energy? Or is the potential energy part of the total energy?

Wait, in classical mechanics, the total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. But in relativity, the total energy includes the rest mass energy and any other forms of energy. So perhaps in this case, the total energy E is equal to the rest mass energy plus the potential energy at maximum displacement. So E = m c² + (1/2)k A². 

Then, when the oscillator is at x=0, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is E - m c² = (1/2)k A². But wait, that's the same as the non-relativistic case. That can't be right because in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c², which is much larger when the speed is a significant fraction of c.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Maybe the potential energy is not (1/2)k x² in the relativistic case. I think that for a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential is still (1/2)k x², but the equation of motion is different. So perhaps the total energy is (1/2)k A², just like in the classical case, but that can't be because relativistic kinetic energy is different.

Wait, perhaps the total mechanical energy is conserved, so the sum of kinetic and potential energy is constant. So when x=A, kinetic is zero, potential is (1/2)k A². When x=0, potential is zero, kinetic is (gamma -1) m c². So the sum is (gamma -1) m c² = (1/2)k A². But that would give gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). 

So gamma = 1 + [k A²/(2 m c^2)]. Hmm, then gamma is greater than 1, so 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let me square both sides. 1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]².

Wait, but that would make 1 - v²/c² = 1/[1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]². Hmm, let me rearrange this.

Wait, v²/c² = 1 - [1 / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))² ]^{-1}?

Wait, maybe I should write it as:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [ gamma ]², where gamma comes from the kinetic energy equation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The equation I have is (gamma - 1) m c² = (1/2) k A².

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then gamma is 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). Gamma is equal to 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me square both sides to get rid of the square root:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A²/(2 m c²))]^2.

Then, 1 - v²/c² = 1/[ 1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )]^2.

Wait, that would give v^2/c^2 = 1 - [1 / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2)))^2 ].

So v_max^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2)))^2 ].

Hmm, looking at the options, let's see option D is v_max= c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2)))^2 ).

Wait, wait, but option D is written as sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + ... )^2 ), so yes, that would match.

But wait, let me compute that expression.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me think about the denominator.

Wait, let me compute v² = c² [1 - 1/(1 + a)^2], where a is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So 1/(1 + a)^2 = 1/(1 + 2a + a²) ≈, but perhaps it's better to leave it as is.

So v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2)))^2 ] )

Which can be rewritten as v_max = c * sqrt( [ (1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2)))^2 - 1 ] / (1 + k A^2/(2 m c^2))^2 )

Wait, numerator inside sqrt: (1 + x)^2 -1= 2x + x², where x is (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

So sqrt( (2x + x²)/(1 + x)^2 ) ) = sqrt( (2x + x²) ) / (1 + x).

But maybe I should just leave it as is. So the expression from earlier is v_max = c * sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2)))^2] )

Looking at the options, option D says that.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I have. So the correct answer should be option D.

Wait, but another approach: we can express 1 - [1/(1 + a)^2] as [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2 ) which is (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2. So sqrt of that is sqrt(2a + a²) / (1 + a) ), but I don't think that helps.

But looking at the expression in option D, that's what we have for v_max.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option A: c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - ... )). That seems more complicated. Option B: sqrt( ... ), but it's under a square root of 1 plus 1/(1 - something). Option C is the non-relativistic case, which we can rule out because it's not relativistic.

So the only option that matches is D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we must account for relativistic effects. In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is no longer \((1/2)mv^2\), but rather \((\gamma - 1)mc^2\), where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\). The total energy \( E \) of the system is conserved and includes the rest mass energy and the potential energy.

At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the potential energy is \((1/2)kA^2\), and the kinetic energy is zero. Thus, the total energy is:

\[
E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

At the equilibrium point \( x = 0 \), all the energy is kinetic. Setting the total energy equal to the relativistic kinetic energy:

\[
(\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Rearranging for \(\gamma\):

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2.
\]

Rearranging for \(v^2/c^2\):

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A** and **Option B** involve incorrect forms under the square root, inconsistent with the derived expression.
- **Option C** corresponds to the non-relativistic case, which does not account for relativistic effects.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
