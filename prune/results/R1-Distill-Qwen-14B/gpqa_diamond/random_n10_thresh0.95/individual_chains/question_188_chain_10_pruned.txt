Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral... I remember that it's one of the crystal structures, right? Like, it's a type of hexagonal crystal system but with certain specific angles. Oh wait, no, actually, rhombohedral is a subclass of the cubic system, but with all the edges equal but the angles not necessarily 90 degrees. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees, which is quite a change from the usual 90 in a cubic system.

The question is asking about the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance... Oh right, that's the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance d is given by d = a / (sqrt(l² + m² + n² + 2lm cos α + 2ln cos β + 2mn cos γ)), but wait, no, I think I might be mixing up the formula. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Oh wait, I think the correct formula for a general crystal system is d = a/(sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ) + ... )) but no, wait, perhaps that's only for hexagonal systems. Oh wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal system is using the reciprocal of the metric tensor. Alternatively, for a rhombohedral crystal, which is a special case, perhaps the formula simplifies. Oh right, because in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and all angles are equal. So maybe this can be simplified.

Wait, rhombohedral is defined by a = b = c, and the angles α, β, γ are all equal, so that might make the math easier.

So the formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is d_hkl = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) ), but wait, no, maybe I'm getting the terms wrong. Or perhaps it's more accurate to think in terms of the Bravais lattice. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula involving the reciprocal of the lattice parameters.

Wait, I remember the general formula for interplanar distance is given by:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² (1/a²) ) + (k² (1/b²) ) + (l² (1/c²) ) + (2 hk (cos γ)/(a b) ) + (2 hl (cos β)/(a c) ) + (2 kl (cos α)/(b c) )) )

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a_0 (let's say), and all angles are equal. So substituting a = b = c = a_0, and α = β = γ = θ (which is 30 degrees here).

So let's plug these into the formula. So the denominator becomes sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) * (1/a_0²) ) + terms with cos(theta) multiplied by (2 hk, 2 hl, 2 kl)/(a_0²) ).

Wait, let me clarify. Let me denote a = b = c = a0, and α=β=γ=θ=30°.

So the formula simplifies because all the terms become symmetrical.

So the expression under the square root becomes:

( h² + k² + l² )/a0² + 2 (hk + hl + kl) (cos θ) / (a0² )

Because, for example, the term 2 hk cos γ / (a b) becomes 2 hk cos θ / a0², since a = b = c = a0.

So the entire denominator becomes sqrt( [ (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ] / a0² ) )

So the reciprocal is a0 / sqrt( [h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ] )

So the interplanar distance d is a0 divided by the square root of (h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos θ + 2hl cos θ + 2kl cos θ )

Wait, because cos θ is the same for all angles, since all are θ=30°.

So for the (111) plane, h = k = l =1.

Plugging those in:

d = a0 / sqrt( 1 + 1 + 1 + 2*(1*1*cos30° + 1*1*cos30° + 1*1*cos30°) )

Simplify the numerator inside the square root.

So, h² + k² + l² = 3.

The 2*(sum) is 2 * [ (1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) cos30° ] → 2 * 3 * cos30° → 6 cos30°.

So the denominator inside the sqrt becomes 3 + 6 cos30°.

Compute cos30°: cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 6 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 3 sqrt(3) ≈5.196.

So 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

So the denominator is sqrt(8.196) ≈ let's compute that. What's sqrt(8.196)?

Well, sqrt(8.196) is approximately 2.863, because 2.86^2 = 8.1796, and 2.863^2 is about (2.86)^2 + 2*2.86*0.003 + (0.003)^2 ≈ 8.1796 + 0.01716 + 0.000009 ≈ 8.196769, which is very close to 8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863.

So d = a0 / 2.863.

Given that a0 is the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstrom.

So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.493 Angstrom? Wait, wait, that can't be right because the options are around 9 Angstrom.

Wait, wait, wait. I must have made a mistake here. Oh, wait, wait. Wait, wait a second. Hold on.

Wait, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, is that the lattice parameter a? Or is the interatomic distance the distance between atoms, which might be different from a in a crystal structure.

Wait, this part is confusing. So, in a crystal structure, the lattice parameter a is the distance between adjacent lattice points. But the interatomic distance is the actual distance between atoms, which depends on the structure.

Wait, but in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a, because each atom is at the lattice point. But in other structures, like BCC or FCC, the interatomic distance is different.

But wait, in a rhombohedral structure, each lattice point is a corner atom, but the actual interatomic distance could be along a different direction. Oh, wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps a, the lattice parameter, is such that the interatomic distance (say, along the cube diagonal) is 10 Angstrom. Or perhaps in the case of rhombohedral, it's the edge length.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different definition. Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter a. Because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a. So perhaps in this case, a is 10 Angstrom.

But then the calculation I did earlier gives d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.49 Angstrom, which is way lower than the options given (which are around 9). So that can't be right. So I must have messed up the formula.

Wait, perhaps I inverted something. Let me recheck the formula for interplanar distance.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance formula in terms of the unit cell parameters. The general formula is derived from the Miller indices and the reciprocal lattice vectors.

In a rhombohedral system, the lattice is defined by a = b = c and α = β = γ. So the metric tensor is diagonal? No, wait, no. The metric tensor for a rhombohedral system is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system as:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

where θ is the angle between the axes, which in this case is 30 degrees.

Wait, that's the same formula I used earlier. But if a is 10 Angstrom, then the interplanar distance would be 10 / sqrt(...). But wait, that gives a smaller value than the options.

But the options are all around 9 Angstrom. Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the reciprocal of d as the term.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate 1/d^2 as the sum of terms, and then take the reciprocal. Let me think. The general formula for 1/d^2 is (h² + k² + l²)/(a^2) + 2(hk cos γ)/(a^2) + ... etc. So in our case, with a = b = c and all angles equal to θ, and h = k = l = 1.

So 1/d^2 = (3)/(a^2) + 2*(3 * cos θ) / a^2.

Because, (h² + k² + l²) is 3, and the cross terms are 2 hk cos θ, 2 hl cos theta, 2 kl cos theta. Since h=k=l=1, each term is 2 * 1 * 1 * cos theta, and there are three such terms, totaling 6 cos theta. Wait, wait, no:

Wait, for the cross terms:

In general, 1/d^2 = (h²)/(a^2) + (k^2)/(b^2) + (l^2)/(c^2) + (2 hk cos gamma)/(a b) + (2 hl cos beta)/(a c) + (2 kl cos alpha)/(b c)

In rhombohedral, a=b=c, and alpha = beta = gamma = theta.

So each term becomes:

h²/(a²) + k²/(a²) + l²/(a²) + 2 hk cos theta/(a²) + 2 hl cos theta/(a²) + 2 kl cos theta/(a²).

So 1/d^2 = [h² + k² + l² + 2 hk cos theta + 2 hl cos theta + 2 kl cos theta ] / a^2.

Which can be rewritten as:

1/d^2 = [ (h + k + l)^2 - 2(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta ] / a^2.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to just compute the numerator as is.

So for (111), h=k=l=1.

Numerator:

1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 =3.

The cross terms: 2*(1*1 cos theta + 1*1 cos theta + 1*1 cos theta) = 2*(3 cos theta) =6 cos theta.

So total numerator:3 +6 cos theta.

Thus,

1/d^2 = (3 +6 cos theta)/a^2.

So d^2 = a^2 / (3 +6 cos theta).

So d= a / sqrt(3 +6 cos theta).

Wait, that's an easier way to write it.

So plug in the numbers.

a is the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstrom.

Theta is 30 degrees, so cos theta is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Compute denominator: 3 +6 *0.8660 =3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)= approximately 2.863.

So d=10 / 2.863 ≈3.493 Angstrom.

Wait, but the options are much higher, like 9 Angstrom. Did I get the formula wrong?

Wait, perhaps I got a wrong formula. Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is not a, but some other parameter.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is for the interatomic distance, not the lattice parameter a.

Wait, maybe I've confused the lattice parameter a with the interatomic distance. Because in some crystal structures, the interatomic distance is not the same as a.

For example, in a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, the interatomic distance is a*sqrt(2)/2, which is a/(sqrt(2)).

But wait, in the case of a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a, so perhaps in rhombohedral, the interatomic distance is along a certain direction, which might not be a.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is along the [100] direction. Oh wait, that's just a, so in that case, a is 10. Then why is my calculation giving d=3.493, which doesn't match any option?

Hmm. So this suggests that perhaps I'm using the wrong formula, or I'm confusing a with the interatomic distance.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used is for the reciprocal of the lattice. No, no, I think I'm just making a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Another approach: Let's find the interplanar distance using the formula for a rhombohedral system.

The interplanar distance d for (hkl) planes in a rhombohedral system is given by:

d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha )

But in our case, alpha=beta=gamma=30°, so cos alpha = cos beta= cos gamma= cos30= sqrt(3)/2.

So d= a / sqrt( 1 +1 +1 + 2*(1*1) cos30 + 2*(1*1) cos30 + 2*(1*1) cos30 )

Which is same as previous calculation: a/(sqrt(3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2)) )

Which is a/(sqrt(3 + 3 sqrt(3) )) )

But with a=10, so d=10/sqrt(3 +3*1.732)=10/sqrt(3+5.196)=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.493
