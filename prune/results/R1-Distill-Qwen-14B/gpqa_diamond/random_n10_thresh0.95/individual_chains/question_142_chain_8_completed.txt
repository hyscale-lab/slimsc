Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, when a state is a density matrix, it's usually a statistical mixture or a pure state. But wait, this matrix looks like a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩ states each with equal probability.

Wait, wait a second. The density matrix for a pure state would be ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, but this looks like a sum of two projectors. Let me compute it. Since |0⟩ and |1⟩ are orthonormal, the sum |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| is actually the identity matrix in 2x2 dimensions? Because for two-level systems, |0⟩ and |1⟩ form a basis, so their projectors add up to I.

So ρ = (1/2)(I). That would make ρ a completely mixed state. Because in a 2-dimensional space, the maximally mixed state is (I/2). So this state is maximally mixed.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubits space. Hmm, wait, what does that mean? I think it's referring to the representation in terms of the Bloch sphere. Oh right, density matrices for qubits can be represented on the Bloch sphere. For a pure state |ψ⟩, the density matrix is a vector on the Bloch sphere, with the position given by the Bloch vector r. For example, |0⟩ would correspond to r=(1,0,0), and |1⟩ to r=(0,1,0)? Wait, no, actually, I think |0⟩ is at (1,0,0) and |1⟩ is at (-1,0,0), but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, no, the Bloch vector for a pure state |θ, φ⟩ is [sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ]. So |0⟩ is θ=0, so cosθ=1, which puts it at (0,0,1). Wait, no, because for |0⟩, cos(θ/2)=1, so θ=0. So sinθ is 0, but the Bloch vector is (x,y,z) = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). So for θ=0, cosθ is 1, so z=1, x and y are 0. So |0⟩ is (0,0,1), and |1⟩ is (0,0,-1). Wait, that makes sense because |0⟩ is (1,0) and |1⟩ is (0,1), which in the Bloch sphere are at the north and south poles, respectively.

But wait, the state ρ here is a mixed state, so its Bloch vector would be at the origin, right? Because a maximally mixed state has no direction. Let me think. The general form of a single-qubit density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector. So if the density matrix is (I/2), then r must be zero. Because then the matrix is (I + 0*I)/2 = I/2.

So in this case, since ρ is (I/2), the Bloch vector r would be (0,0,0). So the geometrical position is at the origin.

Now looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), so that's the answer. The other options don't make sense. Option B is (0,0,1), which would be |0⟩, but this is a mixed state. Option A is (1,1,0), which isn't a possible Bloch vector because the length would be sqrt(1^2 +1^2 +0^2) = sqrt(2), which is larger than 1, but the Bloch vector has length ≤1.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, density matrices are expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( \vec{r} \) is the Bloch vector and \( \vec{\sigma} \) are the Pauli matrices. For a maximally mixed state, \( \rho = \frac{I}{2} \), which implies \( \vec{r} = (0, 0, 0) \). This means the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** (\( r = (1, 1, 0) \)): This is incorrect because the Bloch vector length is \( \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{2} \), which exceeds the maximum allowed length of 1 for a Bloch vector.
- **Option B** (\( r = (0, 0, 1) \)): This corresponds to the pure state \( |0\rangle \), but the given density matrix represents a mixed state, not a pure state.
- **Option C** (\( r = (0, 0, 0) \)): This is correct, as the maximally mixed state has no directional preference and is represented by the origin in the Bloch sphere.
- **Option D** (\( r = (1, 1, 1) \)): This is incorrect because the Bloch vector length is \( \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{3} \), which is also greater than 1.

Thus, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \( r = (0, 0, 0) \).
