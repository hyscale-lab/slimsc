Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So, the first step is heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the NMR of product 3, with the options given.

Hmm. Let's break this down reaction by reaction.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH. I think KOH is a strong base. When dibromides react with strong bases, elimination reactions can happen. Because we have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons, probably? Wait, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so the 1 and 3 positions might be on adjacent carbons or across. Wait, no, in adamantane, the structure is such that each carbon is connected in a way that each bridgehead (like position 1 and others) are connected in a rigid structure. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on adjacent bridgeheads.

Wait, no, the structure of adamantane is a diamondoid, and the positions 1 and 3 would be on opposite ends? Or maybe adjacent? Let me think. The adamantane structure is like a diamond crystal, so the 1,3 positions would be on adjacent bridgeheads. So, when KOH is used, it's a dehydrohalogenation, an E2 elimination. So two E2 eliminations would occur, perhaps. Or maybe a single elimination to form an alkene. But wait, if there are two bromines, maybe two eliminations can happen, leading to the formation of a diene or maybe a bridged cyclohexene structure.

Wait, but KOH is used in elimination reactions, especially with vicinal dihalides. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a dihalide, but not vicinal. Wait, no, 1 and 3 positions might not be adjacent. Wait, in adamantane, each bridgehead is connected to three other bridgeheads, but the numbering might be such that 1 and 3 are not adjacent. Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure.

Adamantane is a molecule with four cyclohexane rings fused together in a diamondoid structure. The bridgehead carbons are the ones where four rings meet. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on two bridgehead carbons that are opposite each other? Wait, no, maybe adjacent, but perhaps not. Wait, maybe I should visualize this. Let's see, the structure of adamantane has four carbons at the corners of a tetrahedron. So, each bridgehead is connected to the others. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on two of these bridgehead carbons. If they're on adjacent bridgeheads, then the dihalide is vicinal. But in that case, elimination would form a double bond between those two carbons. But if they're across, then elimination would form a ring structure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the product. The product after KOH is a light yellow solid, which is probably a diepoxide or some kind of diene. Wait, no, the IR spectrum of product 1 shows an absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, product 1 probably has a ketone group.

Ah, wait. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes dehydrohalogenation with KOH, perhaps it forms an epoxide. But wait, no, epoxide formation usually requires a peracid, or maybe a different reaction. Alternatively, elimination could form an alkene, but the IR doesn't show a peak in the 1600s which would correspond to a double bond. Instead, the 1720 cm⁻¹ is more of a carbonyl. So maybe the product is a diketone?

Wait, how would that happen? If two elimination reactions occur, perhaps each Br is removed with hydroxide, leading to the formation of two ketone groups. But wait, each elimination would form a double bond, but that would require adjacent Brs. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group through elimination, but that requires each Br to be on adjacent carbons. So, perhaps the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane allows for two adjacent Brs on each bridgehead. Wait, perhaps each bridgehead (adamantyl structure) is connected to a CH2Br group. No, because 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Brs on the bridgeheads.

Wait, perhaps when KOH is added, it leads to a double elimination, each Br being replaced by a hydroxyl group, but that would form a diol. But the IR doesn't show an OH stretch, unless it's a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps each Br leads to a carbonyl upon elimination. So, each Br leaves, and the adjacent hydrogens are abstracted, forming a double bond between two bridgeheads, but that would create a ring structure, perhaps a cyclohexene, but then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the IR. 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl, which suggests a ketone. So, perhaps each elimination forms a ketone. But how?

Wait, when a dihalide undergoes dehydrohalogenation, each elimination forms a double bond. But for each elimination, two X's (like Br) are removed. Wait, no, each elimination removes one X. Wait, perhaps in this case, the two Brs undergo elimination, each leading to a carbonyl group. But that would require each Br to be on a carbon that's adjacent to another, perhaps with the possibility of forming a conjugated system.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and when KOH abstracts a β-hydrogen, each elimination forms a ketone. So, each bridgehead Br would lose HBr and form a carbonyl group. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane when treated with KOH would form 1,3-diketoadamantane. So product 1 is a diketone.

But then the NMR of product 1 is given as 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Wait, the 4.79 ppm is probably a triplet, but wait, 2H—could it be an OCH₂ group? Hmm, but that would be more around 3.5-4.5, but 4.79 is a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH₂ connected to something electronegative, like oxygen. Or perhaps it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like a carbonyl.

Wait, but if product 1 is a diketone, the structure would have two ketone groups. The NMR shows 4.79 (2H), which might be a CH₂ group. Let's think about the coupling. The 2H at 4.79 could be adjacent to an oxygen, maybe an ethylene glycol type structure, but that's not likely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diol, but the IR doesn't show OH stretch, so that's probably not it.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the product. What if the product is an epoxide? The IR would then have a peak around 1250 cm⁻¹ for the epoxide C-O-C. But in the question, the IR has a peak at 1720, which is more like a ketone. So, back to the thought that product 1 is a diketone.

But the NMR of product 1 is given: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H).

The 1.94 (2H) could be a methylene group near an electronegative atom or in a more deshielded area. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) suggests several CH2 groups in a more shielded area. The 4.79 (2H) could be an OCH2O group, like in an epoxide, but that would typically be at lower ppm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diol, but again, without OH in IR, that's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.79 is a CH2 group that's part of a ring, perhaps in a six-membered ring, which is adjacent to oxygen. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl group, but the 2H would have to be adjacent to carbonyls.

Wait, another approach. If the product after KOH is a diketone, then the next reaction is with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 is a diketone. So perhaps product 2 is formed via some kind of enolization or Friedel-Crafts type reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is something else.

Wait, let's think again. The first reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid). IR shows carbonyl (1720 cm⁻1), so product 1 is a ketone. Maybe two ketones, so a diketone.

Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(i-Pr)O). Hmm. Under Friedel-Crafts conditions, but product 1 is a ketone. Perhaps the Lewis acid is used for some kind of acylation or alkylation. Alternatively, maybe it's used to form an enol.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a diketone, which upon treatment with a Lewis acid could undergo some kind of cyclization or ring-opening. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. But then the IR would show epoxide C-O-C peak, but here it's a carbonyl, so probably not.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the first step is a double elimination, where each Br is removed with a base, leading to the formation of a single bond with the loss of HBr. Wait, but that's possible only if each Br is on a carbon that can lose HBr and form a double bond. But since the product is a ketone, perhaps each Br is on a quaternary carbon, and elimination forms a carbonyl. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules, forming a diketone.

So product 1 is 1,3-diketoadamantane. Then, the NMR would show the two ketone carbonyl groups. But wait, the NMR of product 1 doesn't have a peak around 2 ppm, which is where ketones typically appear. Instead, the 4.79 ppm is a triplet of 2H. Maybe that's a methylene adjacent to the ketone groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure of product 1 is a diketone with a bridged structure. For example, in a bicyclic system, the 4.79 ppm could be a bridgehead CH2 group adjacent to two ketones. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the 4.79 ppm is a CH2 connected to two oxygen atoms, like an ether.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the first reaction forms an enol. But with KOH, perhaps it's a base-catalyzed elimination to form an enol, but that forms an alkene. Hmm, but the IR shows a carbonyl, not a double bond. So, perhaps the product is a diketone.

Moving on, product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Al(i-Pr)O is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst for Friedel-Crafts reactions, but in this case, the substrate is a diketone. Maybe it's used to form an enol or some kind of cyclic intermediate.

Wait, perhaps the diketone undergoes a nucleophilic attack. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen rearrangement or a similar reaction. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the diketone reacts with the Lewis acid to form a more reactive species. Maybe it forms an acylium ion or something that can undergo cyclization.

Hmm, perhaps the product 2 is formed via a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but the substrate is a ketone. Wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an aromatic ring, which the adamantane structure doesn't have. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: the diketone could undergo a ring-opening under Lewis acid conditions. For example, if the diketone is part of a cyclic structure, the Lewis acid might protonate an oxygen, making it a better leaving group. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, and when treated with a Lewis acid, it undergoes a cyclization to form a more complex structure, possibly a bicyclic ketone or another ring structure.

I'm a bit stuck on this step, but let's proceed. Then, product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis will break it into fragments, each with a carbonyl group.

Wait, but how does product 2 have a double bond? Let's backtrack. If product 1 is a diketone, and product 2 is formed via a reaction that introduces a double bond, perhaps through elimination, then product 2 would contain a double bond, which would then be cleaved by ozonolysis.

Wait, but the third reaction: product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide. That's a standard ozonolysis workup, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

So, putting it all together, product 1 is a diketone, product 2 has a double bond (possibly from a rearrangement or elimination), and product 3 has carbonyls from ozonolysis.

Wait, but how does product 2 form from product 1 and Al(i-Pr)O? Maybe product 1 undergoes a rearrangement or elimination to form a diene, which then would be cleaved by ozonolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but that doesn't fit with the IR data showing a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the first step forms a diepoxide. Let's think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH, could form an epoxide. But wait, epoxides are usually formed from vicinal dihalides with NaOH or KOH in a double elimination. So, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a vicinal dihalide, then KOH would form an epoxide.

But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—does that have adjacent Br atoms? If the positions 1 and 3 are on adjacent bridgeheads, then it's a vicinal dihalide. But in adamantane, each bridgehead is connected to three others, so the positions 1 and 3 might not be adjacent. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to an elimination, forming an alkene. So product 1 would be an alkene. But then the IR shows a carbonyl, which would suggest that product 1 is a ketone, not an alkene.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck on product 1. Let me think differently. The IR of product 1 has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. So, product 1 is a carbonyl compound. The NMR of product 1 has 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Let's imagine this is a structure with two ketone groups and some CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an adamantane derivative with two ketone groups and an attached ethylene group. For example, maybe it's 1,3-diketone with a CH2O group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclohexanone derivative. But I'm not certain.

Moving on, let's think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis of a diene would give two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have more carbonyl groups than product 2. The H NMR for product 3 is what we're interested in.

But I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should try to find another approach. Let me try to imagine the entire process.

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (diketone) via KOH elimination.
2. Product 1 → product 2 (diene) via Al(i-Pr)O (maybe a rearrangement or elimination).
3. Product 2 → product 3 (after ozonolysis) which breaks the diene into carbonyl groups.

If product 3 has carbonyl groups, its NMR would show the appropriate peaks. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.

Wait, but in the ozonolysis of a diene, the resulting carbonyl compounds would have protons adjacent to the carbonyl. These protons would typically couple with neighboring protons, leading to splitting patterns.

If product 2 is a diene, perhaps a conjugated diene, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. Each carbonyl group would have adjacent protons. For example, if the diene is between two CH2 groups, ozonolysis would form two ketones or aldehydes, each with adjacent H's.

Wait, let's think about the structure of product 2. If product 2 is a diene, perhaps a 1,3-diene, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two fragments with carbonyl groups. Each fragment would have a carbonyl group and perhaps some adjacent CH2 groups.

But I'm not getting much further. Let me try to think about the options given for the coupling pattern. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

In an NMR spectrum, splitting occurs when a proton is adjacent to (coupled with) other protons. The number of neighbors determines the splitting. For example, a proton next to one proton would be a doublet. If next to two, it would be a triplet. If next to two sets of protons, each with different coupling constants, it could be a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets.

So, in product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen is likely to be adjacent to a carbonyl group. So, maybe it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl.

Wait, if the diene in product 2 is symmetrical, then ozonolysis would produce two identical carbonyl compounds. So, each fragment would have a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl.

In that case, the H adjacent to the carbonyl (like a CH2=O) would be split based on their neighboring Hs. If each CH2 group is adjacent to another CH2 group, then each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but perhaps the situation is more complex. Suppose product 3 is a diketone, with each ketone adjacent to a CH2 group. The Hs on the CH2 would be next to each other and perhaps also coupled with Hs from other groups.

Alternatively, if the diene in product 2 is a conjugated diene, say in a six-membered ring, then ozonolysis would break it into two three-carbon fragments, each with a carbonyl group. Each fragment would have a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl.

In such a case, each CH2 group's Hs would be next to each other and possibly coupled with Hs from the same or adjacent groups.

Wait, but I'm not getting the exact structure. Maybe I should think about the NMR of product 3. The most deshielded H would be the one closest to the electronegative group, like a carbonyl. So, perhaps this H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl.

In such a scenario, each H in the CH2 group would be coupled with two other Hs in the same group (a triplet), but if there's another coupling from an adjacent group, it could lead to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs from the same CH2 group (giving a triplet) and another H from an adjacent group (maybe a doublet), leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, maybe each H is coupled with two Hs (same CH2: triplet) and another two Hs (from another CH2: doublet), leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the splitting. For a proton that's next to two protons on the same carbon (like in a CH2 group) and also next to another set of two protons on an adjacent carbon, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets. Because each H on the CH2 is split by the two Hs on the same carbon (triplet) and also by the two Hs on the adjacent carbon (another triplet), resulting in a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the coupling constants are different, it might be a doublet of triplets. But the question is about the most deshielded H, so perhaps it's a triplet of triplets.

Looking at the options, option B is triplet of triplets, option C is doublet of triplets.

Wait, another possibility: if the CH2 group is next to a carbonyl, and each H is split by two Hs from the same group and another two from a neighboring group, but if the coupling constants are similar, it could result in a triplet of triplets.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option B, triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, maybe the structure leads to the H being split into a doublet of triplets. For example, if the H is next to two Hs (triplet) and also adjacent to another H that's split into a doublet, perhaps due to coupling with another set of Hs.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the most deshielded H is a singlet, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, another approach: in the first step, product 1 is a diketone, which upon treatment with Al(i-Pr)O undergoes some kind of cyclization to form a diene (product 2). Then, ozonolysis cleaves the diene into two carbonyl compounds (product 3).

If product 3 is a diketone, each ketone would have adjacent CH2 groups. So, the Hs on these CH2 groups would be adjacent to each other (two Hs) and perhaps also adjacent to another CH2 group (two Hs), leading to a triplet of triplets.

But wait, in reality, the splitting would depend on the exact structure. For example, if the CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, the Hs would be split by the two Hs on the same CH2 (triplet) and also by the Hs on neighboring CH2 groups (if any). But if there's another CH2 group adjacent, each H would have coupling with those Hs as well.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that each CH2 group is only adjacent to the carbonyl and perhaps another CH2 group that isn't directly adjacent, the splitting could be a triplet.

Wait, maybe I should think about the actual NMR. The most deshielded H in product 3 would likely be next to a carbonyl, so perhaps in a CH2 group adjacent to a ketone. Each H in the CH2 group would have two neighboring Hs (same group, leading to triplet) and perhaps another coupling with Hs from the adjacent groups. If it's coupled with two Hs from another group, that would add another layer of splitting.

But without the exact structure, it's a bit challenging. Given the options, and considering that the H is adjacent to a CH2 group (so two Hs) and perhaps another CH2 group (another two Hs), the splitting would be a triplet of triplets. So, option B.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH at 240°C leads to a dehydrohalogenation reaction. The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the formation of a diketone. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41–2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a structure with two ketone groups and CH₂ groups in specific environments.

2. **Reaction with Al(i-Pr)O**: Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a strong Lewis acid. This step likely induces a rearrangement or elimination, forming product 2. Product 2 is inferred to contain a double bond, as ozonolysis in the next step cleaves double bonds.

3. **Ozonolysis**: Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, forming carbonyl groups. Product 3 is therefore a compound with carbonyl groups where the double bonds in product 2 were located.

4. **NMR Analysis of Product 3**: The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen would be part of a CH₂ group near the carbonyl. The splitting pattern depends on the number and arrangement of neighboring hydrogens. If the CH₂ group is adjacent to two hydrogens on the same carbon (resulting in a triplet) and also coupled with two hydrogens on an adjacent carbon (another triplet), the coupling pattern becomes a **triplet of triplets**.

Given the options, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is best described as a **triplet of triplets**.

Answer: B
