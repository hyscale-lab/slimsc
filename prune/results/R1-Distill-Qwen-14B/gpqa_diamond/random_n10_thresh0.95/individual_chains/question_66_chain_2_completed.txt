Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are combinations of Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries.

Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension and the fields they involve.

First, I need to recall what each symmetry entails and whether SMEFT respects them.

Lorentz Symmetry: This is the symmetry of spacetime under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. In the Standard Model, all interactions respect Lorentz symmetry. SMEFT, being an effective theory that incorporates the SM, should also respect Lorentz symmetry. So all operators in SMEFT must preserve this symmetry.

Poincare Symmetry: This includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So Poincare symmetry implies that the theory is also translationally invariant. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, does it automatically respect Poincare? Or is it a separate consideration? I think that in SMEFT, the operators are built respecting Poincare symmetry because the effective theory is constructed in a way that maintains the same symmetries as the Standard Model. So Poincare symmetry must be respected.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The question is about operators, not the entire theory. So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, right? Because if an operator isn't a Lorentz scalar, it would break Lorentz symmetry. But does that automatically mean it respects Poincare? Because Poincare includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. So if the operator is a scalar, it's invariant under Lorentz, but what about translations? Well, operators in the effective theory are local, so translation invariance is built in. So I think all SMEFT operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries.

Next, CP symmetry. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. Charge conjugation changes a particle into its antiparticle, and Parity reflects space. CP symmetry means that the laws of physics are invariant under this combined transformation. But the Standard Model doesn't fully respect CP symmetry. For instance, CP violation is observed in certain interactions, like in the CKM matrix. So in SMEFT, the operators can include terms that violate CP, right? Because when you add higher-dimension operators, you might break some symmetries. So perhaps the operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. So the operators can violate CP, meaning that not all operators must respect it. Therefore, answer options that include CP (like option D, which says 1,3,4) would be incorrect in terms of "must be respected by all operators". Because some operators can violate it.

Then there's CPT symmetry. CPT is Charge-Parity-Time reversal symmetry. I remember that in quantum field theory, all theories that respect the basic principles must be CPT symmetric. Because it's a fundamental symmetry arising from the principles of quantum mechanics and relativity. So in SMEFT, which is a QFT, the operators must respect CPT. So any operator in SMEFT must be such that when you apply CPT, the operator remains the same or perhaps acquires a phase, but the overall structure is preserved. So CPT symmetry must be respected.

So summarizing:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: Must be respected. So operators are Lorentz scalars.
2. Poincare Symmetry: Must be respected as well, because it includes Lorentz and translation. Since SMEFT is a local QFT, operators are local and translation invariant.
3. CP Symmetry: Not necessarily. Operators can violate CP, so not all operators must respect it.
4. CPT Symmetry: Must be respected. So all operators must be CPT invariant.

So the question is which of the options include 1, 2, and 4, but not 3.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1, 2,4. So that's Lorentz, Poincare, CPT.

Option D is 1,3,4. That includes CP, which isn't required for all operators.

So the correct answer is option C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators must respect certain symmetries, and the question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This symmetry, which applies to spacetime under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts), is fundamental in SMEFT. All operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz scalars, meaning Lorentz symmetry is strictly respected.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: This symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry with translation invariance. Since SMEFT is a local effective field theory, operators are inherently translationally invariant, and thus Poincaré symmetry is also respected by all operators.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry involves invariance under the combined transformations of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). The Standard Model already exhibits CP violation in certain interactions, and SMEFT allows for operators that can explicitly violate CP symmetry. Therefore, not all operators in SMEFT need to respect CP symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry, which combines charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal, is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. All operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The correct option is **C**.

Answer: C
