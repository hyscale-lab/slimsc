Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The problem says that we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the answer choices are A to D.

First, I think I should figure out what's happening during each part: the dilution, then the titration.

Starting with the dilution: Acetic acid is a weak acid, and when we dilute it, its concentration decreases. So, the initial concentration is 0.05 M. The volume is 20 cm³, which is 0.02 L. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. 

So, the dilution calculation can be done using the formula M1V1 = M2V2. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 L. So, M2 = (M1 V1) / V2. Let me calculate that: (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04 = (0.001) / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait. When you dilute a weak acid, the degree of ionization increases, but the concentration is lower. So the pH should be less acidic than before, but wait, no. Wait, when you dilute a weak acid, the pH actually increases because the solution becomes less concentrated. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Wait, concentration is lower, but since it's a weak acid, the degree of dissociation increases, but since the initial concentration is lower, maybe the pH is higher? Hmm. Hmm, perhaps I should think more carefully.

But maybe I can put that aside for now. Let's move on to the titration part.

The titration is with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is as follows: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, each mole of acetic acid reacts with a mole of NaOH. 

The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Let me tackle each part one by one.

First, the equivalence point.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So the solution will consist of the sodium acetate (CH3COO^- Na+), which is the conjugate base of acetic acid. In solution, the acetate ions will hydrolyze according to: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

Since it's a solution of a weak base (acetate), the pH will be basic. To find the pH, I can calculate the concentration of the acetate ions and then use the Kb.

But first, let me find how much NaOH is needed to reach equivalence.

The initial moles of acetic acid: M = 0.05 M, V = 0.02 L → moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

After dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M, but the volume is 0.04 L. So the moles are the same, right? Because dilution doesn't change the number of moles, just the concentration. So moles of acetic acid is 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

At equivalence, NaOH must provide 0.001 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume required is V = moles / M → V = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, but wait: the initial solution after dilution has a volume of 40 cm³. So when we add 10 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume becomes 40 + 10 = 50 cm³. But perhaps for the equivalence point calculations, the exact volume might not matter as much as the concentration of the acetate ion.

So, at equivalence, the solution is a 0.001 moles of acetate in 0.05 L (50 cm³). So the concentration of CH3COO^- is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, to find the pH, I can calculate the Kb for acetate. Since Ka (acetic acid) is 1.85e-5, Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10. The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The expression for Kb is [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ x² / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

So [OH^-] = 3.29e-6 → pOH = -log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.486 → pH = 14 - 5.486 = 8.514.

Looking at the options, option A's equivalence pH is 8.52, which is close. But let me check again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me compute it again.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kw is 1e-14, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10. That seems correct.

Then, for Kb = 5.405e-10, the acetate concentration is 0.02 M.

So, Kb = x² / 0.02 → x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 3.289e-6.

So pOH is about 5.486 → pH is 8.514, which is approximately 8.51. So option A's equivalence point is 8.52, which is very close. But let me see other options.

Option D's equivalence is 6.92, which is way off. So perhaps I'm on the right track, but perhaps I made a mistake in the volume.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck the moles.

After dilution, the acetic acid is 0.025 M in 40 cm³. So moles are 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. So when we add 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, moles of NaOH are 0.1 * 0.01 = 0.001. So yes, same as acetic acid moles, so equivalence.

But wait, in the solution after adding NaOH, the volume is 40+10=50 cm³ (0.05 L). So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That part is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. When you have a solution of sodium acetate, it's a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution is basic. So the equivalence point pH should be around 8.5, which matches option A's second value.

But let me look at the given options. Option A says 4.26 and 8.52. Hmm. Okay, but let's proceed to the 25% titration part.

25% titration means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.

Wait, 25% of the equivalence volume, perhaps? Or 25% of the moles. Since the equivalence volume is 10 cm³, 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So, in 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the moles are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

Wait, but wait: the total moles of acetic acid is 0.001. So 0.00025 moles of NaOH would neutralize 0.00025 moles of acetic acid, leaving 0.001 -0.00025 = 0.00075 moles of acetic acid, and producing 0.00025 moles of acetate.

But wait, the total volume now would be 40 cm³ (original) + 2.5 cm³ (added NaOH) = 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So, the concentration of acetic acid is 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M. The concentration of acetate is 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

At this point in the titration, we have a buffer solution consisting of acetic acid and its conjugate base (acetate). So, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to calculate the pH.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa = -log(1.85e-5) → let's calculate that. 

1.85e-5 is 1.85 x 10^-5. Taking log: log(1.85) is approximately 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

The ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025/0.0425) / (0.00075/0.0425) → the denominators (0.0425) cancel out, so it's (0.00025) / (0.00075) = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333.

So, pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) → log(1/3) is log(0.3333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256, which is approximately 4.26. So that matches option A's first value.

So at 25% titration, pH is around 4.26, and at equivalence, it's approximately 8.52. So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but let me check another possibility. When calculating the 25% titration, sometimes people take 25% of the initial solution, but I think in this case, it's 25% of the required NaOH to reach equivalence. So, 25% of the 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³, which is what I used.

But perhaps another approach is to compute the degree of neutralization. So, 25% of the acetic acid is neutralized, so 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH are converted to CH3COO^-.

So, the calculation seems correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me double-check the dilution step again.

Original volume: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

Diluted to 40 cm³: concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M, correct.

Then, when 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added, moles NaOH is 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025. So, moles of acetic acid neutralized = 0.00025, so remaining acetic acid is 0.00075 moles. Acetate formed is 0.00025 moles.

Total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³.

So, [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) → 4.733 + log(0.005882/0.017647) → which is log(0.3333) → -0.477, so 4.733 -0.477 = 4.256.

So yes, that's correct.

At equivalence, the pH is about 8.52. So the option that matches 4.26 and 8.52 is option A.

Looking at the options, option A says:

A) 4.26; 8.52.

Other options:

B: 3.17;6.73 → seems too low.

C:4.73;7 → but equivalence should be higher than 7, since it's a basic solution.

D:4.57;6.92 → no, equivalence is lower than 7. So A is the correct option.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the dilution of acetic acid. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
\text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.04} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### At the Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH, forming sodium acetate. The moles of NaOH required to reach equivalence are equal to the moles of acetic acid:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The volume of 0.1 M NaOH required is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Concentration}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

After adding 10 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetate} = \frac{\text{Moles of acetate}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The pH at the equivalence point is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( K_b \) for acetate is calculated using \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} \), where \( K_w = 1 \times 10^{-14} \) and \( K_a = 1.85 \times 10^{-5} \):

\[
K_b = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation \( [OH^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} \):

\[
[OH^-] = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[OH^-] = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.486.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.486 \approx 8.514.
\]

Thus, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.

---

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

This neutralizes 0.00025 moles of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Remaining moles of acetic acid} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The moles of acetate formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right),
\]

where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \):

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log\left(\frac{0.005882}{0.017647}\right).
\]

The ratio \( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \approx 0.333 \), and \( \log(0.333) \approx -0.477 \):

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 - 0.477 \approx 4.256.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.

---
