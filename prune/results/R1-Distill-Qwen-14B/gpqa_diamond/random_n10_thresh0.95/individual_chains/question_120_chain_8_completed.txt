Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about the distribution of stars and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let's think about what I remember about parallax and stars.

Parallax is a measure of how much a star appears to shift its position in the sky as the Earth orbits the Sun. The formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So a star that's closer has a larger parallax, and a farther star has a smaller parallax.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, uniform distribution usually means that the number density is the same everywhere. So if space is filled with stars uniformly, how does their parallax distribution work?

I think about the volume of space at a certain distance. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd would depend on the volume of that shell. The volume of a spherical shell is 4πd² dd. But since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume, so N = n * 4πd² dd, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

But the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let me change variables from d to plx. So d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. Wait, but since plx is inversely proportional to d, as d increases, plx decreases. So when I change variables, I need to get the expression right.

Let me express N in terms of plx. So N = n * 4π d² dd. Substitute d = 1/plx, dd becomes (1/plx²) d plx. But wait, since d plx is the change in parallax, which is a positive quantity, and d increases as plx decreases. Hmm.

Wait, let's not get confused with the signs. The number of stars in a shell with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is N = number density * volume of the shell. So the volume is 4π (d)^2 * dd, where dd is the thickness in distance. But d is 1/plx, so dd = (1/plx²) dplx. Because d = 1/plx, so dd = (d plx)/ (plx^2). Because d plx is the change in parallax, which would mean that as plx decreases (since the star is farther away), d increases.

So putting it all together, N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx / (plx^2)) ). Wait, wait, no. Let me correct that. The shell volume is 4π d² dd, and dd is (d plx) * (dd/dplx) which is (d plx) * (-1/(d^2)) ) because d=1/plx, so dd/dplx = -1/(d^2) → -plx^2. But since we're considering a small change, maybe we can treat it as positive, so the absolute value.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express the differential number of stars in terms of plx. So, the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) is dN = n * 4π d² * (dd), where dd is the change in distance corresponding to a change dplx in parallax.

Since plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/(plx^2)) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But when considering the differential, the absolute value is what matters for the count.

So, substituting d = 1/plx and dd = (1/plx^2) dplx (taking absolute values), we get:

dN = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx^2 )

Wait, that would be dN = n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (dplx / plx^2) ) → dN = 4 π n dplx / plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit plx (dN/dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx, which is dN/dplx, so that's proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, that would make the answer option A, which is ~1/plx^4.

But wait, let me double-check. Another approach: the number of stars in a shell is proportional to the volume of that shell. The volume element in terms of plx is 4π (d)^2 dd, which, as d = 1/plx, becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d d). But d d is (d plx / plx^2) because dd = (d plx) / (plx^2), as plx is 1/d.

Wait, no, because d plx is the change in plx, and since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx, so dd = (1/plx^2) dplx. So substituting, the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx → 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars in that volume is n * (4π / plx^4) dplx. Therefore, the number per unit plx (dN/dplx) is n * 4π / plx^4. So it's proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think about the inverse. The number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is proportional to the volume of that shell. So the volume when you move a small change in plx would be the surface area (4πd²) times the thickness in distance, which is dd. But dd is the change in distance corresponding to a change in plx. So d plx is the change in parallax, and since plx = 1/d, then d plx = - (1/d²) dd → dd = -d² d plx. But since we're dealing with small changes, the sign doesn't matter for the magnitude, so dd ≈ (1/plx²) d plx.

Thus, the volume is 4π d² * dd = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx / plx²) ) → 4π d plx / plx^4.

So number of stars dN = n * 4π d plx / plx^4 → dN/dplx = 4 π n d / plx^4. But d is 1/plx, so d = 1/plx → dN/dplx = 4 π n (1/plx) / plx^4 = 4 π n / plx^5. Wait, that can't be right because that would imply 1/plx^5 dependence, but earlier I thought it was 1/plx^4.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution. Let me do it step by step.

Parallax plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx.

The volume of the shell is 4π d² * dd.

But we can express dd in terms of d plx.

Since plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/(plx^2)) d plx.

The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but when calculating the volume, we take the absolute value, so dd = (1/(plx^2)) d plx.

So substituting into the volume:

Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx / plx^2) ) → 4π d plx / plx^4.

Wait, 4π * (1/plx)^2 * (d plx / plx^2) ) = 4π * [ (1) / (plx^2) ] * [ d plx / plx^2 ] → 4π d plx / plx^4.

But d plx is the change in parallax, so the number of stars per unit parallax is dN = n * Volume → dN = n * (4π d plx) / plx^4.

Wait, d is 1/plx, so:

dN = n * 4π (1/plx) d plx / plx^4 → 4 π n (1/plx^5) d plx.

Hm, that suggests that dN/dplx = 4 π n / plx^5.

Wait, that's a problem because earlier I thought it was 1/plx^4. Now I'm getting 1/plx^5.

Wait, what's the correct approach? Let me think again.

Maybe another approach: The number of stars in a given volume is n * Volume. The volume for a shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² dd. So stars in that shell is N = n * 4 π d² dd.

But we want the number per unit plx. Since plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx, so we can write N = n *4 π (1/plx)^2 * dd.

But we need to express dd in terms of d plx. So plx =1/d → d plx = -dd/(d^2). → So dd = - d^2 d plx → but since d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) d plx.

So substituting into N, N = n *4 π (1/plx^2) * ( - (1/plx²) d plx ) → N = -n *4 π (1/plx^4) d plx.

But since d plx is positive (we're considering a small increase in plx), but in reality, as plx increases, d decreases, so the volume changes. So perhaps it's better to express the number per unit plx in terms of |dd|.

Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of plx as the variable. So the number per unit plx would be dN/dplx = N per unit plx.

From N = n *4 π d^2 dd.

dd is (d plx / plx^2) → d plx is the change in plx, and since plx = 1/d, dd = (d plx)/(d^2) ) → wait, plx =1/d → d=1/plx → dd = (d plx) * (d^2) → because d plx = - (1/d^2) dd → solving for dd: dd= -d^2 d plx.

So substituting into N:

N = n *4 π d² (-d^2 d plx) ) → N = -n 4 π d^4 d plx.

But d =1/plx → d^4=1/plx^4 → N = -n 4 π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number per unit plx is dN/dplx = -n 4 π / plx^4.

The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, the number of stars decreases, which makes sense because stars are farther away. But since the question is about the magnitude, the dependency is 1/plx^4.

Wait, but earlier I thought I had 1/plx^5. I must have messed up the substitution somewhere.

Wait, let's try a substitution again.

Express N as the number of stars at parallax plx.

The number of stars in a thin shell with parallax plx to plx + dplx is:

dN = n * 4 π d² * dd.

But d = 1/plx → d² = 1/plx².

And dd = (d plx) / (d^2) ) → because d plx = - (1/d^2) dd → dd = - d^2 d plx.

So substituting:

dN = n *4 π (1/plx^2) * ( - (1/plx^2) d plx )

→ dN = - n 4 π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number per unit plx is dN/dplx = -4 π n / plx^4.

Ah, okay, so it's proportional to 1/plx^4.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dN/dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Looking back at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the correct answer should be A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dN/dplx) changes with parallax (plx), we start by considering the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax is defined as \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. For a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \), the number of stars \( N \) in the shell is proportional to its volume, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Since the stars are uniformly distributed, \( N = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 dd \), where \( n \) is the number density of stars.

To express \( N \) in terms of parallax, we substitute \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Substituting these into the expression for \( N \), we get:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
N = -n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \cdot d\text{plx}.
\]

The negative sign indicates that as \( \text{plx} \) increases (i.e., as stars are farther away), the number of stars decreases. The number of stars per unit range of parallax is given by \( \frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} \), which is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \text{plx}^4 \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ \( 1/\text{plx}^4 \)**.
