Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me read the question again.

The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant, K, is a measure of the stability of the complex. A higher K means a more stable complex.

So, the formula for the formation constant is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, I think the EDTA is usually in a specific form depending on the pH. Oh right, at the ideal pH, EDTA is in the Y^4- form, which is why it's written as EDTA^4- in the formula.

In this case, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote [Ca-EDTA] as 0.02 M.

Since the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, the expression for K would be K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But in a 1:1 complex like this, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- should be equal because each complex releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

Wait, no, wait. If the solution is only the complex, then initially, the concentrations of free Ca²+ and EDTA^4- should be very low because the complex is stable. So when the complex dissociates a little, the [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] will be equal, and their product will be equal to [Ca-EDTA]/K.

So, let me set up the equation. Let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x, because for each complex that dissociates, one of each ion is released.

So, K = [Ca-EDTA]/(x * x) => K = [Ca-EDTA]/(x²).

We can rearrange this to find x. x² = [Ca-EDTA]/K.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute, no. Because the complex is 0.02 M, and initially, the solution has only the complex. So the total concentration of Ca comes from the dissociation of the complex. So [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x. But wait, since K is so large (5e10), the dissociation is minimal. So x will be very small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, [Ca-EDTA] is approximately 0.02 M. Therefore, K ≈ 0.02/(x²) => x² ≈ 0.02/K.

Wait, that makes sense because with a large K, the complex is stable, and x is small. So x² = (0.02) / (5e10) = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-3 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 = 4e-14. Wait, no, 0.02 is 2e-2. Oh right.

Wait, let me compute it correctly. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is equal to (2/5) * 1e-12, which is 0.4e-12, or 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13. Therefore, x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Let me compute it properly.

Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * (1e-6.5) )? Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2 because 6.5 *2 =13. So yes, 2e-6.5.

Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6,
