Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, and choose the right option from A to D.

Hmm, so I'm thinking this has to do with electrostatic potential energy. Because when you have charges in a system, their potential energy contributes to the total energy. Since it's an isolated system, the energy should be the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges.

Wait, but wait. The 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from the 13th charge. But what about their distances from each other? Oh, wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So are they all at the same distance from P, but their positions relative to each other could vary? Or are they all at the same point? No, that can't be, because if they were all at the same point as each other, their mutual distances would be zero, leading to infinite potential energy, which isn't possible. So I think each of the 12 is at a point 2 meters away from P, but they could be arranged in a sphere or something around P. But since the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but their positions relative to each other might not be specified. Hmm. But for potential energy calculations, I think I need to consider the distance between each pair of charges, but I don't have their relative distances. So maybe the only interactions we're considering are between each of the 12 charges and the 13th charge at P. Because their mutual interactions among themselves might not be considered if their positions are fixed in some way that their mutual distances are fixed, but the problem doesn't specify that. Wait, but the problem says 'constrained to stay at 2 m from P', which suggests that each of the 12 is at 2m from P, but their positions relative to each other could vary. But that's probably not necessary for this problem. Maybe the only relevant interactions are the ones between the 13th charge and the 12 others.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about the minimum energy of the system. So I might need to arrange the charges in a way that minimizes the potential energy. Hmm, in electrostatics, the potential energy is minimized when the charges are as close as possible, but in this case, the 12 charges are fixed at 2m from P, but the 13th is fixed at P. So perhaps the 12 charges can arrange themselves in a way that their mutual potential energy is minimized. But I'm not sure if I need to consider that. Let me think.

Wait, the problem states that the 12 charges are fixed at 2m from P. So their positions relative to P are fixed, but their positions relative to each other could vary. So for the potential energy between them, they might be able to move around as long as they remain 2m from P. But how would that affect the potential energy? If they can arrange themselves in a way that their mutual distances are as large as possible, that would lower their repulsion and thus lower the potential energy. Wait, no, wait. Potential energy for like charges is positive and increases with distance. So if they are as far apart as possible, their mutual potential energy would be higher, not lower. But we are looking for the minimum energy, so maybe the opposite. Wait, no, because for positive charges, when they're closer together, the potential energy is higher (since you have to do work against their repulsion to bring them closer). So the minimum potential energy would occur when they are as far apart as possible. But in this case, since they're constrained to be 2m from P, but I don't know their positions relative to each other. Oh, but perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the 13th charge at P, and not their mutual potential energies. That would make the problem easier.

Wait, but if that's the case, why is the question giving me the number 13? Oh, because the 13th is at the center, and the others are arranged around it. So perhaps each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from P, so each contributes a potential energy term with the 13th charge.

So maybe the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies between each of the 12 charges and the 13th charge. But wait, each pair would contribute twice that, because U is k*(q1*q2)/r. So each of the 12 charges interacts with the central charge, and each interaction is the same.

So let me calculate that. Each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from P, which is where the 13th charge is located. Each charge has a magnitude of 2e, and since they're all identical, I need to figure out if they're positive or negative. But since the problem says 'charge' and not 'point charges with opposite signs', I'm assuming they're all positive. So their interactions are repulsive, but the question is about potential energy.

So the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. Here, k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². Each charge is 2e, where e is the elementary charge, about 1.602 x 10^-19 C. So each charge is 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-19 C.

Wait, but wait. The 12 charges are each 2e, and the 13th is also 2e. So each pair is (2e)*(2e) = 4e². And r is 2 meters.

So for each of the 12 interactions between the central charge and the others, the potential energy is U = k * (4e²) / 2. So that's k * 4e² / 2 = 2k e².

But the total would be 12 times that, because there are 12 such pairs. So total U would be 12 * 2k e² = 24 k e².

Wait, no, wait. Each of the 12 charges contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) = k*(4e²)/(2) = 2 k e². So 12 of these would be 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Wait, no, that's correct? Because each of the 12 is interacting with the central charge. So yes, 12 times the same energy.

But wait, wait a second. Are we considering the interactions between the 12 charges themselves? Because the problem says the system's minimum energy. If the 12 charges can arrange themselves in a way that their mutual potential energy is minimized, perhaps that contributes to the total as well. But the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their positions relative to each other are not fixed, which could allow them to arrange in a way that minimizes their mutual potential energy.

Wait, but if the 12 charges are identical and positive, their potential energy would be lower when they are as far apart as possible. But without knowing their exact arrangement, it's hard to calculate. Unless the problem is designed so that only the interactions between the central charge and the 12 are considered, and the 12's mutual interactions are neglected. But that might not make sense because the problem is about the total energy of the system.

Alternatively, maybe the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is zero or something else. But that's not likely. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, the problem says it's an isolated system. So the total energy is the sum of all the potential energies between each pair of charges. So that would include the 12 interactions each with the central charge, and all the possible interactions between the 12 charges themselves.

But calculating all those interactions would be complicated because we don't know their arrangement. So perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge's interactions, but that seems unlikely because the 12 charges would have their own interactions.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy. So perhaps the minimal energy is achieved when the mutual interactions are as small as possible, but without more information, I can't really compute that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the interactions between the central charge and the 12 others, and not the mutual interactions among the 12. Let me read the problem again. It says, 'the 12 ... are constrained to stay at 2m from P. The 13th is fixed at P.' So perhaps the positions of the 12 are fixed at 2m from P, so their mutual distances are variable, but the problem doesn't give more details. So perhaps we're supposed to assume that the only interactions are between each of the 12 and the central charge. Because otherwise, without knowing the arrangement, we can't compute the mutual potential energies.

Alternatively, maybe the mutual potential energies are zero because the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are infinity, but that's not possible. Or perhaps the charges are arranged symmetrically around P, but I don't have enough data to calculate that.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to proceed with what I can calculate. So the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the central charge would each be U = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m). Let me compute that.

First, compute each U:

k ≈ 8.988e9 N·m²/C²
e = 1.602e-19 C
so 2e = 3.204e-19 C.

So each U is:

U = (8.988e9) * (3.204e-19)^2 / (2)
= (8.988e9) * (1.026e-37) ) / 2
Wait, let's compute (3.204e-19)^2: 3.204^2 is about 10.26, so 10.26e-38 C².

So U = (8.988e9) * (10.26e-38) ) / 2
= (8.988 * 10.26) / 2 * 1e-28.

Compute 8.988 * 10.26: approximately 92.33.

92.33 / 2 = 46.165.

So U ≈ 46.165e-28 J.

Each of the 12 charges contributes this, so total U would be 12 * 46.165e-28 = 554e-28 J.

Wait, 554e-28 is 5.54e-26 J.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 5.645e-26, option B 2.822e-26, etc.

Hmm, but 5.54e-26 is close to option A, but not exactly matching. Did I make a miscalculation?

Wait, let me re-calculate that.

First, (2e)^2 = (2 * 1.602e-19)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2.

3.204e-19 squared is:

3.204^2 = approximately 10.265.

So 10.265e-38 C².

Multiply by k: 8.988e9 * 10.265e-38.

8.988e9 * 10.265e-38 = (8.988 * 10.265) * 1e-28 + (since 1e9 * 1e-38 is 1e-29? Wait, no. 1e9 * 1e-38 = 1e-29. Oh wait, wait:

Wait, 8.988e9 is 8.988 x 10^9, and 10.265e-38 is 1.0265 x 10^(-37). So when I multiply 8.988e9 * 10.265e-38: it's 8.988 * 10.265 = ~92.23, and exponents: 10^9 * 10^-37 = 10^-28. So 92.23e-28.

Then divide by 2: 92.23 / 2 = 46.115e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12 pairs: 46.115e-28 * 12 = 553.38e-28 J.

553.38e-28 is 5.5338e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.645e-26, which is a bit higher than that.

Wait, but perhaps I made an approximation in the calculation. Let me be more precise.

Compute (2e)^2: exactly, (2 * 1.602176634e-19)^2 = (3.204353268e-19)^2.

That's 3.204353268^2 = approximately 10.265 approximately, but let me compute it more accurately.

3.204353268 * 3.204353268.

3.2^2 is 10.24.

But to get more precise:

3.204353268 * 3.204353268 = (3 + 0.204353268)^2 = 9 + 2*3*0.204353268 + (0.204353268)^2.

= 9 + 1.226119608 + 0.0417552 (approx)

So 9 + 1.2261 = 10.2261, plus 0.0417552 gives about 10.2678552.

So (2e)^2 = 10.2678552e-38 C².

Now U per pair is k*(4e²)/(2m) → but wait, wait no, U is k*(q1 q2)/r.

Wait, wait, no. Each charge is 2e, so q1=q2=2e. So U = k*(2e * 2e)/(2 m).

So U = (k *4 e² ) / (2 m) = (2 k e² ) / m.

Wait, m is the distance, which is 2 meters. So U = (2 * k * e² ) / 2 = k e².

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let's do the units.

Wait, no. Because U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2). So that's (4 e² k) / 2 = 2 e² k.

Ah, so each pair contributes 2 e² k.

So 12 pairs would contribute 24 e² k.

Wait, no, wait.

Each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from the central charge. So each pair contributes U = k*(2e * 2e) / 2m.

So U = k *4 e² / (2 * 2m), wait no, r is 2m.

Wait, no, r is 2 meters. So:

U = (k) * (2e * 2e) / (2) → (k *4 e²)/(2) = 2 k e².

So each pair contributes 2 k e².

So 12 pairs contribute 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Wait, no, because each of the 12 charges is interacting with the central charge once. So 12 interactions, each contributing 2 k e².

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Each of the 12 charges has a potential energy of U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m), which is (4 e² k) / (2) = 2 e² k.

So each U is 2 e² k, and 12 of them give 24 e² k.

Wait, but perhaps the correct expression is U = (k * q1 q2) / r.

So for each pair:

q1 = 2e, q2 = 2e, r=2.

So U = k * (2e)(2e) / 2 = (4 e² k) / 2 = 2 e² k.

Yes, so each pair contributes 2 e² k.

So 12 pairs would sum up to 12 * 2 e² k = 24 e² k.

So the total potential energy is 24 e² k.

Let me compute that.

Compute e squared: (1.602176634e-19 C)^2 = approximately 2.56698e-38 C².

So e² is about 2.56698e-38.

Multiply by k: 8.988e9 * 2.56698e-38 = let's compute 8.988e9 * 2.56698e-38.

Multiply 8.988 * 2.56698 ≈ 23.08.

Then, 1e9 * 1e-38 = 1e-29.

So 23.08e-29 → 2.308e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.308e-28 = 55.392e-28 = 5.5392e-27 J.

Wait, 55.392e-28 is 5.5392e-27 J.

But wait, that's not matching any of the options given. The options are around 1e-26 or 1e-27. Option C is 7.056e-27, but that's lower than 5.539e-27.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate step by step.

First, compute 2e: 2 * 1.602176634e-19 C = 3.204353268e-19 C.

Each charge is 3.204353268e-19 C.

So each pair is (3.204353268e-19)^2 = (3.204353268)^2 * (1e-38) C². Let's compute 3.204353268 squared: 3.204353268 * 3.204353268.

3.2 * 3.2 = 10.24.

But more accurately:

3.204353268 * 3.204353268 = ?

Let me compute it:

3.204353268
* 3.204353268
= ?

Well, 3 * 3 =9, 3 * 0.204353268 = 0.613059804, 0.204353268 *3 = same 0.613059804, and 0.204353268^2 is ~0.041755.

So adding:

9 + 0.613059804 + 0.613059804 + 0.041755 = 9 + 1.226119608 + 0.041755 = 10.267874608.

So 3.204353268^2 ≈ 10.267874608.

So (2e)^2 = 10.267874608e-38 C².

Now, the potential energy per pair is U = (k * (2e)^2) / r, where r is 2 m.

So U = (8.988e9 N·m²/C² * 10.267874608e-38 C²) ) / 2 m.

Compute numerator:

8.988e9 * 10.267874608e-38 = (8.988 * 10.267874608) * 1e-28.

Compute 8.988 * 10.267874608.

8 *10 is 80, 0.988 *10 is ~9.88, so 89.88 so far.

Wait, but accurately: 8.988 *10.267874608.

Let me compute 8.988 *10 = 89.88.

8.988 *0.267874608 ≈ let's compute 8.988 *0.2 =1.7976; 8.988 *0.067874608 ≈ approximately 0.611.

So total is 89.88 +1.7976 + 0.611 ≈ 92.2886.

So 8.988 *10.267874608 ≈92.2886.

So numerator is ~92.2886e-28.

Divide by 2 (since r=2):

92.2886e-28 / 2 =46.1443e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 46.1443e-28 *12 = 553.7316e-28 J.

553.7316e-28 J is 5.537316e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.645e-26, which is a bit higher than 5.537e-26. So perhaps I made a miscalculation, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, could it be that I'm not considering the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges? Because if I include those, the total energy would be higher, since those would be repulsive as well.

But I don't know how to compute the mutual potential energies without knowing their arrangement. However, since the problem is asking for the minimum energy, perhaps the mutual potential energies are zero if the charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy is minimized. But that would require them to be as far apart as possible, which isn't possible if they're all at 2m from P. Because the mutual distances could vary, but without knowing the arrangement, I can't compute that.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energies are not considered, and the problem is only considering the interactions with the central charge. But that would mean the options would have a value around 5.5e-26, which is closest to option A (5.645e-26). But perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of e, like e = 1.602176634e-19 C.

Let me recalculate using exact values where possible.

Compute (2e)^2 = (2 * 1.602176634e-19)^2 = (3.204353268e-19)^2 = (3.204353268)^2 * (1e-38) C².

As before, (3.204353268)^2 =10.2678746e0.

So (2e)^2 =10.2678746e-38 C².

U per pair = (8.988e9) * (10.2678746e-38) / 2.

So 8.988e9 =8.988 *1e9.

Multiply 8.988 * 10.2678746 = let's compute that more accurately.

10 *8.988 = 89.88.

0.2678746 *8.988 ≈ 0.2678746 *8 =2.1429968, 0.2678746 *0.988≈ 0.2647.

So total ≈2.1429968 +0.2647=2.4076968.

So total 89.88 +2.4076968=92.2876968.

So 8.988e9 *10.2678746e-38 =92.2876968e-28.

Then divide by 2: 46.1438484e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 46.1438484e-28 *12 = 553.726181e-28 J.

Which is 5.53726181e-26 J.

Now, looking at the options:

A)5.645e-26 → 5.645 x10^-26 J.

B)2.822e-26 →2.822e-26.

C)7.056e-27 →0.7056e-26.

So our calculation gives 5.537e-26, which is close to option A, but not exactly matching. Hmm, perhaps the actual calculation would give a slightly higher value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the potential energy. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps I should use the exact Coulomb's constant.

Wait, Coulomb's constant k is approximately 8.9875517879e9 N·m²/C². Let me use that exact value.

So k = 8.9875517879e9.

Now, compute 8.9875517879e9 *10.2678746e-38.

Compute 8.9875517879 *10.2678746.

Let me compute that step by step.

10 * 8.9875517879 =89.875517879.

0.2678746 *8.9875517879.

Compute 0.2 *8.9875517879 =1.7975103576.

0.06 *8.9875517879=0.5392531073.

0.0078746 *8.9875517879 ≈ approximately 0.07075.

Adding those: 1.79751 +0.53925=2.33676 +0.07075=2.40751.

So total 89.875517879 +2.40751=92.283027879.

So k*(2e)^2 =92.283027879e-28.

Divide by r=2: 46.141513939e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12:46.141513939e-28 *12=553.6981673e-28 J.

Which is 5.536981673e-26 J.

Hmm, still around 5.537e-26 J.

But none of the options exactly match this. The closest option is A:5.645e-26.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Because the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each interacting, so 12 interactions. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each of the 12 charges interacts with the 13th, and each of the 12 charges interacts with each of the other 11 charges. But if the problem is only asking for the potential energy between the 13th charge and the others, then the mutual interactions are not considered, and the answer is 5.537e-26 J.

But wait, the options given don't include that. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is considered. For example, if the 12 charges are arranged in a regular dodecahedron or something around the central charge, but that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy of each of the 12 charges relative to the central charge, but perhaps I should consider the potential energy of each charge in the field of all other charges.

Wait, but the central charge is 2e. Each of the 12 charges is 2e. So each of the 12 contributes a potential energy of U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2) =2 k e².

But then, each of the 12 charges also contributes to the potential energy of the others. So for example, each charge at 2m from P would be in the field of the other 11 charges. But without knowing their arrangement, this is tricky.

Wait, but perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are very large, making their mutual potential energy negligible. But that's probably not the case. Alternatively, perhaps they're arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy is zero, but that's not possible with positive charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energies are zero, which would only be the case if the charges are arranged in a way that their mutual forces cancel out, which is not possible unless they are arranged symmetrically in a way that each charge's mutual potential energy cancels, but that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12 others, and not the mutual energies between the 12. So the total would be 12 * U, where U is 2 k e².

So U_total = 24 k e².

Wait, let me compute 24 k e².

k=8.98755e9.

e=1.602176634e-19.

So e²= (1.602176634e-19)^2 =2.56698e-38.

So 24 *8.98755e9 *2.56698e-38.

Compute 24 *8.98755e9 = 215.7e9.

Then multiply by 2.56698e-38:

215.7e9 *2.56698e-38 = (215.7 *2.56698) *1e-29.

Compute 215.7 *2.56698:

200 *2.56698=513.396.

15.7 *2.56698 ≈15*2.56698=38.5047, 0.7*2.56698=1.7968 → total 38.5047+1.7968=40.3015.

So total 513.396 +40.3015=553.6975.

So 553.6975e-29 →5.536975e-26 J.

Which is the same as before.

So the total potential energy is 5.536975e-26 J.

But none of the options have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the problem says that the system is isolated, so the potential energy includes all pairs. So perhaps I should calculate the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the central charge, and also between each pair of the 12 charges.

But without knowing the arrangement, I can't compute the mutual potential energies. So perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual potential energies are zero, which isn't the case. Or perhaps the mutual potential energies are considered negligible, but that's not likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energies are zero because the charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy is zero, but that's not possible unless their arrangement is such that their mutual forces cancel, which is only possible in certain symmetrical arrangements, but I can't assume that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the potential energy due to the central charge, and not the mutual terms. In that case, the answer would be approximately 5.537e-26 J, which is close to option A (5.645e-26), but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exponents.

Wait, let me re-express the calculation.

k =8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e=1.602e-19 C.

(2e)^2 =4e².

Each pair contributes U = k*(2e)^2 / 2.

So U = (8.988e9) * (4e²) / 2.

Wait, 4e² is 4*(1.602e-19)^2 =4*(2.566e-38) =1.0264e-37 C².

Wait, no, wait. 4e² is 4*(1.602e-19)^2 =4*(2.566e-38) =1.0264e-37 C².

So U = (8.988e9) * (1.0264e-37) / 2.

So 8.988e9 *1.0264e-37 =8.988 *1.0264e-28 = approx (8.988 *1.0264)=9.223e-28.

Wait, 8.988 *1.0264 =?

8 *1.0264=8.2112.

0.988 *1.0264= approximately 1.014.

So total approx 8.2112 +1.014=9.2252.

So 9.2252e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.6126e-28 per pair.

Multiply by 12: 4.6126e-28 *12 =55.3512e-28 =5.53512e-27 J.

Wait, that's 5.535e-27, which is 0.5535e-26.

Wait, no, 55.35e-28 is 5.535e-27 J. Oh wait, no: 1e-28 *12 is 12e-28 =1.2e-27. So 4.6126e-28 *12 is 55.3512e-28=5.53512e-27 J.

Wait, that's 5.535e-27 J, which is 0.5535e-26 J.

But that's not matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait a second, maybe I should consider that each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from P, and the 13th charge is at P. So each of the 12 interacts with the 13th, and each of the 12 also interacts with the other 11. But without knowing their arrangement, it's impossible to compute the mutual potential energies. So perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th charge.

In that case, the total potential energy would be 12 * [k*(2e)^2/(2)] =12*(2ke²) =24 ke².

Compute 24 *k *e²:

k=8.988e9,

e²= (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

So 24 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38 = ?

24 *8.988e9 =215.712e9 =2.15712e11.

Multiply by 2.566e-38: 2.15712e11 *2.566e-38 =5.536e-27 J.

Wait, that's 5.536e-27 J, which is 0.5536e-26 J.

Wait, that's 5.536e-27 J, which is option C:7.056e-27 is higher than that.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the exponents. Let me compute 24 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

24 *8.988e9 =24 *8.988 =215.712 → 215.712e9 =2.15712e11.

2.15712e11 *2.566e-38 = (2.15712 *2.566) *1e-27.

Compute 2.15712 *2.566:

2 *2.566=5.132.

0.15712 *2.566≈0.403.

Total ≈5.132 +0.403=5.535.

So 5.535e-27 J.

Which is 5.535e-27 J, which is 0.5535e-26 J.

So the value is 5.535e-27 J. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the system's potential energy is the sum of all pairs. So that's the 12 pairs between the central charge and the others, plus the combinations between the 12 charges themselves.

But without knowing their arrangement, I can't compute the latter. So perhaps the problem is only considering the 12 pairs, giving 5.535e-26 J as the total potential energy.

Wait, no, wait. 12 pairs of central charge and others give 5.535e-26 J?

Wait, no, earlier calculation said 5.535e-26 J, but that was without considering the mutual interactions. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge's interactions, and the answer is approximately 5.535e-26 J, which would round to 5.535e-26, but the closest option is A:5.645e-26.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Because the 13th charge is fixed, and there are 12 others, each interacting once. So 12 pairs, yes.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem uses the formula for potential energy as the work done to bring each charge from infinity to its position. So for each charge, the potential energy added is (k * q * Q)/r, where Q is the total charge at P.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed, so when bringing each of the 12 charges into place, the potential at P due to the 13th charge is (k * 2e) / 0 as r approaches zero, which is infinite. So that approach might not work. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, without considering that the 13th charge's potential changes as the others are placed.

But perhaps the problem is assuming that the 13th charge is fixed and doesn't move, so bringing each of the 12 charges to their positions would involve the potential due to the 13th charge only, not considering the other 11.

But that's a different approach. Let me think.

The potential energy added when bringing each charge would be the charge multiplied by the potential at the point where it's placed.

So, the potential at point P due to the 13th charge is (k * 2e)/0 → infinite. So that's a problem. So perhaps that approach isn't feasible. Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is calculated as the sum of all pairwise potentials, including between each of the 12 charges, which requires knowing their arrangement.

But without knowing their arrangement, the problem must be simplifying by considering only the interactions with the central charge.

In that case, the answer would be approximately 5.535e-26 J, which isn't exactly any of the options. But the closest option is A)5.645e-26.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial steps. Let me check once again.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy between two charges is U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q1 q2)/r.

1/(4πε₀) is Coulomb's constant k, which is approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So each pair contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) =k*(4e²)/(2) = 2 k e².

So each of the 12 pairs contributes 2 k e².

Total U = 12 *2 k e² =24 k e².

Compute 24 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, (1.602e-19)^2 is 2.566e-38.

So 24 *8.988e9 =215.712e9.

Multiply by 2.566e-38: 215.712e9 *2.566e-38 = (215.712 *2.566) *1e-29.

Compute 215.712 *2.566.

200 *2.566=513.2.

15.712 *2.566≈ let's compute 15 *2.566=38.49, 0.712 *2.566≈1.825.

So total 38.49 +1.825=40.315.

So 513.2 +40.315=553.515.

So 553.515e-29 →5.53515e-26 J.

Hmm, same as before.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option B:2.822e-26, which is roughly half of what I calculated. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Wait, 13 charges, each with 2e. So the 13th is fixed, and the other 12 are at 2m. So each of the 12 interacts with the 13th. So 12 interactions, each contributing 2 k e². So 24 k e
