Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about finding the normalization constant 'a' for a wave function. So, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, right? And the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3 when measured. So, the wave function must be zero outside this region, but here they're telling me that the wave function as given is valid where the particles can exist, which is between 1 and 3.

Wait, but the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm. Oh wait, I think I must read that again. The wave function is described as (a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5i. So, each term is the real and imaginary parts? Or is it a complex function where the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5?

Wait, that's an important point. Because the wave function must be a complex function, but when you measure the position, the probability is given by the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So the normalization condition is the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx over all space equals 1.

But wait, in this case, the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3, right? Because when they say that when measuring position, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So that implies that the wave function is zero outside that region. So, between 1 and 3, the wave function is given by (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But wait, no. Wait, the way it's written, the expression is (a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i. So, that's a complex wave function. So, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5.

Wait, but wait. That can't be right because if the wave function is written as (a/sqrt(1+x)) + (-0.5)i, then it's a complex function, but when you square the absolute value, you'll have (a/sqrt(...))² + (0.5)².

Hold on, but let's think about normalization. The integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must be equal to 1.

So, ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So, ψ(x) = A + B i, where A = a/sqrt(1+x), and B = -0.5.

So, |ψ(x)|² is A² + B². Which is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx equals 1.

Wait, but that seems a bit more complicated than I expected. Let me write that out:

∫ (from 1 to 3) [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

So, I can split the integral into two parts. The first integral is a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3. The second integral is 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3.

Calculating each part:

First integral: a² ∫ dx/(1+x) from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x), right? So evaluated from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So that's a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 * (3 -1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the sum of the two is a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, setting the equation:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides:

a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

So, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So, 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213. Then, a is the square root of that, so sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is around 0.85.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that would be the answer.

Wait a second—did I make a mistake in the setup? Because in the wave function, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So the wave function is a complex number. So the absolute square is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2, which is what I used. So the calculation seems right.

Hmm, but another thought: sometimes wave functions are given with the real and imaginary parts, but perhaps I should consider that the entire thing is the real part, but that doesn't make sense because the presence of 'i' indicates it's a complex number. So, I think my initial approach is correct.

So, a is approximately 0.85, which is option B.


To determine the normalization constant \( a \) for the given wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), we use the normalization condition:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

Since the wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the integral simplifies to:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

The wave function is complex, so \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \). Substituting this into the integral:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This can be split into two integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 1.
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
   \]
   Thus, the first term becomes \( a^2 \ln(2) \).

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 0.25 (3-1) = 0.5.
   \]

Combining these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
