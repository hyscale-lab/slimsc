Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and then we're supposed to react it through a series of reagents to find the final product. The options are A to D, each a different aldehyde or similar structure with phenyl groups.

First, let me think about the NMR data. Let's list the peaks:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet. That's a pretty high chemical shift, so probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm, and the triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, but waitâ€”no, wait. Aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and appear as singlets because they don't have adjacent protons. Hmm, could it be something else? Maybe an enol proton? Or perhaps an aromatic proton that's in a para position to an electron-withdrawing group? Or maybe an aldehyde with some adjacent substituents causing splitting?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The aldehyde proton is usually a singlet because it's only attached to one carbon and has no adjacent protons. So if this 9.72 is a triplet, maybe it's not an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system where coupling is possible. Or perhaps it's a formyl group adjacent to a CH2, but that would split into a quartet, not a triplet. Hmm, not sure yet.

Next, looking at the aromatic protons. The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm are doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent and each couple with each other, giving a doublet. So, perhaps two para-substituted benzene rings, or one with substituents at para positions.

Then there's 6.27 ppm, a broad singlet integrating for 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange or being in a conjugated system where the proton is not very deshielded. Wait, or maybe it's an enol proton, which is often broad due to hydrogen bonding or rapid exchange.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That's probably a methylene group (CH2) attached to something electronegative, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group. Or perhaps adjacent to an oxygen, like in a carbonyl group.

So putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents and an adjacent group.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2= (10)/2=5. So 5 degrees: could be a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and a ring or double bond (1), or another double bond.

Wait, benzene is 3 degrees, another double bond could be an aldehyde (1) and maybe another double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring, a carbonyl, and some other substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a benzene ring, an aldehyde group, and some substituents like OCH2 or similar.
