Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again carefully.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction involves butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each pairing A and B with different reagents.

Hmm, I remember that nitriles can be formed from ketones through a substitution reaction. Oh wait, that's the cyanide addition reaction. But wait, ketones reacting with CN- usually form secondary alcohol cyanohydrins. Right, the cyanohydrin reaction. So in the first reaction, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN. NaCN is a source of CN- ions. But the reaction is probably under acidic conditions, because the cyanohydrin formation typically requires an acid catalyst.

Wait, in the cyanohydrin formation, ketones react with CN- under acidic conditions. The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then the CN- attacks, and water acts as a nucleophile, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin. But wait, in this case, the product is a nitrile and a hydroxyl group. Oh wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, perhaps under acidic conditions, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's look at the product structure: the nitrile is attached to the same carbon as the hydroxyl group. So that's a cyanohydrin. So the reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin, which requires an acid catalyst.

So for the first reaction, reagent A is probably H3O+ (acid). Because NaCN is a weak base, so to generate the CN- in solution, you need an acidic condition. H3O+ would help generate HCN, but wait, wait. Or, maybe the reaction is in a solution with HCN and acid. Oh wait, no. NaCN is a soluble salt, but in aqueous solution, CN- is a weak base and can react with water. So in acidic conditions, the H+ would protonate the CN- to form HCN, which is a weaker base. Wait, but that might not help. Or perhaps the reaction is using a strong acid as a catalyst.

Wait, another possibility. Maybe the first reaction is a nucleophilic addition of CN- to the ketone, forming the cyanohydrin. So the reagent A is H3O+ (acid). So in the options, let's look for A being H3O+.

Looking at the options, option A has A=H3O+, B=HCl. Option B has A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH. Options C and D have A=NaHSO3, which I don't remember being used in cyanohydrin formation.

So for the first reaction, I think A should be H3O+, so options A or B are possible.

Now the second reaction: the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The reagent is B, which is H2O. The product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, how is a nitrile converted into a carboxylic acid? Oh, I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. The typical reactions are either using H3O+ and heat for acidic hydrolysis, which gives a carboxylic acid, or using a strong base like NaOH (with maybe some H2O2 or other oxidizing agents sometimes involved?).

Wait, but the reagent here is B, which is H2O. Wait, no, the question says reagent B is H2O. So reagent B is H2O, but what's the other part? Oh wait, perhaps the reagent is an acid or a base. Looking back, the options specify what B is. For example, option A says B=HCl, but the problem states that in the second reaction, B is H2O. Wait, no—the question says in the second reaction, the reagent is B (H2O). Wait, perhaps I misread that. The way the question is written is a bit confusing.

Wait, the second reaction is written as: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → product.

Hmm, perhaps the reagent is H2O, but under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe B is a catalyst or something else. Wait, perhaps the reagents are as follows: in the second reaction, the reagent is H2O with an acid or base catalyst.

Wait, wait, the problem says reagent B is H2O. So in the second reaction, H2O is the reagent. But how does that lead to a carboxylic acid? Normally, hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids requires more than just water. It usually requires strong acid (like H2SO4, HCl) or strong base (like NaOH, KOH) as a catalyst.

Wait, maybe the reaction uses a strong acid or base in the presence of water. So perhaps reagent B is HCl (acid) or another acid.

Wait, but according to the question, in the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is H2O. Maybe the reagent is something else, like HCl in water? Or perhaps B is an acid or base, and the reaction is done in H2O.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me restate the problem.

First reaction:

Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Second reaction:

2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So in the second reaction, the nitrile is converted into a carboxylic acid. So the reagent B is either an acid or a base, but the question says that B is H2O. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps, in the options, B is the catalyst, and the reaction is done in water.

Wait, looking back at the options, each option gives A and B, which are the reagents. For example, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl.

So in the first reaction, the reagent A is H3O+ (like HCl or H2SO4), and in the second, reagent B is HCl.

Wait, but the second reaction's reagent is given as H2O. Wait, maybe the reagent B is HCl, but the solvent is H2O. Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question.

Wait, looking at the question again: the second reaction uses B as the reagent, which is H2O. So perhaps the way the question is structured is that in the first reaction, A is the reagent (like acid), and in the second reaction, the reagent is H2O with some acid or base.

Alternatively, perhaps the second reaction is a hydrolysis of the nitrile group. The hydrolysis of nitriles can be done in acidic or basic conditions. If the reaction is in the presence of H2O and an acid, that would be acidic hydrolysis. Alternatively, in basic conditions with H2O, it would form the carboxylate, which would then be acidified.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid, so if the hydrolysis is done in acidic conditions, the nitrile would become a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, if done in basic conditions, you'd get the sodium salt, which is then acidified to the carboxylic acid.

So in the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is H2O. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is a catalyst, like H2O as a solvent, and the actual reagent is an acid or base.

Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid, so the reaction must be done under acidic hydrolysis. So reagent B would be HCl (acid) in water.

Wait, but looking at the options, for the second reaction, the reagent B is either HCl or CH3COOH. Because in the options, each option assigns a B.

Wait, perhaps in the second reaction, the reagent is H2O with acid (like HCl) as a catalyst.

So, the second reaction must be done under acidic conditions. So reagent B is HCl (option A or C), or perhaps another acid.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.

Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH.

In the first reaction, A is H3O+ (from options A and B), which fits the cyanohydrin formation requiring acid. So A is H3O+.

In the second reaction, for the nitrile to hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid, we need an acid catalyst. So B would be an acid, like HCl (option A or C) or perhaps CH3COOH (if it's a mild acid).

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, which is more likely to be used for hydrolysis of nitriles. CH3COOH is a weaker acid. Does the hydrolysis of nitriles proceed under acetic acid conditions? I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's done under basic conditions, but then you'd need to acidify afterward.

Wait, another thought: the first reaction is the cyanohydrin formation. That requires an acid catalyst, which fits with A being H3O+.

The second reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. The standard conditions are strong acid or base. If the reaction is done in acidic conditions, then adding HCl (a strong acid) would be appropriate. Alternatively, if it's done in a weak acid, like acetic acid, that might also work, but perhaps not as effectively.

Looking at the options, for B, option A has B=HCl, which would be a strong acid, suitable for the hydrolysis. Option B has B=CH3COOH (acetic acid), which is a weaker acid.

So, considering the second reaction, which reagent would work? Let's think about nitrile hydrolysis. The reaction typically requires either a strong acid (like HCl) in aqueous conditions or a strong base (like NaOH) followed by acid work-up.

Wait, but the product is the carboxylic acid, so if the reaction is done in an acidic aqueous solution, then perhaps HCl is the reagent. So in the second reaction, reagent B is HCl.

So putting it together: first reaction uses A=H3O+ (acid), so options A or B. Second reaction uses B=HCl (acid), so option A.

So looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH.

So, if the second reaction uses HCl, then option A is the correct pair.

Wait, but what about the actual process in the second reaction? The starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. When you hydrolyze the nitrile, you have to consider if the hydroxyl group is activated for any reaction. Wait, the molecule is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So, the nitrile is on a carbon adjacent to a hydroxyl group. That might make the nitrile more reactive for hydrolysis.

Wait, but when nitriles are hydrolyzed, they typically form either amides or carboxylic acids, depending on the conditions. In acidic conditions, you get the carboxylic acid.

So, for the second reaction, adding HCl (acid) in H2O would facilitate the hydrolysis, turning the nitrile into a carboxylic acid.

So putting it all together, reagent A is H3O+ (from NaHSO4 or HCl or something), and reagent B is HCl.

Looking at the options, that's option A.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Yes, that fits.

So the correct answer should be option A.


The problem involves determining the suitable reagents for two reactions. 

### First Reaction:
**Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**  
This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, where a ketone reacts with cyanide ions (CN⁻) under acidic conditions. The acid catalyst (H₃O⁺) is necessary to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better leaving group, and facilitates the nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Therefore, reagent A must be H₃O⁺.

### Second Reaction:
**2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**  
This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Nitriles are typically hydrolyzed in the presence of water and an acid catalyst. Among the options, HCl (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent (B) for this reaction, as it provides the acidic conditions needed for the conversion of the nitrile into a carboxylic acid.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  This matches the requirements for both reactions: H₃O⁺ for the cyanohydrin formation and HCl for the nitrile hydrolysis.  
- **Option B:** A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  While CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is an acid, it is weaker than HCl and less effective for the hydrolysis of nitriles.  
- **Option C:** A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  NaHSO₃ is not typically used for cyanohydrin formation, making this option incorrect.  
- **Option D:** A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  Similar to Option C, NaHSO₃ is unsuitable for the first reaction, and CH₃COOH is less effective for the second reaction.  

### Conclusion:
The correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which are provided in **Option A**.
