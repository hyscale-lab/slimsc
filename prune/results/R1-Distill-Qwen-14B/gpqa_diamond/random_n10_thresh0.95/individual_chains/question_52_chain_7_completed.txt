Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem describes a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

The key part of the question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. We're also told to assume LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) in the stellar photosphere.

Hmm, okay. So, I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation and the distribution of atoms in different energy levels. The Boltzmann factor relates the populations of two energy levels based on temperature. The ratio of the number of atoms in two levels (n1 and n2) is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the overall temperature is lower. Let me think about that. The ratio n1/n2 depends on the exponential term. If the temperature decreases, what happens to the ratio?

Let me think. Suppose level 1 is lower in energy than level 2. Then E1 < E2. So (E1 - E2) would be negative. The exponent becomes positive. So as T decreases, the exponent's denominator is smaller, which makes the entire exponent larger. Or wait, no: if T is lower, then (E1-E2)/(k*T) would be a larger negative number because E1-E2 is negative. Let me recast it: let's say we have two energy levels, say, level 2 is higher than level 1. So E2 = E1 + delta E. Then E1 - E2 = -delta E. So the exponent becomes (-delta E)/(k T). So the ratio is (g1/g2) * exp( (delta E)/(k T) ) ? No, wait, because E1-E2 = -delta E, so -(E1-E2)= delta E. So the ratio is (g1/g2) * exp( delta E / (k T) ).

But wait, if the temperature drops, and delta E is positive, then the exponent (delta E/(k T)) increases because T is smaller. So the exponential term increases. So if the ratio n1/n2 increases with higher T or decreases with lower T? Let's think in terms of when T is high, the population is more spread out, so higher energy levels are more populated. Wait, no, at high T, the exponential becomes less steep. Wait, no, for a given delta E, higher T makes the exponent (delta E)/(k T) smaller, so the exponential is closer to 1, meaning the ratio is higher. So as T increases, the ratio (n1/n2) increases because higher temperature makes the distribution more spread, so higher energy levels have more population. Wait, but wait, n1 is the lower level, and n2 is the higher level. So the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )? Or is it the other way around.

Wait, perhaps I should write it correctly. Let me define the two levels: let's say level 1 is lower in energy than level 2. So E1 < E2. The Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So if E2 > E1, E2-E1 is positive. So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the exp term is larger. So n2/n1 increases as T increases. That would mean that the ratio n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) would decrease as T increases. Wait, because n2/n1 increases, so n1/n2 decreases. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Wait, no. Let's take a numerical example. Suppose E2 - E1 is 1000 K in terms of energy (but that's not correct units, but let's just use K for simplification). So, when T is 5000 K, the exponent is -1000/5000 = -0.2. The exp(-0.2) is about 0.8187. So n2/n1 is (g2/g1) * 0.8187. If g's are 1, then n2/n1 is ~0.8187. So n1/n2 is ~1.22.

Wait, but when T increases to 6000 K, the exponent is -1000/6000 ≈ -0.1667. exp(-0.1667) ≈ 0.8466. So n2/n1 increases from 0.8187 to 0.8466. So n1/n2 decreases from 1.22 to about 1.18. So yes, when T increases, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So the ratio goes down as T increases. Therefore, when T decreases, the ratio increases. Because, when T is lower, the exponent is more negative, so the exponential term is smaller, making n2/n1 lower, which makes n1/n2 higher.

Wait, but in our problem, when there are spots, the effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. The ratio n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots. So when T is 5500 K, n1/n2 is lower than when T was 6000 K? That doesn't make sense based on the earlier example.

Wait, no. Wait, in the problem statement, when the star has spots (T =5500 K), the ratio n1/n2 is lower than when the spots are not present (T=6000 K). Which suggests that at higher T, n1/n2 is higher. Wait, because when T increases, n1/n2 decreases. So, higher T leads to lower ratio. So when the star has spots (lower T), ratio is lower. So when the star doesn't have spots (higher T, 6000K), the ratio is higher. But according to the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So that aligns with the model. So the ratio is inversely related to T.

Wait, but in the example I did, T going from 5000 to 6000 K, the ratio n1/n2 went from about 1.22 to 1.18, which is a decrease. So if the star's T goes up (no spots, 6000K), the ratio n1/n2 goes down. When the star has spots (T=5500K), which is lower than 6000, the ratio would be higher.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Wait, that's conflicting. Because according to the model, when the star's T is lower (with spots), the ratio should be higher. But in the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So maybe I got the levels reversed.

Wait, perhaps I should define the levels correctly. Let me think again. Let's say n1 is the higher energy level and n2 is the lower one. Wait no, that can't be. Or maybe I should consider the transition: the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. That would be in the near UV or visible range. So if it's an emission or absorption line, that depends on the energy difference between the levels.

Wait, but let's get back. The problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T decreases, ratio decreases. So the ratio is inversely proportional to T. Wait, that can't be right because in our example, when T increased, the ratio went down. So if the ratio decreases when T decreases, that would mean that the ratio is inversely proportional to T. But according to the Boltzmann equation, the ratio is proportional to exp( delta E / (kT) ), which would increase as T decreases. So that would cause the ratio to increase when T decreases.

But the problem says the ratio decreases when T is lower. So perhaps I got the levels backward. Let me think: perhaps n1 is the higher energy level, n2 is the lower one. So the ratio being n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ). If E1 > E2, then E1 - E2 is positive, so the exponent is -(positive)/(k T) = negative. So the ratio is (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T) ). So, as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the exp term increases, making the ratio higher. So when T is higher, the ratio n1/n2 is higher.

But in the problem, when T is lower (5500 K), the ratio is lower. So when the star has spots (T=5500), the ratio is lower than when it's spotless (T=6000). That aligns with the model: higher T gives higher ratio. So, with spots, T is lower, ratio is lower. So the ratio when spotless is higher.

Wait, but the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

Because the ratio is lower when T is lower, the no-spots case has a higher ratio than the spotted case. So the factor is greater than 1.

So the question is, how much does (n1/n2) increase when T increases from 5500 K to 6000 K.

So, I need to compute the ratio of (n1/n2) at T1=6000 K to (n1/n2) at T2=5500 K.

Assuming that the statistical weights (g1 and g2) are the same for both cases, so the ratio g1/g2 is a constant, which would cancel out when taking the ratio of (n1/n2) between the two temperatures.

So the ratio of the ratios would be exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) / exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) )) ?

Wait, no. Wait, the expression for (n1/n2) is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). Let me get that right.

Wait, no, the Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). So, n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). 

So, for each temperature, the (n1/n2) is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). 

So, the ratio (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = [ exp( (E2-E1)/(k * 6000) ) ] / [ exp( (E2-E1)/(k * 5500) ) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( (E2-E1)/k (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Wait, because:

exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b) = exp( (E2-E1)/k (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Wait, no. Wait, a is (E2-E1)/(k*6000), and b is (E2-E1)/(k*5500). So a - b = (E2-E1)/k (1/6000 - 1/5500). 

Alternatively, factor out (E2-E1)/k: 

a - b = (E2-E1)/k ( (1/6000) - (1/5500) ) 

Let me compute the term inside the exponent.

But wait, I'm not sure about the sign. Because when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases. So the exponent in (n1/n2) is (E2-E1)/(k T). So when T increases, the exponent decreases, so n1/n2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) would decrease. 

But wait, wait, that's confusing. Let's take it step by step. 

If E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive. So (E2-E1)/(k T) is positive. So as T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases. So the exponent is smaller. So the exp term is smaller, meaning n1/n2 is smaller. So when T is higher, n1/n2 is lower.

So, when the star is without spots (T=6000 K), the ratio (n1/n2) is lower than when the star has spots (T=5500 K). But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So that's conflicting. Wait, no, wait, the problem says "the ratio decreases when the star has spots." So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than when it doesn't have spots. So, when T is lower, the ratio is lower.

So, under T=6000 K (no spots), the ratio is higher than under T=5500 K (spots).

So, the factor we're looking for is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.

Which is exp( (E2-E1)/(k * 6000) ) / exp( (E2-E1)/(k * 5500) )

Which simplifies to exp( (E2-E1)/k (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Wait, no: 

It's [ exp( (E2-E1)/(k * 6000) ) ] / [ exp( (E2-E1)/(k *5500) ) ] = exp( (E2-E1)/k (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Wait, let me compute 1/6000 - 1/5500.

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667
1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818
So 1/6000 - 1/5500 = (0.000166667 - 0.000181818) ≈ -0.000015151

So the exponent is (E2-E1)/k * (-0.000015151)

Wait, but (E2-E1) is positive, so the product is negative. So the exponent is negative, which means the entire factor is less than 1. But that's not matching our earlier conclusion. Because we thought that the ratio when spotless is higher than when spotted.

Wait, this is conflicting. Let me re-examine.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me re-express the ratio.

(n1/n2)_no_spots = exp( (E2-E1)/(k * 6000) )
(n1/n2)_spots = exp( (E2-E1)/(k * 5500) )

So the ratio is [exp(a)]/[exp(b)] = exp(a - b) where a = (E2-E1)/(k*6000), b = (E2-E1)/(k*5500).

So a - b = (E2-E1)/k [1/6000 - 1/5500] = (E2-E1)/k [ (5500 - 6000)/(6000*5500) ) ]

Which is (E2-E1)/k * (-500)/(6000*5500)

So a - b is negative, so exp(a - b) is exp( negative ), which is less than 1. So the factor is less than 1, meaning the ratio (n1/n2)_no_spots is less than (n1/n2)_spots. But that's the opposite of what the problem says.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the levels. Let me think again. Maybe the ratio in the problem is n2/n1, not n1/n2. Because according to the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So let me check that.

If the ratio is n2/n1, then when T decreases, what happens? Let's see.

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So if E2 > E1, (E2-E1) is positive, so -(E2-E1) is negative. So the exponent is -(E2-E1)/(k T), which is negative. So as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, making exp term smaller. So n2/n1 would decrease as T decreases.

So if the ratio in the problem is n2/n1, then when T is lower, the ratio is lower. Which matches the problem statement. Because when the star has spots, T goes down, so n2/n1 ratio decreases.

So perhaps I was considering the wrong ratio earlier. The problem states that the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in level 1 to level 2 (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. But according to the Boltzmann equation, if the ratio is n2/n1, then it would decrease when T decreases. So perhaps the problem refers to the ratio n2/n1, not n1/n2.

Wait, the problem says, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)" observed to decrease when the star has spots. So the ratio could be either n1/n2 or n2/n1. But the problem just says it decreases, so perhaps the specific ordering doesn't matter. Let me think: in any case, the ratio depends on T in a way that would change.

But perhaps the way to approach this is to compute the ratio of the ratios, regardless of which level is which.

But wait, perhaps the key is to compute the ratio (n1/n2) when T is 6000 K compared to when T is 5500 K.

So the ratio of (n1/n2)_6000K / (n1/n2)_5500K = [exp( (E2-E1)/(k*6000) ) ] / [ exp( (E2-E1)/(k*5500) ) ] = exp( (E2-E1)/k [1/6000 - 1/5500] )

But as we saw, 1/6000 - 1/5500 is negative, so the exponent is negative. So the ratio is exp( negative ), which is less than 1. So the ratio (n1/n2) at 6000 K is less than that at 5500 K. But the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Wait, but when T is lower (spots), the ratio is... in this case, according to our calculation, the ratio would be higher, since (n1/n2)_6000 is less than (n1/n2)_5500. So, the ratio is higher when T is lower. Which contradicts the problem statement.

So perhaps I'm getting the levels wrong. Let me think again: maybe level 1 is higher in energy than level 2. So E1 > E2.

In that case, (E2 - E1) is negative. So the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) is negative. So the ratio (n1/n2) is (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) → which is (g1/g2) exp( negative ), so that's a small number. So when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes more negative, making the exponent smaller → exp term is smaller → ratio (n1/n2) is smaller.

So when T increases, (n1/n2) decreases. So when the star has spots, T is lower, so (n1/n2) is higher. Which would mean that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Wait, no, in that case, when T is higher, (n1/n2) is lower. So when the star is spotless (T=6000), (n1/n2) is lower than when it's spotted (T=5500), which would mean the ratio is higher when the star is spotted. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So that would be a contradiction.

Hmm. I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let me think about the transition wavelength. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, which is about 144.8 nm, which is in the UV. So this is a higher energy transition than visible light. So the energy difference would be E = hc/λ. 

Let me compute the energy difference between the two levels based on the given wavelength.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.
c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.
λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So E = hc / λ = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m) 

Calculating that: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

To convert to eV, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so E ≈ 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV.

Wait, that's a pretty large energy difference. So each photon corresponds to about 8.57 eV. That's a very high energy, which is in the X-ray range. Wait, wait, no, 1448 Å is 0.1448 microns, which is near UV. Hmm, but perhaps the energy is correct. Let me double-check.

Wait, 1448 Å is 144.8 nm. Using the formula E(eV) = 1240 / λ(nm), so E ≈ 1240 / 144.8 ≈ 8.57 eV. Yeah, that's correct. So the energy difference between the two levels is about 8.57 eV.

Wait, that's a huge energy gap. But perhaps that's correct. So E = 8.57 eV.

Now, using the Boltzmann equation, the ratio of populations depends on this energy and the temperature.

So, the ratio (n1/n2) is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). But wait, in our case, if E2 is the higher level, then E2-E1 is positive. So, when T increases, the exponent becomes smaller, making the ratio (n1/n2) smaller.

So, when T is higher (no spots, 6000 K), (n1/n2) is smaller than when T is lower (spots, 5500 K). But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T is lower, the ratio is lower. That's only possible if the ratio is n2/n1 and the energy difference is positive.

Wait, perhaps I should model the ratio as n2/n1 instead. Let me try that.

n2 is the lower level, n1 is the higher level. So E1 > E2. So E1-E2 = positive 8.57 eV. 

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ) → since E2-E1 is negative, -(E2-E1) is positive. So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) )

So when T increases, the exponent (E1-E2)/(k T) becomes smaller, so exp becomes closer to 1. So n2/n1 increases as T increases. 

So, when the star is without spots (T=6000 K), n2/n1 is higher than when it has spots (T=5500 K), meaning the ratio increases when T increases. But according to the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So if the ratio in question is n2/n1, then the problem's statement makes sense: when T is lower (spots), the ratio is lower.

So, the ratio refers to n2/n1, and when the star has spots, this ratio decreases.

So, the factor we're looking for is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots.

Which is [ (g2/g1) exp( (E1-E2)/(k *6000) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( (E1-E2)/(k *5500) ) ]

The g2/g1 terms cancel out, so the factor is exp( (E1-E2)/(k) [1/6000 - 1/5500 ] )

Wait, but (E1-E2) is positive, so let's compute the exponent:

(E1-E2)/(k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500 )

We can compute (1/6000 - 1/5500) as follows: 1/6000 = 0.000166667, 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818. So 1/6000 - 1/5500 = -0.000015151.

So (E1-E2) is positive, and multiplied by a negative number, so the exponent becomes negative.

So the factor is exp( (8.57 eV) / (k * T) ) * [1/6000 - 1/5500 ]

Wait, no, the factor is (E1-E2)/(k) multiplied by (1/6000 - 1/5500 )

Wait, let me compute the exponent.

(E1-E2) = 8.57 eV.

We need to compute (8.57 eV) / (k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500 )

But wait, since (1/6000 - 1/5500) is negative, the exponent is negative.

Wait, but let's compute the exact value.

First, compute (1/6000 - 1/5500 ) = (5500 - 6000)/(6000*5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) = -500 / 3.3e7 = approximately -1.51515e-5.

Now, (E1-E2) is 8.57 eV, and k is Boltzmann's constant, which is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So, (E1-E2)/(k) = 8.57 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 8.57 / 8.617e-5 ≈ approximately 100,000 K? Let me compute it more accurately.

8.57 / 8.617e-5 = 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ 8.57 * 11603 ≈ let's see: 8 * 11603 is 92,824, and 0.57 * 11603 ≈ 6614 → total ≈ 99,438 K.

Wait, 8.617e-5 eV/K is 8.617e-5 eV per Kelvin. So 8.57 / 8.617e-5 is approximately 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ 99,438 K.

So, (E1-E2)/(k) ≈ 99,438 K.

Now, multiply by (1/6000 - 1/5500 ) which is approximately -1.515e-5.

So, 99,438 K * (-1.515e-5) ≈ -99,438 * 1.515e-5.

Let me compute that:

99,438 * 1.515e-5 = (99,438) * (0.00001515) 

99,438 * 0.00001515 ≈ 

Approximating: 100,000 * 0.00001515 = 1.515. But 99,438 is 100,000 - 562.

So 99,438 * 0.00001515 = (100,000 * 0.00001515) - (562 * 0.00001515 )

= 1.515 - (0.00852) ≈ 1.5065.

So with the negative sign, the exponent is approximately -1.5065.

So the factor is exp( -1.5065 ) ≈ 0.221.

Wait, wait, that's about 0.22, which is much less than 1. But that would imply that (n2/n1)_no_spots is 0.22 times (n2/n1)_spots.

But that's a decrease by a factor of about 4.5 (since 1/0.22 ≈ 4.5). So the ratio (n2/n1) is decreasing by a factor of about 4.5 when the star goes from no spots to having spots.

Wait, but the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So that's (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots = 0.22. So the factor is 0.22. But none of the options is 0.22. The options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

Hmm, wait, let's go back. The exponent is (E1-E2)/(k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500 )

But (E1-E2) is 8.57 eV.

k is 8.617e-5 eV/K. So (E1-E2)/(k) = 8.57 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 99,438 K.

Then, (1/6000 - 1/5500 ) = (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) )= (-500)/(33,000,000) )= -5e2 / 3.3e7 = -5/(3.3e5) ) ≈ -1.515e-5.

So, (E1-E2)/(k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500 ) = 99,438 K * (-1.515e-5 ) ≈ -1.506.

So the exponent is about -1.506.

So the factor is exp( -1.506 ) ≈ e^-1.506 ≈ 0.221.

So the ratio (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots = 0.221. So the ratio decreases by a factor of ~4.52 when the star has spots. Because 1/0.221 ≈ 4.52.

But the question is what's the factor when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So the factor is 0.221. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the reciprocal.

Wait, perhaps I got the ratio reversed. Let's see: The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, the ratio when no spots (T=6000 K) is higher than when spots are present (T=5500 K). So, the ratio without spots is higher, and with spots it's lower.

If I'm computing (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots, which is 0.221, that would mean that when the star has spots, the ratio is higher by a factor of ~4.5. But that's not what the problem says. The problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the definition. Let's think again: the ratio (n2/n1) without spots is higher than with spots. So when spots are present, the ratio is lower. So the factor is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots = 0.221. So the ratio decreases by a factor of 1/0.221 ≈ 4.52. So the factor is ~4.5. So the answer would be option C) ~4.5.

Wait, but wait, no. The question is phrased as "the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots." So if the ratio at no spots is 0.221 times the ratio at spots, the factor is 0.221. But that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is being considered the other way.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots. Let's try that.

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So for T=6000, it's exp( (E2-E1)/(k *6000) )

E2-E1 is negative, since E1 > E2. So (E2-E1)/(k T) is negative. So (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( negative ), so it's a small number.

The ratio (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 = [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k *6000) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k *5500) ) ]

The g's cancel. So the ratio is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

E2-E1 is -8.57 eV.

So (E2-E1)/(k) = -8.57 / 8.617e-5 eV/K → same as -99,438 K.

Multiply by (1/6000 - 1/5500 ) which is -1.515e-5.

So exponent is (-99,438 K) * (-1.515e-5 ) = 99,438 * 1.515e-5.

Which is the same as earlier, about 1.5065.

So exponent is +1.5065.

So the ratio is exp(1.5065) ≈ 4.51.

So the factor is approximately 4.5. So the ratio (n1/n2)_no_spots is about 4.5 times (n1/n2)_spots. 

But according to the problem statement, when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. Wait, no. Because if (n1/n2)_no_spots is 4.5 times (n1/n2)_spots, that would mean that when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. Which matches the problem statement.

But the problem says that "this ratio decreases when the star has spots." So that would imply that (n1/n2)_no_spots is higher than (n1/n2)_spots. So the factor is indeed ~4.5.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is ~4.5, so the answer is option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights, \(E_1\) and \(E_2\) are the energies of the two levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The problem specifies that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, meaning the ratio is higher at \(T = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (no spots) than at \(T = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (spots).

### Key Steps:
1. **Energy Difference**: The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \(1448 \, \text{Å}\), so the energy difference is calculated using \(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\). Substituting \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\), we find \(E \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}\).

2. **Boltzmann Factor**: The ratio of the populations depends on the Boltzmann factor:
   \[
   \frac{n_1}{n_2} \propto \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right).
   \]
   For the given energy difference, the ratio of the ratios is:
   \[
   \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{6000}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{5500}} = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500}\right)\right).
   \]

3. **Temperature Difference**: Compute \(\frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500}\):
   \[
   \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.000166667, \quad \frac{1}{5500} \approx 0.000181818,
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} \approx -0.000015151.
   \]

4. **Exponent Calculation**: Using \(E_2 - E_1 = 8.57 \, \text{eV}\) and \(k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}\), compute:
   \[
   \frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \approx 8.57 / 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \approx 99,438 \, \text{K}.
   \]
   The exponent becomes:
   \[
   99,438 \times (-0.000015151) \approx -1.506.
   \]

5. **Factor Calculation**: The ratio is:
   \[
   \exp(-1.506) \approx 0.221.
   \]
   This means the ratio decreases by a factor of approximately \(1 / 0.221 \approx 4.52\) when the star has spots.

### Conclusion:
The factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is approximately **4.5**.
