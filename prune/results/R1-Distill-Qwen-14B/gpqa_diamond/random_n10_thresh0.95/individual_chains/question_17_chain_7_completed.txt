Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mentioned that the pH is ideal, which probably means that the activity coefficients are close to 1, so I can ignore activity for now. The temperature is at 25°C, and the stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.

I remember that EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The complex is usually written as CaY²- where Y is the EDTA^4- ion. The stability constant, K, tells us how stable the complex is. A high K like 5e10 means the complex is very stable.

The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. So, I need to find [Ca²+].

Hmm, I think the key here is to use the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The reaction would be something like:

CaY²- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA⁴−

The stability constant K is given by the formula:

K = [Ca²+][EDTA⁴−] / [CaY²−]

Wait, no, the stability constant is actually the inverse because K is for the formation of the complex. So the formation reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA⁴− ↔ CaY²−, and K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴−}]). Oh, right, so when the complex dissociates, K_d (dissociation constant) would be 1/K.

But in this problem, the solution is 0.02 M of the CaY²− complex. So, the concentration of CaY²− is 0.02 M. I'm assuming that the solution is at equilibrium, so the concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA⁴− can be found using the K expression.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The complex is dissociating, so:

CaY²− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA⁴−

The equilibrium expression is K_d = [Ca²+][EDTA⁴−] / [CaY²−]

Wait, but K is given as 5e10 for the formation, so K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴−}) = 5e10.

So the dissociation constant K_d = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

But wait, in this case, the initial concentration is 0.02 M of CaY²−, and the other species (Ca²+ and EDTA⁴−) are negligible because of the high K. So, when the complex dissociates, some of the CaY²− breaks down into Ca²+ and EDTA⁴−.

Let me denote the change as x. So at equilibrium:

[CaY²−] = 0.02 - x

[Ca²+] = x

[EDTA⁴−] = x

But because K is so large (5e10), the dissociation is very little, so x will be very small compared to 0.02. So we can approximate [CaY²−] ≈ 0.02.

Then, K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴−}) ≈ 0.02 / (x^2) = 5e10.

So:

5e10 = 0.02 / (x²)

Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / 5e10 = 2e-3 / 5e10 = 4e-13.

Wait, let me calculate that again. 0.02 divided by 5e10.

0.02 is 2e-2. 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Let me calculate: sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is approximately 6.32e-7.

Wait, wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13. The square root is sqrt(4)=2 and sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5. So x is 2 * 1e-6.5. 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 *3.16e-7=6.32e-7 M.

So [Ca²+] is approximately 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, but let me double-check. Is there any assumption I made that's incorrect? I assumed that x is very small, so [CaY²−] ≈ 0.02. Let's see: x is about 6.3e-7, which is much less than 0.02, so the approximation holds.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²+]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex at equilibrium, we use the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The stability constant for the formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is given as \( K = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is the reciprocal of \( K \), so:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

At equilibrium, the concentrations of the species are related by:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}.
\]

Let the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) at equilibrium be \( x \). Since the dissociation of the complex is very small (due to the high stability constant), we approximate:

\[
[\text{CaY}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x.
\]

Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_d = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = K_d \cdot 0.02 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}.
\]

Using \( 10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \), we find:

\[
x \approx 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
