Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particle physics, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm just starting to learn this. Let me read it through again.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as:

L(y) = -λf f(y)(ῡ + X(y))ψ_f(y)

Wait, I think maybe the notation is a bit off. Probably, it's something like L = -λ_f f bar ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Maybe the fermion field ψ_f is interacting with the scalar X. So, the interaction is Yukawa-like because it's similar to the Yukawa coupling in the Standard Model, where fermions couple to a scalar field.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

So, I need to figure out what particles X can decay into. For that, I think about decay modes and the conservation laws, like energy and momentum. But since this is a boson, probably a scalar, decaying into fermions, we have to consider the possible pairs.

At lowest order, the decay would be into two particles because higher-order decays would involve more vertices, which are higher-order processes. So, X would decay into a pair of fermions.

The possible decay products depend on the mass of X and the masses of the fermions. The mass of X is 6 GeV. So, the fermion pair's combined mass must be less than or equal to 6 GeV for the decay to be possible kinematically.

Wait, but wait! Wait a minute. Fermions come in generations, each with different masses. Let me think about the possible fermions that X can decay into. The fermions that X couples to are the ones in the interaction term. The Lagrangian has ψ_f, so the fermion ψ_f could be any of the charged leptons or quarks, depending on the context.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify which fermions ψ_f are. Wait, the interaction is given as L = -λf f bar ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Oh, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe it's a typo, and it's meant to be something like L = -λ_f \bar{ψ}_f ψ_f (ῡ + X) where X is a scalar, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the interaction term is more like L = λ \bar{ψ} ψ X, which would make X a mediator coupling to the fermions ψ.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the interaction is such that X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs. So, the decay X → f f̄ is possible if the fermion's mass is less than or equal to half of X's mass because each fermion would carry a mass of up to 3 GeV (since 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV). So, if the fermion's mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV, the decay is allowed.

But wait, the fermion masses vary. Let's list the masses of the known fermions:

- Up-type quarks: u, c, t. But the top quark is way too heavy (mass ~173 GeV), which is way above 3 GeV. So, t quark can't be a decay product of X here.

- Down-type quarks: d, s, b. Again, bottom quark has a mass around 4.5 GeV, which is higher than 3 GeV, so X cannot decay into b quarks because each b would require at least 4.5 GeV, and X only has 6 GeV. So 2 * 4.5 is 9 GeV, which is more than 6, so decay into b b-bar is not allowed.

- Leptons: electron (0.5 MeV, negligible), mu (105.7 MeV), tau (1.78 GeV). So tau is about 1.78 GeV, so each would be okay because 1.78 *2 = 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6. Wait, no: wait, 1.78 GeV per tau, so two taus would sum to 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau pairs are allowed.

Wait, but wait: the X is 6 GeV, so for a decay into two fermions, each must have mass ≤3 GeV. Because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3. So if a fermion has mass m, 2m ≤6 → m ≤3 GeV.

So let's check each fermion's mass:

- Electron: m_e ≈ 0.5 MeV → way below 3 GeV → allowed.

- Muon: m_mu ≈ 105.7 MeV → allowed.

- Tau: m_tau ≈ 1.78 GeV → allowed.

- Up quark: m_u ≈ 2 MeV → allowed.

- Down quark: m_d ≈ 4.7 MeV → wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, down quark mass is about 4.7 MeV. So less than 3 GeV, so allowed.

Wait, but wait, wait. No, wait: the masses are in the order of MeV, so that's way less than 3 GeV. So X can decay into any of these as long as they are coupled.

Wait, but wait, the initial interaction term: the problem states that the interaction is between the boson X and fermions. So which fermions are involved? Because the interaction term is given as:

L = -λf f(y)(ῡ + X(y))ψ_f(y)

Wait, perhaps the notation there is a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps it's more like L = -λ_f \bar{ψ}_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. So, each fermion ψ_f has a Yukawa coupling to X. So the fermion ψ_f can be any of the quarks or leptons, depending on λ_f.

But the problem states that the interaction is with fermions, so X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair provided their mass is less than 3 GeV. So the possible decay products are all the fermions with mass ≤3 GeV.

So let me think of possible fermions:

Quarks:

- u: up quark, mass ~2 MeV → allowed.

- d: down quark, ~4.7 MeV → allowed.

- s: strange quark, ~95 MeV → allowed.

- c: charm quark, ~1.27 GeV → allowed.

- b: bottom quark, ~4.5 GeV → each would require 4.5 GeV, so 2 *4.5=9 GeV >6 GeV → not allowed.

- t: top quark, way too heavy, not allowed.

Leptons:

- e: electron, 0.5 MeV → allowed.

- mu: ~105.7 MeV → allowed.

- tau: ~1.78 GeV → allowed.

So the possible fermions that X can decay into are:

e, mu, tau (leptons), u, d, s, c (quarks), but not b or t.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, but the decay into each pair must also conserve charge and other quantum numbers. But for this problem, it's probably sufficient to consider the mass condition.

So the possible decay channels are X → f f̄ where f is any fermion with m_f ≤3 GeV.

So the possible pairs are:

- e+ e-

- mu+ mu-

- tau+ tau- → wait, but tau is 1.78 GeV, so 2 m_tau is 3.56 GeV, which is less than X's mass of 6 GeV. So yes, allowed.

Quarks:

- u ū → possible.

- d d̄ → possible.

- s s̄ → possible.

- c c̄ → possible, since c is 1.27 GeV, so 2*1.27=2.54 GeV <6 GeV.

Wait, but wait: the c quark is about 1.27 GeV, so two of them would sum to 2.54 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So yes, allowed.

So the allowed decay modes would include all of these except for those where the fermion pair's mass exceeds 6 GeV.

Wait, but wait again. Wait, when the fermion is a quark, the decay would produce a quark-antiquark pair. But in reality, when a boson decays into quarks, we have to consider that the quarks would hadronize, but for the purpose of this question, perhaps it's just considering the possible fermion pairs, regardless of whether they're quarks or leptons.

So the possible decay products are any f f̄ pair where the sum of the masses is ≤6 GeV, but more accurately, each fermion's mass is ≤3 GeV because each has to be ≤ half of X's mass.

Wait, no: that's only for the case where X → f f̄. For that to happen, each f must have mass ≤ m_X /2, which is 3 GeV. Because if each f had mass, say, 2 GeV, then 2 *2 GeV =4 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So, any fermion with mass ≤3 GeV can be a decay product.

So let's list the fermion masses:

- e: 0.511 MeV → yes.

- mu: 105.7 MeV → yes.

- tau: 1777 MeV → 1.777 GeV → less than 3 GeV → yes.

- u: ~2 MeV → yes.

- d: ~4.7 MeV → yes.

- s: ~95 MeV → yes.

- c: ~1270 MeV → 1.27 GeV → yes.

- b: ~4500 MeV → 4.5 GeV → no, because 4.5 >3 GeV.

- t: way too heavy → no.

So, X can decay into any of the following pairs:

ee, mu mu, tau tau, u u, d d, s s, c c.

But wait, wait. Wait, but when you're considering decay into quarks, you have to consider that quarks are confined, but for the purposes of this problem, perhaps it's just about the allowed fermion pairs, regardless of whether they're observed as jets or not.

So the possible decay modes are:

X → b b̄: no, because each b is ~4.5 GeV, and 2 *4.5 =9 GeV>6 GeV.

X → c c̄: allowed, since 2*1.27=2.54 GeV<6.

X → s s̄: allowed.

X → d d̄: allowed.

X → u ū: allowed.

X → tau+ tau-: allowed.

X → mu+ mu-: allowed.

X → e+ e-: allowed.

Wait, but what about the b quark? Because 4.5 GeV per b, so 4.5 *2 =9 GeV>6 GeV. So, X can't decay into b b̄.

So the allowed decays are all the fermion pairs except the b and t.

Wait, but in the options given, the answer options include some of these.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau, e.

Wait, but if X can't decay into b's, then option A is wrong because it includes b.

Option B: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau, mu, e.

Wait, this includes c c̄, which is allowed because c's mass is 1.27 GeV, so 2 *1.27=2.54 GeV <6 GeV.

Option C: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, tau, mu, e.

Wait, t is way too heavy, so this option includes t, which is impossible. So C is not correct.

Option D: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau, mu, e.

Again, b is included, so D is wrong.

Wait, but looking back, the problem says the interaction is given by L = ... but I have to make sure that the fermions that X couples to are allowed to decay. Because if X couples only to certain fermions, those are the only possible decay channels.

Wait, the problem statement says, "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by..." So X can interact with any fermion, as per the Lagrangian. So any fermion ψ_f in the Lagrangian is allowed, provided that the mass condition is satisfied.

So, for example, the top quark is too heavy, so X can't decay into t t̄. Similarly, bottom quark is too heavy, so X can't decay into b b̄.

So the allowed decay products are all the fermions with mass ≤3 GeV.

So the possible decay products are:

ee, mu mu, tau tau, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

Wait, but wait. Wait, what about the tau lepton? Each tau is about 1.78 GeV, so two taus would require 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau+ tau- is allowed.

So the possible decay modes are:

c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So looking at the options:

Option B: X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+, tau-, mu+, mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's exactly what I have.

Option C includes t, which is not allowed.

Option A includes b, which is not allowed.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait, in the options, the wording is a bit different.

Looking back:

Option A: includes b, so no.

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Yes.

Option C includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is too heavy.

Option D includes b, so no.

So the correct option is B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. The decay \( X \to f\bar{f} \) is allowed if the total mass of the fermion-antifermion pair is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), which implies \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Additionally, the interaction term suggests that \( X \) can decay into any fermion \( f \) it couples to, provided the mass condition is satisfied.

### Analysis of Fermion Masses:
1. **Leptons**:
   - Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \approx 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \approx 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed, as \( 2m_\tau = 3.56 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).

2. **Quarks**:
   - Up (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 2 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Down (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Strange (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 95 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed, as \( 2m_c = 2.54 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
   - Bottom (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
   - Top (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as it is much heavier than \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).

### Allowed Decay Channels:
The boson \( X \) can decay into the following fermion-antifermion pairs:
- \( e^+ e^- \)
- \( \mu^+ \mu^- \)
- \( \tau^+ \tau^- \)
- \( u\bar{u} \)
- \( d\bar{d} \)
- \( s\bar{s} \)
- \( c\bar{c} \)

Decays into \( b\bar{b} \) or \( t\bar{t} \) are not allowed due to their masses exceeding the kinematic threshold.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decay channels for \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV.

Answer: B
