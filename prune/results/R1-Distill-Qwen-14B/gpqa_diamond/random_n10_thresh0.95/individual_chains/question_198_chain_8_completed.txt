Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in a solution. The solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, what's the blue complex here? I remember that for cobalt complexes, the color often depends on the number of ligands attached. For example, [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ has different colors based on n. I think the blue color is typically for the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex. So the dithiocyanato complex would be the one with two SCN- ligands, but wait, dithiocyanato is two SCN, but wait, Co with two SCN would be [Co(SCN)_2]^2+. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about the possible complexes and their colors.

Wait, maybe the blue is for the tetra-thiocyanato complex. Because I recall that the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is deep blue. So the problem is asking for the percentage of [Co(SCN)_4]^2- in the solution.

The stability constants (β) are given for each complex. Stability constant (β) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. For a complex like [Co(SCN)_n]^(m), the β would be the product of the formation steps. Let me think about how these stability constants are structured.

Assuming the complexes form step-wise, each β represents adding one SCN- at a time. So β1 is for the first step: Co^2+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+ with β1=9. Then β2 would be the second step: [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2]^0 with β2=40. Wait, no, that might not be right. Each β is the cumulative constant for the nth complex. Alternatively, βn is the formation constant for the complex with n ligands.

Wait, that's probably the case. So β1 is the stability constant for [Co(SCN)]^+. β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

So the question is asking about the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex, which has β4=16. Wait, but wait, the β values are given in the order β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, that seems a bit odd because I would expect the β to increase with the number of ligands, but here β4 is smaller than β3. Maybe because of some factors like solubility or other equilibria.

So the goal is to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_4]^2- in the solution. To do this, I need to consider the distribution of Co across all possible complexes, considering their formation constants and the concentrations of the ions.

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the species present, which includes Co^2+, [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Let me denote [Co^2+] as x. Then, the concentrations of the complexes can be expressed in terms of x and the stability constants.

The stability constant for each complex is given as:

βn = [complex] / ( [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n )

Which rearranges to [complex] = βn * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^n.

So, for each complex:

[Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN]^1
[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 * x * [SCN]^2
[Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 * x * [SCN]^3
[Co(SCN)_4]^2- = β4 * x * [SCN]^4

Wait, but wait: each step's β is the cumulative constant. So for β2, it's the formation constant for the second step. Or is β2 the overall constant for [Co(SCN)_2]?

I think the problem defines βn as the cumulative stability constant for the nth complex. So that [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

So, with that in mind, all the species can be expressed in terms of x and [SCN^-].

The problem gives [SCN^-] as 0.1 M. Let's plug that in.

Let me compute each term:

First, [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

So for each complex:

[Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 * x * (0.1) = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9x
[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 *x*(0.1)^2 = 40 x (0.01) = 0.4 x
[Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 *x*(0.1)^3 =63 x (0.001) = 0.063 x
[Co(SCN)_4]^2- = β4 *x*(0.1)^4 =16 x (0.0001) = 0.0016 x

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because [Co(SCN)_4]^2- seems really low, but maybe that's correct.

Now, the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these species plus the free Co^2+:

x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = total c(Co) =1e-2 M.

Let me compute this sum:

x (1 + 0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016) = 1e-2.

Adding the coefficients:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3

2.3 + 0.063 =2.363

2.363 + 0.0016=2.3646.

So 2.3646 x = 0.01.

Thus, x = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004224 M.

Wait, that's approximately 4.224e-3 M.

But wait, let me compute more accurately.

2.3646 x =0.01 → x = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004224 M.

So, x ≈ 0.004224 M.

Now, let's compute each complex's concentration in terms of x.

[Co(SCN)]^+ = 0.9x ≈ 0.9 * 0.004224 ≈ 0.003799 ≈ 3.8e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = 0.4 x ≈ 0.4 * 0.004224 ≈ 0.0016896 ≈1.6896e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- = 0.063 x ≈0.063 *0.004224≈0.000266 ≈2.66e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- =0.0016 x ≈0.0016 *0.004224 ≈6.758e-6 M.

Wait, but wait a minute, that seems way too small. Let me check the calculations.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in calculating the [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, [Co(SCN)_4]^2- = β4 * x * (0.1)^4.

So beta4 is 16. So 16 * x * (0.1)^4 =16 * x * 1e-4=16e-4 x.

Wait, x is 0.004224.

So 16e-4 *0.004224 = (16 * 0.004224 ) * 1e-4.

16 * 0.004224 = approx 0.067584.

Multiply by 1e-4 → 6.7584e-6 M.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the concentrations are:

Co²+ : ~4.224e-3 M

[CoSCN]^+ : ~3.8e-3 M

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 : ~1.69e-3 M

[Co(SCN)_3]^- : ~2.66e-4 M

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- : ~6.758e-6 M.

Now, the question is, what's the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Wait, but wait. The blue is supposed to be [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

But according to this, that's the smallest concentration. That can't be right. Wait, but perhaps I misunderstood the complexes. Maybe the blue color is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the dithiocyanato (two SCN).

Wait, that's a possibility. Because dithiocyanato would be two SCN ligands, so [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

So the question says, percentage of the blue dithiocyanato... So that's [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

So the question is asking for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 concentration.

Looking back, the options are in the range of about 16% to 42%. So [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is 1.69e-3 M.

The total cobalt is 0.01 M.

So the fraction is (1.69e-3) / 0.01 = 0.169, which is 16.9%.

Looking at the options, D is 16.9%.

But wait, let me think again. Because the problem says "dithiocyanato" which is two SCN. So [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

Another way: perhaps the stability constants are given for each step, so that β1 is for the first ligand, β2 is the second, etc., but that's not the same as the overall β for the complex. Hmm. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of step-wise formation constants.

Wait, maybe the given β values are the step-wise formation constants, not the overall. So for the first complex, β1 is the constant for [CoSCN]^+. Then β2 is for the second ligand, so the formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 from [CoSCN]^+ and SCN^-.

In that case, the overall β for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 would be β1 * β2. Similarly, β3 is the third step, and β4 the fourth.

Wait, that's probably the correct approach. Because the way the problem presents the β1 to β4 as stability constants for the complexes, but it's more likely that each β is the step-wise formation constant, not the overall for each n.

Okay, that changes everything. Let me reevaluate.

If βn is the nth step's formation constant. So:

β1 = K1 = [CoSCN^+]/( [Co^2+][SCN^-] )

β2 = K2 = [Co(SCN)_2^0]/([CoSCN^+][SCN^-] )

β3 = K3 = [Co(SCN)_3^-]/( [Co(SCN)_2^0][SCN^-] )

β4 = K4 = [Co(SCN)_4^2-]/( [Co(SCN)_3^-][SCN^-] )

In this case, the overall β for [Co(SCN)_n] would be the product of K1 through Kn.

So for [CoSCN]^+, β_total = K1 =9.

For [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β_total = K1*K2 =9*40=360.

For [Co(SCN)_3^-], β_total= K1*K2*K3=9*40*63=22680.

For [Co(SCN)_4^2-], β_total= K1*K2*K3*K4=9*40*63*16= let's calculate that: 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362880.

Wait, that changes everything. Because now the overall β for [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is 362880, which is a huge number, indicating it's very stable. Hmm, but that's conflicting with the initial thought that the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- might be the dominant species.

Wait, but the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M, which is relatively high. So perhaps the higher β species will have higher concentrations.

Wait, let's redo the analysis with this correct approach.

First, the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) =1e-2 M, [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

Each complex's concentration can be expressed as:

[Co^2+] = x

[CoSCN^+] = β1 * x * [SCN^-] =9 x * 0.1 =0.9 x

[Co(SCN)_2^0] = β1 β2 x [SCN^-]^2 =9*40 x (0.1)^2 = 360 x * 0.01 =3.6 x

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = β1 β2 β3 x [SCN^-]^3 =9*40*63 x (0.1)^3 = (9*40=360; 360*63=22680) → 22680 x * 0.001 =22.68 x

[Co(SCN)_4^2-] = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN^-]^4 =9*40*63*16 x (0.1)^4 → let's compute:

9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362880.

(0.1)^4=1e-4.

So [Co(SCN)_4^2-] =362880 x * 1e-4=36.288 x.

So now, the concentrations are:

Co^2+: x

[CoSCN^+]: 0.9x

[Co(SCN)_2^0]: 3.6x

[Co(SCN)_3^-]:22.68x

[Co(SCN)_4^2-]:36.288x

Adding all these together gives the total cobalt concentration: x +0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x = (1 +0.9+3.6+22.68+36.288) x.

Let me sum these coefficients:

1 +0.9 =1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So 64.468 x = 1e-2 M → x= 1e-2 /64.468 ≈ 1.55e-4 M.

So x ≈1.55e-4 M.

Now, let's compute each species' concentration.

Co^2+ =1.55e-4 M.

[CoSCN^+]=0.9 *1.55e-4 ≈1.395e-4 ≈1.4e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)_2^0] =3.6 *1.55e-4 ≈5.58e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)_3^-]=22.68 *1.55e-4 ≈3.52e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)_4^2-]=36.288 *1.55e-4 ≈5.61e-3 M.

Wait, that makes sense because the higher complexes with higher β would be favored when [SCN^-] is high.

Now, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. If the blue is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, then we take [Co(SCN)_4^2-], which is 5.61e-3 M.

But wait, the problem says "dithiocyanato," which usually means two SCN ligands. So the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me recheck.

Dithiocyanato would imply two SCN ligands. So [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is the dithiocyanato complex. The blue color is for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, as I thought earlier. So the question is about the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- percentage.

Wait, no, the question says "blue dithiocyanato." So perhaps the blue is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0. That's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the "dithiocyanato" refers to two SCN ligands, making [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the dithiocyanato complex, and this is the blue one.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is deep blue, and [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is another color. Let me think. I think [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue, and [Co(SCN)_3]^− is green, while [Co(SCN)]^+ is pink. But I might be mixing up the colors.

Alternatively, perhaps the dithiocyanato (two SCN) is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is blue. So the question is asking for that.

But looking at the numbers, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is 5.58e-4 M.

Total cobalt is 1e-2 M.

So the fraction is 5.58e-4 / 0.01 =0.0558, which is 5.58%. That's not among the options. Hmm, that's a problem. The options don't have that.

Wait, but perhaps the blue is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

In that case, [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is 5.61e-3 M.

Fraction is 5.61e-3 /0.01 =0.561, which is 56.1%. Again, not among the options.

Wait, but that can't be; the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate it differently. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the [Co(SCN)_2] complex, and the blue color is for that. Then, the percentage is 5.58e-4 / 0.01 =5.58%, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I applied the stability constants. Let me re-express the problem.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants given are for the overall complexes, not the step-wise. So β1 is the overall K for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc. So each β is the overall constant for that complex.

In that case, the [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

So for [CoSCN]^+, β1=9.

[CoSCN]^+ =9 x (0.1) =0.9x

[Co(SCN)_2]^0= β2 x (0.1)^2 =40 x (0.01)=0.4 x

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = β3 x (0.1)^3=63 x (0.001)=0.063x

[Co(SCN)_4^2-] =β4 x (0.1)^4=16 x (0.0001)=0.0016x.

So the concentrations are:

Co^2+ : x

[CoSCN]^+ :0.9x

[Co(SCN)_2]^0: 0.4x

[Co(SCN)_3^-]:0.063x

[Co(SCN)_4^2- ]:0.0016x.

Sum all to get total Co:

x +0.9x +0.4x +0.063x +0.0016x = (1+0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646) → 2.3646 x =1e-2 →x=1e-2 /2.3646≈4.224e-3.

So x≈4.224e-3 M.

So the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is 0.4x =0.4 *4.224e-3≈1.6896e-3 M.

Total cobalt is 0.01 M.

So the percentage is (1.6896e-3 / 1e-2) *100 = (0.16896) *100 =16.896%, which is approximately 16.9%. Option D.

So the correct answer is D) 16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]⁰) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants (β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16) and the total cobalt concentration (c(Co) = 10⁻² M) and thiocyanate concentration ([SCN⁻] = 0.1 M).

### Key Steps:
1. **Stability Constants and Complex Formation**:
   The stability constant (βₙ) for each complex [Co(SCN)ₙ]^(m) is defined as:
   \[
   \beta_n = \frac{[\text{complex}]}{[\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^n}
   \]
   Using this, the concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration \([x]\) and the given \([SCN^-]\).

2. **Concentrations of All Species**:
   Let \([x]\) represent the concentration of free \(\text{Co}^{2+}\). The concentrations of the cobalt species are:
   - \([\text{Co}^{2+}] = x\)
   - \([\text{CoSCN}^+] = \beta_1 x [SCN^-] = 9x(0.1) = 0.9x\)
   - \([\text{Co(SCN)₂}^0] = \beta_2 x [SCN^-]^2 = 40x(0.1)^2 = 0.4x\)
   - \([\text{Co(SCN)₃}^-] = \beta_3 x [SCN^-]^3 = 63x(0.1)^3 = 0.063x\)
   - \([\text{Co(SCN)₄}^{2-}] = \beta_4 x [SCN^-]^4 = 16x(0.1)^4 = 0.0016x\)

3. **Total Cobalt Concentration**:
   The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:
   \[
   x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = 10^{-2} \, \text{M}
   \]
   Adding the coefficients:
   \[
   1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]
   Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 4.224 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
   \]

4. **Concentration of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰**:
   Substituting \(x\) into the expression for \([\text{Co(SCN)₂}^0]\):
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)₂}^0] = 0.4x = 0.4(4.224 \times 10^{-3}) \approx 1.69 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
   \]

5. **Percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰**:
   The percentage of \([\text{Co(SCN)₂}^0]\) is:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{[\text{Co(SCN)₂}^0]}{\text{Total Co Concentration}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{1.69 \times 10^{-3}}{10^{-2}}\right) \times 100 \approx 16.9\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex \([\text{Co(SCN)₂}^0]\) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution is **16.9%**.
