Okay, I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem about eigenvectors of an operator. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the question is about finding the normalized eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. They've given the components P_x, P_y, and P_z as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the spin operator components are often represented as Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So each component P_x, P_y, P_z is (ħ/2) times the respective Pauli matrix.

The muon's spin is 1/2, so the state is a two-component spinor. The operator P is the spin component along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The direction n is arbitrary but in the x-z plane, so the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and φ is zero because it's in the x-z plane. So the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) perhaps? Or maybe (cosθ, 0, sinθ)? I'm a bit confused about the exact parametrization, but I think for a general direction in the x-z plane, the angle θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and φ is zero.

The operator P for a direction n would be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction's components. So the operator along n is given by P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1. So n_x = sinθ (since for polar angle θ from z, x would be sinθ, and z would be cosθ). So n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ) perhaps. So P = sinθ * P_x + cosθ * P_z.

Each P component is given: P_x has a matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], P_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and P_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], all multiplied by ħ/2.

So substituting, P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].

Let me write that matrix out. Let me compute it step by step.

The matrix inside the brackets is:

sinθ * [ [0,1], [1,0] ] → [ [0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0] ]

plus

cosθ * [ [1,0], [0, -1] ] → [ [cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ] ]

Adding them together:

Top-left: cosθ

Top-right: sinθ

Bottom-left: sinθ

Bottom-right: -cosθ

So the matrix is [[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]], multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck. The first term when multiplied by sinθ gives [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]. The second term gives [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]. So adding them:

Top-left: 0 + cosθ = cosθ

Top-right: sinθ + 0 = sinθ

Bottom-left: sinθ + 0 = sinθ

Bottom-right: 0 + (-cosθ) = -cosθ.

So the matrix is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]], multiplied by ħ/2.

So the operator P is (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]].

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Because when adding, for the bottom-right element: 0 (from P_x) plus (-cosθ) (from P_z) gives -cosθ. Yes, that's correct.

So the operator is (ħ/2) times that matrix.

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Let me denote the 2x2 matrix as M = [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]. So P = (ħ/2) M, so P |ψ> = (ħ/2) M |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

So the eigenvalue equation becomes (M) |ψ> = |ψ>.

Wait, no: because (ħ/2) M |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ> → M |ψ> = |ψ> → (M - I) |ψ> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So the matrix equation is (M - I) |ψ> = 0.

So M - I is [[cosθ - 1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ - 1]].

The determinant of (M - I) must be zero for non-trivial solutions. Let me compute the determinant:

det(M - I) = (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)(sinθ)

= [ (cosθ)(-cosθ) + (cosθ)(-1) + (-1)(-cosθ) + (-1)(-1) ] - sin²θ

Wait, perhaps expanding it step by step is better.

Alternatively: (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = -(cosθ -1)(cosθ +1) = -[cos²θ -1] = -(cos²θ -1) = -(-sin²θ) = sin²θ.

So the first term is sin²θ.

The second term is (sinθ)(sinθ) = sin²θ.

So determinant is sin²θ - sin²θ = 0. Which makes sense because the matrix M has eigenvalues +1 and -1 (since trace is zero, determinant is -1^2 =1? Wait, wait, M is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]. The trace is cosθ - cosθ = 0. The determinant is cosθ*(-cosθ) - sinθ*sinθ = -cos²θ - sin²θ = -(cos²θ + sin²θ) = -1.

Wait, but when we subtract I, M -I has determinant [ (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - sin^2θ ].

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Since we're dealing with eigenvalues, perhaps it's better to find the eigenvalues of M and then find the eigenvectors.

Wait, M is a 2x2 matrix. Its eigenvalues are the solutions to det(M - λI) = 0.

Which is: (cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) - sin^2θ = 0.

Expanding: [ -cosθ λ - cosθ λ + λ^2 + cosθ^2 ] - sin^2θ = 0.

Wait, perhaps expanding as:

(cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) = (-cosθ)(cosθ - λ) - λ (cosθ - λ) ?

Wait, perhaps a better way: (a - λ)(b - λ) = ab - aλ - bλ + λ².

Wait, no, M - λ I is [[cosθ - λ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ - λ]].

So determinant is (cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) - sin^2θ.

Multiply out:

= [ (-cosθ)(cosθ - λ) - λ (cosθ - λ) ) ]

Wait no, let me compute (cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) = (-cosθ)(cosθ) + λ cosθ - λ cosθ + λ².

Wait: (cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) = (-cosθ)(cosθ) + (-cosθ)(-λ) + (-λ)(cosθ) + (-λ)(-λ)

= -cos²θ + λ cosθ - λ cosθ + λ²

= -cos²θ + λ².

So the determinant is (-cos²θ + λ²) - sin²θ = λ² - (cos²θ + sin²θ) = λ² - 1.

So the equation is λ² -1 =0 → λ= ±1.

So M has eigenvalues +1 and -1.

So the eigenvalue +1 corresponds to our desired eigenvalue of P, which is +ħ/2.

So the eigenvector we're looking for is the one where (M - I) |ψ> =0.

So the system of equations is:

(cosθ -1) ψ₁ + sinθ ψ₂ =0

sinθ ψ₁ + (-cosθ -1) ψ₂ =0

Let me write this as:

Equation 1: (cosθ -1) ψ₁ + sinθ ψ₂ = 0

Equation 2: sinθ ψ₁ + (-cosθ -1) ψ₂ = 0

Let's try to solve this. Let's take equation 1:

(cosθ -1) ψ₁ = - sinθ ψ₂ → ψ₂ = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] ψ₁

Alternatively, ψ₂ = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] ψ₁

But (1 - cosθ)/sinθ can be simplified using trigonometric identities. Let me think: (1 - cosθ) = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So (1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] ] = tan(θ/2).

So ψ₂ = tan(θ/2) ψ₁.

So the eigenvector can be written as ψ = [ ψ₁, ψ₂ ] = [ ψ₁, tan(θ/2) ψ₁ ] = ψ₁ [1, tan(θ/2)].

We can factor out ψ₁, which is arbitrary (non-zero) because it's an eigenvector.

Let me write the eigenvector as |ψ> = [1, tan(θ/2)].

But we need to normalize this. Let's compute the normalization factor.

The normalization condition is |ψ₁|^2 + |ψ₂|^2 =1.

Since ψ₁ is a scalar, let me pick ψ₁ =1, and then compute the normalization.

Wait, no, let's let ψ₁ = a, then ψ₂ = a tan(θ/2).

So normalization: |a|^2 (1 + tan²(θ/2) ) ) = 1.

But 1 + tan² = sec², so 1 + tan²(θ/2) = 1 / cos²(θ/2).

So |a|^2 (1 / cos²(θ/2) ) ) =1 → |a| = cos(θ/2).

So a = cos(θ/2), but considering the phase, maybe we can take a as real positive.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Because: since tan(θ/2) = sin(θ/2)/cos(θ/2), so ψ₂ = a tan(θ/2) = a (sin/cos) → with a=cos(theta/2), it's [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, let me check that. If a is cos(theta/2), then ψ₂ = a * tan(theta/2) = cos(theta/2) * [ sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2) ] = sin(theta/2).

So the components are [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but the eigenvector is a two-component vector, so the state would be |ψ> = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, the options given are in terms of sqrt(2/3) etc., but let me look at the options.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but without hbar factors.

Wait, but the problem is about the eigenvector of a muon's spin operator. The eigenvector is a spinor, which is a two-component vector, but the options include some with hbar multiplied, which seems off because eigenvectors are typically dimensionless. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the scaling.

Wait, in the problem statement, each component P_x is ħ/2 times the Pauli matrix. So the operator P is (ħ/2) times the components. So the eigenvalue is ħ/2. So the eigenvector is a spinor, which is a normalized vector, so the components shouldn't have ħ in them.

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our result.

But wait, let me check the other options.

Option D is (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)). The presence of ħ is confusing because it's a unit vector; it shouldn't have physical units. So probably option D is incorrect.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which looks like spherical coordinates, but I don't think that's the case here.

Option A is (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ), which is a fixed vector regardless of theta, so it's unlikely.

So the correct eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

Wait, but I should check if the problem is about the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Because when I found the eigenvalue to be +1, leading to the eigenvector we calculated, but the operator P is (ħ/2) M. So when we solve P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, that's the same as M |ψ> = |ψ>, which I did correctly.

Wait, but let me think about the operator again. The operator along direction n is (n·P) where n is the direction vector. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, because spin-1/2 systems have eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

So yes, the eigenvector we found is correct, and the components are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.


To determine the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, we proceed as follows:

The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components:
- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$,
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$,
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$.

For an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, the operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is:
\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z,
\]
where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$ (since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane). Substituting the components of $P_x$ and $P_z$, we find:
\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\vec{P} |\psi\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |\psi\rangle.
\]
Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, this simplifies to:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} |\psi\rangle = |\psi\rangle.
\]
This implies:
\[
\left( \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \right) |\psi\rangle = 0.
\]
The resulting matrix is:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To solve this, we find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+1$. The system of equations is:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)\psi_1 + \sin\theta \psi_2 = 0, \quad \sin\theta \psi_1 + (-\cos\theta - 1)\psi_2 = 0.
\]
From the first equation:
\[
\psi_2 = \frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} \psi_1 = \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \psi_1.
\]
Thus, the eigenvector can be written as:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \psi_1 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize, we use the condition $|\psi_1|^2 + |\psi_2|^2 = 1$. Substituting $\psi_2 = \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \psi_1$, we find:
\[
|\psi_1|^2 \left(1 + \tan^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right) = 1.
\]
Using the identity $1 + \tan^2(x) = \sec^2(x)$, we get:
\[
|\psi_1|^2 \sec^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = 1 \implies |\psi_1| = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right).
\]
Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ is incorrect because it does not depend on $\theta$ and includes $\hbar$, which is not part of the normalized eigenvector.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ is incorrect because it does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ is incorrect because it includes $\hbar$ and does not match the normalization.

The correct answer is **Option C**.
