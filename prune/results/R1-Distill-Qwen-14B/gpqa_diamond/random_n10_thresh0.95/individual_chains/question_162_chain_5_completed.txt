Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the area of a pseudosphere with a given metric. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) * (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of dx and dy. So this is a 2-dimensional spacetime? Or maybe a surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space. Oh wait, no, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere, which is a 2-dimensional surface, I think.

Wait, pseudospheres are usually solutions to the Einstein field equations in certain limits. But maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's stick to the metric given.

The problem is about computing the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, but the metric given doesn't have an 'r' in it. Oh wait, maybe the metric is expressed in terms of x and y coordinates, but perhaps we can find the relation to radius r.

Wait, the metric is in the form of ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) * (dx² + dy²). So the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which looks like 4 is r² where r is 2, since 2² is 4. So maybe 4 - x² - y² is 4 - (x² + y²) = 4 - r², but that would make sense if r² is x² + y². Hmm, perhaps in this metric, the spatial part is being expressed in polar coordinates? Because x² + y² is like r².

So in polar coordinates, x² + y² = r², so the denominator becomes 4 - r². So the metric becomes ds² = 32/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²), but wait, no, because the original metric is in terms of dx² + dy², which in polar coordinates is dr² + r² dθ². So that part is correct.

Wait, but the problem says the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So r is 2, so 4 - r² would be zero. Wait, 4 - (2)^2 is zero. So wait, the denominator is zero when r is 2. That would make the metric's coefficient blow up. So the metric is singular at r=2. So that's the event horizon or something like that.

Wait, but the area is usually computed by integrating over the surface. But if the metric becomes singular at r=2, what happens to the area?

Alternatively, perhaps the pseudosphere is an a surface with finite area despite having infinite extent. Wait, I'm not sure.

Wait, the pseudosphere (like the tractricoid) has finite area but infinite surface area? No wait, the standard pseudosphere (tractricoid) is a surface of constant negative curvature and has finite area? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, maybe I should compute the area using the metric provided. The area in 2D is usually given by the integral of the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. But since this is a 2D metric, the determinant is just (32/(4 - r²))², but wait no, the area element is sqrt(det g) dr dθ.

Wait, in 2D, the metric is ds² = g_{rr} dr² + g_{θθ} dθ² + cross terms (but if it's diagonal, then only these two terms). So the area element would be sqrt(g_{rr} g_{θθ}) dr dθ. Alternatively, it's the square root of the determinant, which for a diagonal metric is g_{rr} * g_{θθ}.

Wait, let me write the metric in terms of r and θ. So in polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². So the metric becomes:

ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²).

So the components are:

g_{rr} = 32/(4 - r²),
g_{θθ} = (32 r²)/(4 - r²),
and the off-diagonal terms are zero because it's diagonal.

So the determinant of the metric is g_{rr} * g_{θθ} = [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] = (32 * 32 r²)/(4 - r²)^2.

Wait, no, the determinant for a 2D metric is (g_{rr} * g_{θθ} - g_{rθ}^2), but since it's diagonal, g_{rθ}=0, so determinant is g_{rr} * g_{θθ}.

So sqrt(det g) would be sqrt( (32/(4-r²)) * (32 r²/(4-r²)) ) = sqrt( (32 * 32 r² ) / (4 - r²)^2 ) )

Simplify that: sqrt( (1024 r²) / (4 - r²)^2 ) = (32 r) / (4 - r²), because sqrt(1024) is 32 and sqrt(r²) is r, and sqrt((4 - r²)^2) is |4 - r²|. Since 4 - r² is positive for r < 2, and negative otherwise. But since our radius r is 2, what's the range of r? The metric is defined where 4 - r² > 0, so r² <4, so r <2.

Wait, but the radius of the pseudosphere is given as r=2. So the area would be the integral from r=0 to r=2 of sqrt(det g) * r dr dθ? Wait, no, wait, the area element is sqrt(det g) dr dθ. So the integral for area is ∫ (sqrt(det g) ) dr dθ over the region.

So let's calculate the area:

Area = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to r=2) [ (32 r) / (4 - r²) ) ] dr dθ.

Wait, because sqrt(det g) is 32 r / (4 - r²).

So Area = ∫0^{2π} dθ ∫0^2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

We can compute this integral.

First, the integral over θ is 2π. So we have 2π times the integral from r=0 to 2 of [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute that integral. Let me set u = 4 - r², so du/dr = -2r. So r dr = -du/2.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 r dr / (4 - r²)] = 32 * ∫ ( r dr ) / u

= 32 * ∫ ( (-du/2) ) / u )

= 32 * (-1/2) ∫ ( du / u )

= -16 ∫ (du/u) 

= -16 ln|u| + C.

Evaluating from u=4 to u=0.

Wait, wait, when r goes from 0 to 2, u goes from 4 to 0.

So the integral becomes [ -16 ln u ] evaluated at u=0 and u=4.

So, [ -16 ln 0 ] - [ -16 ln 4 ].

Wait, ln 0 is negative infinity, so -16 ln 0 is positive infinity.

Wait, but that would mean the integral diverges. So the area is infinite.

But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm. So if the integral goes up to r=2, which is the point where the denominator becomes zero, the integral would approach infinity.

So the area would be infinite. Looking at the options, option D is +infty.

Wait, but why is the area infinite? Because as r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, so the area element becomes infinite. So integrating up to r=2 would indeed give an infinite area.

So the correct answer is option D.


The metric provided is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This is a 2-dimensional metric, and the problem asks for the area of a pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). To compute the area, we first express the metric in polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), where \( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \). Substituting this, the metric becomes:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

The area element in 2D is given by \(\sqrt{\det g} \, dr \, d\theta\), where \(\det g\) is the determinant of the metric tensor. For this diagonal metric, the determinant is:

\[
\det g = g_{rr} \cdot g_{\theta\theta} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2} = \frac{1024 r^2}{(4 - r^2)^2}.
\]

Thus, the area element is:

\[
\sqrt{\det g} = \sqrt{\frac{1024 r^2}{(4 - r^2)^2}} = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2}.
\]

The area of the pseudosphere is then computed by integrating the area element over the region \( r \in [0, 2) \) and \( \theta \in [0, 2\pi) \):

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

The integral over \(\theta\) gives \( 2\pi \), so the area becomes:

\[
\text{Area} = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, let \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \), or \( r \, dr = -\frac{du}{2} \). When \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \), and when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_4^0 \frac{-\frac{du}{2}}{u} = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{du}{u}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-16 \int_4^0 \frac{du}{u} = -16 \left[ \ln |u| \right]_4^0 = -16 \left( \ln 0 - \ln 4 \right).
\]

Since \(\ln 0 \to -\infty\), the integral diverges, and the area becomes infinite. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite.
