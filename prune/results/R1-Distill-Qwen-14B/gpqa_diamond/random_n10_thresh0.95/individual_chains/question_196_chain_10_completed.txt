Okay, I need to figure out the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, so the setup is that it's obeying Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. The mass is m, and the maximum amplitude is A. The question is about the maximum speed v_max.

Wait, in classical mechanics, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², right? So the kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv². Setting them equal: 1/2 kA² = 1/2 mv² → v_max = sqrt(kA²/m) which is option C. But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. Here, the problem says it's relativistic, so we can't use the classical formula directly because relativistic effects come into play.

So, relativistic harmonic oscillator... I remember that in relativity, the total energy of a particle includes its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The energy levels are quantized, but maybe that's more quantum mechanics. Alternatively, perhaps we should think in terms of the energy equations.

In the relativistic case, the total energy E is gamma times mc². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So E = gamma mc².

In a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. But since it's a conservative system, the total energy should be conserved. At maximum displacement (amplitude A), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic.

Wait, but in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. Hmm, I think the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². So at maximum speed (when velocity is maximum, x is zero), the kinetic energy would be (gamma -1) mc².

The potential energy in the harmonic oscillator is (1/2)k x², but in the relativistic case, maybe the potential is similar, but perhaps modified? Or perhaps it's the same as the classical case because the problem states it obeys Hooke's law, so F = -kx.

Wait, but in special relativity, forces are tricky because they depend on the frame. But maybe for small velocities, the classical form holds, but in this problem, since we're considering relativistic effects, the speed isn't necessarily small. So when x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². At that point, the velocity is zero, so the total energy E is (1/2)kA². But wait, in relativity, the total energy is also gamma mc². So at x=A, v=0, so gamma =1 (since v=0, gamma is 1). So E = mc² = (1/2)kA². So (1/2)kA² = mc² → kA² = 2 mc². But wait, that can't be right because in that case, when the oscillator is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic, which would be E = mc² + K, where K is the kinetic energy. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and the potential energy. Because in the non-relativistic case, the total energy is (1/2)kA², which equals (1/2)mv_max². But in the relativistic case, maybe the total energy is E = mc² + (1/2)kA², because when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, it's all potential energy, and the kinetic energy is zero. Wait, that makes sense. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

But wait, in relativity, the total energy is also gamma mc². So at maximum displacement, v=0, so gamma =1, so E= mc². So if E = mc² + (1/2)kA², that would imply that (1/2)kA² =0, which isn't possible. That can't be right. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Perhaps in the relativistic case, the potential energy is the same as classical, but the total energy includes the rest mass. So when x=A, the mass is momentarily at rest (v=0), so the total energy is the rest energy plus potential energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA². But in relativity, the total energy is also gamma mc². Wait, but at x=A, v=0, so gamma is 1, so E= mc². That suggests that (1/2)kA² =0, which can't be right. So that approach must be incorrect.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the energy conservation in the relativistic case. At any point, the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So E = mc² + K. The kinetic energy K is (gamma -1) mc².

At the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. So K = E - mc². So at x=0, the energy is E= (gamma) mc^2, where gamma is for the maximum speed v_max.

At x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. So E is mc² + (1/2)kA².

But wait, that can't be because when x=A, the velocity is zero, so gamma is 1, so E should be mc². So the potential energy would have to be zero, which it isn't. So maybe the potential energy expression is different in the relativistic case.

Alternatively, perhaps in relativistic harmonic oscillators, the potential is not (1/2)kx². Maybe the form is modified. But the problem states that it obeys Hooke's law, so F = -kx. So the potential is the integral of F, which is (1/2)kx², same as classical.

So perhaps the total energy is E = mc² + (1/2)kA², and when the oscillator is at x=0, all of that energy is kinetic. So E = (gamma) mc^2.

So setting E = mc² + (1/2)kA² = gamma mc².

So (gamma -1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

We can solve for gamma:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²).

Gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)).

So,

1/(sqrt(1 - (v_max^2/c^2))) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²).

Let me write that as:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / (1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²)).

Square both sides:

1 - (v_max^2/c^2) = 1 / [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²) )^2 ]

Then,

v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - [1 / (1 + (k A²/(2 mc²)) )^2 ]

Hmm, but looking at the options, let me see.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 mc^2)))^2 )

That's exactly what I have here. So that would make option D correct.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ) )

No, that doesn't match.

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2m)) )^2 )

Hmm, but our denominator is (1 + ... ), so probably not.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation.

We have:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²).

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²) / (2 m c²).

And gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some variable, say, x.

Then,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + x.

Take reciprocal,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + x).

Square,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + x)^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + x)^2.

Which can be written as,

v^2/c^2 = [ (1 + x)^2 -1 ] / (1 + x)^2.

Expand numerator:

(1 + 2x + x^2) -1 = 2x + x^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = (2x + x^2)/(1 + x)^2.

Factor numerator:

x (2 + x) / (1 + x)^2.

But x is (k A²)/(2 m c^2), so substitute back:

v^2/c^2 = [ (k A²/(2 m c^2)) (2 + (k A²/(2 m c^2) )) ] / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2) ))^2.

Hmm, perhaps this isn't the easiest way to proceed.

But from the earlier expression,

v_max^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ]

Which is,

v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2) ))^2 )

Looking at option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2) ))^2 )

So that's exactly option D.

Wait, but the options are written in terms of fractions. Let me check option D again.

Option D: sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2) ))^2 )

Yes, that's what I have. So the answer should be option D.

Wait, but another way to write this expression.

Wait, let me compute 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c²)))^2.

But perhaps we can manipulate the expression a bit more. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another approach. Maybe using the relativistic expression for velocity in terms of energy.

But I think I've reached the conclusion that option D is correct.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the system using relativistic energy conservation principles.

In the relativistic case, the total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. At maximum displacement (\( x = A \)), the velocity is zero, and all the energy is potential energy, which is \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). Thus, the total energy at this point is:

\[
E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

At the equilibrium point (\( x = 0 \)), all the energy is kinetic, and the total energy is purely relativistic kinetic energy:

\[
E = \gamma_{\text{max}} mc^2,
\]

where \( \gamma_{\text{max}} \) corresponds to the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \). Equating the two expressions for \( E \), we have:

\[
\gamma_{\text{max}} mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
\gamma_{\text{max}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

The Lorentz factor is related to \( v_{\text{max}} \) by:

\[
\gamma_{\text{max}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma_{\text{max}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we solve for \( v_{\text{max}} \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:

\[
1 - \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 \):

\[
\frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Thus, the maximum speed is:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, it matches **Option D**.

**Answer: D**
