Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titrations and pH calculations. But let's take it step by step.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, with various pH values.

First, let me understand the initial setup. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When we titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the equivalence point will form a buffer solution, but wait, actually, the salt formed is the acetate ion, which is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So the equivalence point solution will be basic because acetate is a weak base.

But let's start from the beginning. The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid diluted with 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³. Let me calculate the new concentration.

Molarity (M) is moles per liter. So the initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) are M * V in liters. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters) = 0.001 moles. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the volume becomes 40 cm³, so 0.04 liters. So the new concentration is moles / volume: 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but acetic acid is a weak acid, so when we dilute it, it dissociates more, but the concentration initially is 0.025 M. So for the first part, the pH at 25% titration.

When titrating, the 25% point refers to the point where 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So let's figure out how much NaOH is added at that point.

The moles of acetic acid initially are 0.001 moles (from earlier). So 25% of that is 0.00025 moles. Since NaOH reacts with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio (CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O), the moles of NaOH needed for 25% titration is also 0.00025 moles.

What's the volume of NaOH needed to deliver 0.00025 moles at 0.1 M concentration? Molarity is moles / volume (L). So volume = moles / M = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

But wait, the initial solution's volume is 40 cm³, and adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH makes the total volume 42.5 cm³. But maybe for the purpose of calculating concentration, I can proceed with the moles.

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate ions. Let me denote:

Initial moles of CH3COOH: 0.001 mol.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.00025 mol.

So, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, moles of CH3COOH after reaction: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed: 0.00025 mol.

The total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

This is a buffer solution, so the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

The pKa is the negative log of Ka. Given Ka is 1.85e-5.

So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1) - log(1.85e-5) = 0 - (log(1.85) + log(1e-5)).

Wait, wait, more accurately, pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that.

log(1.85) is about 0.267. So pKa = 4.733 (since log(1.85e-5) is 5 - 0.267 = 4.733, but wait no: 1.85e-5 is 1.85 * 10^-5. So log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5) = 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333 (since 5.882e-3 is 1/17 approx, wait 0.005882 is 1/170, and 0.017647 is 1/56.5? Wait, let me compute 0.005882 / 0.017647.

Alternatively, 0.005882 * 1000 = 5.882 mmol, 0.017647 * 1000 =17.647 mmol. So 5.882 /17.647 ≈ 0.3333, exactly 1/3.

So log(1/3) is approximately -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, which is about 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. Option D has 4.57 as the first. So that suggests that at 25% titration, the pH is around 4.26.

Wait, but wait. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid after 25% titration is 0.00075, acetate is 0.00025. So the ratio [A-]/[HA] is (0.00025) / (0.00075) = 1/3. Hence, log(1/3) is -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256. Rounded to two decimal places, that's 4.26. So the first pH is 4.26, which matches option A and option D is 4.57 and 6.92. So perhaps the first part is 4.26, but let's check the equivalence point.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So moles of NaOH needed would be 0.001 mol, since that's the initial moles of acetic acid. So moles of NaOH = 0.001 mol.

Since NaOH is a strong base, it will deprotonate all the acetic acid, forming 0.001 mol of acetate ion, CH3COO^-.

The volume of NaOH solution required would be (moles)/(Molarity) = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So the total solution volume at equivalence point is 40 cm³ +10 cm³ =50 cm³=0.05 L.

The concentration of acetate ions is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

But acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.

The hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw = Ka * Kb.

Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, wait, let me compute that accurately. 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405 *1e-9 = 5.405e-10.

So Kb =5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis can be approximated using the formula for weak bases. Since Kb is very small, we can assume x is small.

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is small compared to 0.02, we can approximate:

Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

So [OH^-] = 3.29e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.486. Therefore, pH = 14 -5.486 ≈ 8.514, which is about 8.51.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. So that would match. But wait, another option is option D: 4.57; 6.92. Hmm.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the equivalence point calculation? Because another approach is to calculate the pH of the acetate solution.

Alternative approach: For the acetate ion, the pH can be calculated using the formula for the pH of a salt of a weak acid.

The formula is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) → but wait, at equivalence point, all the acid is converted to A^-, so it's only A^- in solution. So HA is negligible. So [A^-] is 0.02 M, and [HA] is negligible. But wait, in solution, some A^- will hydrolyze to form HA and OH^-.

Alternatively, considering the Kb approach, which I did earlier, leading to pH ≈ 8.51.

But wait, some sources say that when you have a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base, the solution is basic because the conjugate base (A^-) reacts with water.

So, the solution here is 0.02 M acetate. So the Kb is 5.405e-10, and using the approximation:

OH^- = sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

Which gives pOH ≈5.48 → pH ≈8.52.

So at equivalence point, pH is around 8.52, which matches option A's second value of 8.52. So the equivalence point pH is approximately 8.52.

So putting it together, the pH at 25% is about 4.26, and at equivalence point, 8.52. So the correct option is A.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option D has 4.57 and 6.92. That would be if the equivalence point is around 7, which is incorrect since it's a weak acid titrated with strong base; the equivalence pH should be above 7.

So the conclusion is that the pH at 25% is 4.26 and equivalence is 8.52, which is option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I correctly calculate the concentrations after titration?

At 25% titration:

Moles of CH3COOH = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- =0.00025 mol.

Volume is 40 +2.5 =42.5 cm³ →0.0425 L.

Concentration of CH3COOH: 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

Concentration of CH3COO^-:0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log (0.005882 / 0.017647) → 4.733 + log(1/3) → 4.733 -0.477 =4.256 →4.26.

Yes that's correct.

So the answer would be A) 4.26;8.52.

Looking back at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So that's the choice.


To solve the problem, we start by calculating the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of CH}_3\text{COOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 1. pH at 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.25 \times 0.001 \, \text{mol} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

After the reaction:
- Remaining moles of CH₃COOH: \( 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol} \),
- Moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed: \( 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \).

The total volume is now \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L} \). The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.733 + \log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

### 2. pH at the Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH, forming 0.001 mol of CH₃COO⁻. The total volume is:

\[
40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of CH₃COO⁻ is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is the conjugate base of acetic acid and will hydrolyze in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( K_b \) for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation for weak bases, the concentration of OH⁻ is:

\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02} = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.486.
\]

Thus, the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.486 = 8.514 \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
At 25% titration, the pH is approximately 4.26, and at the equivalence point, the pH is approximately 8.52. Therefore, the correct option is:

**Answer: A**
