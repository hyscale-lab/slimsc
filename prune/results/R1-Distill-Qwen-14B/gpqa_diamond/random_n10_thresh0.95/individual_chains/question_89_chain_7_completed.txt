Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by breaking down the problem and understanding each reaction step.

The first part is about 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically forming an alkene. But wait, adamantane is a pretty rigid structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromines on carbons 1 and 3. When KOH is used, especially in a high temperature, elimination should occur. Since both bromines are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure, removing them would form a double bond. So, the product after KOH treatment would be 1,3-didehydrogenated adamantane? Or more accurately, an alkene between carbons 1 and 3. Wait, but wait—adamantane is a diamondoid structure; the positions are a bit tricky. So, when KOH is used, the dibromide would eliminate HBr twice, probably forming a diene or perhaps a ring contraction? Hmm, not sure. Wait, perhaps it's a single elimination because each molecule can only eliminate once. Wait, no, wait. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would likely form a conjugated diene upon elimination. Because each Br is on a separate carbon, so each elimination would form a double bond. So perhaps the product is a diene, but considering the structure of adamantane, maybe it's more about forming a bridgehead double bond.

Wait, adamantane has four cyclohexane rings fused together. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on adjacent bridgehead carbons. When KOH is used, the elimination would form a bridgehead double bond. So, the product after KOH would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid, and the NMR has specific signals. Let's look at the NMR data given for product 1.

The 1H NMR of product 1 shows:
- 4.79 (2H)
- 2.41-2.23 (10H)
- 1.94 (2H)
And an IR peak at 1720 cm^-1.

Hmm, 1720 cm^-1 is a strong peak, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). Wait, but if product 1 is from elimination of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH, that would form an alkene, but how does that give a carbonyl group?

Wait, perhaps I got the reaction wrong. Maybe it's not elimination but substitution. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, more likely to cause elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by something else. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Wait, another thought: if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane and it's treated with KOH, perhaps it's a double elimination, forming a ketone. How? Because elimination can sometimes lead to carbonyl groups if two adjacent groups are removed. Wait, no—elimination typically forms alkenes. Unless it's a case of debromination leading to a carbanion which could form a ketone. Wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, considering the IR, the 1720 cm^-1 peak suggests a carbonyl. So perhaps the product is a diketone or some sort of ketone.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is not elimination but a substitution, but that's less likely with KOH as a base. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material isn't an alkyl dibromide but something else. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a bridged structure, perhaps when treated with a strong base, it undergoes a ring-opening elimination to form a carbonyl. For example, in some cases, when a geminal dihalide (two halogens on the same carbon) reacts with a base, it can form a ketone. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a geminal dihalide; the Brs are on different carbons. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't a simple elimination. Let me think again. If you have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons, and KOH removes both in some way. Wait, perhaps it's a double elimination, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. For example, each Br is removed, and the adjacent carbons each lose a Br and a H, forming a double bond. But that would form an alkene, not a ketone.

Wait, but looking at the NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H. That's about where a methylene adjacent to an oxygen might show up, like an ether or an ester. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone's adjacent protons. Wait, but 4.79 is more deshielded, so maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, like an epoxide. But wait, an epoxide's protons are usually around 3-4 ppm. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diepoxide? No, that doesn't fit with the IR. Wait, maybe the product is a bicyclic ether, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Another approach: the IR absorption at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl, so it's either a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But the product is a solid, and aldehydes are usually less stable as solids unless it's something like formaldehyde, which is a gas. So more likely a ketone.

So perhaps the product is a ketone, which would suggest that the reaction forms a carbonyl group. How could that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane?

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. Maybe each Br is replaced by an O- group, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing a β-elimination, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation. If both Brs are eliminated, but each elimination requires a base and H. Wait, but for each Br, you eliminate HBr. So two HBr eliminations would form a diene. But then where does the carbonyl come from?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane has a structure with four cyclohexane rings. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two bridgehead carbons. When KOH is added, perhaps it abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. But wait, if two adjacent double bonds form, maybe it creates a conjugated diene. But that wouldn't explain the carbonyl group in the IR.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. Wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic attack, but KOH is a strong base, not a nucleophile in this context. Unless there's some sort of ring opening.

Alternatively, perhaps heating with KOH leads to a rearrangement. Maybe the dihalide forms an oxide. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone, but that would require losing two HBr molecules, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product isn't from elimination but from a substitution where each Br is replaced by an OH group, but that would form a diol. But that wouldn't give a carbonyl group. Unless it's a neighboring group effect leading to elimination, but I'm not connecting the dots here.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial step forms an epoxide. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product isn't from KOH but from another reagent. No, the question says KOH is used. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe I should proceed to the next steps and see if that gives me any clues.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)3) is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. Hmm. So product 1 would presumably be a ketone, as the IR suggests, so maybe product 2 is formed via Friedel-Crafts, but that requires an aromatic ring. Wait, adamantane derivatives aren't aromatic. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol, which might undergo some kind of acylation.

Wait, but product 1 is a light yellow solid. Friedel-Crafts would require an aromatic ring, but perhaps product 1 is an alcohol that undergoes some kind of reaction with Al isopropoxide to form an acylium ion or something similar.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, but that doesn't fit with the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Then, when treated with a Lewis acid like Al isopropoxide, it might open up. But I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a di-tertiary alcohol. Or maybe it's a ketone, and the Al isopropoxide is used for some kind of alkylation. Hmm.

Then, product 2 is subjected to ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, forming product 3. Ozone followed by work-up usually cleaves double bonds, so this would be an ozonolysis reaction. Ozonolysis of a diene would break each double bond into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a diene, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl compounds.

But I'm getting a bit ahead of myself. Let's try to retrace.

First step: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow, IR 1720 cm^-1, which is a carbonyl).

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but a substitution. Wait, but with KOH, that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. Wait, how? Because if you lose HBr from each adjacent carbon, perhaps it forms a carbonyl. Wait, imagine two adjacent Brs: when each Br leaves, taking a β-hydrogen with it, but that might form a double bond. Wait, maybe a vicinal dihalide can't form a ketone directly upon elimination. So I'm back to square one.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon treatment with KOH, it forms a diepoxide. But no, epoxides would have different IR absorptions (around 1250 cm^-1 for C-O-C). The IR here is 1720, which is a strong carbonyl.

Alternative approach: perhaps the product is adamantanone. Adamantane has a structure that allows for some ketone formation. So if product 1 is 1-adamantanone, then the NMR would show a certain pattern. The IR would match the ketone's carbonyl.

So, how would 1,3-dibromoadamantane form 1-adamantanone upon treatment with KOH?

Wait, perhaps the KOH is causing a dehydrohalogenation twice, leading to the formation of a ketone. For example, if each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a CH2 group, then eliminating both HBr would form a ketone. But I'm not entirely sure how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that elimination of two HBr molecules forms a ketone. Let me imagine the structure: if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons that are each attached to two CH2 groups, eliminating HBr from each might form a double bond, but that doesn't form a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a solvolysis, but with KOH as a base. Hmm, perhaps it's a double β-elimination. Let me think: each Br is on a carbon that has a hydrogen adjacent. So when KOH abstracts a β-hydrogen, each Br leaves, forming a double bond between the two carbons. But that would form an alkene, not a ketone. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the product isn't a ketone but an ester? But the IR would be around 1740 cm^-1 for an ester, so 1720 might be a ketone.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the product is a diketone. But the NMR shows three different sets of peaks. Let me look at the NMR of product 1 again:

4.79 (2H) — possibly a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like an ether or ester.

2.41-2.23 (10H) — these are probably the bridgehead protons, maybe in a ring structure.

1.94 (2H) — perhaps another CH2 group, maybe adjacent to something else.

So if product 1 has a CH2 group next to an oxygen (like an ester or ether), but also a ketone group, then perhaps the structure is a bridged ketone with an ester group elsewhere.

But I'm getting stuck on the first step. Maybe I should think about the NMR data and IR together. The IR is definitely a carbonyl. So product 1 is a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH, undergoes two dehydrohalogenation reactions, each eliminating HBr and forming a double bond. But that would produce an alkene, not a ketone. So maybe the initial reaction is elimination to form an alkene, and then a subsequent oxidation? But the question states that product 1 is formed after heating with KOH, so perhaps oxidation isn't part of this step.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane or some other strained ring, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution where each Br is replaced by an O- group. But then, with KOH, you'd get a diol. But that wouldn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, unless the diol further undergoes some kind of oxidation. But again, that's not part of the reaction conditions given.

I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should proceed with the assumption that product 1 is a ketone and see where that leads me.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, perhaps 1-adamantanone. Then, when product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid, perhaps it's used in a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, adamantane isn't aromatic, so Friedel-Crafts doesn't apply. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes some kind of enolate formation or alkylation. Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen condensation or something else.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, heating it with Al isopropoxide might not do much. Unless there's another functional group present. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and Al isopropoxide is used to open it, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol, and Al isopropoxide is acting as a catalyst for some kind of elimination to form a carbonyl. But I'm not quite sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, which upon treatment with Al isopropoxide could undergo ring-opening. But without more info, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a tertiary alcohol. Then, Al isopropoxide could facilitate the formation of a tosylate or some leaving group, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bridged ketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes some rearrangement. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is formed via a coupling reaction, but again, unclear.

Wait, let me think about the next step. Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, breaking them into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond.

So, if product 2 has a double bond, then product 1 must have a functional group that, upon reaction with Al isopropoxide, forms a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an alkene formed via elimination. So product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enone (a conjugated enol with a ketone). Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond.

Wait, but ozonolysis of a conjugated diene would produce two carbonyl groups. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene, which upon ozonolysis would form two carbonyl compounds.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is a diene. So, how can product 1 form product 2, which has a diene?

Wait, product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid. Maybe it's used to catalyze an elimination reaction, forming a double bond. So, product 1 might be a diol or a tertiary alcohol, and the Lewis acid facilitates elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, product 1's NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. If product 1 is a diol, say with a CH2-OH group, then heating with Al isopropoxide might cause elimination of water, forming a double bond.

So, product 1 could be a diol, such as 1,3-diol adamantane. But earlier steps would need to form that. Wait, but initial step was elimination with KOH, which would form a di-epoxide or diol?

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an alkene formed via elimination with Al isopropoxide as a catalyst.

But then, where does the carbonyl group come from in product 1's IR?

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or some conjugated system. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let me try to approach this differently. Let me consider product 3's NMR. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. So, after ozonolysis, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

Assuming product 2 has a double bond, which upon ozonolysis forms carbonyl groups. So, the structure of product 3 would depend on where the double bond was in product 2.

So, the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. In such cases, these protons are usually in a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, leading to a triplet due to coupling with two neighboring Hs on each adjacent CH2. Alternatively, if it's a CH group, the coupling could be more complex.

Wait, let me think about ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a double bond typically breaks it into two carbonyl groups. For example, if you have R1R2C=CR3R4, ozonolysis would give R1R2CO and R3R4CO.

But if the double bond is part of a ring, like a cyclopropane, then ozonolysis would produce two carbonyl groups connected via a chain.

Wait, let me suppose that product 2 is a bicyclic compound with a double bond. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, leading to two carbonyl groups. The resulting structure could have two carbonyls connected by a chain.

In product 3, after ozonolysis and work-up, the most deshielded proton would be adjacent to a carbonyl group, perhaps in a CH2CO structure.

In such a case, the CH2 next to the carbonyl would have two neighboring Hs on each adjacent CH2 group, leading to a triplet of triplets. Because each H on the CH2 would be coupling with two Hs on each neighboring group.

Wait, perhaps it's a CH2 group between two carbonyl groups. So each CH2 group is next to a carbonyl, and each H would couple with the adjacent CH2's Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like CH2-CO-R. The Hs on the CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

But wait, the question is about the most deshielded H. Deshielded Hs are typically those near electronegative groups or in an environment with lower electron density, like near carbonyls.

If the structure after ozonolysis has a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, each H on that CH2 would be coupling with two Hs on each adjacent CH2 group. So, each H would have two neighboring Hs on one side and two on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, let me think about the splitting. Each H on the central CH2 would have neighboring Hs on both sides. For example, if you have:

(CH2)2CO

Then each H on the CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would have 2 neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet. But if the structure is more complex, like CH2-CO-CH2-..., then each CH2 group is adjacent to a carbonyl and another CH2.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is also adjacent to another CH2 group, leading to coupling with two Hs on each side. So each H would have coupling constants with two Hs on the left and two on the right, leading to a triplet of triplets. Or maybe a doublet of triplets, depending on the structure.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, each H would be coupled with the two Hs on each adjacent CH2 group. But that's a more complex scenario.

Wait, let me think of a specific example. Suppose product 3 is a diketone with the structure O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, the CH2 groups in the middle would each have two adjacent Hs. Each H on the middle CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the neighboring CH2 group. So each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet. But in reality, each H is coupled with two Hs on each adjacent group, so that's actually a triplet of triplets.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Each H in the middle CH2 is next to two Hs on the left and two on the right. So each H would have two sets of couplings: one with the two Hs on the left (J1) and one with the two Hs on the right (J2). So the splitting would be a triplet for each coupling, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But wait, that's only if J1 and J2 are different. If J1 and J2 are similar, the splitting might collapse into a quintet. Alternatively, if the coupling constants are the same, it might be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but in reality, in such a structure, each H would couple with two Hs on each adjacent CH2 group. So each H has two couplings, each to two Hs. So the splitting would be (n+1)(m+1), where n=2 and m=2. So (2+1)(2+1) = 9, which would be a nonet. But that's not one of the options. So maybe this isn't the right scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded H is part of a CH group next to a carbonyl. For example, a propenal group (CH2=CH-CO), but after ozonolysis, that becomes two carbonyl groups. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps product 2 is a tricyclic compound with a bridgehead double bond. Ozonolysis of a bridgehead double bond would break it into two carbonyl groups. Then, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups where the bridge was. So the adjacent Hs would be on a CH2 group next to each carbonyl.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 has a conjugated diene, which upon ozonolysis gives a diketone. Then, the most deshielded H would be on a CH2 group between two ketones.

In that case, each H on the CH2 would be next to two Hs on either side. So each H would have two neighboring Hs on each adjacent CH2 group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But looking at the options, B is triplet of triplets, and C is doublet of triplets. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, CH-CO. That CH would have coupling with adjacent Hs. But in ozonolysis, the product would be a ketone and another group.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded H is on a terminal CH group next to a carbonyl. For example, RCO-CH2-CH2-CH2-... But that's not a bridgehead scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group that's adjacent to a carbonyl and also next to another CH2 group. So each H on that CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Wait, let me think of a specific example. Suppose after ozonolysis, the molecule is CH2(CO)-CH2-CH2(CO)-something. Then the middle CH2 would have two neighboring CH2 groups, each with two Hs. So each H on the middle CH2 would be split by two Hs on each side. So the splitting would be a triplet of triplets because each H is coupled with two Hs on each adjacent group. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH group that's only coupled with one neighboring H. But that doesn't fit the options.

Wait, another angle: the IR of product 1 shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone. When product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid, perhaps it facilitates an elimination reaction, forming a double bond adjacent to the ketone. So product 2 would have a conjugated enone (alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone).

Then, when product 2 undergoes ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved. Ozonolysis of an enone would form two carbonyl groups. But in this case, since the double bond is conjugated to the ketone, ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups, but perhaps not form a new structure beyond that.

Wait, but ozonolysis of an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone would typically cleave the double bond between the alpha and beta carbons, leading to the formation of two carbonyl groups. For example, CH2=CH-CO-R would become two fragments: CO and another CO group, depending on the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the enone structure leads to a diketone after ozonolysis.

Wait, but in any case, the resulting product 3 would have carbonyl groups, and the Hs adjacent to them would be deshielded.

So, considering that product 3's structure has a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, each H on that CH2 would be coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group. So each H would be a triplet. But if there are two sets of adjacent Hs, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, perhaps it's a CH2 group between two carbonyl groups. So the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Each CH2 group would be adjacent to a carbonyl. The Hs on each CH2 would couple with two Hs on the neighboring CH2 group. So each H would be a triplet due to coupling with two Hs. So the NMR would show a triplet for that CH2.

But wait, the question is about the most deshielded H, which is probably the one closest to the carbonyl. So in that case, the CH2 next to the carbonyl would have each H coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another scenario where the H is coupled with two different sets of Hs, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl, leading to coupling with two Hs on the same CH2 and one H on another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the H is part of a CH2 group with two adjacent Hs on one side and another H on the other, but that's getting too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a diketone with a CH2 group between two carbonyls, and each H on that CH2 is coupled with two Hs on one adjacent CH2 and two on the other. That would lead to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

If the H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to two CH2 groups, each with two Hs, then the splitting would be a triplet of triplets (option B).

Alternatively, if the H is coupled with two Hs from one side and one from the other, it might be a doublet of triplets (option C), or a triplet if coupled with two Hs.

But given the possible structures, I think the most likely scenario is that the H is part of a CH2 group between two carbonyls, each H being coupled with two Hs on each adjacent CH2 group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but wait. The question specifies that product 3's most deshielded H (excluding those that exchange with deuterated solvent) shows what coupling pattern.

If the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each H on the middle CH2 groups would be coupled with two Hs on each adjacent CH2. So each H would have two neighboring groups with two Hs each, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But looking at the options, that's option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the H is part of a CH group, leading to a different splitting. But I think the more likely answer is a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating this. Maybe the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is also adjacent to another CH group. For example, O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-something. Then, each H on the CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the CH2 and the one H on the adjacent CH. That would lead to a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. However, considering the options, I think the most plausible answer is a triplet of triplets (option B).


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning leading to the answer:

1. **Step 1: Reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH**  
   - The reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH at 240°C likely involves elimination of two equivalents of HBr, forming a conjugated diene. However, the IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group. This suggests that the reaction does not stop at the diene stage but proceeds further to form a ketone, likely 1-adamantanone.  
   - The ¹H NMR of product 1 supports this conclusion:  
     - 4.79 ppm (2H) could correspond to a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen atom.  
     - 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H) likely corresponds to the bridgehead protons of the adamantane skeleton.  
     - 1.94 ppm (2H) could correspond to another CH₂ group.  

2. **Step 2: Reaction of product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide**  
   - Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)₃) is a Lewis acid, often used in elimination or acylation reactions. Given that product 1 is a ketone, the reaction likely facilitates the formation of a conjugated enone (α,β-unsaturated ketone) via elimination. This forms product 2, which contains a double bond conjugated to the carbonyl group.

3. **Step 3: Ozonolysis of product 2**  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, breaking it into two carbonyl groups. This results in product 3, which is a diketone. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **Analysis of the coupling pattern in product 3**  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group. This CH₂ group is also adjacent to another CH₂ group, which has two hydrogens.  
   - Each hydrogen on the CH₂ group couples with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet. However, since the coupling occurs with two sets of hydrogens (from both adjacent CH₂ groups), the splitting pattern becomes a triplet of triplets.

5. **Evaluation of the options**  
   - **A) Triplet**: This would occur if the hydrogen coupled with only two equivalent hydrogens. However, the presence of two adjacent CH₂ groups makes this unlikely.  
   - **B) Triplet of triplets**: This matches the scenario where each hydrogen couples with two hydrogens from each adjacent CH₂ group, leading to a more complex splitting pattern.  
   - **C) Doublet of triplets**: This would occur if the hydrogen coupled with one set of two hydrogens and another set of three hydrogens, which is not consistent with the structure.  
   - **D) Pentet**: This would occur if the hydrogen coupled with four equivalent hydrogens, which is not the case here.  

Thus, the most plausible coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet of triplets.
