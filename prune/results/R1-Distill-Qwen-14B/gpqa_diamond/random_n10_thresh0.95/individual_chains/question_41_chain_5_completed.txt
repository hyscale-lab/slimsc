Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and it's moving toward the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties. Oh right, the speed v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So in the glass, light normally travels at speed 1/n, assuming c is set to 1 as in the problem.

But the glass is moving. Does the motion of the glass affect the speed of light inside it? Or is the speed of light still just 1/n relative to the glass? Because according to special relativity, the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames. Wait, but here the glass is a medium, not a vacuum. So maybe that changes things.

Let me think again. Suppose the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. Inside the glass, the light is moving at speed v_light = 1/n. So from the lab frame, what's the speed of the light? 

Wait, in the frame where the glass is moving, how does that affect the light's speed inside? Since the glass is moving, perhaps the light's speed relative to the lab is not just 1/n. Or is it?

I think the speed of light in a medium is always c in any inertial frame, but wait, no. Because in the medium, the light's speed is determined by the medium's properties. So when the medium is moving, how does that combine with the speed of light?

Let me consider the frame moving with the glass. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at 1/n. But if the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, then we have to transform the light's velocity into the lab frame.

Wait, velocities don't just add linearly in relativity. Normally, you'd use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. But wait, the medium is moving, so maybe it's more complicated. Or does the velocity addition formula apply here?

The velocity addition formula is (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c^2), where u' is the velocity in the medium's frame. So in the medium's frame, the light's speed is u' = 1/n. Then, in the lab frame, the velocity u would be ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (1/n) v ) / c² ). But since c is 1, that simplifies to (1/n + v) / (1 + v/(n)).

Wait, that's (1 + n v) / (n + v). Because let's see: numerator is 1/n + v = (1 + n v)/n. Denominator is 1 + (v/n) = (n + v)/n. So when you divide them, the n's cancel out. So u = (1 +n v)/(n +v).

Wait, but wait. Is the light moving in the same direction as the glass? The problem says the light is propagating through the glass in the same direction as the glass's motion, and the glass is moving toward the observer. So the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity.

Wait, but what is the direction in the velocity addition? Suppose the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light, in the glass's frame, is moving at speed u' = 1/n in the same direction as the glass's movement. So in the lab frame, the light's speed is u = (u' + v) / [1 + (u' v)/c^2 ].

Wait, but the problem states that the glass is moving in the same direction as the light. So, if the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction, then in the lab frame, the light is moving faster than the glass. But I'm not sure if that's the right way to model it.

Wait, let me make sure. The glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving through the glass in the same direction as the glass's motion. So from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving toward them, and the light is moving in that same direction. So the light's velocity in the lab frame would be higher than the glass's velocity.

So using the velocity addition formula, as I did earlier, the light's speed in the lab would be (u' + v) / (1 + u' v) because c is 1. But u' is 1/n. So substituting, the lab speed is (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n) v) = ( (1 + n v)/n ) / ( (n + v)/n ) ) = (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Wait, but wait. The options given include (1 + n v)/(n + v), which is option A. But I'm a bit confused because I thought the speed of light in a medium is always c regardless of the medium's motion, but that's only in a vacuum. Because in a medium, the speed of light depends on the medium, but when the medium itself is moving, the light's speed in the lab frame would change.

Wait, but according to the velocity addition formula, if the light's speed in the medium's frame is u', then in the lab frame it's u as per the formula. So in this case, the speed would be higher than the medium's speed.

Wait, but let me double-check the velocity addition formula. The formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c²). So with c=1, it's (u' + v)/(1 + u' v).

Plugging u' = 1/n, we get [ (1/n + v) ] / [ 1 + (v/n) ].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (1 + n v)/n.

Denominator: (n + v)/n.

So when we divide, the n's cancel, giving (1 + n v)/(n + v). Which is option A.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The light beam is propagating through a glass medium with a refractive index \( n \), and the glass itself is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, toward the observer.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Speed of Light in the Glass (Medium's Frame):**  
   In the frame of the glass, the speed of light is given by \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \), where \( c = 1 \) (as specified in the problem).

2. **Velocity Addition Formula:**  
   To find the speed of light in the laboratory frame, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:  
   \[
   u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + u' v}
   \]  
   Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \), the formula becomes:  
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]

3. **Simplification:**  
   Simplify the numerator and denominator:  
   - Numerator: \( \frac{1}{n} + v = \frac{1 + n v}{n} \)  
   - Denominator: \( 1 + \frac{v}{n} = \frac{n + v}{n} \)  
   Dividing these gives:  
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}} = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**  
   The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.

### Conclusion:
The motion of the glass affects the observed speed of light due to the relativistic velocity addition formula. The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
