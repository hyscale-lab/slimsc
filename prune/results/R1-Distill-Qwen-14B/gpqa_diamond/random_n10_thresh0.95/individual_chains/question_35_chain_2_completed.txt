Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon.

Wait, the operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S. Oh right, c is h/(4π). And S is a 2x2 matrix. They've given the first row of S as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So S looks like this:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

I remember that the Pauli matrices are similar, but this might be a different one. Oh wait, the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so S is the Pauli Y matrix. So Ay = c * Y, where Y is the Pauli Y matrix.

The eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ. So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

First, I should probably find the eigenvalues of S, then multiply by c to get the eigenvalues of Ay.

Since S is a Pauli matrix, I remember that the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. So the eigenvalues of S are 1 and -1. Wait, no, wait. For the Pauli Y matrix, the eigenvalues are ±1. So that's correct.

So the eigenvalues of Ay would be c multiplied by these. Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues a are (h/(4π)) * (±1), so a = ± h/(4π).

Wait wait, but looking at the options, let's check. Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh and real part ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues should be real or imaginary? Wait, wait, no—the eigenvalues of Pauli matrices are real, right? Because Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Oh yes, because S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is Hermitian. So its eigenvalues are real, ±1. Therefore, Ay is c times Hermitian, so Ay is Hermitian as well. So the eigenvalues should be real.

So the eigenvalues of Ay would be ±(h/(4π)). So the eigenvalues are real: a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). So any options that suggest the eigenvalues have imaginary parts can be ruled out.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Imaginary part ±2πh, real part ±h/(4π). No, because eigenvalues are real. So A is wrong.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, but our eigenvalues are real. So the eigenvalues would have real parts ±1, but the imaginary parts are zero. So B is saying eigenvalues have imaginary parts, which can't be right. So B is incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Hmm, I'm not sure. Well, since A is a component of the angular momentum, the square of A (A²) is the total angular momentum squared, which commutes with all components (since [A_x, A_y] etc. are non-zero, but A² is a Casimir operator that commutes with each component). So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it should also be an eigenfunction of A². So the statement in C says that it can be an eigenfunction of A², which is correct. But does it say anything about Az? The statement says "but not of the Z-component, Az." Wait, the components don't commute. So if you have an eigenstate of Ay, it won't be an eigenstate of Az, because [Ay, Az] = iħ A_x, so they don't commute. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So the statement in C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator's space, which is 2x2, so yes, the eigenvectors would form a basis. Wait, but the eigenvectors for a 2x2 matrix are two in number, so they form a basis. So D's statement may be correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps I should look at each option's validity.

Let me think again. The eigenvalues of Ay are a = ± h/(4π). So looking at the options, none have eigenvalues with real parts and zero imaginary parts except for perhaps option C, which doesn't talk about eigenvalues but about the functions.

Wait, perhaps I should consider each option.

Option A is about eigenvalue parts, which are wrong because the eigenvalues are real. So A is incorrect.

Option B talks about imaginary parts, which is wrong. So B is wrong.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not of Az. Since A^2 is the square of the angular momentum, and for spin-1/2 particles, the eigenvalues of A^2 are (ħ² s(s+1)), where s=1/2. So A^2 is a scalar, and since Ay and A^2 commute, any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A^2. So the first part is correct. The second part is that it's not an eigenfunction of Az. Since Ay and Az don't commute, correct. So C is a correct statement.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Well, the matrix operator Ay is 2x2, so its eigenvectors form a basis for C². So D's statement is correct. But wait, the statement says "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." Hmm, perhaps. Because Ay is a 2x2 matrix, and its eigenvectors form a basis. So D's statement is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps more than one statement is correct, but the options are presented as A to D.

Wait, but let me think again. So the eigenvalues are real, ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues have no imaginary parts. Now, looking at the options:

Option C: The eigenfunction can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of Az. That's correct because A^2 commutes with Ay, so any eigenstate of Ay is an eigenstate of A^2 (since they share eigenvectors), but Az does not commute with Ay, so their eigenstates are different.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space. So D is correct. So which of the options is correct?

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps more than one option could be correct, but in the given options, only one is correct.

Wait, but the options are given as A, B, C, D, so I have to choose the correct one.

So let's double-check.

Eigenvalues are real: ± h/(4π). So A and B are wrong because they mention imaginary parts.

So between C and D.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions. Because the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait but what about option C?

C says that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct, and not of Az, which is correct.

So both C and D could be correct. But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, let me think again. The question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

So during the calculation, when I find the eigenvectors of Ay, which is a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors would form a basis for the 2-dimensional space. So statement D is correct.

But statement C is also a correct statement about the eigenfunctions.

Wait, but the question is in the context of the calculation. So during the calculation, when I find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

If during the calculation I find that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay, that's correct. So D is correct. But C says something about A² and Az. So perhaps C is also correct.

Wait, the problem is to choose which statement is correct.

Wait, perhaps only one option is correct.

Wait, the question says, which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation.

So during the calculation, when you diagonalize Ay, you find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A². Because A² commutes with Ay, so yes. But not of Az because they don't commute.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Since the space is two-dimensional, the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is a multiple-choice with one correct answer.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because the way the question is worded, which statement is correct. Let me think again.

Wait, let me read the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

Yes, because A^2 commutes with Ay, so any eigenfunction of Ay is an eigenfunction of A^2. However, Az does not commute with Ay, so the eigenfunctions are not eigenfunctions of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, the matrix operator Ay is 2x2, and its eigenvectors form a basis for C^2. So yes, D is correct.

Wait, but perhaps both C and D are correct statements. But in the options, only one can be correct, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the properties of the matrices. Let me compute Ay first.

Ay = c * S, with c= h/(4π) and S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So the matrix Ay is:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Which is:

[ [0, -i*(h/(4π))],
  [i*(h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

So the matrix is:

0          -i*(h/(4π))
i*(h/(4π)) 0

To find the eigenvalues, we solve det(Ay - a I) = 0.

The determinant is | -a        -i h/(4π) |
                  | i h/(4π)  -a       |

The determinant is ( -a )^2 - ( -i h/(4π) )(i h/(4π) )

Compute the second term: (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the second term is (1)*(h^2/(16 π²)).

So determinant is a^2 - [ (h^2)/(16 π²) ) ] = 0.

So a^2 = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4π) as I thought earlier.

So the eigenvalues are real: ± h/(4π).

So, eigenvalues are real. Now, the eigenvectors can be found.

For a = h/(4π):

(Ay - a I) φ = 0 → 

( -a ) φ₁ + (-i c) φ₂ = 0
(i c) φ₁ + (-a) φ₂ = 0

Wait, c is h/(4π), so substituting a = c:

Equation 1: (-c) φ₁ - i c φ₂ = 0 → -c (φ₁ + i φ₂) = 0 → φ₁ = -i φ₂.

So the eigenvector is proportional to ( -i, 1 ). Or can write as (1, i ) scaled.

Similarly, for a = -c:

(Ay + c I) φ =0 → 

c φ₁ - i c φ₂ = 0 → φ₁ = i φ₂.

So eigenvectors are (i, 1) or (1, -i).

So the eigenvectors are (1, i ) and (1, -i ), perhaps up to normalization.

So the eigenfunctions are these vectors.

Now, looking back at the options.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Since the space is 2-dimensional, the two eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

But what about option C?

The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A². Since A² is the Casimir operator, which commutes with all components, any eigenstate of Ay must be an eigenstate of A². So the statement in C is correct.

But wait, in the problem statement, S is given as a 2x2 matrix. So this is for spin-1/2 particles, like the muon.

The eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A², because A² is (ħ^2)(s(s+1)) where s=1/2. So yes, that's correct.

So both C and D are correct statements.

Wait, but in the options, only one can be the correct answer.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating D. The statement says: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

Wait, the matrix operator Ay is 2x2, so its eigenvectors are basis functions for the space. So yes, D is correct.

But the problem is that the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So which of these statements would be correct when solving the problem.

Wait, perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct. So I might need to re-examine.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay.

So, which is more correct? The question is about which statement will I consider correct during the calculation.

I think both C and D could be correct, but perhaps in the options, it's only one that is correct.

Wait, perhaps option D is correct because, given that Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenfunctions are the basis vectors of the matrix. So the correct answer is D.

But I'm a bit confused because I thought C was also correct.

Wait, another approach: the muon is a spin-1/2 particle. The intrinsic angular momentum A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Wait, S is the Pauli Y matrix, which would have eigenvalues ±1. So when multiplied by c = h/(4π), which is ħ/(2π) * (2π), wait, no. Let me compute c.

c = h/(4π) = (2π ħ) / (4π) )= ħ/2.

Ah, wait, because h = 2πħ. So c = (2πħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2.

So Ay = c * S = (ħ/2) * Y.

So the eigenvalues are (ħ/2) * (±1) → ± ħ/2.

Wait, but earlier I thought c was h/(4π), and S has eigenvalues ±1, so a = ± h/(4π) = ± (2π ħ)/(4π) )= ± ħ/2. Yeah, same thing.

So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

But regardless, the eigenfunctions are spin-up and spin-down in the Y direction.

Now, when I think about option C: the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A². Since A² is (ħ/2)(ħ/2 + 1) ) ?

Wait, A² is the square of the angular momentum. For spin-1/2, s=1/2, so A² is (ħ^2)( (1/2)(1/2 +1) ) )= (3/4) ħ^2.

So any eigenfunction of Ay will have A² eigenvalue 3ħ²/4.

So the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So C's first part is correct.

As for Az, since Ay and Az don't commute, the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So the statement in C is correct.

So, if the question is which statement is correct, both C and D could be correct, but the options are presented such that only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct statement is C and D, but since the options are single letters, I think I need to reevaluate.

Wait, the question is about the statements made during the calculation. So during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which of the following statements is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Since the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors should form a basis. So D is correct.

But the earlier analysis also leads to option C being correct.

Wait, perhaps there's another angle. Let me think about the eigenvectors.

The eigenvectors for Ay are (1, i) and (1, -i), up to normalization. The Pauli matrices have eigenstates that are not the same as the eigenstates of S_z. So if I'm looking at Az (the z-component), its eigenvectors are (1,0) and (0,1). Since Ay's eigenvectors are combinations of these, they are not eigenvectors of Az.

So option C is correct: the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², which is correct, but not of Az.

So option C is correct.

Now, the options:

Option C is correct.

Wait, but another point: the eigenvectors form a basis, so option D is correct as well. But perhaps the question is about whether the eigenfunctions are the same as the basis functions of the operator.

Wait, the statement in D says, "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So, the matrix operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix, and its eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So this statement is correct.

But then, why is option C correct?

Hmm. I'm getting stuck between C and D.

Wait, think about the structure of the problem. The question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation. So which statement would be true when you're calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Since the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors would form a basis for the space, so D is correct.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Which is correct as well.

So perhaps both C and D are correct, but in the options, only one is presented as correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps only C is correct. Because D is a bit of a general statement and is always true for 2x2 matrices, but C is a more specific statement about the particular operator.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, perhaps the statement in D is a bit ambiguous. The eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. It's more precise to say that the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space the operator acts on. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors form a basis for C^2, so D is correct.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps D is incorrect because the basis functions are the standard basis vectors, but the eigenvectors are different.

Wait, the standard basis for 2x2 matrices is (1,0) and (0,1). The eigenvectors of Ay are (1, i) and (1, -i), which are linear combinations of the standard basis vectors. So they're not the same as the basis functions (standard basis), but they form another basis.

So the statement in D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. If by "basis functions" they mean the standard basis, then D is incorrect. Because the eigenfunctions are not the standard basis vectors.

Ah, that might be the key point. The standard basis is (1,0) and (0,1), but the eigenvectors are different. So the eigenfunctions are not the standard basis functions, unless they happen to be the same. In this case, they are not.

So statement D is incorrect because the eigenvectors of Ay (which are (1,i) and (1,-i)) are not the same as the standard basis functions (1,0) and (0,1). Therefore, D is incorrect.

So the correct statement is C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Therefore, the correct option is C.


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), for a muon. The operator is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli Y matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvalues of the Pauli Y matrix \( S \) are \( \pm 1 \), as it is a Hermitian matrix.
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real numbers.

2. **Eigenvalues of the Options:**
   - **Option A:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \), and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are entirely real, with no imaginary parts.
   - **Option B:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \), and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

3. **Eigenfunctions of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvectors of \( A_y \) are found to be proportional to \( (1, i) \) and \( (1, -i) \), which are distinct from the standard basis vectors \( (1, 0) \) and \( (0, 1) \).
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \). However, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \) (the Z-component of angular momentum) because \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute.

4. **Option C and D:**
   - **Option C:** Correctly states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \). This is consistent with the commutation relations and the properties of angular momentum operators.
   - **Option D:** Claims that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is incorrect because the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not the same as the standard basis vectors \( (1, 0) \) and \( (0, 1) \), which are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \). 

Answer: C
