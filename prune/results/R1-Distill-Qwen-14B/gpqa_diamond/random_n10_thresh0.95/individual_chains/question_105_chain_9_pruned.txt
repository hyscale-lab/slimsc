--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see.

The question is about a star with a radius equal to the Sun's. It has dark spots covering one hemisphere, with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. When the star rotates, these spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations that can look like an exoplanet transiting the star.

The problem asks what the radius of an exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation. So we're comparing the signal from the planet's transit to the signal caused by the spots.

Hmm. I remember that the change in brightness (the dip) when a planet transits a star depends on the ratio of their areas. The formula is something like delta F over F = (Rp/Rstar)^2. Because the area of the planet is a circle with radius Rp, and the star's area is a circle with Rstar. So when the planet passes in front, it blocks that fraction of the star's light.

But wait, the star has these spots. So when the spots rotate into view, the brightness changes, but it's not a simple occultation. Spots are cooler, so when they're on the visible side, the star appears dimmer. So the variation in brightness due to spots is different.

Wait, the star's hemisphere is spotty. So the star's surface isn't uniform. The total brightness variation when the spots rotate would depend on the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

So the idea is that the observed brightness variation caused by the spots should be the same as if an exoplanet were causing a dip through transit.

Let me model this.

First, the star's total luminosity without spots: L = 4πRstar² σ Teff⁴.

But wait, when spots are present, the effective brightness changes. Spots have a lower temperature. So the observed flux when spots are in view would be lower.

The filling factor is 20%, which means the spots cover 20% of the star's surface area. So the star's surface isn't entirely spot-free. Let's think about how the flux changes as the star rotates.

But wait, the star's hemisphere is covered with spots. So if it's one hemisphere, that's half the star. Wait, no, the filling factor is 20%, so the spots take up 20% of the hemisphere. So the total area with spots is 20% of the hemisphere's area, which would be 0.2 * (2π Rstar²) / 2, because a hemisphere is half the surface area. Wait, no, wait: the total surface area of a sphere is 4π R². A hemisphere is 2π R². But the filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So if the spots cover 20% of the star's surface, that's 0.2 * 4π Rstar² = 0.8π Rstar².

Wait, no. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So if it's 20%, then the area A_spots = 0.2 * 4π Rstar² = 0.8π Rstar².

But the question says that only one hemisphere is spotty. Wait, no, the entire hemisphere is covered in spots. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, the question says: One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Hmm. So each hemisphere (northern and southern) is a hemisphere. So one hemisphere is completely covered with spots, but the spots themselves have a filling factor of 20%. Wait, no, maybe the hemisphere is the area where the spots are, but the spots cover only 20% of that hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me re-read: "One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the hemisphere is the area that's spotted, and within that, 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered by spots. Or is the entire hemisphere covered with spots, and the filling factor is 20% overall? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the filling factor is the fraction of the entire star's surface that is covered by spots. So 20% of the entire surface is spots. So A_spots = 0.2 * 4π R² = 0.8 π R².

But the question says that only one hemisphere is spotty. So perhaps the spots are concentrated in one hemisphere, but the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface.

I think I should proceed under the assumption that the spots cover 20% of the star's surface. So A_spots = 0.2 * 4π Rstar² = 0.8 π Rstar².

Each spot has a temperature of (6000K - 1000K) = 5000K. The rest of the star's surface is at 6000K.

So the total flux from the star when spots are visible will be lower than when they're not.

But how does this translate into the brightness variation observed?

Wait, when the star rotates, the spots come into view. The star's brightness is modulated because the spots are cooler.

But for the brightness variation, I need to compute the maximum change in flux as the spots come into view.

Wait, but the problem says that the star's brightness variation due to spots is being mistaken for a planet transit. So the dip in brightness caused by the spots when they are on the visible hemisphere is being compared to the dip caused by a planet.

So, to find the radius of the planet that would cause the same dip in brightness as the spots, we need to compute the relative change in flux.

Wait, but when the spots are on the visible side, the flux is lower. So the maximum dip occurs when the spots are fully visible.

Wait, but how much does the flux dip when spots are present?

The star's total flux without any spots is F0 = σ Teff^4 * (4π Rstar²) / (4π D²) ) when observed from Earth, but I think the actual value might not matter because we can work with relative changes.

Alternatively, considering the surface brightness: each part of the star emits with a certain flux, depending on its temperature. The total flux is the sum of all the surface elements.

So the star's surface is made of two parts: spots (covering 20% of the area) with T_spot = 5000 K, and the rest (80% area) with T=6000 K.

So the total flux F_total = F_spot + F_non_spot.

F_spot = A_spot * σ T_spot^4
F_non_spot = A_non_spot * σ T_non_spot^4

Where A_spot = 0.2 * 4π R²
Wait, wait, no. The entire star's surface is 4π R², so A_spot = 0.2 * 4π R².

Wait, no. Wait, if the filling factor is 20%, then A_spot is 0.2 of the total surface area. So A_spot = 0.2 * 4π R² = 0.8π R².

Similarly, A_non_spot = 4π R² - A_spot = 3.2 π R².

So the flux from the spots is F_spot = A_spot * σ (5000)^4.

The flux from the non-spots is F_non_spot = A_non_spot * σ (6000)^4.

The total flux when the spots are on the side facing us is F = F_spot + F_non_spot.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, when the star is rotating, the spots are on the visible side, so their flux is included.

But the star's flux when spots are on the visible side is F_visible = F_spot + F_non_visible_non_spot.

Wait, perhaps I should model the star as being composed of two regions: one with spots (A_spot) and the rest without (A_non_spot). When the star rotates, the spots come into view. But I'm not sure that's correct because the star's rotation would cause the spots to come into and out of the observed hemisphere.

Wait, wait, the question says that only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star rotates, that hemisphere comes into the observer's view, and when it's on the far side, the spots are not visible.

Wait a minute. So when the star shows the spotted hemisphere, the observed flux is lower because a part of the star's surface (the spotted part) is cooler. When the other hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the far side, so the flux is from the non-spotted part.

Wait, but the filling factor is 20% for the entire star. So the spotted hemisphere (which is half the star's surface) has the spots covering 20% of the entire star. So the area of the spots is A_spots = 0.2 * 4π R² = 0.8 π R².

But the spotted hemisphere is 2π R² in area. So the spots cover 0.8 π R² of that. So in the hemisphere we're observing, the spotted area is 0.8 π R², and the unspotted area is 2π R² - 0.8 π R² = 1.2 π R².

Wait, maybe I should model it this way: when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is from the spotted region plus the unspotted part of the hemisphere. Because the other hemisphere isn't visible. So the spotted hemisphere has both spotted and unspotted areas.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's try a different approach.

The star's surface is divided into two hemispheres: one is spotty (let's call it the front hemisphere), the other is spot-free (the back hemisphere).

Each hemisphere has a surface area of 2π R².

The front hemisphere has spots covering 20% of the star's entire surface. So the front hemisphere has 20% of 4π R², which is 0.2 *4π R² = 0.8π R². But since the front hemisphere is only 2π R², how much of it is covered by spots?

Wait, perhaps the front hemisphere is the only one with spots, and the spots cover 20% of the entire star's surface. So the area of the spots is 0.2 *4π R² = 0.8 π R². Since the front hemisphere is 2π R², the spots occupy 0.8 π R² / (2π R²) ) = 40% of the front hemisphere. Wait, 0.8π/(2π) = 0.4.

So when the front hemisphere is facing us, 40% of that hemisphere is covered in spots. The rest 60% is normal.

So the flux when the front is facing us is the sum of the flux from the spotted part and the flux from the non-spotted part of the front hemisphere, plus the entire back hemisphere.

Wait, but the back hemisphere is spot-free. So the back hemisphere's flux is (2π R²) * σ (6000)^4.

The front hemisphere when it's visible: 40% is spots, 60% is normal.

So flux from front hemisphere = (0.4 * 2π R²) * σ (5000)^4 + (0.6 * 2π R²) * σ (6000)^4.

Wait, no. Wait, the front hemisphere's surface area is 2π R². Spots cover 0.4 * 2π R² = 0.8 π R², which matches the 0.8 π R² from earlier.

So when the front hemisphere is visible:

F_front = (0.8 π R²) * σ (5000)^4 + ( (2π R² - 0.8 π R²) ) * σ (6000)^4.

Which is F_front = 0.8 π R² σ (5000)^4 + 1.2 π R² σ (6000)^4.

The back hemisphere, which is spot-free, when the front is visible, is not contributing because it's on the far side. Wait, no, when the front is facing us, the back is on the other side and not visible. So the observed flux is just from the front hemisphere.

Wait, no, that's not right. The total flux when the front is facing us is from the front hemisphere. When the back is facing us, the flux is from the back hemisphere, which is spot-free. So when the front is visible, the flux is from the front hemisphere, including spots. When the back is visible, the flux is from the back hemisphere, which is entirely normal.

Wait, but the star's rotation would cause the front and back hemispheres to come into view. So the maximum flux is when the back hemisphere is visible (no spots), and the minimum flux is when the front is visible (with spots).

So the maximum flux F_max occurs when the back hemisphere is visible: F_max = 2π R² * σ (6000)^4.

The minimum flux F_min occurs when the front hemisphere is visible: F_min = [0.8 π R² σ (5000)^4 + 1.2 π R² σ (6000)^4 ].

The difference in flux between F_max and F_min would be F_max - F_min = [2π σ (6000^4) R² ] - [0.8 π σ (5000^4) + 1.2 π σ (6000^4) ) R² ].

Let's compute that:

F_max = 2π R² σ (6000⁴)
F_min = (0.8 π R² σ (5000⁴) ) + (1.2 π R² σ (6000⁴) )
= π R² σ [0.8 (5000⁴) + 1.2 (6000⁴) ]

So F_max - F_min = 2π R² σ (6000⁴) - π R² σ [0.8 (5e3)^4 + 1.2 (6e3)^4 ]

Factor out π R² σ:

= π R² σ [ 2 (6e3)^4 - [ 0.8 (5e3)^4 + 1.2 (6e3)^4 ] ]

Compute inside the brackets:

2*(6e3)^4 = 2 * 6^4 * 1e12 = 2 * 1296 * 1e12 = 2592e12.

0.8*(5e3)^4 = 0.8 * 625e12 = 500e12.

1.2*(6e3)^4 = 1.2 *1296e12 = 1555.2e12.

So inside the brackets: 2592e12 - [500e12 + 1555.2e12 ] = 2592e12 - 2055.2e12 = 536.8e12.

So F_max - F_min = π R² σ * 536.8e12.

The amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between F_max and F_min. When the planet transits, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 times the star's flux.

Wait, but wait, the planet causes a dip when it transits. The dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 * F0, where F0 is the star's flux without any planet. But in the case of the spots, the dip is F_max - F_min.

So the dip from the planet (dF_planet) is (Rp/Rstar)^2 * F0.

The dip from the spots (dF_spots) is F_max - F_min.

We are to set dF_planet = dF_spots.

Wait, but F0 is the star's flux when there are no spots, right? Or is it when the star is in a certain state?

Wait, actually, the star's flux without spots would be F0 = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

But in reality, the star has spots, so when the back hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_max = 2π R² σ (6000)^4. When the front is visible, F_min is lower.

But wait, the star's average flux without any spots would be F0 = 4π R² σ (6000)^4. But with spots, the average flux would be lower. But the variation is the difference between F_max and F_min.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the relative change in flux when the spots are on the front. The dip is (F_max - F_min)/F0.

Wait, but the question says that the star's brightness variations (due to rotation) are being mistaken for a planet transit. So the amplitude of the variation (the dip) caused by the spots is the same as the dip caused by the planet.

But the dip from the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2 * F0.

The dip from the spots is (F_max - F_min).

Wait, but I think F0 is the star's flux without any spots. But with spots, the star's flux varies. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting tangled here.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to compute the relative change in flux when the spots are on the front.

The relative dip is (F_max - F_min) / F0.

Set that equal to (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Because when the planet transits, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 times the star's flux.

So, let's compute (F_max - F_min) / F0.

F0 is the star's flux without any spots, which is 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

So,

(F_max - F_min)/F0 = [ π R² σ (536.8e12) ] / [4π R² σ (6000^4) ].

Simplify:

= [536.8e12] / [4 * (6e3)^4 ].

Compute 6e3^4 = (6^4)*(1e3)^4) = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

So,

= 536.8e12 / (4 * 1.296e15 )

= 536.8e12 / 5.184e15

= (536.8 / 5184) * 1e-3.

Wait, 536.8 /5184 ≈ 0.1035.

So 0.1035e-3 = 1.035e-4.

So (F_max - F_min)/F0 ≈ 1.035e-4.

So the dip due to the spots is approximately 0.01% of the star's flux.

Now, the dip due to the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Set (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 1.035e-4.

Take square root:

Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(1.035e-4) ≈ 0.01017.

Wait, that's about 0.01, which is 1% of Rstar. Looking at the options, the closest is option B) ~0.07, but that's 7%... Hmm, none of the options match that.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculations?

Let me double-check the steps. Maybe I messed up the calculation when computing F_max - F_min.

Wait, let's recalculate:

Inside the brackets, 2592e12 - (500e12 + 1555.2e12) = 2592e12 - 2055.2e12 = 536.8e12.

Wait, 2592 - 2055.2 = 536.8, yes.

F0 is 4π R² σ (6e3)^4.

So the ratio is (pi R² sigma 536.8e12 ) / (4 pi R² sigma 6e3^4 )

Simplify:

(pi cancels, R² cancels, sigma cancels.)

Left with (536.8e12) / (4 * (6e3)^4 )

Compute (6e3)^4 = 1.296e16?

Wait, wait, 6e3 is 6000. 6000^4 is (6^4) * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

So,

(536.8e12 ) / (4 * 1.296e15) ) = (536.8e12) / (5.184e15)

= 536.8 / 5184 * 1e-3

536.8 /5184 ≈ 0.1035.

So 0.1035 * 1e-3 = 1.035e-4.

So (dF/F0) from spots is ~1.035e-4.

So the planet's dip would be (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 1.035e-4.

So Rp = Rstar * sqrt(1.035e-4) ≈ Rstar * 0.01017.

So Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.01017, which is about 1% of Rstar.

Looking at the options, the choices are:

A) ~0.39 --> 39% → too big

B) ~0.07 → 7% → maybe not, but let me check.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation in the temperature values. Let me check the temperatures again.

Wait, the star's Teff is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K.

Wait, in the calculation, when computing F_spot, it's (5000)^4, correct?

Yes, so that's correct.

Wait, but let me check the area of the spots again. So the filling factor is 20% for the entire star's surface. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 4π R² = 0.8 π R².

But when the star shows the front hemisphere (the spotty one), the flux from that hemisphere is:

F_front = (0.8 π R²) * σ (5000)^4 + (2π R² - 0.8 π R²) * σ (6000)^4.

Wait, when the front hemisphere is visible, the other hemisphere is not, so F_observed is F_front.

Wait, but earlier I thought that when the front is visible, the observed flux is F_front, and when the back is visible (no spots), the flux is F_back = 2π R² * σ (6000)^4.

So the maximum flux is when the back is visible, and the minimum when the front is visible.

So the dip is F_max - F_min = F_back - F_front.

Wait, that's what I did earlier. So F_back = 2 pi R² sigma (6e3)^4.

F_front = 0.8 pi R² sigma (5e3)^4 + 1.2 pi R² sigma (6e3)^4.

So yes, F_back - F_front = 2 pi R² sigma (6e3)^4 - [0.8 pi R² sigma (5e3)^4 + 1.2 pi R² sigma (6e3)^4 ]

= (2 - 1.2) pi R² sigma (6e3)^4 - 0.8 pi R² sigma (5e3)^4.

= 0.8 pi R² sigma (6e3)^4 - 0.8 pi R² sigma (5e3)^4.

= 0.8 pi R² sigma [ (6e3)^4 - (5e3)^4 ].

Ah, this is a better way to compute it.

So,

delta F = 0.8 pi R² sigma [ (6e3)^4 - (5e3)^4 ].

So,

delta F / F0 = [0.8 pi R² sigma (6e3^4 -5e3^4)] / (4 pi R² sigma (6e3)^4 )

Simplify:

= [0.8 (6^4 -5^4) *1e12 ] / [4 * 6^4 *1e12 ]

The 1e12 cancels.

= 0.8 (1296 - 625) / (4 * 1296 )

Compute 1296 -625 = 671.

So,

= 0.8 * 671 / (4 * 1296 )

= 536.8 / 5184.

536.8 /5184 ≈ 0.1035.

So delta F / F0 ≈ 0.1035 / 1000 = 1.035e-4.

Which brings us back to the same result.

So the dip is ~ 0.01% of the star's flux.

Comparing to the planet's dip: (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 1.035e-4.

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(1.035e-4) ≈ 0.01017.

So Rp is about 1% of Rstar. None of the options match that. The options are 0.07, 0.11, etc.

Wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the assumption that the dip from the spots is F_back - F_front?

Wait, maybe the flux from the star when the spots are visible is lower than when they are not. So the dip is F_back - F_front, which is the difference in flux when the spots are on the back side (so not visible, so flux is higher) compared to when they are on the front (flux is lower). So the maximum dip occurs when the front is visible, which is F_front. So the dip is F_back - F_front, which is the decrease in flux.

But in the planet scenario, the dip is F0 * (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So setting F_back - F_front = F0 (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Wait, but F_back is 2pi R² sigma (6e3)^4, and F0 is 4pi R² sigma (6e3)^4.

So,

F_back = 0.5 * F0.

Because F0 = 4pi R² sigma T^4 = 2pi R² sigma T^4 *2 = 2 * F_back.

So F_back = 0.5 F0.

Then, delta F = F_back - F_front = 0.5 F0 - F_front.

Wait, but F_front is the flux when the front hemisphere is visible.

Wait, let me express F_front in terms of F0.

F_front = [0.8 pi R² sigma (5e3)^4 ] + [1.2 pi R² sigma (6e3)^4 ]

= [0.8 pi R² sigma (5e3)^4 ] + [1.2 pi R² sigma (6e3)^4 ]

We can factor out pi R² sigma.

= pi R² sigma [ 0.8 (5e3)^4 + 1.2 (6e3)^4 ]

But F0 =4 pi R² sigma (6e3)^4 = 4 pi R² sigma (1.296e16) [Wait, 6e3 is 6000, so (6e3)^4 is (6^4)*(1e3)^4)=1296 * 1e12=1.296e15.

Wait, F0 =4 pi R² sigma (6e3)^4 =4 pi R² sigma * 1.296e15.

So,

F_front = pi R² sigma [ 0.8*(5e3)^4 + 1.2*(6e3)^4 ]

= pi R² sigma [ 0.8*625e12 + 1.2*1296e12 ]

Which is pi R² sigma [500e12 + 1555.2e12 ] = pi R² sigma * 2055.2e12.

So,

F_front = pi R² sigma * 2055.2e12.

F0 =4 pi R² sigma * 1.296e15 =4 pi R² sigma * 1296e12.

So,

F_front = (pi R² sigma) * (2055.2e12 )

F0 = (4 pi R² sigma) * (1296e12 )

So,

F_front / F0 = (2055.2e12 ) / (4 * 1296e12 ) = 2055.2 / (5184) ≈ 0.396.

So F_front ≈ 0.396 * F0.

Thus, when the front is visible, the flux is about 39.6% of F0.

But when the back is visible, the flux is F_back = 2 pi R² sigma (6e3)^4 = (2 pi R² sigma * 1.296e15 ) = (2/4) F0 = 0.5 F0.

So the dip when the front is visible is F_back - F_front = 0.5 F0 - 0.396 F0 = 0.104 F0.

So the dip is 10.4% of F0. So the relative dip is 10.4%.

Wait, wait! That can't be right because 10% dip would be a big dip. We had earlier something like 0.01%, which was much smaller.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, let me compute F_front in terms of F0.

F_front = 0.8 pi R^2 (5e3)^4 sigma + 1.2 pi R^2 (6e3)^4 sigma.

F0 =4 pi R^2 (6e3)^4 sigma.

So,

F_front = pi R^2 sigma [ 0.8*(5e3)^4 + 1.2*(6e3)^4 ]

= pi R^2 sigma [ 0.8 * 625e12 + 1.2 * 1296e12 ]

= pi R^2 sigma [500e12 + 1555.2e12 ].

= pi R^2 sigma (2055.2e12 )

F0 =4 pi R^2 sigma 1296e12.

So,

F_front = (2055.2e12 / (4 * 1296e12 )) * F0.

(2055.2 / (4*1296)) = 2055.2 / 5184 ≈ 0.396.

So F_front ≈ 0.396 F0.

F_back = 2 pi R^2 sigma (6e3)^4 = (2/4) F0 = 0.5 F0.

Thus, when the front is visible, the flux is ~0.396 F0, and when the back is visible, it's 0.5 F0.

So the dip is 0.5 F0 - 0.396 F0 = 0.104 F0.

That's a 10.4% dip. That's much larger than the earlier 0.01% I thought. So my first approach was wrong.

Wait, why the discrepancy? Because in the first approach, I treated the star as having spots on a single hemisphere
