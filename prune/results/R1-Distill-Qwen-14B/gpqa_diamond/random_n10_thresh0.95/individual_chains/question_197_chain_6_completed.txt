Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound X based on its spectroscopic data and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of certain functional groups, like nitriles or maybe something else. Wait, or could it be a substitution reaction? Let me think.

First, let's look at the IR data. The IR peaks are given as 3400–2500 cm-¹, which usually indicates N-H or O-H stretches. But in this case, the strong peak around 3400 could be an O-H stretch. Then, 1720 cm-¹ is a strong peak, which might correspond to a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester or maybe an acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-¹ regions are around the area for aromatic C=C stretching. So, the compound has an aromatic ring with substituents, a carbonyl group, and maybe an OH group.

Looking at the NMR data. Starting with the 1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, probably an -OH proton. Though sometimes it could be an aldehyde, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm and split differently. But a broad peak here suggests it's an -OH, maybe in an acidic environment, like a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the IR would have a very strong O-H stretch around 2500-3000 cm-¹, which matches the first IR region. So maybe compound X is a benzoic acid derivative.

Next, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) are typical for para-substituted aromatic rings. So, the ring has two substituents in para positions, maybe a carbonyl group and something else.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH adjacent to an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) might be part of a branched chain. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) suggests a terminal methyl group, like a CH2CH2CH3 chain.

Putting this together: The aromatic ring has two substituents in para positions. One is a carbonyl group (since we have the IR at 1720 cm-¹). The other substituent is an alkyl chain. The NMR shows that the substituents are at para positions, so the structure is something like para-substituted phenyl with a carbonyl group and an alkyl side chain.

Wait, but looking at the NMR shifts, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which might be a carboxylic acid proton. So if that's the case, then the carbonyl at 1720 cm-¹ could be a ketone, but in the presence of a carboxylic acid group, that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the 1720 is an ester or an acid.

Wait, another thought: Could the 1720 cm-¹ be an ester or maybe a ketone? If it's an ester, the IR would show the carbonyl, and in the NMR, the ester oxygen would make the adjacent protons deshielded. But looking at the NMR, I don't see any triplet or quartet that would correspond to an ester's methyl groups. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. But then, the 10.5 ppm would be a different proton.

Wait, maybe the 1720 is a carboxylic acid. Wait no, the carboxylic acid would have a lower wavenumber, around 1700 cm-¹, but that's about the same. But wait, the IR given in the question is 1720. Carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300, which is in the first IR region. So if we have a strong peak at 1720, that could be a carbonyl, perhaps a ketone or an ester or an acid.

Wait, but if the compound is a benzoic acid derivative, then the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-¹. But the given IR is 1720, which might be a bit higher, so maybe it's not a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester, which typically has a higher carbonyl stretch—like 1720-1760 cm-¹.

But then why is there a broad peak at 10.5 ppm? Wait, maybe that's a ketone? No, because ketones don't have O-H. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes appear around 9-10 ppm, but they're usually split into a triplet or something because of coupling with adjacent protons. But in this case, it's a broad singlet.

Wait, another thought: Could it be a phenolic O-H? Phenols have O-H stretches around 3200-3600 cm-¹, which matches the first IR region. But in the NMR, the phenolic O-H would appear as a broad peak, which fits the 10.5 ppm. But phenols don't have carbonyl groups as strong as 1720 cm-¹. Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl is an ester or something else.

Let me try to sketch out the structure based on the NMR. The aromatic protons are a doublet each at 8.0 and 7.2, which suggests a para-substituted benzene. So the substituents are at the para positions. One substituent is a carbonyl group (from IR), and the other is perhaps a side chain.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. Then, 1.7 (m, 2H) and 1.4 (d,3H) could be part of a butyl group. Wait, 1.4 is a doublet—maybe a CH2CH(CH3) group? Let's think: The 1.4 ppm for 3H as a doublet suggests a methyl group attached to something. The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is a terminal methyl, like CH2CH2CH3.

So perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. Wait, but let's count the protons. The 2.9 ppm (1H) would be a CH next to a carbonyl, then 1.7 is two protons, maybe a CH2. Then 1.4 (3H, d) is a methyl group attached to a CH. So, the structure could be something like:

Ph–CO–CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2CH3?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. Maybe it's a propyl group attached to the ring. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. Let's try to piece it together.

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a CH2CH2CH3, so that's a methyl group at the end of a chain. The 1.7 (2H, m) could be a CH2 adjacent to that, so like CH2CH2CH3. Then the 1.4 (3H, d) would be a CH(CH3), which is a branching point. So the substituent could be a sec-butyl group. Wait, let me think: sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)CH2. Wait, no. Structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, no, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-? No, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me draw it.

If the substituent is an isobutyl group, that would be CH2CH(CH3)2. But the NMR doesn't show a triplet for the CH(CH3)2 group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching. Wait, the NMR shows 1.4 ppm (d,3H), which suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. So maybe the chain is something like CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the substituent. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is probably a CH group adjacent to the carbonyl. Then, the 1.7 (m,2H) would be another CH2, and the 1.4 (d,3H) a methyl attached to that. So, the substituent could be a CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, the structure could be:

Ph–CO–CH(CH2CH(CH3)2). Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should look at the options to see what structures they have. Let's check the options:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So, that's a benzoic acid where the benzene has an ethyl group in the para position, and the acid is at the ortho position. Wait, no, wait. 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid would have the structure where the benzene ring has an ethyl group at the para position, and the propanoic acid is attached to the ring at position 2 (which would be the ortho position relative to the ethyl). So the structure would be Ph–CH2–COOH, but with the substituents in para.

Wait, but propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid would have a phenyl group at position 2 of the propanoic acid. So structure would be benzene ring with ethyl group in para, and the propanoic acid is attached at the ortho position? Or perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's Ph–CH2–CH2–COOH. No, that would be 3-phenylpropanoic acid. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the structure in option A.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at position 4. Structure would be Ph–COOH with a sec-butyl at para, so the substituents are COOH and sec-butyl on the benzene ring.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl and a methyl in para positions. So, the benzene has substituents at positions 1 and 4.

Wait, but let's look back at the NMR. The aromatic protons are a doublet each at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. That suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents in the para positions. So, the benzene ring has two groups, each in the para position. So, the substituents are at opposite ends. So for example, positions 1 and 4 if it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene.

In the NMR, the two doublets with 2H each suggest that the ring has two substituents which are identical, leading to two sets of equivalent protons. So, the substituents are probably in the para positions and the same on each side, leading to two doublets in the aromatic region.

So, for example, if the substituents are a carbonyl group (like COOH or COOR) and another group, such as an alkyl chain, which is symmetric.

Wait, but in the options, some are acids, others are substituted benzene rings.

Looking back at the IR, the 1720 cm-¹. If the compound is a benzoic acid, then the carbonyl is around 1700 cm-¹. But this is 1720, which is higher, so maybe it's an ester. Or maybe a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which is a strong indicator of an -OH group. If it's a carboxylic acid, that would fit. But then the carbonyl would be around 1700 in IR. Alternatively, it's a phenol derivative, but phenols don't have a carbonyl at 1720.

Wait, perhaps the compound is an acyl chloride? No, because the IR would show a much higher carbonyl (around 1800) and the NMR wouldn't have such a broad peak.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. The 1720 cm-¹ is a good match for an ester. But then the 10.5 ppm would have to be something else. Wait, but if it's an ester, why the broad peak at 10.5? Unless it's not an ester.

Wait, maybe the compound is a ketone and a phenol? But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the 1720 is a conjugated carbonyl, like an aromatic ketone. For example, acetophenone derivatives have carbonyls around 1680-1720 cm-¹. So maybe the compound is a para-substituted acetophenone with another substituent.

But then the NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5, which doesn't fit a ketone. So that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 ppm isn't an O-H. Could it be an aldehyde? Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but they're sharp. The broadness here suggests an O-H. So perhaps it's a carboxylic acid.

So, if the compound is a benzoic acid with a substituent in the para position, then the IR would have a strong O-H (carboxylic acid) around 2500-3300, which is the first IR region. The 1720 cm-¹ might be an error, or perhaps it's an ester group elsewhere.

Wait, but the question says that when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what's the product. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction, like an elimination.

Wait, another thought: When a nitrile is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes hydrolysis to form an amine. No, wait, I think it's more likely to hydrolyze a nitrile to an amine, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Alternatively, if compound X contains a carbonyl group, like a ketone, perhaps the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would lead to some kind of substitution or addition.

Wait, another possibility: If the compound is a benzaldehyde with a substituent, but I don't think that fits the data. Let me think again.

Let me try to identify the structure of compound X. Let's go back to the NMR.

The aromatic protons are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So, the ring must have two substituents, each in the para position, leading to two sets of equivalent protons. So, the substituents are in the 1 and 3 positions? No, wait, para is 1 and 4. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so para substituents are opposite each other. So, substituents at positions 1 and 4, for example.

So, the substituents are at the para positions, each having two equivalent protons. So, for example, if substituent A is at position 1 and substituent B is at position 4, then the aromatic protons would be in two groups: those ortho to substituent A, and those ortho to substituent B.

Wait, but if both substituents are in the para positions, perhaps the ring is 1,4-disubstituted. So, substituent A is at position 1, substituent B is at position 4.

If substituent A is a carbonyl group (like COOH or COR), and substituent B is an alkyl group, the aromatic protons would split into two doublets.

Looking at the NMR, the aromatic signals are at 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). The higher shift (8.0) is probably the protons next to the electron-withdrawing group (like a carbonyl), which would deshield the protons, making them appear downfield. So substituent A is at position 1, which is a carbonyl group, and substituent B is at position 4, which is an alkyl group.

So, substituent B is an alkyl group at para to a carbonyl group.

Looking at the other NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): likely a CH group adjacent to the carbonyl.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): maybe a CH2 adjacent to the CH.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to the CH.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal methyl group.

So, putting this together, substituent B is an isobutyl group. Let's think: the structure would be:

Ph–CO–CH(CH2CH2CH3) ?

Wait, but the substituent B is at position 4, and substituent A is at position 1. So, substituent B is an isobutyl group, perhaps.

Wait, let's think about the substituent B's structure. The NMR indicates a CH group, then a CH2, then a CH(CH3), and finally a CH2CH3.

Wait, another way: The substituent is a butyl group with branching. Let's see:

The substituent is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2- ?

Wait, perhaps it's an isobutyl group. The isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, the isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent B is a propyl group with a branching. Let me try to map the NMR.

The substituent would be something like:

CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3.

Wait, but that's a pentyl group. Hmm, alternatively, maybe it's a 3-pentyl group, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, substituent B is a sec-butyl group. Sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)2.

Wait, let me think about the NMR shifts. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is probably a CH that's adjacent to the ring. Then, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be a CH2 group next to that. The 1.4 (d,3H) would be a methyl group attached to a CH, and 0.9 (t,3H) is a terminal CH3.

So, the chain would be: CH(CH2CH2CH3)–CH2–CO–Ph.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl chain attached to the ring.

Wait, another approach: Let's imagine the substituent is a propyl group with a branching. For example, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But that would be a pentyl group, which doesn't fit the NMR data.

Alternatively, substituent B is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps substituent B is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group.

Wait, maybe I should look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, this would mean the substituent is a sec-butyl group at para position, and the ring has a benzoic acid group.

Benzoic acid has a COOH group. So, the IR would have a strong O-H stretch, which aligns with the first IR region. The 1720 cm-¹ could be the carbonyl of the COOH, but typically, carboxylic acids have lower carbonyls, around 1700.

Wait, maybe the 1720 is due to another carbonyl, like an ester or a ketone. But if the substituent is a sec-butyl, then there's no other carbonyl, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, let me think about the NMR again. If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, the structure would be:

Ph-COOH at position 1, and the substituent at position 4 is a sec-butyl group.

The substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-. Wait, no, that's more like an isobutyl group.

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. So, the substituent is at position 4, attached to the ring. The rest of the substituent would be CH(CH3)2 attached to the ring.

Wait, but then the NMR would show a CH2 at 2.9 ppm, but that doesn't fit. Let me think.

Alternatively, if substituent B is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, then the NMR would have a CH at 2.9, a CH2 at 1.7, a CH(CH3) at 1.4, and the terminal CH3 at 0.9. So perhaps substituent B is a propyl group with a branching.

Wait, putting it all together, the substituent B is a isobutyl group. Let's see: isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2. But that would mean the CH2 is attached to the benzene, then a CH(CH3)2.

But in NMR, the isobutyl group would have a triplet for the CH2 adjacent to the benzene, a septet for the CH(CH3)2, but that's not matching the data.

Wait, another thought: perhaps substituent B is a butyl group with a -CH(CH2CH3)2 structure. No, that might not fit.

Alternatively, substituent B is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. No, that's a propyl substitution.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck on the substituent structure. Let's think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the structure is a benzene ring with a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

What would the NMR of this structure look like?

The aromatic protons would be in two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which matches the data.

The substituent (sec-butyl) would be at position 4. The sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. So the substituent is attached to the benzene as -CH2-CH(CH3)2.

Wait, no, the substituent would be directly attached as -CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Wait, no, the sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. So, it's CH2-CH(CH3)2 attached to the benzene ring.

But in that case, the NMR would show the CH2 group as a triplet (since it's next to a -CH(CH3)2 group), but I don't see that in the NMR data. The given data for 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H), which suggests a CH group adjacent to something else.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent B is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. But then the structure would be Ph-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-COOH. Hmm, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe I should consider the substituent as a propyl group. Let's think: the substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But looking at the NMR, that would have a triplet for the first CH2, a quartet for the next, etc., but the given data shows a multiplet for 1H at 2.9 ppm, which doesn't fit a simple propyl group.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, making the structure Ph-COOH and Ph-CH(CH2CH2CH3) in the para positions. But then, the NMR would show a CH at 2.9, which would make sense.

Wait, putting this together, the substituent B is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So, substituent B would be attached to the benzene as CH(CH2CH2CH3). Then, the substituent would have a CH group (2.9 ppm, m), which is connected to a CH2CH2CH3 group. The CH2 groups would be at 1.7 ppm (m), and the terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t).

Wait, but in that case, the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group at position 4, making the structure 4-(propylmethyl)benzoic acid? Or maybe it's 4-(propyl)phenyl propanoic acid. I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent B is a propyl group, but it's attached in a way that the CH is adjacent to the ring. Wait, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group.

But I'm not making much progress here. Let's try to think about the reaction part.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that HI is a strong acid and a good nucleophile. Red phosphorus is often used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. For example, a nitrile (R–C≡N) reacts with HI and red phosphorus to form an amine (R–CH2–NH2) or maybe an imidamide.

Wait, but if compound X has a nitrile group, then the product would be an amine. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, like converting a halogen to something else.

Wait, another possibility: If compound X has an ester group (R-O-CO-R'), then red phosphorus and HI might perform some kind of nucleophilic substitution. But I'm not sure about that.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the IR again. The IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-¹, which suggests a carbonyl group. If X is a nitrile, the carbonyl would be at a higher wavenumber, maybe around 2200 cm-¹. So that's not matching. Alternatively, if X is an ester, the carbonyl is around 1720.

If X is an ester, then reacting with HI and red phosphorus might lead to hydrolysis. Esters can hydrolyze under acidic conditions to form carboxylic acids and alcohols. But with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps compound X is a benzoyl chloride. But then the IR would show a higher carbonyl peak (around 1800 cm-¹), which isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a methyl benzoate. The IR would have the ester carbonyl around 1720 cm-¹. Then, when X reacts with HI and red phosphorus, it would hydrolyze to benzoic acid.

But looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So if X is the ester, and the reaction converts it to the carboxylic acid, then the product would be option C.

Wait, but the initial IR of X is 3400–2500 cm-¹, which includes a strong O-H. If X is an ester, it doesn't have an O-H group. So that's conflicting.

Hmm, perhaps X is a benzoic acid with a substituent. Then, when treated with HI and red phosphorus, what would happen? Maybe nothing, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another reaction: If X is an acyl chloride, but that would have a higher carbonyl peak. Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde derivative, but I don't think that fits the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile, and the reaction converts it to an amine. But earlier analysis suggested that the IR doesn't fit a nitrile.

Wait, back to the NMR. The 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet with 1H. If it's an -OH proton, and the IR has a strong O-H stretch, then X is a carboxylic acid. So, the structure is a benzoic acid with substituents.

So, X is a para-substituted benzoic acid, with a substituent that includes a branching alkyl group. Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, that would fit.

So, the structure would be:

Benzoic acid (PhCOOH) with a sec-butyl group at the para position.

So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group (-CH2CH(CH3)2) attached to the benzene ring opposite the COOH group.

Wait, but wait. The substituent B in this case would be a sec-butyl group. So, the NMR of the substituent would have:

- The CH2 adjacent to the ring (position 2 in the substituent) would show as a triplet (if next to a CH(CH3)2 group), but in the data, it's a multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H), which suggests a CH group, not a CH2.

Hmm, perhaps that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the substituent.

Wait, let's think about the NMR of a sec-butyl group. The structure is CH2CH(CH3)2.

The CH2 group attached to the ring would be next to a CH(CH3)2 group.

So, the CH2 would be split into a triplet because it's next to a CH(CH3)2 group. The CH(CH3)2 would be a septet because it's adjacent to the CH2.

Wait, but in the NMR data, we have 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is a multiplet integrating to 1H. That suggests a single CH group, not a CH2.

So, maybe the substituent isn't a sec-butyl. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a propyl group with a branching. Let's imagine the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Then, the structure would be:

Ph–COOH at position 1, and substituent B is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group at position 4.

In this case, the CH would be at 2.9 ppm (m,1H), the adjacent CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm (m,2H), the next CH2 at 1.4 (d,3H)? Wait, that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent B is a -(CH2)3CH3 group. But that would be a straight propyl group, which wouldn't match the NMR data.

Wait, another possibility: The substituent could be a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2 group. Then, the structure would be Ph–COOH, and the substituent is -(CH(CH2CH3)CH2).

But in that case, the substituent would have a CH group next to the ring, which would be the 2.9 ppm peak. Then, the adjacent CH2 (from CH2CH3) would be at 1.7 ppm, and the CH2CH3 group would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm.

Wait, that seems to fit. Let me map it:

- The substituent is -(CH(CH2CH3)CH2).

But wait, that would make the substituent a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group. But that doesn't make sense as a substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Let's imagine the structure of this compound.

Benzoic acid has the structure Ph–COOH. The substituent is a sec-butyl group at the para position. The sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. Wait, no. The structure of sec-butyl is actually CH(CH2CH3)2. So, the substituent is attached directly to the benzene as CH(CH2CH3)2.

Wait, no, that's not right. The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH(CH2CH3)CH2–. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms.

Wait, butyl groups can be primary (straight chain), secondary (two carbons attached to the branching), or tertiary (three carbons attached). So, a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)–.

Wait, no, the correct structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)– attached to the main chain. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? No, that doesn't make sense. Let me clarify.

The structure of butyl groups:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH2– (straight chain)
- iso-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)– (branched)
- sec-butyl: CH(CH2CH3)2– (two CH2CH3 groups attached to a central CH)

Wait, no. Actually, the correct structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2–. No, I'm getting confused. Let me look it up mentally.

Butyl groups:

1. n-butyl: -CH2CH2CH2CH3
2. iso-butyl: -CH2CH(CH3)2
3. sec-butyl: -CH(CH2CH3)CH2-
Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Actually, the correct IUPAC name for iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2, while sec-butyl would be CH(CH2CH2CH3)–? No, I think I'm getting it wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent in option C is a iso-butyl group. Because, in the NMR, we have a CH at 2.9 ppm, a CH2 at 1.7, and methyl groups. So the substituent would be iso-butyl, which is CH2CH(CH3)2.

In that case, the substituent would be attached to the benzene as -CH2CH(CH3)2. So, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 group (attached to the ring) as a triplet around 1.4 ppm, but in the data, 1.4 is a doublet for 3H, which suggests a methyl group attached to a CH.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let me think: the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

But that's a pentyl group, which is probably not the case.

Alternatively, substituent B is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So, the substituent is a single CH group attached to the benzene, which itself is attached to a propyl group (CH2CH2CH3).

The NMR would then show:

- The CH group (attached to the benzene) at ~2.9 ppm (m,1H)
- The adjacent CH2 group at 1.7 ppm (m,2H)
- Another CH2 group at 1.4 ppm (d,3H) – but wait, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, the CH2CH2CH3 group would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H).

Hmm, this seems to fit the given data.

So, substituent B is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group.

So, the structure is:

Ph–COOH (at position 1) and substituent B is -(CH(CH2CH2CH3)) at position 4.

Thus, the full structure is 4-(3-methylbutan-1-yl)benzoic acid? Wait, not sure.

But looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2, then the structure would be Ph–COOH with a -(CH2)CH(CH3)2 group attached at the para position.

But then, the NMR would show the CH2 group (attached to the ring) as a triplet, but in the data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H, which suggests a CH group, not a CH2.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a iso-butyl group. So, attached as -(CH2)CH(CH3)2.

In that case, the CH2 group (attached to the ring) would be a triplet, but the data shows 2.9 ppm as a multiplet for 1H, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH(CH2CH3)) group. Then, the structure would be Ph–COOH with a -(CH(CH2CH3)) substituent at para.

In that case, the substituent is -(CH(CH2CH3)), which is a propyl group with a branching. The CH group would be at 2.9 ppm (m,1H), the adjacent CH2 would be at 1.7 (m,2H), and the terminal CH3 would be at 0.9 (t,3H). But where is the 1.4 ppm (d,3H)? That would suggest a methyl group attached to a CH. So perhaps there's another methyl group attached.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) suggests a CH(CH3) group. So, perhaps the substituent is -(CH(CH3)CH2CH3).

Wait, but then the substituent is a iso-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2.

Wait, maybe I've been overcomplicating this. Let's try to match the options with the data.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Structure: Benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at para.

The substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. So, the substituent would have:

- A CH2 group attached to the ring.
- A CH(CH3)2 group attached to the CH2.

In NMR, the CH2 would be a triplet (coupled with the CH(CH3)2), which would appear around 1.4 ppm (maybe). The CH(CH3)2 group would split into a septet, but that's not matching the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a iso-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. The CH2 would be a triplet, but in the data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the reaction part again.

When X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens? If X is an ester, the reaction might hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid. But if X is a nitrile, it might convert to an amine. Alternatively, if X is a benzal chloride, it could be hydrolyzed.

Wait, another angle: Perhaps X is a nitrile, and the reaction produces an amine. Let's see. Nitriles (R–C≡N) with HI and red phosphorus typically undergo hydrolysis to form amines. The reaction is usually R–C≡N → R–CH2–NH2.

So, if X is a nitrile, the product would be an amine. Let's see which options are amines. Looking at the options:

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative, not an amine.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Also a toluene derivative.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That's a carboxylic acid.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Another carboxylic acid.

So, none of the options are amines, which suggests that X is not a nitrile. So, that approach might not be correct.

Hmm, perhaps X is an ester. Then, reacting with HI and red phosphorus might cause some kind of substitution. Wait, but I'm not sure about that reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Fries rearrangement, but that usually involves esters under certain conditions, leading to ketones. But I'm not sure if that applies here.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. If X is an ester (R-O-CO-R'), then treatment with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze it to R-COOH and R'-OH.

But looking at the options, option C is a benzoic acid. So, if X is the ester, then the product would be the acid, which is option C.

But wait, if X is the ester, then its IR would show a carbonyl around 1720 cm-¹, which fits. The O-H in the IR would be from another part, perhaps an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, if X is the ester, it wouldn't have an O-H group. So that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a ketone. Then, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus could lead to some kind of substitution or addition.

Wait, but I'm not finding a clear path. Let's try to approach this differently.

Based on the NMR data, the aromatic protons are two doublets, so the substituents are para and the same. So, the substituents are two identical groups in para positions. Wait, but the substituents are a carbonyl group (from IR) and an alkyl group. So, they're different, but in para positions.

Wait, but the aromatic region in NMR shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests that the ring has two substituents which are identical. Otherwise, the pattern would be different. So, perhaps the substituents are the same group in the para positions.

Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl and an O-H. If the substituents are both carbonyl groups, that might not fit the NMR data. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are both -COOH groups. But that would make the aromatic protons more deshielded, but the NMR data shows two doublets.

Hmm, perhaps the substituents are both -COOH groups at the para positions, but that would lead to a different NMR pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are both alkyl groups, but that contradicts the IR data showing a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and another group, but considering the NMR data, the substituents are different. So, perhaps the substituent in para is a carbonyl group (COOH) and an alkyl group, making the two substituents different, but in para positions.

Wait, that would fit the NMR data, as the two substituents are in para and would lead to two sets of equivalent aromatic protons.

So, if X is a benzoic acid with an alkyl substituent in the para position, then the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would need to be considered.

But what reaction would that be? If X is a benzoic acid, then the reaction with HI and red phosphorus might not do much, unless there's another functional group.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a methyl benzoate ester. Then, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze it to benzoic acid.

But if X is the ester, then the IR would have a carbonyl at 1720 cm-¹, which matches. The O-H in IR would be from the reaction, but X itself would not have O-H. So, maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzamide. But then, the IR would have a strong N-H stretch, which isn't mentioned.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a cinnamic acid derivative. But that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, another angle: Let's consider the reaction of X with red phosphorus and HI leading to a specific product. If the product is an acid (option C), then perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to the acid.

So, X is an ester, and the product is the carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, if X is the ester, then X would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate ester.

But then, the NMR would show the ester oxygen, which would cause the adjacent CH2 to split into a quartet, but in the data, the substituent's NMR doesn't show that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent in X is a sec-butyl group, and X is a benzoic acid. But then, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus doesn't change it, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps I should try to make an educated guess.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The substituent is a sec-butyl group at para. So, the structure would be Ph–COOH with a sec-butyl substituent.

The IR would show O-H (carboxylic acid) and a carbonyl. The NMR would have the aromatic protons as two doublets, which fits.

The substituent's NMR: The sec-butyl group would have a CH2 group attached to the ring, then a CH(CH3)2 group. The CH2 would be a triplet (coupled with the CH(CH3)2), but in the given data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H, which suggests a CH group, not CH2.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a isobutyl group, which would have a CH2 adjacent to the ring, then a CH(CH3)2. The CH2 would be a triplet, but the data for 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a isopropyl group. Then, the structure would be Ph–COOH and a isopropyl group in para. The NMR would have the isopropyl group's CH at around 1.4 ppm (as a septet?), but I don't see that in the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group. But the data doesn't fit that either.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H). That's likely a CH group adjacent to an electronegative group, like the carbonyl. So, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2) group attached to the ring, which is connected to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps X is a phenylpropanoic acid derivative. For example, 4-ethylphenylpropanoic acid. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a cinnamic acid derivative, but that's not matching.

Hmm. I think I'm going around in circles here. Based on the IR and NMR data, the compound X is likely a benzoic acid with a substituent in the para position. The substituent's structure corresponds to a branching alkyl group.

Given the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what product forms? If X is an ester, it would hydrolyze to the acid. But if X is already a carboxylic acid, perhaps the reaction is something else.

Wait, another reaction: The presence of red phosphorus and HI could lead to the formation of an acid anhydride or perhaps a substitution reaction if there's a leaving group. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration of the benzoic acid's substituent group, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a nitrile group, and the reaction converts it to an amine. But again, the options don't show any amines.

Wait, perhaps X is a methyl ester of the benzoic acid. Then, the reaction would hydrolyze it to the carboxylic acid, which is option C.

So, the reaction is hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. Hence, the product is option C.

Another thought: If X is a nitrile, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would form an amine. But none of the options are amines.

Alternatively, if X is a benzyl chloride, the reaction with HI might lead to substitution. But again, the options don't fit.

I think I've circled enough. Based on the spectroscopic data, the structure is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a substituent that includes a branching alkyl group. The reaction likely hydrolyzes an ester group to a carboxylic acid, making the product option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.


The problem involves identifying the final product when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The spectroscopic data provided includes IR and $^1$H NMR, which help determine the structure of X and the nature of the reaction.

### Analysis of IR Data:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Suggests a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid or ester.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching, indicating a substituted benzene ring.

### Analysis of $^1$H NMR Data:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of an O-H proton in a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet for 1H, likely a CH group adjacent to the carbonyl.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet for 2H, likely a CH₂ group.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet for 3H, likely a methyl group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet for 3H, likely a terminal methyl group.

### Structure of Compound X:
The IR and NMR data indicate that X is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para position. The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, where the benzoic acid group is at position 1, and the sec-butyl group is at position 4.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. However, since X is already a carboxylic acid, the reaction does not alter the functional group. Therefore, the product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid)**: Incorrect, as the substituent and positions do not match the NMR data.
- **Option B (1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene)**: Incorrect, as it is not a carboxylic acid and does not match the IR data.
- **Option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid)**: Correct, as it matches the IR, NMR, and reaction conditions.
- **Option D (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene)**: Incorrect, as it is not a carboxylic acid and does not match the IR data.

### Conclusion:
The final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
