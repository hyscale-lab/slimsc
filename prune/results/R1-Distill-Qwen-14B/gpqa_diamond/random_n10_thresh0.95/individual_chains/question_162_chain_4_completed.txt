Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like a two-dimensional metric because it's got dx² and dy² terms. So this is probably a 2D spacetime, maybe a surface in some higher-dimensional space.

Wait, the question mentions a pseudosphere. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. But wait, I'm also remembering that in relativity, a pseudosphere is a type of solution to Einstein's equations, often with negative mass or something. Oh, but wait, I might be mixing that up with the Schwarzschild solution, which is a sphere with positive curvature.

So the metric given here must be a 2D spacetime, perhaps representing a pseudosphere. But how do I find its area?

Wait, in 2D, the line element is usually written as ds² = g_{xx} dx² + 2g_{xy} dx dy + g_{yy} dy². Here, g_{xx} and g_{yy} are the same because the coefficient is the same for both dx² and dy². So the metric is diagonal with g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32/(4 - x² - y²).

The area of a surface in 2D is calculated using the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times dx dy. The determinant for a diagonal metric is (g_{xx} * g_{yy}) - (g_{xy})². Since g_{xy} is zero here, it's just g_{xx} times g_{yy}.

Wait, but in 2D, the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric. Since it's diagonal, the determinant is g_{xx} * g_{yy} - 0 = (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2. So the area element dA is sqrt(g) dx dy = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) * dx dy.

Wait, no, wait. The area element in 2D is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. The determinant of a 2x2 metric tensor is g_{11}g_{22} - g_{12}g_{21}. Since our g_{12} and g_{21} are zero, determinant is (g_{11})². So sqrt(det(g)) is g_{11}, which is 32/(4 - x² - y^2). So dA = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

But to find the total area, I need to integrate this over the entire x and y. So the area A is the double integral over all x and y of (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

Wait, but what's the domain of x and y? The denominator is 4 - x² - y², which implies that 4 - (x² + y²) must be positive to avoid singularities, because the metric would otherwise become imaginary. So x² + y² < 4. So the domain is a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. So the integration is over the region where x² + y² < 4.

So A = ∫∫ [32/(4 - r²)] (r dr dθ), where I converted to polar coordinates. Because in polar coordinates, dx dy becomes r dr dθ. So substituting, the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

I can separate the integrals since the integrand doesn't depend on θ. So A = (32) * ∫0^2π dθ * ∫0^2 (r)/(4 - r²) dr.

Compute the θ integral first: ∫0^2π dθ = 2π.

So A = 32 * 2π * ∫0^2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Wait, let's compute that integral. Let u = 4 - r², then du = -2r dr → -(du/2) = r dr.

When r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes:

∫ from u=4 to u=0 of [ (r dr) / u ] → ∫ (from 4 to 0) (1/u) (-du/2) )

Which is (-1/2) ∫ from 4 to 0 (1/u) du.

But changing the limits to from 0 to 4, we get (-1/2) [ ∫4^0 → so that's (1/2) ∫0^4 (1/u) du ].

Wait, let me clarify. Let me substitute u = 4 - r².

When r=0 → u=4; r=2 → u=0.

So the integral ∫0^2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr becomes ∫4^0 [ (1/u) * (-du/2) ) ]

Which is the same as (1/2) ∫0^4 (1/u) du.

So ∫0^4 (1/u) du is ln(u) evaluated from 0 to 4. But wait, ln(0) is negative infinity. So the integral would be ln(4) - ln(0) → which is ln(4) + ∞ = ∞.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the integrand r/(4 - r²) as r approaches 2 from below becomes (2)/(4-4)=infinite. So the integral has a divergence at r=2.

Wait, but the area is the integral of dA, which is (32/(4-r²)) r dr dθ. So the integral ∫0^2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr is (1/2) ln(4 - r²) evaluated from 0 to 2. Wait, let's compute that.

Wait, let me compute ∫ r/(4 - r²) dr.

Let me make substitution u=4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

∫ r/(4 - r²) dr = ∫ (-1/2) du/u → (-1/2) ln|u| + C = (-1/2) ln(4 - r²) + C.

So evaluating from 0 to 2:

At r=2, 4 - r² = 0 → ln(0) is -infty. So [ (-1/2)*(-infty) ) ] → (1/2)*infty.

At r=0, it's (-1/2) ln(4) → finite.

So the integral from 0 to 2 is (1/2)*infty - (-1/2 ln(4)) → which is infinity.

So A = 32 * 2π * ( ∞ ) → which is infinity.

So the area is infinite. But wait, that doesn't make much sense. How can the pseudosphere have infinite area?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. The metric given is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, in 2D, the area is finite only if the integral converges.

But from the integral, it's going to infinity as r approaches 2. So the area is infinite.

But looking at the options, option D is +infty. So the answer would be D.

But wait, another thought: perhaps I'm integrating over the entire 2D space where x² + y² <4, but maybe this is a hyperbolic plane or something. Wait, the pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature, and the hyperbolic plane has infinite area.

So in this case, the area is infinite. So the answer is D) +infty.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D spacetime. To find the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\), we compute the area element \(dA\) using the determinant of the metric tensor. For a diagonal metric, the area element is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The total area \(A\) is obtained by integrating \(dA\) over the domain where the metric is defined. The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0\) implies that the domain is the region \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), i.e., a circle of radius 2 in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. Converting to polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), where \(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\) and \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\), the integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The \(\theta\)-integral is straightforward:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

The remaining radial integral is:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate this, use the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), so \(du = -2r \, dr\), or \(-\frac{1}{2} du = r \, dr\). Changing the limits accordingly (\(r = 0 \to u = 4\), \(r = 2 \to u = 0\)), the integral becomes:

\[
-\frac{32}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \(\int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u|\), so:

\[
16 \left[\ln(u)\right]_0^4 = 16 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(0)\right).
\]

Since \(\ln(0) = -\infty\), the integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the total area is:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \cdot \infty = +\infty.
\]

This result is consistent with the fact that a pseudosphere with constant negative curvature corresponds to a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area.
