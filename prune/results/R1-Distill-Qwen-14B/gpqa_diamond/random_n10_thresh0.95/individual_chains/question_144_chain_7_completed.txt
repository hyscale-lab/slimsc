--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the mean decay distance of a meson resonance called X. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

Alright, the given values are: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. Wait, the units are a bit mixed here. Oh yeah, GeV and MeV. I should probably convert everything to the same unit to avoid confusion.

First, I remember that the mean decay distance of a particle is related to its lifetime and velocity. The formula I think is something like mean distance L = v * τ, where τ is the mean lifetime. But how do I find τ?

Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. For a resonance, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy ΔE, so Γ * τ ≈ ħ. That means τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I should make sure about the exact relation here. I think the formula is τ = ħ / Γ, because Γ is the total decay width, which is the inverse of the lifetime. So yeah, τ = ħ / Γ.

Next, I need to find the velocity v of the meson. How is that calculated? I remember relativistic mechanics. The energy E of the particle is related to its mass and momentum. The formula should be E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. Hmm, but wait, I need to express v in terms of E and m.

Alternatively, maybe using beta (β) and gamma (γ) factors would help. Because β = v/c, and gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). So, I can find gamma first.

Wait, the production energy E is the total energy of the meson. So, E = gamma * m c². So, gamma = E / (m c²). Let me compute that.

But wait, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. But I should be careful with units. Since E and m are in GeV, and c is in m/s, but when using units where c=1, like in particle physics, sometimes the calculations are simplified. Wait, no, I think I should proceed without assuming c=1, but convert everything properly.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute gamma as E/(m c²). So let's compute that. But wait, the mass is in GeV/c². Hmm, maybe I should express everything in appropriate units.

Wait, let me think in terms of natural units where c=1, but when calculating distances and times, I need to convert back.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma correctly. So, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So, E = gamma * m c². So, gamma = E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV/c² * c²) )= 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. Oh wait, but in units where c=1, this would just be 8/1.2. So gamma is about 6.6667.

Then, beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Let me compute that. 1/gamma squared is (1.2/8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887, which means v ≈ 0.9887 c. So, v = beta c ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

But wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the calculation of beta. Let me compute 1/gamma^2 accurately.

Gamma is 8/1.2 = 20/3 ≈ 6.6666667. So gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.4444. So 1/gamma squared is 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ let's compute that.

Well, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. Let me check: 0.9887 squared is about 0.9775, yes. So beta is about 0.9887, so v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, I have v. Now, I need to find the lifetime tau. Tau is ħ / Γ. But the units for Γ are 320 MeV. I need to convert that into energy units compatible with ħ. 

Wait, ħ has units of J·s. Let me get all the units right. 

Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But energy here is in MeV. So I need to convert Γ from MeV to J. 

1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J. So 320 MeV is 320e6 eV, so 320e6 * 1.60218e-19 J = 320e6 * 1.60218e-19 = let's calculate that.

320e6 is 3.2e8. 3.2e8 * 1.60218e-19 = (3.2 * 1.60218) × 1e-11. 3.2 * 1.60218 is approximately 5.127. So 5.127e-11 J. 

So Γ is approximately 5.127e-11 J.

Tau is ħ / Γ. So tau = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (5.127e-11 J) = (1.0545718e-34) / (5.127e-11) s.

Calculating that: 1.0545718e-34 /5.127e-11 = approximately (1.0545718 /5.127) * 1e-23 ≈ 0.2056 * 1e-23 = 2.056e-24 seconds.

Wait, but wait a second, I think I messed up the exponents. Let's do it more carefully.

1.0545718e-34 divided by 5.127e-11 is (1.0545e-34) / (5.127e-11) ) = (1.0545 /5.127) ) * 1e-23. Because 1e-34 /1e-11 = 1e-23. 

1.0545 / 5.127 is approximately 0.2056, so 0.2056e-23 = 2.056e-24 seconds.

So tau is approximately 2.056e-24 seconds.

Now, the mean decay distance L is v * tau. So L = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s.

Multiply those together: 2.966e8 * 2.056e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056) * 1e-16.

Calculating 2.966 * 2.056. Let's see:

2 * 2.056 = 4.112,

0.966 * 2.056 ≈ approx 2. So total is around 6.112.

Wait, more accurately:

2.966 * 2.056 = ?

Let me compute 2 * 2.056 = 4.112

0.966 * 2.056:

Compute 0.9 * 2.056 = 1.8504

0.066 * 2.056 ≈ 0.1355

Adding up: 1.8504 + 0.1355 = 1.9859

Total is 4.112 + 1.9859 = 6.0979.

So approximately 6.098e-16 meters.

Wait, that's about 6.1e-16 meters. But none of the options are near 6e-16. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m

B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m

C) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m

D) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m

Hmm, none of them are 6e-16. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me go back and check each step.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units when calculating Gamma. Let me re-express everything in terms of natural units where c=1. Maybe that's a better approach.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for the decay length in terms of the particle's lifetime and velocity, but perhaps I can compute it using natural units and then convert.

Wait, let me think again. The decay length L is given by L = gamma * beta * c * tau. Because tau is the proper lifetime, and in the lab frame, it's gamma * tau. So L = v * gamma * tau, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, no, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime tau. So tau_lab = gamma * tau_proper. So L = v * tau_lab = v * gamma * tau_proper.

Wait, but tau_proper is given by tau = ħ / (Gamma c^2). Because Gamma is the total decay width. Hmm, perhaps I should express it that way.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for a formula that directly relates the decay length to the given parameters.

I think the formula for the mean decay length is L = (gamma * beta * c * tau), where tau is the proper mean lifetime.

But tau is ħ / Gamma. Because Gamma is the total width, which is the inverse of the lifetime in natural units. But I have to make sure about the units.

Wait, another approach: the decay length L can be found using the formula L = (E * c * tau) / m. Because E = gamma m c², so gamma = E/(m c²). Then, L = (gamma beta c tau).

Wait, but tau is the proper lifetime, so L = gamma beta c tau. So, L = (gamma beta) * c * (hbar / (Gamma)).

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula L = (E * c * hbar ) / ( m c^2 Gamma ) ) * beta.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the velocity beta as v/c, then compute gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use natural units where ħ = c = 1, so tau is in units of inverse energy.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try an alternative approach.

Wait, another formula I remember is that the decay length is given by L = (c * tau) * beta gamma.

Wait, beta gamma is gamma * beta. So, L = c * tau * gamma beta.

So, let's compute each part.

Tau is ħ / Gamma. So, tau = ħ / Gamma. Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 320e6 eV. Let's convert that to GeV: 0.32 GeV.

Wait, but ħ has units of eV·s. Wait, no, ħ is in J·s. So, converting Gamma to J: 320 MeV = 320e6 eV. Each eV is 1.602e-19 J. So Gamma is 320e6 * 1.602e-19 J ≈ 5.126e-11 J.

Wait, but if I use ħ in eV·s, which is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s. So, then tau = ħ / Gamma = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (320e6 eV) ) = 6.582e-16 / 3.2e8 = (6.582 /3.2) * 1e-24 s ≈ 2.056e-24 s, which matches what I got earlier.

Now, beta gamma: beta is v/c, gamma is E/(m c²). So beta gamma = (v/c) * E/(m c²) = (v E) / (m c^3). Wait, perhaps another way: since E = gamma m c², and gamma = 1/sqrt(1-beta²), then beta gamma = (gamma beta) = (gamma) * (v/c) = (E/(m c²)) * (v/c) ) = (E v) / (m c^3).

But I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, I can compute beta gamma as (gamma * beta) = (E/(m c²)) * (v/c). But v is sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E^2)} ) * c ≈1 when E is much larger than m. So, perhaps beta gamma ≈ E/(m c²) * 1.

Wait, for E=8 GeV and m=1.2 GeV, E is about 6.6667 times m. So gamma is 6.6667. Then, beta is sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2 c^4)) )^0.5 = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64) )= sqrt(1 - 0.0225) )= sqrt(0.9775)= ~0.9887. So beta gamma is 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.593.

So, beta gamma ≈6.593.

Now, L = c * tau * beta gamma.

c is about 3e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056e-24 s.

So, L = 3e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s * 6.593.

Let's compute 3e8 * 2.056e-24 = 6.168e-16 m.

Then multiply by 6.593: 6.168e-16 *6.593 ≈ 4.077e-15 m.

Hmm, that's approximately 4.077e-15 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m and option C is 5.022e-15 m. Wait, so 4.077e-15 is close to option B.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me recount the steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing beta gamma. Let me compute it more accurately.

Gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666666667.

Beta is sqrt(1 -(1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2 ) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.98868.

So beta * gamma = 6.6666666667 * 0.98868 ≈ 6.6667 * 0.98868.

Multiplying: 6 * 0.98868=5.932, 0.6667 * 0.98868 ≈ 0.6591, so total ≈5.932 + 0.6591 ≈6.5911.

So, beta gamma is approximately 6.5911.

Then, L = c * tau * beta gamma.

c = 3e8 m/s.

tau = 2.056e-24 s.

So, 3e8 * 2.056e-24 = (3 * 2.056) * 1e-16 =6.168e-16 m.

Multiply by beta gamma: 6.5911 * 6.168e-16 m.

6.5911 *6.168 is let's compute: 6 *6=36, 6 *0.168=1.008, 0.5911*6=3.5466, 0.5911 *0.168≈0.099.

Wait, perhaps a better way: 6.5911 *6.168.

Let me compute 6 *6.168 =37.008.

0.5911 *6.168 ≈ 3.644. So total is 37.008 +3.644≈40.652.

Wait, no, wait, that's not right. Wait, I think I'm miscalculating.

Wait, no, 6.5911 *6.168. Let me compute this:

6.5911 * 6 = 39.5466.

6.5911 * 0.168 = let's compute 6.5911 *0.1=0.65911, 6.5911 *0.06=0.395466, 6.5911 *0.008=0.0527288. Adding those: 0.65911 +0.395466=1.054576 +0.0527288=1.1073048.

So total is 39.5466 +1.1073048≈40.6539 m? No, wait, that can't be right because L is 3e8 m/s * 2e-24 s *6.59... which is a small number.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me compute 6.5911 *6.168e-16.

Wait, 6.5911 *6.168 is approximately:

Let me compute 6.5911 *6 =39.5466.

6.5911 *0.168= approx 1.1073.

Adding gives 39.5466 +1.1073=40.6539.

So 6.5911 *6.168e-16 =40.6539e-16 m =4.06539e-15 m.

Ah, that's about 4.065e-15 meters, which matches option B:4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655 ×10^-15 m.

Option D is 4.0655 ×10^-16 m.

So, I'm getting approximately 4.065e-15 m, which is option B.

Wait, but I thought earlier I had 4e-15, which would match option B. So the correct answer should be option B.

But wait, I thought I had L=4.065e-15 m.

So the correct answer is B.


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau
\]

where \( v \) is the velocity of the particle and \( \tau \) is the mean lifetime. The mean lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the total decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau \)
The decay width \( \Gamma \) is given as \( 320 \, \text{MeV} \). Converting \( \Gamma \) to joules:

\[
\Gamma = 320 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV} = 5.127 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{J}
\]

The reduced Planck constant \( \hbar \) is \( 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). Thus:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{5.127 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 2.056 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( v \)
The velocity \( v \) is determined using relativistic mechanics. The total energy \( E \) and mass \( m \) of the meson are related by:

\[
E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2
\]

The relativistic factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{mc^2}
\]

Substituting \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

The velocity \( v \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}, \quad v = \beta c
\]

First, calculate \( \beta \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

Thus:

\[
v = 0.9887 \cdot c \approx 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance \( L \) is:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau
\]

Substituting \( v \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( \tau \approx 2.056 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056 \times 10^{-24}) \approx 6.12 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 4: Adjust for relativistic effects
The decay length in the lab frame is enhanced by the relativistic factor \( \gamma \beta \). Using \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \) and \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \):

\[
\gamma \beta = 6.6667 \cdot 0.9887 \approx 6.591
\]

Thus, the corrected decay length is:

\[
L = \gamma \beta \cdot c \cdot \tau = 6.591 \cdot 6.12 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m} \approx 4.065 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Match with options
The closest option to \( L \approx 4.065 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.

Answer: B
