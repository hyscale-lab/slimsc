Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question is asking for the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. Oh right, and the speed of light is c. The options are A to D, and I need to find which one is correct.

Wait, so I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, (1/2)kA² equals (1/2)mv²_max. Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But wait, this is a relativistic problem, so I can't just use the classical formula. Relativistic effects must come into play here.

In relativity, momentum isn't just mv anymore. The momentum p is gamma times mv, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But how does that affect the maximum speed?

Let me think about the energy. The total energy in relativity isn't just kinetic plus potential; it includes rest mass energy. But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and kinetic is (gamma-1)mc² plus the rest mass. Hmm, maybe I should consider the conservation of mechanical energy.

Wait, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. But I'm not sure about the exact form here. Alternatively, maybe the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic, but in a relativistic sense.

Wait, in the classical case, the maximum speed is when x is zero, so all potential is converted into kinetic. But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv², it's (gamma - 1)mc². Oh, right, because the total energy is gamma mc², so kinetic is (gamma -1) mc².

So, setting the potential energy at maximum amplitude (x = A) equal to the kinetic energy at x=0.

Potential energy is (1/2) k A². Kinetic energy at x=0 is (gamma -1) m c².

So,

(1/2) k A² = (gamma - 1) m c²

But wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). And at maximum speed, when the oscillator is at x=0, the kinetic energy is maximum, so yes, this should hold.

So substituting gamma,

(1/2) k A² = ( (1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) - 1 ) m c²

Let me rearrange this equation to solve for v.

First, divide both sides by m c²:

( k A² ) / (2 m c² ) = [ (1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) - 1 ] 

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a variable for simplicity, say, let’s call it a.

So, a = [ (1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) - 1 ]

Solve for 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²):

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = a + 1

Take reciprocal on both sides:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(a + 1)

Wait, no, wait. Let me square both sides first.

Wait, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = a + 1 → (1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2))^2 = (a+1)^2 → 1/(1 - v^2/c^2) = (a + 1)^2

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/[ (a + 1)^2 ]

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(a + 1)^2 ]

= [ (a + 1)^2 - 1 ] / (a + 1)^2 

Expand numerator: (a^2 + 2a + 1) -1 = a^2 + 2a

So,

v^2/c^2 = (a^2 + 2a) / (a +1)^2 

Factor numerator: a(a +2 )

Denominator: (a+1)^2

Hmm, let me substitute back a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v²/c² = [ ( (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 + 2 (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ] / ( ( (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) + 1 )^2 

Let me factor out (k A²)/(2 m c²) from numerator:

= [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) + 2 ] ] / [ ( (k A²/(2 m c^2) ) + 1 )^2 ]

Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I can simplify it differently.

Let me write the numerator as a(a + 2) and denominator as (a +1)^2.

So,

v²/c² = [ a (a + 2) ] / (a +1)^2 

= [ a (a + 2) ] / (a^2 + 2a + 1 )

Hmm, perhaps we can factor this expression.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express in terms of v.

Wait, let's think differently. Let me assume that at maximum speed, the kinetic energy is equal to the potential energy. So,

(1/2) k A² = (gamma -1) m c²

But wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

So,

(1/2) k A² = ( (1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c² )) - 1 ) m c²

Let me rearrange:

(1/2) k A² = ( (1 - sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ) m c²

Wait, perhaps that's complicating things. Alternatively, let me move terms around.

Let me denote beta = v/c, so beta is a number between 0 and 1.

So,

(1/2) k A² = ( (1/ sqrt(1 - beta²) ) -1 ) m c²

Let me divide both sides by m c²:

( k A² ) / (2 m c² ) = [ 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²) - 1 ]

Let me rearrange:

1 / sqrt(1 - beta²) = (k A²)/(2 m c² ) + 1

= [k A² + 2 m c² ] / (2 m c² )

Take reciprocal:

sqrt(1 - beta²) = (2 m c² )/(k A² + 2 m c² )

Square both sides:

1 - beta² = [4 m² c^4 ] / (k A² + 2 m c² )^2 

So,

beta² = 1 - [4 m² c^4 ] / (k A² + 2 m c² )^2 

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me compute the denominator:

(k A² + 2 m c² )^2 = (2m c² + k A² )^2 = [2 m c² (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]^2 

= (2 m c²)^2 (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) )^2 

So,

beta² = 1 - [4 m² c^4 ] / [4 m² c^4 (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 ]

Wait, wait, no. Wait, (k A² + 2 m c² ) is in the denominator. Wait, let me substitute:

(k A² + 2 m c² ) = 2 m c² ( 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )

So,

(k A² + 2 m c² )^2 = [2 m c² ( 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]^2 

= (2 m c² )^2 ( 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 

So, the denominator becomes (2 m c² )^2 ( 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 

So,

beta² = 1 - [4 m² c^4 ] / [ (2 m c² )^2 ( 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4 m² c^4 / [4 m² c^4 (1 + ... )^2 ] → 1/(1 + ... )^2 

So,

beta² = 1 - [1 ] / [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ]

Which becomes:

beta² = [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Compute numerator:

(1 + a)^2 - 1, where a = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

= 1 + 2a + a² - 1 = 2a + a² = a (2 + a )

So,

beta² = [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a )^2 

Substituting a back:

a = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

beta² = [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ] / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 

Factor numerator:

= [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ] / [ ( (2 m c²) + k A² )/(2 m c²) ) ]^2 

Wait, perhaps it's easier to factor out terms.

Wait, let me compute the numerator inside the fraction:

(2 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )) = 2 [ 1 + (k A²)/(4 m c^2 ) ] 

Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, let me compute the numerator and denominator as polynomials.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express beta in terms of a.

Wait, beta squared is [a (a +2 ) ] / (a +1 )^2 

Let me write a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

beta = sqrt( [ a (a + 2 ) ] ) / (a +1 )

But wait, I'm trying to get v_max in terms of c, so v_max = beta c.

Wait, perhaps there's another approach. Maybe using the conservation of energy.

In a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy plus kinetic energy plus potential. Hmm, but maybe the total energy is fixed, so at maximum displacement (x=A), the kinetic energy is minimal (zero?), and the potential is maximum. At the equilibrium point x=0, the kinetic is maximum and potential is zero.

Wait, no. In a harmonic oscillator, when x is maximum (A), velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero. So all energy is potential. When x is zero, potential is zero, and kinetic is maximum.

So, the total energy E is the potential at x=A, which is (1/2) k A².

But wait, in relativity, the total energy would include the rest mass energy. No, wait, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)k x², but the kinetic energy is (gamma m c²) - m c².

Wait, so the total energy E = (1/2)k A² + m c².

Because when x=A, the potential is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic is zero, so E = (1/2)k A^2 + m c^2.

Then, when x=0, the potential is zero, and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c².

So,

gamma m c² = E = (1/2)k A^2 + m c²

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2 )/( 2 m c^2 )

Because,

gamma = [ (1/2)k A^2 + m c^2 ] / ( m c^2 ) 

= (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )/( 2 m c^2 )

= (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 )

= 1 + ( k A^2 )/( 2 m c^2 )

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

But gamma is also 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 )

So,

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Take reciprocal,

sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 / [ 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ) ]

Square both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1 / [ 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ) ]^2 

Rearranging,

v²/c² = 1 - [ 1 / ( 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ) )^2 ]

Hmm, so v_max squared is c² times that.

So,

v_max² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 ]

Take square roots,

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Let me compute the denominator in the fraction. Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c² ) as a.

So,

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 )

= c sqrt( [ (1 + a )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a )^2 )

Compute numerator:

(1 + a)^2 -1 = 1 + 2a + a² -1 = 2a + a² = a (2 + a )

So,

v_max = c sqrt( [ a (2 + a ) ] / (1 + a )^2 )

= c sqrt( a (a +2 ) ) / (1 + a )

But a is (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (k A²/(2 m c² )) * (k A²/(2 m c² ) + 2 ) ] ) / ( 1 + k A²/(2 m c² )) )

Hmm, maybe I can factor this expression differently.

Wait, let me look at the options.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Which matches what I have here.

Wait, let me see:

Looking at the options:

Option D says:

v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which is exactly what I derived. So option D is correct.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option B is sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - ... )). No, doesn't match.

Option A has sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - ... )^2 ), which doesn't match.

Option C is the classical expression, which would be correct only if we're not considering relativity.

So the correct answer must be option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we must account for relativistic effects. The total energy of the system includes the rest mass energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement \( x = A \). At \( x = A \), the potential energy is maximized, and the kinetic energy is zero. At \( x = 0 \), the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximized.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Total Energy**: The total energy \( E \) of the system is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy at \( x = A \):
   \[
   E = m c^2 + \frac{1}{2} k A^2
   \]

2. **Relating Total Energy to Kinetic Energy**: At \( x = 0 \), the potential energy is zero, and the total energy is purely kinetic. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by:
   \[
   E = \gamma m c^2 = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \right) m c^2
   \]
   Equating this to the total energy:
   \[
   \gamma m c^2 = m c^2 + \frac{1}{2} k A^2
   \]

3. **Simplifying for \( \gamma \)**:
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}
   \]

4. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v \)**:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
   \]
   Substituting \( \gamma \) from the previous step:
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v^2/c^2 \)**:
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}}
   \]
   Squaring both sides:
   \[
   1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2}
   \]
   Rearranging:
   \[
   v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2}
   \]

6. **Final Expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression does not match the derived result and introduces an unphysical term.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The denominator inside the square root is inconsistent with the derived result.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. This is the classical result and does not account for relativistic effects.
- **Option D**: Correct. This matches the derived relativistic expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \).

### Final Answer:
Answer: D
