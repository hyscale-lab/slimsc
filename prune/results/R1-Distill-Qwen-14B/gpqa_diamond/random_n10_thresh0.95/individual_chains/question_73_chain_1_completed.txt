Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question says: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Relative speed in relativity isn't just like subtracting the two velocities, right? Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't use the classical velocity addition formula. Oh right, I remember that the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. Let me recall the formula.

The formula for the relative velocity u' between two objects moving at velocities u and v relative to some frame is given by (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). So in this case, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. But wait, which one is the observer? So the relative speed would be the velocity of the second astronaut as seen from the first astronaut's frame, or vice versa. Oh wait, actually, no. Wait, in the problem, both are moving in the same direction, so the relative speed would be the difference between their speeds as observed in a different frame. But wait, the relative velocity formula is for when you have two frames moving relative to each other. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, both in the same direction (positive x), then from A's frame, what is B's speed?

Wait, no. Let me think again. So the way the formula works is that if one frame S' is moving at velocity u relative to frame S, then the velocity of an object in S' is (v - u)/(1 - vu/c²). Wait, no, I think it's (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²). So here, which frame is which? Let me define frame S as the rest frame of astronaut A (the one moving at 0.6c). Then, astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction as A's movement. So in frame S (A's frame), B's velocity would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, no. Wait, that's incorrect. Because actually, in the frame where A is moving, the speed of B would be calculated considering that in the original frame, both are moving. So the original frame is probably the Earth frame, where A is moving at 0.6c, and B at 0.5c. So to find the relative speed of B as seen from A's frame, which is moving at 0.6c relative to Earth, I need to apply the velocity addition formula.

Wait no, I think I got that wrong. The velocity addition formula is used when you have two frames moving relative to each other. So, to find the velocity of B as seen from A's frame, which is moving at 0.6c relative to Earth. So in Earth's frame, B's velocity is 0.5c, and A's frame is moving at 0.6c. So the formula is (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/c²), where v is B's velocity in Earth frame (0.5c), and u is the velocity of A's frame relative to Earth (0.6c).

Wait, but wait, velocities are the same direction, so the numerator is (0.5c - 0.6c) = -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.5c * 0.6c) / c². Let me compute that: (0.5 * 0.6) =0.3, and 0.3 c² / c² is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So relative velocity is (-0.1c) / 0.7 → approximately -0.142857c. The negative sign indicates direction, but the magnitude is 0.142857c. So about 0.14c. So that's the relative speed between them.

Wait, but wait, the question says "relative speed". So I think the answer would be 0.14c, but I need to check the options. Looking at the options, C and D both have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that's a start.

Now, the other part is the total energy of the system. So I need to calculate the total energy of both astronauts. Since they are moving at relativistic speeds, I can't just use classical kinetic energy; I need to use the relativistic energy formula.

The relativistic energy for each is given by E = gamma * m c². Where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options:

Option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c.

Option D says E=5 mc² and v_rel=0.14c.

So my calculations point to option C as the correct one.

Wait, wait, but let me double-check the relative speed calculation. Did I get the signs right? Because if you have two objects moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference in their speeds, but the direction matters. So in A's frame, B is moving slower than A, so B would appear to be moving at -0.14c, meaning 0.14c in the opposite direction. But the question asks for the relative speed, which is the magnitude, so 0.14c.

So yes, the relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy is about 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C matches both.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and the total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_B - v_A}{1 - \frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_A = 0.6c\) and \(v_B = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.142857c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the magnitude of the relative speed is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m c^2) = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m c^2) = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\).
- The total energy is \(E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2\).

These values match **Option C**, which states \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\) and \(E = 5.96m c^2\).
