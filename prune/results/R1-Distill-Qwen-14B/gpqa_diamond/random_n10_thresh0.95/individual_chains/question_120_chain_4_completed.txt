Okay, so I've got this question here about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me try to think it through. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I guess means that their density is the same throughout space. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A through D, each with different power laws involving 1/plx to some exponent.

Wait, parallax is related to distance, right? Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So a star with a parallax of 1 pc has a distance of 1 parsec, but wait, no, wait. Actually, the formula is distance d = 1 / plx, where plx is in arcseconds and d is in parsecs. So as parallax increases, the distance decreases.

So, thinking about it, when plx is small, the stars are very far away. If the distribution is uniform, the number of stars in a given volume depends on the volume. Because the number density is uniform, n, the number of stars in a volume V is n*V.

But wait, we're looking at how the number of stars per unit parallax range changes with plx. Let me model this.

Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So for a range of plx from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding distance range?

If plx increases, d decreases. So a change in plx, dplx, corresponds to a change in d. Let's compute that. Since d = 1/plx, the derivative dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. But since we're dealing with ranges, maybe the absolute values matter.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd. The volume of a spherical shell is 4π d² dd. But wait, no, that's for a radial distance. Alternatively, considering that the number of stars in a shell is the surface area times the thickness, but wait, let me get this right.

Wait, maybe I should express the number of stars in a given range of parallax. Let's say we have a parallax range from plx to plx + delta_plx. What's the corresponding distance range?

Since plx = 1/d, the distance corresponding to plx is d = 1/plx. The distance for plx + delta_plx is d + delta_d = 1/(plx + delta_plx). Hmm, but for small delta_plx, perhaps we can approximate delta_d ≈ - (delta_plx)/(plx²). Because d = 1/plx, so dd/dplx = -1/(plx²). So delta_d ≈ - (delta_plx)/(plx^2).

But the thickness of the shell in terms of distance is delta_d. The volume of the shell at distance d with thickness delta_d is approximately 4π d² delta_d. Since the number of stars in a given volume is n * volume, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume), the number of stars in this shell would be n * 4π d² delta_d.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit parallax range, which is delta_plx. So the number of stars per delta_plx would be n * 4π d² (delta_d) / delta_plx.

But delta_d is approximately -(delta_plx)/(plx^2), so substituting:

Number per delta_plx ≈ n *4π d² [ ( - delta_plx / plx² ) ] / delta_plx.

The delta_plx in numerator and denominator cancels, leaving:

n *4π d² ( - 1 / plx² )

But since d = 1/plx, d squared is (1/plx)^2 = 1/plx². So substitute that in:

n *4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) )

Which is n *4π / plx^4.

Wait, but the number per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit range of plx (i.e., per delta_plx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me double-check my reasoning. Let me think about the steps again.

1. Uniform distribution of stars implies number density n is constant.

2. Parallax plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx.

3. The number of stars in a thin shell between d and d + dd is 4π d² dd * n.

4. But we need the number as a function of plx, so express dd in terms of d_plx.

Since d = 1/plx, dd = - (d_plx) / (plx)^2.

So the number of stars for a change d_plx in parallax is:

Number = 4π (d^2) * (dd) * n = 4π ( (1/plx)^2 ) * ( -d_plx/(plx^2) ) * n.

But we are considering the number per unit delta_plx, so divide by delta_plx:

Number per delta_plx = [4π (1/plx²) * (-d_plx/(plx²)) *n ] / d_plx.

The d_plx (delta_plx) cancels, leaving:

4π n / plx^4.

So the number is proportional to 1/plx^4, which is option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that stars are uniformly distributed, meaning their number density \( n \) is constant. Parallax is inversely related to distance: \( \text{plx} = 1/d \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. 

For a thin shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \), the volume is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). The number of stars in this shell is proportional to the volume, \( n \cdot 4\pi d^2 dd \). To express this in terms of parallax, we use \( d = 1/\text{plx} \), so \( dd = -\frac{d(\text{plx})}{\text{plx}^2} \). Substituting \( d = 1/\text{plx} \), the number of stars becomes:

\[
\text{Number of stars} = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \left(-\frac{d(\text{plx})}{\text{plx}^2}\right).
\]

To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( d(\text{plx}) \)), we divide by \( d(\text{plx}) \):

\[
\text{Number per unit parallax} = \frac{n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \left(-\frac{d(\text{plx})}{\text{plx}^2}\right)}{d(\text{plx})} = \frac{n \cdot 4\pi}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( 1/\text{plx}^4 \). Among the given options, this corresponds to **Option A**.
