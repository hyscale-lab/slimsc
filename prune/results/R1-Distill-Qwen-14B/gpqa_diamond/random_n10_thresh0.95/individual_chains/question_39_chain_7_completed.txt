Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. So we've got 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Interesting. And when they measure the position of the particles, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So the particles are only between 1 and 3.

Wait, the wave function is given as a function of x, right? But wait, normally wave functions have both real and imaginary parts, but when you square the absolute value, you get the probability density. So the total probability must be 1, because all the probability is between 1 and 3, and zero outside. So I think we need to normalize the wave function.

The wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i. So I can write this as ψ(x) = A - Bi, where A is a/sqrt(1+x) and B is 0.5. 

The normalization condition is the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 equals 1. Because the wave function is zero outside that interval. 

So |ψ|² is (A)^2 + (B)^2. Because when you have a complex number a + ib, the square is a² + b².

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The wave function is a complex number, right? So ψ = a/sqrt(1+x) - (0.5)i. So the complex conjugate is a/sqrt(1+x) + (0.5)i. So when you multiply ψ by its conjugate, you get [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] because (a/sqrt(1+x))² is a²/(1+x), and (0.5i)(-0.5i) becomes 0.25 because i squared is -1.

Wait, wait, let me calculate (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i). That's equal to (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2, because (a - ib)(a + ib) = a² + b².

So yes, |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait no, wait. Because the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, which is ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) * (1) + 0*(-1) + 0*i? No, wait the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So ψ(x) can be written as Re(ψ) + Im(ψ) i, where Re(ψ) = a/sqrt(1+x), Im(ψ) = -0.5.

So when you compute |ψ|², it's Re(ψ)^2 + Im(ψ)^2. 

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1 + x) + ( (-0.5)^2 ) = a²/(1 + x) + 0.25.

Then the normalization condition is the integral of this from x=1 to x=3 equals 1.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral step by step. Let's split it into two parts:

Integral from 1 to 3 of a²/(1+x) dx + Integral from 1 to 3 of 0.25 dx = 1.

Compute each part.

First integral: a² * ∫ dx/(1+x) from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So first integral is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 * ∫ dx from 1 to 3. That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So putting it together: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Wait, so a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.693 ≈ 0.721.

So a² = 0.721, so a is sqrt(0.721) ≈ 0.849, which is about 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recheck the steps.

1. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So |ψ|² is (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25.

2. Integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ|² dx = 1.

3. So integral becomes a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1→3 plus 0.25 * (3-1) = 2*0.25=0.5.

4. The first integral is a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

5. So a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.721.

6. a ≈ sqrt(0.721) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Yes, that seems correct. So the answer is B) 0.85.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by normalizing the given wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \). The probability density is given by \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \). 

The normalization condition requires that the total probability over the interval \( x \in [1, 3] \) equals 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \):  
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating from \( x=1 \) to \( x=3 \), we get:
   \[
   a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx \):  
   This is straightforward:
   \[
   0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5.
   \]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:
\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):
\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \), we find:
\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.721.
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.721} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
