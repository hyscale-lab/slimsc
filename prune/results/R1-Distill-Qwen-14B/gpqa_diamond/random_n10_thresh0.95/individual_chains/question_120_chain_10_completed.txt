Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think through this step by step. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. The options are A through D, each being a different inverse power of parallax.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. The formula I recall is that distance (in parsecs) is 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds). So, plx = 1/d, or d = 1/plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what sense? I think it means that their spatial density is uniform in space. So, the number density of stars doesn't depend on where you are in the galaxy, but I might be wrong. Alternatively, it could mean that their distribution on the sky is uniform, but that's probably not the case. Wait, no, the question says uniformly distributed in the sky. Hmm, maybe that they are spread out evenly across the sky, but maybe their actual distance distribution isn't uniform. Wait, no, I think the point is that their density in space is uniform, so the number of stars increases with the volume of space you look into.

So, considering that, the number of stars in a given volume depends on the size of that volume. Let's think about how volume relates to distance. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So, as you go further away, the volume increases with the cube of the radius, which is the distance.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So, let me think about how the number of stars in a thin shell (a small range of distance) depends on the distance.

Suppose I'm looking at stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx. The distance range would be from d = 1/plx to d + dd = 1/(plx + dplx). Wait, but for small dplx, I can approximate dd as -d^2 * dplx (since d = 1/plx, so dd = -1/(plx^2) dplx). But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe it's easier to think in terms of distance and then convert parallax.

Alternatively, instead of considering parallax, let's think in terms of distance. The number of stars in a thin shell between distance d and d + dd would be proportional to the surface area of the shell times the thickness, and since the density is uniform, the number is proportional to 4πd² * dd.

Because the number of stars (N) in a thin shell is N = n * volume, where n is number density. But for a thin shell, volume ≈ surface area * thickness. So, N = n * 4πd² * dd.

So, for each distance d, the number of stars per unit distance (per dd) is proportional to d².

But the question is about the number per unit parallax. Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let's substitute d into the expression.

So, the number per unit parallax (dN/dplx) would be proportional to (1/plx)^2 * (dd/dplx). Because dN/dplx = dN/dd * dd/dplx.

Wait, let me clarify. We have N = n * 4π d² dd. So, the number per unit distance is proportional to d². But since we want the number per unit parallax, we need to express this in terms of plx.

Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx, and dd = - (1/plx²) dplx (because d =1/plx, so dd/dplx = -1/(plx^2)). But wait, when plx increases, d decreases. So, when you have a small change in plx, dN is proportional to d² * dd. Let's write this as:

dN = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/plx² ) dplx )

Wait, but the negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but since we're considering the magnitude, we can ignore the negative sign.

So, dN = n * 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx.

Which is dN proportional to (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, the number of stars per unit range of plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So that's the one.

Wait, but another way to think about it: the number of stars in a range of parallax between plx and plx + dplx is the number of stars in the spherical shell at distance d =1/plx, with thickness dd = -d^2 dplx (wait, let me compute that again). Let me rederive.

We have plx = 1/d. So, d =1/plx. The thickness in distance, dd, is the derivative of d with respect to plx: dd/dplx = -1/(plx^2). So, dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

The volume of the thin shell is 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - 1/plx^2 ) dplx )

= -4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Since we're dealing with absolute numbers, the negative sign just indicates direction (increasing plx corresponds to decreasing d), but the magnitude is 4π / plx^4 dplx.

Thus, the number of stars per unit plx range is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the answer should be option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely related to distance: \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). The question assumes stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning the number density of stars is constant. 

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the surface area of the shell (\( 4\pi d^2 \)) and the thickness (\( dd \)). Thus, the number of stars in this shell is:

\[
dN \propto 4\pi d^2 \, dd
\]

Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we find \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} \). Substituting these into the expression for \( dN \), we get:

\[
dN \propto 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) d\text{plx}
\]

Simplifying, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is:

\[
\frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**

Answer: A
