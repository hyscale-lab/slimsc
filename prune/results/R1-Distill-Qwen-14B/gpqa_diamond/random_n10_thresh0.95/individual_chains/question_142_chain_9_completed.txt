Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. So the question is asking about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubit space.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I need to figure out where this is located in the qubit space. I think the qubit space is represented in terms of Bloch vectors, right? The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states, where pure states are on the surface and mixed states are inside.

Wait, how do I convert a density matrix into a Bloch vector? Oh right, the density matrix for a single qubit can be expressed using the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. So if I can express the given ρ in that form, I can find r.

Let me write down the given ρ. It's (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I know that |0⟩⟨0| is a projector, and similarly for |1⟩⟨1|. Let me compute each term:

|0⟩⟨0| is a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the (0,0) position and 0s elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 in (1,1). So adding them and dividing by 2:

ρ = (1/2)[ [1, 0], [0, 1] ] because both |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1| add up to the identity matrix. Wait, so ρ is (1/2) * I, where I is the 2x2 identity matrix. So ρ = I/2.

Hmm, now let's relate this to the general form ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. Let's set them equal:

I/2 = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2.

Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

Subtract I from both sides: 0 = r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are:

σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the equation is 0 = r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

Is the only solution r_x=0, r_y=0, r_z=0? Because if I add any of these matrices with non-zero coefficients, I can't get zero unless all coefficients are zero.

So r must be (0,0,0). 

Wait, but wait. The rho is (I)/2. What does that state represent? I recall that the completely mixed state is when all possible states are equally likely. For a single qubit, the maximally mixed state is (I)/2, which corresponds to the origin on the Bloch sphere. Because the Bloch vector is zero, which is the center of the sphere.

So the geometrical position is at the origin, which would be r=(0,0,0). Looking at the options, that's option C.

Let me make sure I didn't mix anything up. Another way to think: pure states have density matrices with trace squared equal to 1, while mixed states have it less. The trace of ρ is 1 (since it's a density matrix), and the trace of ρ squared would be Tr( (I/2)^2 ) = Tr( I/4 ) = 1/4 +1/4= 1/2. Since 1 != 1/2, it's a mixed state. The Bloch vector for mixed states is inside the sphere, but since it's the maximally mixed state, the vector is at the center, so r=(0,0,0).


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{I}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), we find that the only solution is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), as all components of \(\mathbf{r}\) must vanish to satisfy the equation.

This corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which is represented by the origin of the Bloch sphere. Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix is 

\[
r = (0, 0, 0).
\]
