Okay, so I have this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let's start by recalling what I know about density matrices.

A density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. For a single qubit, the density matrix is a 2x2 Hermitian matrix with trace 1. In this case, the given matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, this is the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. It's like being in a completely mixed state, so it's the analog of classical randomness in quantum mechanics.

But wait, the question is about its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, what does that mean? I think qubit space can be visualized using the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of the state space of a qubit. Each point on the unit sphere corresponds to a possible state of the qubit. So, pure states are on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states are inside.

The Bloch vector (r) for a density matrix ρ is given by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices and r is a 3-dimensional vector (the Bloch vector). So I need to find the components of r, which are r_x, r_y, r_z.

Let me compute ρ first. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let's write out these matrices. |0⟩⟨0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 and 0, and |1⟩⟨1| is diagonal with 0 and 1. So adding them gives a matrix with [1,0; 0,1], and then multiplied by 1/2, we get [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements 0.5.

Now, the general form for a density matrix in terms of the Bloch vector is:

ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z) / 2.

I is the identity matrix, which for 2x2 is [[1,0],[0,1]]. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So expanding ρ into Bloch form:

ρ = (1/2) [ [1,0],[0,1] ] + (1/2) [ r_x [0,1;1,0] + r_y [0,-i;i,0] + r_z [1,0;0,-1] ]

Let me compute each term.

First term is (1/2) I: [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]

Second term is (1/2) r_x σ_x: (r_x/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]

Third term is (1/2) r_y σ_y: (r_y/2) [[0,-i],[i,0]]

Fourth term is (1/2) r_z σ_z: (r_z/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Adding all these together:

The diagonal elements are 0.5 + (r_z/2)*1 for (1,1) and 0.5 + (r_z/2)*(-1) for (2,2). The off-diagonal elements are (r_x/2) for (1,2) and (r_x/2) for (2,1), and similarly for the y terms.

Wait, but our ρ is diagonal with both diagonal elements 0.5 and the off-diagonal elements zero. So when we compare the expanded form to the given ρ, the off-diagonal terms must be zero, and the diagonal terms are 0.5.

So let's equate the off-diagonal terms first. The (1,2) element in ρ is 0. So:

Looking at the expanded form, the (1,2) element is (r_x/2) + (r_y/2)(-i) = 0.

Wait, but our ρ has (1,2) element zero. So:

r_x / 2 - (i r_y)/2 = 0.

Which implies (r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0, so r_x - i r_y = 0.

But wait, the Bloch vector components r_x, r_y, r_z are real numbers. So for the imaginary part to be zero, r_x must be zero and r_y must be zero. Because:

r_x - i r_y = 0 → Both real and imaginary parts must be zero. Real part is r_x = 0, and imaginary part is -r_y = 0 → r_y = 0.

So now, r_x=0 and r_y=0. That simplifies things.

Now looking at the diagonal elements. The (1,1) element is 0.5 + (r_z/2)(1) = 0.5 + r_z/2. But in our ρ, the (1,1) element is 0.5. So:

0.5 + (r_z/2) = 0.5 → r_z/2 = 0 → r_z = 0.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). Therefore, the geometrical position is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Wait, but the options are given as points. Let me check the options again. Option C is (0,0,0). So that's the one.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1|\right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state of a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices and is related to the density matrix by:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(I + r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z\right),
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix, and \( \sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z \) are the Pauli matrices. Expanding this, the diagonal elements of \( \rho \) are:

\[
\rho_{11} = 0.5 + \frac{r_z}{2}, \quad \rho_{22} = 0.5 - \frac{r_z}{2}.
\]

The off-diagonal elements are:

\[
\rho_{12} = \frac{r_x}{2} - \frac{i r_y}{2}.
\]

From the given \( \rho \), the diagonal elements are both \( 0.5 \), and the off-diagonal elements are zero. This implies:

1. From \( \rho_{12} = 0 \): \( \frac{r_x}{2} - \frac{i r_y}{2} = 0 \). Since \( r_x \) and \( r_y \) are real, this gives \( r_x = 0 \) and \( r_y = 0 \).
2. From \( \rho_{11} = 0.5 \): \( 0.5 + \frac{r_z}{2} = 0.5 \), which gives \( r_z = 0 \).

Thus, the Bloch vector is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), meaning the density matrix corresponds to the origin in qubit space.
