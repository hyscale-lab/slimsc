Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about titration. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.

The question says we have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, and the Ka is given as 1.85e-5.

Wait, so acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. The reaction between them should be a neutralization reaction. Let me think about the steps involved.

First, when we dilute the acetic acid with water, the concentration will change. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration of acetic acid is calculated using dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 is (0.05 * 20) /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, during titration with NaOH. Let's tackle each part — the 25% titration point and the equivalence point.

Starting with 25% titration. I think this means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So I need to find out the moles of acetic acid and the moles of NaOH added at 25% of the equivalence point.

Moles of acetic acid initially: Molarity * Volume (in liters). The original volume after dilution is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters. Moles = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

At 25% titration, moles of NaOH added would be 25% of that. So 0.001 * 0.25 = 0.00025 moles of NaOH.

The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of CH3COOH, producing CH3COO^- (acetate ion), which is the conjugate base.

So the moles of CH3COOH left would be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And the moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed would be 0.00025 moles.

Since the total volume at this point is important, I need to calculate the new volume. The initial solution was 40 cm³, and we're adding 25% of the required volume of NaOH for equivalence. Wait, but what's the volume of NaOH added at 25%? Hmm, to find that, I need to find the equivalence point volume first.

Wait, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Moles of acetic acid is 0.001, so moles of NaOH needed is 0.001. Since the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume would be moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm³. So at equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

So at 25% titration, we have added 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³. So the total solution volume at 25% is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

Now, back to the 25% point. We have 0.00075 moles of CH3COOH and 0.00025 moles of CH3COO^- in 0.0425 L. So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. The equation is:

pH = pKa + log ([A^-]/[HA])

pKa is -log(Ka), so Ka is 1.85e-5. Let me calculate pKa: log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5). Log(1.85) ≈ 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) ≈ 4.733. So pKa is ≈ 4.733.

Wait, wait, no. Wait: pKa = -log(Ka). So if Ka is 1.85e-5, then log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + (-5). Log(1.85) is approximately 0.2672, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.2672 -5 = -4.7328. So pKa is 4.7328, which I can round to 4.73.

So plugging into Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = 4.73 + log( (0.005882) / (0.017647) )

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333. Log(0.333) is approximately -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.253. So around 4.25.

Looking at the options, option A has 4.26, which is very close. Option D is 4.57, that's higher. So 4.25 is close to option A. But wait, maybe I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, let me recheck the ratio. [A^-] is 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M. [HA] is 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M. So ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.3333... exactly 1/3.

So log(1/3) is log(0.3333). Let me calculate that: log(3)=0.4771, so log(1/3)= -0.4771. So pH=4.73-0.4771=4.2529. So about 4.25, which is 4.25. So option A has 4.26, which is very close.

Now, moving on to the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. The solution is now a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

So the concentration of acetate ions: moles of acetate is 0.001 (since all acetic acid is converted), and the total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

Concentration [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will react with water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be calculated using Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C, so Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.

The concentration is 0.02 M. Let me set up the expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-] produced, we can approximate x^2 / 0.02 ≈ Kb.

So x^2 ≈ Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M. Then pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the Kb calculation. 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 is (1 / 1.85e5) * 1e-14 / 1e-14? Wait, no:

Wait, (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9. 1/1.85 is approx 0.5405, so 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10. That's correct.

So x^2 ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) = approximately 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5, pOH is about 4.98, so pH is about 9.02.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have 9. So that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in the calculations?

Wait, the options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Hmm, none of the equivalence points are around 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: when you dilute the solution, perhaps the concentration of acetate is less, but my calculation said 0.02 M. Let me recalculate the moles and volume.

Wait, initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. At equivalence, all that becomes 0.001 mol of acetate. The volume is 40 + 10 =50 cm³, so 0.05 L. So 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the Kb is not correct. Wait, let me double-check Kb.

Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10.

Wait, maybe the hydrolysis isn't just assuming x is small, but perhaps the approximation isn't valid?

Wait, let's consider the exact solution. Let me write the expression again.

CH3COO^- reacts with water:

CH3COO^- → CH3COOH + OH^-

The initial concentration is 0.02 M. Change is -x, producing x of each product.

So Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5, which is much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation holds.

So pOH is about 4.98, so pH is 9.02. But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, wait a second. Perhaps the problem has a different approach. Oh! Because when you mix acetic acid with water, you have a buffer solution, and upon titration with NaOH, you reach certain points.

Wait, but the equivalence point I'm calculating leads to a pH higher than any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles.

Wait, let's re-calculate the equivalence point.

Wait, the initial concentration after dilution is 0.025 M, right? Because 0.05 M * 20 cm³ / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. Moles are 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in considering the volume. Let me think again.

Wait, when we add NaOH, the volume isn't just 40 cm³ plus the NaOH volume? Or do we have to account for the fact that adding the NaOH solution affects the total volume?

Wait, yes, I did account for that. At equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added to 40 cm³ of solution, giving 50 cm³. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the Kb calculation. Another approach: maybe I should calculate the pH using the concentration of acetate ions and the hydrolysis reaction.

Wait, acetate is a weak base. So its hydrolysis reaction is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is Kw/Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10, as I had before.

So, if the initial concentration is 0.02 M, then:

At equilibrium:

[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x

[CH3COOH] = x

[OH^-] = x

Kb = (x^2)/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is negligible compared to 0.02, then:

x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5. pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. pH is about 9.02, which isn't in any of the options. So I'm confused.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculations. Let me check the 25% titration point again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the 25% titration is based on the volume of NaOH added being 25% of the equivalence point volume. So equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added. So 25% titration would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

So the initial solution is 40 cm³, adding 2.5 cm³ makes 42.5 cm³.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol. Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol.

So the concentrations are [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M. [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

So pH = pKa + log (0.005882 / 0.017647) = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253.

So about 4.25, which is close to option A's 4.26.

But the equivalence point I'm calculating doesn't fit any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point's pH calculation. Maybe I'm not considering the presence of NaOH in the solution. But no, at equivalence point, the NaOH has neutralized all the acetic acid to acetate. So the solution should be a solution of sodium acetate, which is a basic solution.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH using the formula for the hydrolysis of acetate ions, but perhaps the approximation isn't valid. Let me set up the equation again without approximation.

Let me denote the concentration of acetate as 0.02 M.

So Kb = x^2 / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, so x^2 ≈ 5.4e-10 * 0.02 = 1.08e-11. x ≈ 1.04e-5.

But maybe I should check without approximation.

x^2 = Kb (0.
