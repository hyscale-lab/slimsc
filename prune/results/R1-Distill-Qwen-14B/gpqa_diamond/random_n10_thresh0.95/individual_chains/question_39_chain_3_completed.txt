Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to wrap my head around it. Hmm, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, and each particle can move along the x-axis in a tube. When they measure the position, none are found outside x=1 and x=3. So the particles are only between x=1 and x=3. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the probability of finding a particle in a region is related to the square of the absolute value of the wave function. Oh right, the probability density is |ψ(x)|².

So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the wave functions are usually complex, so this makes sense. But when calculating the probability density, I just need the square of the magnitude, which is ψ*(x)ψ(x). Let me compute that.

The wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus (0.5)i. So the complex conjugate, ψ*, would be (a / sqrt(1 +x)) plus (0.5)i. When I multiply ψ and ψ*, the cross terms (the imaginary parts) should cancel out. Let me compute that.

ψψ* = [a/sqrt(1+x)]² + [0.5]^2. Because when you multiply (a + ib)(a - ib) = a² + b². Wait, no, actually in this case, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5i. So ψ = Real part + imaginary part. So ψ* is Real part - imaginary part. So when you multiply them, you get (Real part)^2 + (Imaginary part)^2.

So the probability density is [a²/(1 + x)] + (0.5)^2. So [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25. Got it.

Now, the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3. That means the probability of finding the particle outside this region is zero. So the wave function must be zero outside x=1 and x=3. Wait, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. How does this relate to the probability?

Wait a second, maybe I'm getting confused here. The wave function ψ(x) is given in the region where the particle can exist, which is between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function is zero outside this region. But the way the wave function is written, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Hmm, but that's only in the region where it can exist. So, perhaps the wave function is zero elsewhere.

Wait, no, the question says each particle can be found only between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function must be zero outside this interval. But the given expression is for the region where it can exist. So in x <1 or x>3, ψ(x) is zero.

But the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So that's valid between x=1 and x=3. But since the wave function has to be continuous, or maybe it's a valid wave function in that interval. So the probability is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3.

So to find 'a', I think I need to normalize the wave function. Because the total probability over all space should be 1. So the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1.

So let's write that. The integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the probability density is |ψ(x)|². So that's [a^2/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. Because (0.5i) squared magnitude is 0.25. So the probability density is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The wave function is ψ = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ* is (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So |ψ|^2 = [a/sqrt(1+x)]^2 + (0.5i)^2? No, wait. No, when you compute ψ*ψ, it's (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2, because the imaginary parts multiply to give 0.25.

Wait, no, because ψ = A + iB, where A is a/sqrt(1+x), and B is -0.5. Then ψ* is A - iB. So ψ*ψ = A² + B². So yes, it's (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

So let's compute this integral.

Breaking it down into two terms:

Integral from 1 to 3 of (a²/(1+x)) dx + Integral from 1 to 3 of 0.25 dx = 1.

Compute each integral separately.

First integral: a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So first integral is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So adding both integrals:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Thus, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.


To determine the value of \( a \) in the wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), we use the normalization condition for wave functions. The total probability of finding the particle in the region \( x \in [1, 3] \) must equal 1. The probability density is given by \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), which is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This can be split into two separate integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} 1 \, dx = 1.
\]

1. For the first integral, \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx \), the antiderivative of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating this from 1 to 3 gives:

\[
\ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln\left(\frac{4}{2}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Thus, the first term becomes \( a^2 \ln(2) \).

2. For the second integral, \( 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} 1 \, dx \), the result is:

\[
0.25 \times (3 - 1) = 0.25 \times 2 = 0.5.
\]

Combining these results, the normalization equation becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Rearranging for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \), we find:

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately 0.85, which corresponds to option **B**.
