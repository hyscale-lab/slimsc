--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, with various distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle and its speed. Oh right! The formula is something like distance = c * τ * β, where τ is the lifetime, c is the speed of light, and β is the velocity relative to the speed of light.

But how do I find τ? Oh, right, the lifetime τ is connected to the width Γ via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle gives τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I think the exact relation is τ = ħ / (Γ/2π), or maybe τ = ħ / Γ. I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The natural linewidth is Γ = ħ/τ, so τ = ħ/(Γ). Yeah, that's it.

Wait, but I should double-check. The width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ/τ. So τ = ħ/(Γ). So that's straightforward.

Next, I need to compute βγ. Wait, β is v/c, and γ is the Lorentz factor. Since the particle is moving at relativistic speeds, I can't ignore γ. But wait, the mean decay distance is calculated using the particle's velocity and lifetime, right?

Wait, the formula for mean decay length (L) is L = βγ c τ. Because the proper time is τ, and the time experienced in the lab frame is γτ. So the distance traveled is velocity times time, which is βc * γτ. So L = βγ c τ.

But wait, let's make sure. The particle's lifetime is τ in its rest frame. In the lab frame, it's moving, so the lifetime is dilated by gamma. So the time it lives is gamma * tau. Then, the distance is speed times that time. Speed is beta*c, so L = beta * c * gamma * tau.

Alternatively, L = (c * tau) * beta gamma. Yeah, that makes sense.

So putting it all together, L = c * tau * beta gamma.

Now, let's get the steps:

1. Calculate tau (τ). Tau = ħ / Γ. But wait, ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Let me remember the value. ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and Planck's constant is about 6.626e-34 J·s, but when converted to GeV·s, it's approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Wait, wait, 1 GeV is 1.602e-10 J. So Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So h = 6.626e-34 J·s. To get ħ, which is h/(2π), so approximately 1.05457e-34 J·s.

Wait, but maybe I should use the value in natural units where ħ c is known. Alternatively, perhaps using the commonly used approximation for particle physics: ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, but that's more for converting energy to distance.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the formula directly. Let me think: tau in seconds is ħ / (Γ in GeV). So Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / (0.32 GeV). Let's plug in the numbers. ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let's compute 6.582 / 0.32:

6.582 ÷ 0.32 ≈ 20.56875. So tau ≈ 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, no, wait: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56. So 20.56e-25 is 2.056e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. Yes.

Next, I need to find beta gamma. Beta is v/c, and gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).

But to find beta and gamma, I can use the energy and mass of the particle.

The total energy E is given as 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. So E = gamma m c^2. So gamma = E / (m c^2). Wait, but since we're dealing in natural units where c=1, E (in GeV) = gamma * m (in GeV). So gamma = E / m.

So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... ≈ 6.6667.

Now, beta can be found using the relation gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). Let me solve for beta.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) → sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1/gamma → 1 - beta^2 = 1/gamma^2 → beta^2 = 1 - (1/gamma^2).

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))).

Compute gamma^2: (6.6667)^2 = (20/3)^2 = (400/9) ≈ 44.4444.

So 1/gamma^2 is 1/44.4444 ≈ 0.0225.

So beta^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775 → beta ≈ sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Wait, let me compute this more accurately.

gamma = 8/1.2 = 6.6666667.

gamma squared: 6.6666667^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.4444444.

1/gamma squared is 1/44.4444444 ≈ 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

Square root of 0.9775: let's compute it.

Well, sqrt(0.96) is 0.98 (since 0.98^2=0.9604), sqrt(0.9801)=0.99. So 0.9775 is between 0.96 and 0.9801.

Compute 0.9775: let's see, 0.988^2 = (approx) 0.976144, 0.9885^2 is about (0.988)^2 = 0.976144, add (0.0005*2*0.988 + (0.0005)^2) → 0.988^2 = (approx) 0.976144, 0.9885^2 is 0.976144 + 2*(0.988)*(0.0005) + (0.0005)^2 ≈ 0.976144 + 0.000988 + 0.00000025 ≈ 0.977132. Hmm, but I'm looking for 0.9775, which is higher. Let's try 0.9886:

(0.9886)^2 = (0.988)^2 + 2*(0.988)*(0.0006) + (0.0006)^2.

0.988^2 = 0.976144.

2*0.988*0.0006 = 0.0011856.

(0.0006)^2 = 0.00000036.

So total is 0.976144 + 0.0011856 = 0.9773296, plus 0.00000036 → ≈0.97733. Close to 0.9775.

So beta is approximately 0.9886.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach would be better, but I'll proceed with beta ≈ 0.9886.

So beta gamma is beta multiplied by gamma. Gamma is 6.6667, so beta gamma is 0.9886 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.5907.

Wait, let me compute 0.9886 * 6.6667:

0.9886 * 6 = 5.9316.

0.9886 * 0.6667 ≈ approx 0.9886 * (2/3) = about 0.659066667.

So total is 5.9316 + 0.65906667 ≈ 6.59066667.

So beta gamma ≈6.5907.

Now, L = c * tau * beta gamma.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 meters per second.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So let's compute each part:

c * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (3 * 2.056875) * 1e-16 = 6.170625e-16 meters.

Then multiply by beta gamma (approx 6.5907):

6.170625e-16 m * 6.5907 ≈ ?

Let's calculate 6.170625e-16 *6= 3.702375e-15.

6.170625e-16 *0.5907 ≈ 3.648e-16.

Wait, wait, no: 6.170625e-16 *6.5907 = 6.170625 *6.5907 * 1e-16.

Compute 6.170625 * 6.5907.

Hmm, 6 * 6.5907 is 39.5442.

0.170625 *6.5907 ≈ approx 1.1205.

Total approx 39.5442 + 1.1205 ≈ 40.6647.

So 40.6647e-16 meters = 4.06647e-15 meters.

Wait, so L ≈ 4.066e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B: 4.0655e-15 m, or option C:5.0223e-15 m.

Wait, but wait. Did I make an error in the calculation of beta gamma?

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the relation between gamma and beta more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute beta and gamma more accurately.

Wait, gamma is 8/1.2 = 6.6666666667.

Let me compute beta more precisely.

gamma = 6.6666666667.

gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.444444444.

1/gamma squared = 9/400 = 0.0225.

So beta squared is 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

Beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ let's compute it more accurately.

We can use the Taylor expansion for sqrt(x) around x=1.

Let x=0.9775. Let’s let x = 1 - Δ, where Δ=0.0225.

sqrt(1 - Δ) ≈ 1 - (Δ/2) - (Δ^2)/(8) - ... 

So sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 1 - (0.0225/2) - (0.0225^2)/(8).

0.0225/2 = 0.01125.

0.0225^2 = 0.00050625. Divided by 8 is 0.00006328125.

So sqrt ≈ 1 - 0.01125 - 0.00006328 ≈ 0.988687.

Wait, but that's an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute sqrt(0.9775) more accurately.

Let me compute 0.988687^2:

0.988687 * 0.988687.

Compute 0.98^2 = 0.9604.

0.008687^2 ≈ 7.54e-5.

But perhaps better to do it step by step.

(0.98 + 0.008687)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.008687 + (0.008687)^2.

0.98^2 = 0.9604.

2*0.98*0.008687 = 2 * 0.98 = 1.96; 1.96 *0.008687 ≈ 0.017047.

(0.008687)^2 ≈ 0.00007546.

So total is 0.9604 + 0.017047 = 0.977447 + 0.00007546 ≈ 0.9775225. Which is very close to 0.9775. So beta is approximately 0.988687.

So beta is about 0.988687.

So beta gamma is beta * gamma = 0.988687 * 6.6666666667.

Compute 0.988687 *6.6666666667.

6.6666666667 is 20/3. So 0.988687 *20/3.

0.988687 *20 = 19.77374.

19.77374 /3 ≈6.5912467.

So beta gamma is approximately 6.5912467.

Now, back to L = c * tau * beta gamma.

c is 3e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So c * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 3e8 *2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by beta gamma (6.5912467):

6.170625e-16 m *6.5912467 = ?

Compute 6.170625 *6.5912467.

Let me compute 6 *6.5912467 =39.54748.

0.170625 *6.5912467 = let's compute:

0.1 *6.5912467 = 0.659125.

0.07 *6.5912467 ≈0.461387.

0.000625 *6.5912467 ≈0.004057.

Adding them: 0.659125 +0.461387 =1.120512 +0.004057=1.124569.

So total is 39.54748 +1.124569 ≈40.67205.

So 40.67205e-16 meters =4.067205e-15 meters.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option C is5.0223e-15 m.

Hmm, my calculation gives approximately 4.067e-15 m, which is very close to option B (4.0655e-15). So probably option B is the correct one.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau. Let me double-check that.

Tau is ħ / Γ.

Given ħ =6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So tau =6.582e-25 /0.32 = ?

6.582 ÷ 0.32 = let's compute.

0.32 *20=6.4. So 20.56875, as before.

Which gives tau=2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, but perhaps the precise value of ħ is 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Some sources might use 6.582×10^-25, others 6.58×10^-25. Let me check: Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. So that part is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate beta gamma more accurately. Let me recompute:

gamma =8/1.2 =6.6666666667.

beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma)^2)).

gamma squared is (8/1.2)^2 = (20/3)^2=400/9=44.444444444...

1/gamma^2 is 9/400=0.0225.

So beta^2=1-0.0225=0.9775. So beta= sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.98868.

So beta gamma = 0.98868 *6.6666666667=?

0.98868 *6 =5.93208.

0.98868 *0.6666666667 ≈ ?

0.6666666667 is 2/3.

So 0.98868 * 2/3 = approx 0.65912.

So total beta gamma =5.93208 +0.65912=6.5912.

So same as before.

So L = c * tau * beta gamma =3e8 *2.056875e-24 *6.5912.

Wait, 3e8 *2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16.

Multiply by 6.5912:

6.170625e-16 *6.5912 = ?

6.170625 *6.5912=?

Let me compute 6 *6.5912=39.5472.

0.170625 *6.5912= let's compute.

0.1 *6.5912=0.65912.

0.07 *6.5912=0.461384.

0.000625 *6.5912=0.0041195.

Adding these: 0.65912 +0.461384=1.120504 +0.0041195=1.1246235.

So total is 39.5472 +1.1246235=40.6718235.

So 40.6718235e-16 m =4.06718235e-15 m.

Which is about 4.067e-15 m. The option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Close enough, considering the approximations.

Maybe I should consider more precise calculations, but perhaps the given options have these values.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in using the formula for L.

Wait, another approach: the mean proper lifetime is tau = ħ / Γ.

The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau.

The velocity is beta c. So the mean path length is velocity * lifetime = beta c gamma tau.

Which is the same as beta gamma c tau.

So the formula is correct.

So with the numbers, it's approximately 4.067e-15 m, which matches option B (4.0655e-15 m).

Wait, but option C is 5e-15, which is a bit bigger. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in beta gamma?

Wait, another thought: when I calculate L = c tau beta gamma, perhaps I should have used beta gamma multiplied by c tau.

Wait, let me compute with exact numbers.

Exact tau: 6.582e-25 /0.32 = (6.582 /0.32 ) * 1e-25 = 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24 s.

Beta gamma: 6.5912.

So L =3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s *6.5912.

So 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 meters.

Multiply by 6.5912: 6.170625e-16 *6.5912 = ?

6.170625 *6.5912 = ?

Again, 6 *6.5912=39.5472.

0.170625 *6.5912:

= (0.1 *6.5912) + (0.07 *6.5912) + (0.000625 *6.5912)

=0.65912 +0.461384 +0.0041195= 1.1246235.

So total 39.5472 +1.1246235=40.6718235.

So 40.6718235e-16 m =4.06718235e-15 m.

Again, which is about 4.067e-15 m, very close to option B:4.0655e-15 m. So option B is the correct answer.

But wait, why is option B 4.0655e-15? Could it be due to more precise calculation of beta?

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute beta more precisely.

Let me compute beta using more precise sqrt(0.9775).

Using a calculator isn't possible, but perhaps a better approximation.

Let me use the Newton-Raphson method to find the square root of 0.9775.

We're trying to find x where x^2=0.9775.

We'll start with an initial guess, say x0=0.988687 as before.

Compute x0^2=0.9775225.

The difference is 0.9775225 -0.9775=0.0000225.

So f(x)=x^2 -0.9775.

f'(x)=2x.

So next approximation: x1 = x0 - f(x0)/f'(x0).

f(x0)=0.9775225 -0.9775=0.0000225.

f'(x0)=2 *0.988687=1.977374.

So x1=0.988687 - (0.0000225)/(1.977374) ≈ 0.988687 - 0.00001138 ≈0.9886756.

Compute x1^2: (0.9886756)^2.

Let me compute this:

= (0.9886 +0.0000756)^2.

= 0.9886^2 + 2*(0.9886)*(0.0000756) + (0.0000756)^2.

0.9886^2: which is 0.97752256.

2*0.9886*0.0000756 = 0.000151039.

(0.0000756)^2=5.715e-8.

So x1^2≈0.97752256 +0.000151039 +0.00000005715≈ 0.97767366.

Wait, wait, that's more than 0.9775. So maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, because f(x0) was positive, so x1 should be smaller than x0.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the sign in the Newton-Raphson.

Wait, Newton-Raphson is x1 = x0 - f(x0)/f’(x0).

But in this case, f(x0)=x0^2 - a =0.9775225 -0.9775=0.0000225.

So x1 = x0 - (0.0000225)/(2x0) = x0 - 0.0000225/(2*0.988687).

=0.988687 - 0.0000225/(1.977374) =0.988687 - 0.00001138 ≈0.9886756.

Now, computing (0.9886756)^2:

Let me compute 0.9886756 * 0.9886756.

Break it down:

0.9886 * 0.9886 = (as before) 0.97752256.

0.9886 *0.0000756 = approx 0.00007505.

0.0000756 *0.9886 = same as above.

0.0000756 *0.0000756=5.715e-8.

Now, adding all the cross terms:

Wait, (a +b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2, where a=0.9886, b=0.0000756.

So a^2 is 0.97752256.

2ab = 2 *0.9886 *0.0000756 = 2 * 0.00007505 = 0.0001501.

b^2= (0.0000756)^2≈5.715e-8.

So total is 0.97752256 + 0.0001501 =0.97767266 + 5.715e-8=0.977672717.

Which is 0.977672717, which is larger than 0.9775. So f(x1)=0.977672717 - 0.9775=0.000172717.

Wait, that's more than before. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should use a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator, but since I can't, maybe I'll accept that beta is approximately 0.9886.

In any case, the previous calculation gives L around 4.067e-15 m, which is very close to option B (4.0655e-15 m). So I think option B is the correct answer.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = c \cdot \tau \cdot \beta \gamma
\]

where:
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the lifetime of the particle,
- \( \beta \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau \)
The lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:
\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]
Given \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \), we calculate:
\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \) and \( \gamma \)
The total energy of the particle is given as \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), and its mass is \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is:
\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
\]
The velocity \( \beta \) is calculated using the relation:
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}.
\]
Substituting \( \gamma^2 = (6.6667)^2 = 44.4444 \), we find:
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.4444}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]
Thus, \( \beta \gamma \) is:
\[
\beta \gamma = \beta \cdot \gamma = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \approx 6.5912.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:
\[
L = c \cdot \tau \cdot \beta \gamma.
\]
Substituting \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \), and \( \beta \gamma = 6.5912 \), we compute:
\[
L = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot 6.5912.
\]
First, calculate \( c \cdot \tau \):
\[
c \cdot \tau = 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
\]
Then, multiply by \( \beta \gamma \):
\[
L = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \cdot 6.5912 \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with Options
The calculated decay distance \( L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B** (\( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)).
