Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the probability of them transiting in front of their host stars. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest chance of transiting. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period, which means it's closer to its star. Oh wait, right, the orbital period and the star's mass are related through Kepler's third law. So a shorter period implies a closer orbit.

The host stars have the same radius, but Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Hmm, same radius but different masses—so maybe different densities or temperatures, but for transit probability, I think the key is the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

Wait, transiting probability depends on the size of the planet and the star, but also on the orbital distance. Because a planet closer to the star has a smaller orbit, which might make the chance of it passing in front of the star from our perspective higher. Or is it the other way around?

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by some function of the orbital distance. Oh wait, more accurately, the transit probability is given by (R_p / a) * (something with the inclination), but I think the main factors are the planet's size relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

Wait, no. The probability that a planet transits is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / a, but because R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's roughly (R_star) / a * something. Or wait, the transit probability formula I think is:

P ≈ (R_p / a) * (some function), but I'm not sure. Or wait, perhaps the transit probability is proportional to (R_star + R_planet)^2 / a^2, but that's for the area of the star. No, maybe the probability is (R_p / a)^2 * (some factor). Wait, maybe I should think about the formula correctly.

Another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the planet's orbit, but that's when the planet's orbit is edge-on. Wait, no, that's not accurate. Actually, the transit probability depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit and the star's size. Specifically, the probability that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The higher the probability, the more likely we are to observe a transit.

The formula for the probability of a transit is given by (R_star / a) * (something). Wait, I think the formula is P = (R_p / a) * (R_p / a) times some factor based on other things, but maybe I'm getting tangled. Alternatively, I recall that the probability is roughly proportional to (R_star / a) where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, no, the formula is P ≈ (R_p / a) * (something else), but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: the probability that a planet transits is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's roughly (R_star / a) times 1. But wait, that doesn't make sense because if a is small, then R_star/a would be big, implying a higher probability. Which makes sense because a planet closer in has a smaller orbit, so a higher chance of transiting.

Wait, but let's think about it. The transit can only occur if the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The probability is higher when the planet's orbital distance a is smaller because the path it takes is more likely to cross our line of sight. So when a is small, the probability increases.

But wait, no, I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think again. The transit probability depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the size of the star. The probability of the planet passing in front of the star from our point of view is higher when the planet's orbit is smaller because the angle subtended by the star is larger relative to the planet's orbital area.

Wait, no. Another way: the chance that a randomly oriented orbit will result in a transit is given by the ratio of the star's radius to the distance of the planet's orbit, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I think the formula for the transit probability is (R_star / a), but only when the star's radius is much smaller than the semi-major axis. So the probability is higher when a is smaller.

Wait, no, another approach. The transit probability is given by R/(a * sqrt(1 - e²)), where e is the eccentricity. Since both planets have circular orbits, e=0, so it's R/(a). So the probability is proportional to R/(a). Wait, but R here is the radius of the star, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet.

So for each planet, P = (R_star) / a. So the higher R/a ratio, the higher the probability.

Wait, but the question says that both stars have the same radius. So R is the same for both stars. So the probability for each planet would be (R) / a_1 and (R) / a_2.

So the planet with a smaller a has a higher probability.

Now, the planets have orbital periods given. Planet_1 has a period three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1's period is P1 = P2 /3.

Using Kepler's third law: P² is proportional to a³ / (M_star), where M_star is the mass of the host star. Because for a planet orbiting a star, P² = (4π²/G M_star) * a³.

So rearranging, a³ = (G M_star) P²/(4π²). So a is proportional to (M_star * P²)^1/3.

So a1 is proportional to (M1 * P1²)^(1/3) = (2 M2 * (P2/3)²)^(1/3) because M1 is twice M2 (since M1 = 2 * M2 for Planet_2's host?), wait wait.

Wait, the question says: the star of Planet_1 has mass twice that of Planet_2's host. So M1 = 2*M2.

Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's, so P1 = (1/3) P2.

So for each a:

a1 = [ (G M1 P1²) / (4π²) ]^(1/3)

a2 = [ (G M2 P2²) / (4π²) ]^(1/3)

So a1 / a2 = [ (M1/M2) * (P1² / P2²) ]^(1/3)

Substitute M1 = 2 M2, P1 = (1/3) P2.

a1/a2 = [ (2) * ( (1/3 P2)^2 / P2^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify (1/3 P2)^2 = (1/9) P2², so P1²/P2² is (1/9).

So:

[ 2 * (1/9) ]^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3)

Which is approximately (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6. Let me compute 0.6 cubed is about 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So a1 is about 0.6 times a2.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6 * a2.

Wait, because a1 is smaller than a2. So a1 is about 0.6 times a2.

But wait, a1 is the semi-major axis of Planet_1, which is closer in because its period is shorter.

So since a1 is smaller than a2, the transit probability is higher for Planet_1. Because the transit probability is R/(a) as per earlier, and R is same for both stars.

So P1 = R/a1, P2=R/a2.

Since a1 < a2, P1 > P2.

So which is higher, Planet_1 or Planet_2's transit probability?

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher than Planet_2, so the researchers should choose Planet_1, which is option C or D.

But wait, the question is about which has a higher probability. Let's compute the ratio of probabilities.

P1 / P2 = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2/(a1).

So if a1 is 0.6 a2, then a2/a1 is 1/0.6 ≈1.6667, so P1 is about 1.67 times higher than P2.

Wait, but wait, since a1 is smaller than a2, so a2 = a1 / 0.6 ≈ 1.666 a1.

So P1 = R/a1, P2 = R/(1.666 a1) = R/(5/3 a1) )= (3 R)/(5 a1).

So P1 is R/a1, P2 is (3/5)(R/a1) ≈ 0.6 R/a1.

So P1 is about 1.666 times P2.

So the ratio is P1 = (a2/a1) * P2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, perhaps another approach.

Compute transit probability for each.

Transit probability P = (R_star / a) times some factor, perhaps, but let's proceed.

Since both stars have same R, R1=R2=R.

Compute a1 and a2.

As per earlier, a1 = ( (G M1 P1²) / (4π²) )^(1/3 )

a2 = ( (G M2 P2²) / (4π²) )^(1/3 )

So the ratio a1/a2 is [ (M1/M2) * (P1²/P2²) ]^(1/3 )

Which is [ (2) * ( (1/3)^2 ) ]^1/3.

(1/3)^2 is 1/9.

So 2 * (1/9) = 2/9 ≈ 0.2222.

Cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.6 (since 0.6^3 is 0.216).

So a1 is about 0.6 a2.

Now, transit probability is proportional to R/(a), so since R is same, P ∝ 1/a.

So P1 = 1/a1, P2=1/a2.

So P1 / P2 = (1/a1) / (1/a2) ) = a2 / a1.

Since a1 is 0.6 a2, a2/a1 is 1 / 0.6 = 5/3 ≈ 1.6667.

So P1 is about 1.67 times higher than P2.

Looking at the options:

Option C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher.

So 1.6667 is approximately 1.65, so option C is the correct one.


The question involves determining which of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, has a higher probability of transiting its host star, given that the researchers want to prioritize the planet with the higher transit probability. Both planets have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period (three times shorter than Planet_2). The host stars of the two planets have the same radius but different masses: the star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as that of Planet_2.

The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both stars have the same radius, the transit probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \). A smaller \( a \) results in a higher transit probability.

Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M_{\text{star}}} \), the semi-major axis \( a \) can be expressed as:

\[
a \propto \left( M_{\text{star}} \cdot P^2 \right)^{1/3}.
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) (Planet_1's host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's host star).
- \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's).

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{M_1}{M_2} \cdot \frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{\left(\frac{1}{3}P_2\right)^2}{P_2^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( 2 \cdot \frac{1}{9} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3}.
\]

Approximating \( \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3} \), we find \( a_1 \approx 0.6a_2 \). Thus, Planet_1's semi-major axis is smaller than Planet_2's.

Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), the ratio of the transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67.
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

From the options provided:
- **Option C** states that Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit, which matches the calculated result.

**Answer: C**
