Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let me try to work through it. The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when you titrate them, they react to form the acetate ion, which is the conjugate base.

Alright, the problem says we start by diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

First, let's tackle the initial dilution. Diluting equal volumes, so the concentration should decrease by a factor of 2. Wait, no, because the total volume is 40 cm³ now. So initial moles of acetic acid: Molarity * Volume = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After diluting with 20 cm³ water, the volume is 40 cm³, so the new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, wait, let me double-check. Oh yeah, 20 mL + 20 mL is 40 mL, which is 0.04 L. So moles are the same, 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. So 0.001 / 0.04 L is 0.025 M. That makes sense.

Now, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed at equivalence would be 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL. Wait, but the initial volume was 40 mL, and we're adding 10 mL of NaOH? So the total solution at equivalence is 50 mL.

But wait, the question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. Let me think about each.

First, the 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume. Since equivalence is 10 mL, 25% of that is 2.5 mL. So we're adding 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH to the 40 mL solution. Let's calculate the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Wait, wait, no. Because the initial solution is 40 mL (diluted), and you're adding 2.5 mL of NaOH. So the total volume becomes 42.5 mL. But the moles of NaOH is 0.00025 mol. Since acetic acid is a weak acid, it will react with NaOH in a 1:1 ratio. So moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol. Moles of NaOH added: 0.00025 mol. So moles of acetic acid left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.00025 mol.

So now, the solution is a buffer solution because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. To find pH, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Wait, let me calculate pKa. The given Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. Log(1.85) is around 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Now, [A^-] is 0.00025 mol, and [HA] is 0.00075 mol. But wait, in the solution, the volume is 40 mL + 2.5 mL = 42.5 mL = 0.0425 L. So concentrations are:

[HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approximately 0.017647 M.

[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.3333.

So log(0.3333) is -0.477. So pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.256. So approximately 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value, and option D has 4.57. Hmm, so the pH at 25% titration is around 4.26.

Wait, but wait a second. Another approach: the 25% titration refers to the percentage of the equivalence point reached. So in the initial solution, the equivalence volume is 10 mL, so 25% is 2.5 mL. So when you add 2.5 mL of NaOH, it's 25% of the way to the equivalence point. So the buffer ratio is 1:3 because the ratio of base to acid is 1/4th of the total. Wait, because 25% is 1/4, so the moles of NaOH added is 1/4 of the moles of acetic acid.

Wait, in this case, the moles of NaOH added are 0.00025, which is 1/4 of 0.001. Oh, wait, no. Because the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So if you add a quarter of that, then you have 1/4 of the acetic acid neutralized. So, the moles of HA are initial minus (1/4 initial), which is (3/4 initial), and moles of A^- are 1/4 initial. So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (1/4)/(3/4) = 1/3. So log(1/3) is about -0.477, so pH is pKa + (-0.477) = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, which is approximately 4.26. So that's the first pH value.

Now, the second part is the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. The solution will be a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

So, the moles of NaOH at equivalence is 0.001 mol (since that's the initial moles of acetic acid). The total volume is 40 mL + 10 mL = 50 mL = 0.05 L. So the concentration of acetate ions is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb is about 5.405e-10. Now, to find the pH, we can set up the expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming that x is the concentration of OH^- produced, and since Kb is very small, x^2 / 0.02 ≈ 5.405e-10. So x^2 ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. Taking square root: x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M. So [OH^-] is about 3.288e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.486. Then pH = 14 - 5.486 ≈ 8.514. So approximately 8.51. Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52, which fits this.

Wait, but wait another thing. The initial solution after equivalence point is 0.02 M acetate. So when we calculate Kb, yes, that's correct.

But wait, wait. The Kb calculation is correct. Let me double-check the calculations. Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Then, [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 M. So Kb expression:

x^2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x² = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 3.288e-6. So [OH^-] is 3.288e-6 → pOH is -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288) is about 0.516, so 0.516 + 5 → 5.516. pOH is 5.516 → pH is 14-5.516=8.484. Hmm, that's about 8.48, but the option A says 8.52. Close enough, considering rounding.

Wait, perhaps more precise calculation is needed. Let me compute Kb more accurately.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = 4.733.

Wait, Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9.

1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405405405... So Kb = 5.4054054e-10.

So x² = 5.4054e-10 * 0.02 → 1.08108e-11.

x = sqrt(1.08108e-11) → Let's compute this accurately.

What is sqrt(1.08108e-11)?

Well, sqrt(1e-11) is 1e-5.5, which is 3.1623e-6. So 1.08108 is about 1.08 times larger than 1. So the square root is about 1.04 times 3.1623e-6 → 3.1623e-6 * 1.04 ≈ 3.288e-6. So same as before.

So [OH^-] is 3.288e-6 → pOH = -log(3.288e-6). Let's compute this more precisely.

Log(3.288) → let's see, log(3)=0.4771, log(3.288)= approx 0.5168.

So pOH is 5.5168 → pH = 14 - 5.5168 = 8.4832. So approximately 8.48. But none of the options match exactly, except A says 8.52. Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach is correct, but perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Wait, let's compute x^2/(0.02) = 5.4054e-10 → x^2 = (5.4054e-10)(0.02) = 1.08108e-11 → x = sqrt(1.08108e-11) → let's compute this square root accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach:

1.08108e-11 = 1.08108 × 10^-11.

We can write 1.08108 as approximately 1.08108. The square root of 1.08108 is about 1.04, because 1.04^2 is 1.0816. Close enough.

So sqrt(1.08108e-11) = sqrt(1.08108) * sqrt(1e-11) ≈ 1.04 * 3.1623e-6 = approx 3.289e-6.

So [OH^-] = 3.289e-6 → pOH = -log(3.289e-6). Let's calculate this more accurately.

Log(3.289e-6) = log(3.289) + log(1e-6) → log(3.289)= approximately 0.5167. So pOH is 5.4833 (since 6 - 0.5167 is 5.4833). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the pOH is -log[OH^-], which is 6 - 0.5167 =5.4833. So pH is 14-5.4833=8.5167. So about 8.52. So the pH at equivalence is about 8.52.

So putting it together, the pH at 25% is about 4.26 and equivalence is 8.52. So the correct option is A: 4.26; 8.52.

Wait, but wait, other options. Let me check, for example, option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, no. So option A seems correct.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the initial dilution of acetic acid. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³, and its concentration is 0.05 M. After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³. The moles of acetic acid remain the same, but the concentration decreases to:

\[
\text{Concentration of diluted acetic acid} = \frac{0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point occurs when the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid. The moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles of acetic acid}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{mL}.
\]

At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume (2.5 mL of NaOH) is added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH added} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]

and forms:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is now:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{mL} + 2.5 \, \text{mL} = 42.5 \, \text{mL} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{HA}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}\right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \), we calculate:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log\left(\frac{0.005882}{0.017647}\right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{A}^-] = \frac{\text{Moles of acetate ion}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( K_b \) for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the expression for \( K_b \):

\[
K_b = \frac{[OH^-]^2}{[\text{A}^-]} \implies [OH^-]^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{A}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
[OH^-] = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[OH^-] = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.483.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.483 = 8.517 \approx 8.52.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
