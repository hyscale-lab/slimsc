Alright, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's read it carefully.

Okay, so the question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. Because of these spots, when the star rotates, the observed brightness changes. The setup is such that this situation can look like an exoplanet causing brightness variations. The task is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as these spots do.

Hmm, wait. So if the star wasn't spotted, what exoplanet radius would give the same brightness change? So I need to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to that caused by an exoplanet transit.

First, I should calculate the brightness change due to the spots. Then, figure out the same change caused by a planet blocking part of the star's disk.

The star's radius is Rstar = Rsun. The spots are on one hemisphere, so the area of spots is 20% of half the star's surface. Wait, wait. The filling factor is 20%. So the total area covered by spots is 0.20 multiplied by the area of the hemisphere. Wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered, right? Because the star is a sphere, so each hemisphere is half the surface. But the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere. So the total area of spots is 0.2 (fraction) * (4πR²/2) ) = 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4 π R². Wait, no, wait. Let me think.

Wait, the star is a sphere. The total surface area is 4πR². The spots are on one hemisphere, and the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So the area is 0.20 * (2πR²) ) = 0.4 π R². So the total area covered is 0.4 π R².

Each spot is cooler, at Teff = 6000K - 1000K = 5000K? Wait, the problem says a temperature difference of 1000 K. So spots are 5000 K.

The brightness variation occurs because when the spots come into view, the star's total emitted light decreases. So the change in brightness is the difference between the normal flux and the flux with spots.

The star's total flux when unspotted is F_total = σ T_eff^4 × 4π R² / (4π D²) ), but wait, actually, when considering the flux from a star, it's given by F = σ T^4 multiplied by the area (but actually, the area is 4π R², but when it's at a distance D, the flux at distance D is F = (σ T^4 * 4π R²) )/(4π D²) )= σ T^4 (R^2/D^2). But since we're comparing relative brightness (like the change in flux), the distance D would cancel out
