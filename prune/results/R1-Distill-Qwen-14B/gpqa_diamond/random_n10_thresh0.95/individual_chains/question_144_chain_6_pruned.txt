Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime. Because particles decay over time, the distance they travel before decaying depends on their lifetime and the speed they're moving at. Oh right, the formula for the mean proper lifetime (τ) is h-bar times the decay width inverse, something like τ = ħ / Γ. And then the mean distance (L) would be L = βγcτ, where β is v/c and γ is the Lorentz factor.

So first, I need to calculate the lifetime τ. The decay width Γ is given as 320 MeV. But wait, I think Γ has units of energy, and when you take ħ divided by Γ, you get time. Let me think about the constants. Oh right, ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So Γ is 320 MeV which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is roughly 20.56875. So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds? Wait, wait, 6.582 divided by 0.32 is like 20.56? Let me do it more accurately: 0.32 times 20 is 6.4, so 0.32 * 20.56 is 6.58, so yeah, around 20.56. So 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = approx 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recalculate that. Oh, 6.582e-25 GeV·s divided by 0.32 GeV is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. So 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s. Wait, 20e-25 is 2e-24, so yeah, that's correct.

Next, I need to find the velocity β. The meson has energy E_X =8 GeV and mass m_X =1.2 GeV. The relativistic energy is E = γ m c². So γ = E/(m c²). Wait, but since E and m are both in GeV, perhaps we can calculate gamma as E/(m) in units where c=1? Well, let's think. In natural units where c=1, E (in GeV) equals gamma m (in GeV). So gamma is E / m = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Wait, yes. So γ is approximately 6.6667. Then, the velocity β is given by β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). Hmm, let me compute that. So 1/γ² is (1.2/8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887.

Alternatively, perhaps using a better approximation: For high gamma, beta approaches 1. But since gamma is around 6.6667, maybe beta is about 0.988. Let me calculate sqrt(0.9775). Let's see, sqrt(0.96) is 0.98, sqrt(0.9801) is 0.99. So 0.9775 is between 0.96 and 0.9801. Let me compute 0.988^2: 0.988 * 0.988 = (0.988)^2. Let's compute: 988 * 988 = (1000 - 12)^2 = 1000^2 - 2*1000*12 +12^2 = 1,000,000 -24,000 +144 = 976,144. So 0.988^2 is 0.976144. Hmm, but our target is 0.9775, which is higher. So 0.988^2=0.976144, which is less than 0.9775. So the square root of 0.9775 is a little higher than 0.988.

What's 0.9885^2? Let's compute (0.988 +0.0005)^2. It's approximately 0.988^2 + 2 *0.988 * 0.0005 + (0.0005)^2 = 0.976144 + 0.000988 + 0.00000025 = 0.97713225. Hmm, 0.97713225 is still lower than 0.9775. So let's try 0.9887. 0.9887^2: compute (0.988 +0.0007)^2. 0.988^2=0.976144. 2*0.988 *0.0007 = 0.0013832. And (0.0007)^2=0.00000049. So total is 0.976144 +0.0013832=0.9775272 plus 0.00000049=0.97752769. That's very close to 0.9775. So β is approximately 0.9887.

So β ≈ 0.9887. So then we can compute the mean decay distance L=βγ c τ.

Wait, but let me get all the values right. So τ is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Let's compute L.

Wait, but what's c in meters per second? Approximately 3e8 m/s.

So putting it all together: L = β * γ * c * τ.

Compute each part step by step.

First compute β * γ: 0.9887 * (8 / 1.2) ≈ 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ let's compute 0.9887 *6 =5.9322, 0.9887 * 0.6667≈0.9887 * (2/3)≈approx 0.659. So total is about 5.9322 + 0.659=6.5912.

So β * γ ≈6.5912.

Then multiply by c (3e8 m/s) and τ (2.056875e-24 s):

So 6.5912 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, let's compute this step by step.

First, 6.5912 *3e8 = 1.97736e9 m/s.

Then, multiply by τ: 1.97736e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s =1.97736e9 * 2.056875e-24.

Multiply the coefficients: 1.97736 * 2.056875 ≈ let's calculate that. 2 *2 is 4, but wait:

1.97736 *2 =3.95472. 1.97736 *0.056875 = approx 0.11228. So total is approximately 3.95472 +0.11228=4.067. So the product is about 4.067e-15 meters. Because 1e9 *1e-24 is 1e-15.

So L≈4.067e-15 meters. Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

So the closest is option B.

Wait, but perhaps I should be more precise with the calculations, especially with the values of gamma and beta. Maybe I approximated too much.

Let me re-calculate beta more accurately.

Gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... So gamma = 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

So gamma = 20/3.

Then, beta squared is 1 - (m²)/(E²) = 1 - ( (1.2)^2 )/(8^2 ) = 1 - (1.44)/(64) = 1 -0.0225= 0.9775.

So beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ Let me compute it more precisely.

Compute sqrt(0.9775).

Let me use linear approximation. Let me take x=0.9775.

We know that sqrt(0.96)=0.98, sqrt(0.9801)=0.99.

x=0.9775 is between 0.96 and 0.9801.

The function sqrt(x) can be approximated around a point a.

Let me take a=0.9801, where sqrt(a)=0.99.

Compute f(x) = sqrt(x) ≈ sqrt(a) + (x -a)/(2 sqrt(a)).

So x =0.9775, a=0.9801.

x - a = -0.0026.

sqrt(a)=0.99.

So f(x)=0.99 + (-0.0026)/(2 *0.99) =0.99 - 0.0026/(1.98)≈0.99 -0.001313=0.988687.

So beta≈0.988687.

So beta * gamma = 0.988687 * (20/3) ≈ 0.988687 *6.6666667.

Let me compute that:

0.988687 *6 =5.932122.

0.988687 *0.6666667 ≈0.988687 * (2/3)≈approx 0.6591247.

Total is 5.932122 + 0.6591247 ≈6.5912467.

So beta gamma is approximately 6.5912467.

Now, L = beta gamma c tau.

So c=3e8 m/s.

Tau is ħ/(Gamma) in seconds.

Gamma is 320 MeV =0.32 GeV.

So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32 ) * 1e-25 s.

6.582 /0.32 = let's compute:

0.32 * 20=6.4, so 6.582-6.4=0.182.

0.32 * 0.56875 =0.182 (because 0.32 *0.5=0.16, 0.32*0.06875=0.022, total 0.182).

So 6.582/0.32 =20 +0.56875=20.56875.

So tau=20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

So putting it all together:

L = beta gamma * c * tau.

So:

beta gamma =6.5912467.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So L=6.5912467 *3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute the product:

First, 6.5912467 *3e8 =1.977374e9 m/s.

Then, 1.977374e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply the numbers:

1.977374 *2.056875 ≈ Let's compute.

1.977374 *2 =3.954748.

1.977374 *0.056875.

0.056875 is 9/160 approximately, but exact calculation:

0.056875 *1.977374 ≈ 0.056875 *2=0.11375, but 1.977374 is 2 - 0.022626.

So 0.056875 * (2 - 0.022626) =0.11375 - 0.001291 ≈0.112459.

So total is 3.954748 +0.112459≈4.067207.

So 4.067207e-15 meters.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, perhaps a more precise calculation would get closer.

Wait, perhaps using more precise values for beta and gamma.

Wait, let me recompute beta with more precise sqrt(0.9775).

Another approach: Newton-Raphson method for square root.

We can compute sqrt(0.9775).

Let me denote y = sqrt(x), x=0.9775.

We can use the approximation for y near some a^2.

Let me take a=0.988, as earlier. Compute a^2=0.976144.

We have x=0.9775, a^2=0.976144. The difference is dx=0.001356.

We can use the linear approximation:

y ≈ a + dx/(2a).

So a=0.988, dx=0.001356.

So delta y =0.001356/(2*0.988)=0.001356/(1.976)= ~0.000686.

So y ≈0.988 +0.000686=0.988686.

Which matches our earlier approximation of 0.988687.

So beta=0.988686.

So beta gamma=0.988686 * (8/1.2)=0.988686 *6.6666667.

Compute 0.988686 *6 =5.932116.

0.988686 *0.6666667≈ 0.659124.

Wait, 0.988686 * (2/3)= (0.988686 *2)/3=1.977372/3≈0.659124.

So beta gamma=5.932116 + 0.659124=6.59124.

Exactly same as before.

So now, L is 6.59124 *3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 6.59124 *3e8 =1.977372e9 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s:

1.977372e9 *2.056875e-24 = (1.977372 *2.056875) *1e-15.

Compute 1.977372 *2.056875.

Let me compute this more accurately.

2 *2=4, but let's do it step by step.

1.977372 * 2.056875.

Break it down:

=1.977372 * (2 +0.05 +0.006875)

= (1.977372 *2) + (1.977372 *0.05) + (1.977372 *0.006875)

Compute each term:

1.977372 *2=3.954744.

1.977372 *0.05=0.0988686.

1.977372 *0.006875=?

0.006875 is 11/1600.

1.977372 *0.006875= (1.977372 * 11) / 1600.

1.977372 *11=21.751092.

Divided by 1600: 21.751092/1600≈0.0135944325.

So summing up all three:

3.954744 + 0.0988686 =4.0536126.

Add 0.0135944325 → 4.0536126 +0.0135944325≈4.067207.

So 4.067207e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. Perhaps the exact calculation would have a more precise value accounting for more decimal places in the constants.

Wait, perhaps using more precise values for ħ. I used 6.582e-25 GeV·s, but perhaps the exact value is 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. So if I use more precise constants, maybe I get a slightly different result.

Wait, let's compute tau again with more precise ħ.

Tau = ħ / Γ.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = (6.582×10^-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV = (6.582 /0.32 ) ×10^-25 s.

6.582 divided by 0.32 is 20.56875, so tau=20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

So that part is correct.

Another thing to
