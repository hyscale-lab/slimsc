Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my EDTA stuff, but let me try to work through it. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is present. Hmm. Let's see.

Alright, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. And the temperature is 25°C, which I think is standard, so maybe some constants are known. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant is a measure of how strong the complex is.

Wait, what do I know about EDTA complexes? EDTA, or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, is a ligand that binds metal ions. The complex here is Ca-EDTA. So the formula of the complex would be CaEDTA^2-. Oh right, because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, so each EDTA^4- ion can bind a metal ion.

The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. So the complex is formed, and we need to find [Ca²+]. The thought process involves using the formation constant, which relates the concentrations of the complex to the concentrations of the individual ions.

I think the formation constant (K) is given by the equation:

K = [CaEDTA²−] / ( [Ca²+] [EDTA⁴−] )

But wait, wait, no. Wait, EDTA is usually in the form of H4Y, and under certain pH conditions, it exists as Y^4−. So the formation constant is for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. So the K expression would be:

K = [CaEDTA²−] / ( [Ca²+] [EDTA^4−] )

But in this solution, the only species present are the Ca-EDTA complex and the dissociated calcium and EDTA. But since the solution is made by adding 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, I can assume that initially, [CaEDTA^2−] is 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4−] are negligible, but considering the K is large, the complex is stable, so the dissociation is very small.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: the total concentration is the sum of the concentration of the complex and the free calcium and EDTA. But since K is so large (5e10), the complex is very stable, meaning that the majority of EDTA is bound to Ca²+. So the assumption is that [CaEDTA²−] ≈ 0.02 M, and the free [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4−] are very small.

Wait, but wait again. The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So all the EDTA is in the form of CaEDTA²−, right? Because if the solution is only Ca-EDTA, then free EDTA would come from dissociation.

Wait no, that's not correct. The complex is formed, but a little dissociates. So the total concentration of EDTA comes from both the complex and the free EDTA. But since K is so big, the amount dissociated is negligible.

So, let me think. The total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M.

We can write the expression for K as:

K = [CaEDTA²−] / ( [Ca²+] [EDTA^4−] )

But since the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, and assuming that the dissociation is minimal, [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4−] will be equal because the reaction is 1:1. So let me denote x as [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4−] = x.

Then,

K = 0.02 / (x * x ) = 0.02 / x²

We can solve for x:

x² = 0.02 / K
x² = 0.02 / (5e10)
x² = 2e-3 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 = 4e-14

Wait, wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) ) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, let me calculate that again.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2)/(5e10) ) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * 1e-6.5? Hmm, wait, sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, right, because 6.5 *2 is 13.

So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5. Wait, but 1e-6.5 is the same as 3.16e-7, because 10^−6 is 1e-6, 10^−7 is 1e-7. So 10^−6.5 is sqrt(1e-13) = approx 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7.

Wait, but that would make x ≈ 6.32e-7 M. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7, which matches this.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: let me not make any assumptions. Let me write down all the variables.

Let’s let the concentration of Ca²+ be x. Since the complex is 0.02 M, and the reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−

The initial concentrations before dissociation:

[CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M (assuming all the complex is present), and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4−] are zero.

But after dissociation, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4−] = x, and [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 – x. But since K is so large (5e10), x will be very small compared to 0.02. So 0.02 – x ≈ 0.02.

So the K expression becomes:

K = [CaEDTA²−] / ( [Ca²+] [EDTA^4−] ) = 0.02 / (x * x ) = 0.02 / x².

So rearranging, x² = 0.02 / K → x² = (0.02) / (5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2.

So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → 2 * (1e-6.5) → 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7, so 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7 M.

So the concentration of Ca²+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7. So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, but wait. Another thought—could the problem be considering that the EDTA is in its deprotonated form? But the question says pH is ideal, so I think we can assume that all EDTA is in the Y^4- form, which is necessary for the formation constant.

So yeah, the calculation seems right. The free calcium concentration is about 6.3e-7 M.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant expression is:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}] [\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the total concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, we assume that the dissociation of the complex is minimal due to the large \( K \). Thus, \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\), and the dissociation equilibrium yields \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\).

Substituting into the formation constant expression:

\[
K = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}
\]

\[
10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7}, \quad x \approx 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which matches option C.

Answer: C
