Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

So, we have ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is along the x-axis. The wave function of each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Wait, but wave functions typically are complex numbers, right? So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is 0.5. Hmm.

The key detail is that when they measure the position of the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. Oh, wait, no, the question says none were found at x<1 and x>3. So particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. That means the wave function must be zero outside this interval. Oh wait, but wait, the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That implies that the wave function isn't zero outside 1<x<3. So maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is only defined in that region, and zero elsewhere. Because if the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3, then the probability of finding the particle elsewhere would be zero. So maybe the given expression is valid only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. Or maybe it's a normalized wave function.

Wait, the question says, "the wave function (from Schrodinger equation) of each particle, in a part of space where it can exist, can be described as..." So the part where it can exist is the region between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero outside that range. Therefore, the given expression is zero for x <1 and x>3, and the given function in between.

Wait, but the given function is (a /sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that seems to have both real and imaginary parts. But wave functions should be square-integrable, and for a stationary state, perhaps it's a real function, or a complex one. But wait, for a real wave function, the imaginary part should be zero.

Wait, maybe the given function is the function in the region where the particle can exist, and zero elsewhere. But wait, the imaginary part is 0.5i, so it's a constant imaginary term. That seems odd because when you integrate the square of the absolute value, you'd have |ψ|^2 = (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2. But if the wave function is zero outside 1<x<3, then the integral of |ψ|^2 from x=1 to x=3 should be 1 (since it's normalized). 

Wait, but the problem gives ψ(x) as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ(x) is a complex function. To find 'a', I probably need to normalize the wave function.

Wait, but if ψ(x) is zero outside 1<x<3, and in between, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, then the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 must be 1.

So |ψ(x)|² is [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) ]^2 + (0.5)^2. So integrating that from 1 to 3 should equal 1.

Wait, but wait, because the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So |ψ(x)|² is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 must be equal to 1.

So the integral would be the sum of two integrals: the integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus the integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

Let me compute each part.

First part: integral of (a²)/(1+x) from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ) ] = a² ln(2).

Second part: integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202.

Taking the square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. That seems close.

Wait, but let me double-check the setup. Oh wait, the wave function is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So in the region where the particle exists (1<x<3), the wave function is that, and zero elsewhere. So yes, the normalization condition is that the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx is 1.

So yes, the calculation is correct.

So a ≈ sqrt(0.5 / ln(2)) ≈ sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485, which is approximately 0.85. So the correct answer should be B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by normalizing the given wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

and the particle is restricted to the region \( 1 \leq x \leq 3 \). Outside this range, the wave function is zero. The normalization condition requires that the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over all space equals 1:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

Since \( \psi(x) \) is zero outside \( 1 \leq x \leq 3 \), the integral reduces to:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

The wave function is complex, so \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 \). Substituting this into the integral:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This splits into two integrals:

1. \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \),
2. \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx \).

For the first integral, the antiderivative of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \), so:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_1^3 = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2).
\]

For the second integral:

\[
\int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5.
\]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7202.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7202} \approx 0.8485.
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
