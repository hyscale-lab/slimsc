Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, while HIRES can observe brighter than 16 V mag. So, the stars need to have apparent V magnitudes less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES, right? Because lower magnitude means brighter.

But wait, actually, no. Wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO and "brighter than 16 mag" for HIRES. So the apparent magnitude (V) must be less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO to detect, and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. Because lower magnitudes are brighter. So a star must be brighter than 17 mag to be detected by ESPRESSO, meaning apparent V <=17. Similarly, for HIRES, apparent V <=16.

But wait, no, wait. Let me parse the wording again. It says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed", which means if a star's V is brighter (i.e., smaller than) 17. So, for detection, the apparent V must be ≤17 for ESPRESSO, and ≤16 for HIRES. So both spectrographs can detect the star only if its V is ≤16 (since 16 is brighter than 17), because then it's within both's capabilities. But wait, no, because if a star is, say, V=16, then it's observable by both. If it's V=17, only ESPRESSO can see it. So the star must have V ≤16 to be detected by both. Because HIRES can't go beyond 16.

Wait, let me think again. The question is asking which stars can be detected by both. So the star must be detectable by both instruments. So the star's apparent V mag has to be ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (for HIRES). So the more restrictive condition is apparent V ≤16. Because only then can both detect it.

Wait, no. Because if a star's V is 16.5, then for ESPRESSO (which goes up to 17), it's okay. But for HIRES, which only goes up to 16, it's too faint. So the star can be detected by ESPRESSO but not HIRES. So only stars with V ≤16 can be seen by both.

So to be detected by both, the apparent V magnitude must be ≤16.

Wait, but what about the other way around? Suppose a star's apparent magnitude is 16.5. Then ESPRESSO can detect it (since 16.5 <17), but HIRES can't (since 16.5 >16). So only ESPRESSO would see it. So the star must have V ≤16 to be detected by both.

Wait, but no, because if the star's V is exactly 16, it's detectable by both. If it's 16.5, only ESPRESSO can, but not HIRES.

So the correct approach is: for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16. So let's look at each star's apparent magnitude.

Now, each star has either an absolute magnitude (M) or an apparent magnitude (m). So we need to compute the apparent magnitude for those that have absolute magnitude, considering their distances and any extinction.

Wait, the question gives us some information about each star. Let's go through each one.

Star1: Absolute V magnitude is 15.5, located at 10 pc. So apparent magnitude m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in pc.

So d=10, so log10(10/10)=0. So m = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5. So apparent V is 15.5, which is less than 16. So it's detectable by both.

Star2: Apparent V is 16.5. So for ESPRESSO (17 mag limit), 16.5 is below 17, so detectable. For HIRES (16 limit), 16.5 is above 16, so not detectable. So this star can't be detected by both.

Star3: Apparent V is 15.5 mag, but there's E(B-V)=0.6. The question says total absorption in V is 3.1*(B-V). Wait, wait, no. Wait, E(B-V) is the color excess. The formula for extinction (A_v) is A_v = R * E(B-V), where R is about 3.1 (the standard value). So here, A_v = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag.

So the apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, but that's before extinction. Or wait, wait, the question says 'apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance, with E(B-V)=0.6'. Wait, is the apparent magnitude affected by extinction? Or is it the absolute magnitude?

Wait, I think the given V magnitude (apparent) is 15.5, but that's the observed (extincted) magnitude. Or is it the intrinsic magnitude? No, no. Let me re-read the question.

Star3: Apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) =0.6. So the observed apparent magnitude would be m_obs = m_true + A_v.

Wait, no. When a star is observed, the apparent magnitude is dimmed (so higher number) due to interstellar extinction (dust). So m_observed = m_true + A_v. So when they say Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5, that's after extinction, so m_observed = 15.5. So the true magnitude (without extinction) would be m_true = m_obs - A_v = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64? Wait, no, wait. Wait, if there's extinction, the observed magnitude is larger (since the star appears dimmer). So if the star's actual (intrinsic) m is m_true, then the observed m is m_obs = m_true + A_v.

But in Star3's case, the apparent V magnitude is already 15.5, which is the observed value. So to get the intrinsic m, it's m_true = 15.5 - A_v. Because extinction makes it appear dimmer (so m_obs is m_true + A_v). So if Star3's m_obs is 15.5, which is after extinction, then the intrinsic would be brighter. But wait, the question is about whether the observed V magnitude is within the limits.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think.

The apparent magnitude is what the star looks like from Earth, which includes any extinction. So for the spectrograph, the apparent magnitude (m) is the observed one. So when determining detectability, we use m_obs, which is already the value given. So for Star3, m_obs is 15.5. So both spectrographs can detect it, because 15.5 <16 and <17. So Star3 is detectable by both.

Wait, but wait: Star3's given data says 'apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag' and E(B-V)=0.6. But the way the question is worded, perhaps the apparent magnitude is given without considering extinction? Hmm, that's unclear.

Wait, the question says: For Star3, 'apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us.' So perhaps the 15.5 is the observed (extincted) magnitude. Because if the star's true magnitude is brighter, but due to extinction, the observed is dimmer.

Wait, but the extinction affects the apparent magnitude. So the question says, the apparent V is 15.5, but with E(B-V)=0.6, which would correspond to some extinction.

Wait, perhaps the 15.5 is the intrinsic magnitude, and we have to calculate the observed magnitude. But that's unclear. The question says, for Star3: 'apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag.' So perhaps the 15.5 is the observed apparent magnitude, including extinction.

Wait, but then why give E(B-V)? Because that's the reddening. Or perhaps the 15.5 is the absolute magnitude, not apparent. Let me check all the stars again.

Wait, no. Let's parse each star:

Star1: Abs V is 15.5, at 10 pc. So apparent would be M=15.5, d=10, so m = M +5log10(d/10) = 15.5 + 0 =15.5. So m is 15.5.

Star2: Apparent V 16.5, so no need to compute. E(B-V) is 0.4, but wait, no, Star2's E(B-V) is not given, only Star3 and Star4 have E(B-V) info.

So Star3: apparent V of 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, distance 15 pc.

Wait, but why is the E(B-V) given if the apparent magnitude is already given? Because perhaps the apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (without extinction) and we have to calculate the observed one. Or vice versa.

Wait, the question says for Star3, 'apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1.' So, perhaps the 15.5 is the intrinsic (unreddened) magnitude, and the observed apparent magnitude is higher due to extinction.

Wait, no. Because extinction causes the observed apparent magnitude to be larger (dimmer). So if the true apparent magnitude is m, the observed is m + A_v.

Wait, but the problem says that Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5, including extinction. Or is the 15.5 the true m, and the extinction makes it appear larger? Hmm, perhaps the question is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the observed one, so the extinction is already accounted for. In that case, Star3's m is 15.5, which is within both spectrographs. So detectable by both.

Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is without extinction, and we need to calculate the observed magnitude. So the actual m_obs = m_true + A_v.

In that case, for Star3:

m_true = 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6 → A_v =3.1 *0.6 =1.86.

So m_obs =15.5 + 1.86=17.36.

That would put Star3's m at 17.36, which is brighter (higher number) than 17. So ESPRESSO can't detect it (since it can go up to 17 mag). HIRES can't either, as 17.36>16.

Wait, but that would depend on whether the given m is the intrinsic or observed.

Wait, let's think: the question says for Star3, the apparent V is 15.5. But perhaps that is the intrinsic value, and the extinction affects it, making it appear dimmer. So the observed apparent magnitude is m_obs = m_true + A_v.

If that's the case, then m_obs =15.5 + 1.86=17.36.

Which is beyond both instruments' limits. So Star3's m_obs=17.36, which is above ESPRESSO's 17 limit (so can't be detected). So in that case, Star3 would not be detectable by either.

But this is confusing. Let me think again.

The key is whether the given apparent magnitude includes extinction or not. In astronomy, when someone gives the apparent magnitude, it's usually the observed value, including extinction. So when the question says Star3's apparent V is 15.5, that's the observed m, so no need to add extinction.

In that case, Star3's m_obs is 15.5, which is within both spectrographs. So detectable by both.

But wait, another possibility: the apparent magnitude given is the true magnitude (without considering extinction), so the observed is higher. So for Star3, m_true=15.5. E(B-V)=0.6 → A_v=3.1*0.6=1.86. So m_obs=15.5+1.86=17.36. Which is above both's limits. So Star3 couldn't be detected by either.

But which interpretation is correct?

The question says, for Star3: 'apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us.'

Hmm. The wording says 'apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag'—so that's the observed value, so including extinction. So we don't need to add anything. So Star3's m is 15.5, which is less than 16 and 17. So it's detectable by both.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should proceed and see how the other stars look.

Star4: Absolute V magnitude 15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, distance 10 pc.

So M =15.5.

Compute apparent magnitude without extinction: m = M +5 log10(d/10) =15.5 +5*(log(10/10))=15.5 +0=15.5.

But we have E(B-V)=0.4 → A_v=3.1*0.4=1.24. So the observed apparent magnitude, m_obs, is m_true + A_v =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So m_obs=16.74. Which is above HIRES's limit of 16, but below ESPRESSO's 17. So ESPRESSO can detect it, but HIRES cannot. So Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, not both.

So for Star4, m_obs=16.74>16 → HIRES can't detect it. So Star4 can't be detected by both.

Star5: Absolute V mag 16.5, distance 5 pc.

Compute apparent magnitude without extinction: m = M +5 log10(d/10) =16.5 +5*(log10(5/10)).

log10(0.5)= -0.3010.

So m=16.5 +5*(-0.3010) =16.5 -1.505 =14.995≈15. So m_true=15.

Assuming no extinction, m_obs=15.

But what about extinction? The question doesn't mention E(B-V) for Star5, so I think we can assume extinction is zero. So m_obs=15.

So m=15, which is less than both 16 and 17. So both spectrographs can detect Star5.

Wait, but Star5's absolute magnitude is 16.5. So with d=5, m=16.5 +5*(log10(5/10))=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5-1.505=14.995, so about 15.

So apparent V is 15, so detectable by both.

Wait, but wait. Star5's M is 16.5, distance 5 pc. So m = M +5 log10(5/10) =16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995, which is ~15. So apparent V is 15, which is under both 16 and 17. So detectable by both.

So now, let's recap:

Star1: m_obs=15.5 → detectable by both.

Star2: m_obs=16.5 → detectable only by ESPRESSO.

Star3: m_obs=15.5 → detectable by both.

Star4: m_obs=16.74 → detectable only by ESPRESSO.

Star5: m_obs=15 → detectable by both.

Wait, but earlier for Star3, I was confused about whether to add the extinction. But under the assumption that the given apparent magnitude includes extinction, Star3's m is 15.5, so detectable by both.

Alternatively, if the given apparent magnitude is without extinction and must be adjusted, then Star3's m_obs would be 15.5+1.86=17.36, which is too faint for HIRES. So Star3 wouldn't be detectable by either.

But the question explicitly says that for Star3, the apparent V is 15.5, so I think that's the observed value, so no need to add extinction. Thus, Star3 is within both.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → no, Star4 can't be detected by both.

B) Star3 and Star5 → yes, both detectable by both.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't be detected by both.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be detected by both.

Wait, but wait, Star1's m is 15.5, which is under both's limits. So Star1 is detectable by both.

So the stars detectable by both are Star1, Star3, Star5.

Looking at the options, the options are A, B, C, D. Let's look:

Option B is Star3 and Star5. Both are detectable by both.

Option D is Star1 and Star4: Star1 is detectable, but Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

Option B is an option. So the correct answer would be stars that are detectable by both, so Star3 and Star5. So option B.

Wait, but Star5 is also detectable by both, as m=15. So which stars are in both detectable by both instruments?

Star1, Star3, Star5.

Looking at the options, the only option that includes both of these is if the option includes any two of them.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both detectable.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that includes all three. The options are pairs. So the question is, which pair can be detected by both.

So the possible pairs are:

Star1 and Star3 → both detectable by both.

Star1 and Star5 → both detectable by both.

Star3 and Star5 → both detectable.

So, looking at the options:

A) 4 and5 → no.

B)3 and5 → yes.

C)2 and3→ no.

D)1 and4→ no.

So the correct answer is option B, which is Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check Star5.

Star5: M=16.5, d=5 pc. So m= M +5 log10(5/10) = 16.5 +5*(log0.5)=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5-1.505≈15.

So m_obs=15, which is under both's limits. So yes, detectable by both.

Star3: m_obs=15.5 → detectable by both.

So the pair is Star3 and Star5. So option B is the correct choice.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤17, while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤16. Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detectable by both spectrographs.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5 \).  
   - \( m = 15.5 \leq 16 \), so Star1 is detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 16.5 \).  
   - \( m = 16.5 > 16 \), so Star2 is detectable only by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \), distance \( d = 15 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - The total absorption in the V band is \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.6 = 1.86 \).  
   - The observed apparent magnitude \( m_{\text{obs}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36 \).  
   - \( m_{\text{obs}} = 17.36 > 17 \), so Star3 is not detectable by either spectrograph.

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent magnitude without extinction \( m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5 \).  
   - Total absorption \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24 \).  
   - Observed apparent magnitude \( m_{\text{obs}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 \).  
   - \( m_{\text{obs}} = 16.74 > 16 \), so Star4 is detectable only by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent magnitude \( m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \times (-0.3010) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15 \).  
   - No extinction is mentioned, so \( m_{\text{obs}} = m = 15 \).  
   - \( m_{\text{obs}} = 15 \leq 16 \), so Star5 is detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

### Conclusion:
- Stars detectable by both spectrographs are **Star1**, **Star3**, and **Star5**.  
- Among the options provided, only **Star3 and Star5** are detectable by both spectrographs.

**Answer: B**
