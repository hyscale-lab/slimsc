Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out. Let me read through it carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and after a series of reactions, I need to determine the final product. The options are A to D.

First, let's look at the NMR data. The question gives the 1H-NMR spectrum in ppm:

- 9.72 (t, 1H)
- 6.98 (d, 2H)
- 6.51 (d, 2H)
- 6.27 (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 (d, 2H)

Hmm, okay. Let me think about each of these signals.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Wait, no, wait. Wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm and as a singlet. But here it's a triplet, which is a bit unusual. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic proton adjacent to something else. Or perhaps it's a vinylic proton. Alternatively, could it be an acidic proton like from an enol or something else?

Wait, another thought: if there's an aldehyde group, the proton would typically be a singlet because it's only attached to one carbon. But here it's a triplet, maybe coupling with two neighboring protons? Or maybe it's not an aldehyde. Let me think again.

Looking at the other signals: 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets, each integrating to 2H. These might be aromatic protons, perhaps in a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are typically as two doublets, each with integral 2. For example, if there are two substituents on the benzene ring, maybe two substituents in para positions, but that's just one possibility.

The 6.27 peak is a broad singlet with 2H. Broad means perhaps exchange with something, like an acidic proton or maybe a vinylic proton in a conjugated system. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic ring with some substituent that causes the protons to be deshielded, but the broadness suggests maybe it's an -OH group or something else that's exchanging.

Then there's 3.66 ppm, a doublet with 2H. That's in the range of, say, a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2CH2... or maybe a methylene group next to an electronegative atom like oxygen. For example, in an alkoxy group, or perhaps next to a carbonyl.

Putting this together, perhaps it's a molecule with a benzene ring and another ring or substituent.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C8H9NO:

C =8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be from one ring (benzene, which is 3 degrees) plus maybe a carbonyl group (another degree) and a double bond or another ring (but let's see).

Wait, benzene is three degrees (three double bonds). Plus a carbonyl is another, and maybe a double bond. Alternatively, maybe a benzene ring and another ring, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, let's think of possible structures. The NMR suggests some aromatic protons, an aldehyde maybe, and some CH2 groups.

Wait, another thought: the triplet at 9.72 could be a vinylic proton. Like in an enal (alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde). The vinylic protons are around 5-7 ppm, but wait, 9.72 is higher. So maybe not.

Wait, the triplet at 9.72 ppm is a triplet, which implies two neighboring protons. So perhaps it's next to a CH2 group. Like an aldehyde next to a CH2, but that seems unlikely because aldehydes are typically at the end. Alternatively, maybe it's part of an enamine? Or maybe it's an enol? Hmm, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe the 9.72 is an aldehyde proton, but why is it a triplet? Maybe it's coupling with two protons from adjacent carbons. For example, if the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group, which would have two protons. That would give a triplet for the aldehyde proton. Wait, but that would require a structure where the aldehyde is connected to a CH2, but aldehydes are RCHO, so R would be CH2... Let me think. If you have CH2-CHO, then the aldehyde proton would couple with the two protons on the CH2. So the aldehyde H would see two protons, giving a triplet. Oh, that makes sense! So the aldehyde proton is next to a CH2 group, which is why it's a triplet. So that's probably the case.

So let's think of a structure where there's a CH2CHO group. Also, the CH2 would be next to the aldehyde.

Looking at the other NMR signals:

- The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm are each two H as doublets. So perhaps a para-substituted benzene ring. So maybe the molecule is something like benzaldehyde attached to a chain that includes a CH2 group, but this is getting a bit vague.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me try drawing a possible structure.

Considering that, perhaps the structure is a diphenyl compound. Wait, but the formula is C8H9NO. Let's see: if it's a benzene ring (C6H5) attached to a CH2 group, but then the rest would be CH2CHO or something similar.

Wait, alternatively, let's think about the substituents. Another approach: the NMR has two doublets around 6.98 and 6.51. That could be a para-substituted benzene, so perhaps the substituent is an -OCH2CHO group or something like that.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a diphenylbutanal or something similar.

Wait, another thought: the 6.27 ppm, broad singlet (2H) could be an enol proton or perhaps an -OH group. Or maybe a vinyl group next to an oxygen, like in a conjugated system.

Wait, let me think about the reactions given. The reagents are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl
2. H2O
3. aq. KOH, Heat

These steps are usually for diazotization, hydrolysis, and then perhaps some elimination or other reaction.

Wait, first reaction: NaNO2 and HCl is typically for diazotization. So the starting compound must have an amine group. Because diazotization is for aryl amines or aliphatic amines. But after that, the next steps are hydrolysis (H2O), then KOH and heat.

Wait, let me think: if the starting material has an aromatic amine group (-NH2), then diazotization (step 1) would convert it to a diazonium salt. Then, in H2O (step 2), perhaps it undergoes hydrolysis to form a phenol. Then, with KOH and heat (step 3), maybe some elimination or substitution occurs.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO, which includes an O. So perhaps the starting compound is an aniline derivative, which upon diazotization and hydrolysis would become a phenol.

Wait, but the starting NMR doesn't show any -NH2 protons, so perhaps the starting material doesn't have an NH2 group. Alternatively, maybe it's a secondary amine, but that's less common for diazotization. Hmm, maybe I should think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has an alcohol group, but that doesn't fit with the first step being diazotization. Hmm. Wait, maybe the starting material has a nitro group, but that's not reacting in the first step. Alternatively, maybe the N is in another functional group, like an amide or something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me try to think about the possible structure of the starting material based on NMR.

So, the signals are:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): likely an aldehyde proton adjacent to a CH2 group.
- 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H): para-substituted benzene rings.
- 6.27 (bs, 2H): maybe an enol proton (like in a conjugated dienol) or an -OH group.
- 3.66 (d, 2H): a CH2 group next to an O, perhaps OCH2.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the carbons.

Suppose the structure includes a benzene ring (6 carbons), then a CH2 group, then perhaps a carbonyl group (CHO). Wait, benzene (6C), CH2 (1C), CHO (1C) would be 8C, but wait: 6 (benzene) + 2 (CH2) + 1 (CHO) = 9C? Hmm, no, that's more than 8. So perhaps it's not a simple benzaldehyde substituent.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Suppose we have a benzene ring substituted with a group that's -CH2-CHO. But that would be two more carbons beyond the benzene, making 8 carbons in total (6 from benzene, 2 from CH2-CHO). Wait, benzene is 6 carbons, CH2CHO is 3 carbons (CH2-CHO is 3 carbons?), no: CH2 is one, CHO is one, so that's two carbons beyond the benzene. Wait, 6 + 2 = 8, which matches the formula.

But wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So the benzene (C6H5) would have formula C6H5, then the substituent would be CH2CHO, which is
