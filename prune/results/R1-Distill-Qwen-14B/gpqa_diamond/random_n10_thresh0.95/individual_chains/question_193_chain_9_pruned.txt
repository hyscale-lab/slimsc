Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And they're asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each with a different power of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift of a star's position as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I know is that distance in parsecs is equal to 1 over the parallax in arcseconds. So, distance d = 1 / plx. That means plx is inversely proportional to distance.

The question says the number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down: Number of stars N = k / (plx)^5, where k is some constant. Since I need to relate this to distance, I can substitute plx with d. Because plx = 1/d. So, replacing plx with 1/d, N becomes k / ( (1/d)^5 ). Let's compute that.

(1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so 1 over that is d^5. So, N is proportional to d^5. Wait, no, wait. Let me do the substitution step by step.

plx = 1/d, so plx^5 = (1/d)^5 = 1/d^5. Then, 1/(plx^5) is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how N changes with distance—per unit range of distance. So, they probably want the differential of N with respect to d, like dN/dr, to see how it scales with d.

Let me think. So N is proportional to d^5. If I take the derivative of N with respect to d, dN/dd = 5 d^4. But the question isn't asking for the derivative, it's asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So perhaps it's looking for the trend of N as d increases.

Wait, no, the wording is a bit ambiguous. The way the question is phrased: "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So, maybe it's about how N depends on d. Because the initial statement is N varies as 1/(plx)^5, and since plx is 1/d, N is proportional to d^5. So, as distance increases, N increases with d^5. But wait, that might not make sense because in reality, for a given region, the number of stars you can observe should decrease with distance beyond a certain point. But in this problem, they're giving a specific relation, so we have to go with that.

Wait, but wait again. Let me think about what the question is really asking. The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So, when parallax increases, the number of stars decreases. But parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So when distance increases, parallax decreases, which would make 1/plx^5 increase. So the number of stars would go up as distance goes up. But that seems counterintuitive—shouldn't stars be farther and fewer? Hmm, but perhaps this is a theoretical scenario where the number of stars actually increases with distance for some reason. So, in this case, the number of stars N is proportional to (1/plx)^5, which is (d)^5, since plx is 1/d. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how N changes with distance, the dependence. So if N ∝ d^5, then for a small change in distance dr, the change in N would be dN = 5 d^4 dr. So the number of stars per unit distance would be dN/dr = 5 d^4, which is proportional to d^4. But the question says "per unit range of distance, r"—so perhaps they are asking for the number of stars per unit distance, which would be dN/dr. So according to this, dN/dr ∝ d^4. Looking at the options, option C is ~ r^4, so that would be the answer.

Wait, but another approach: maybe the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr is what's being considered. The number of stars would depend on the volume of that shell, but perhaps here the relation is given as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. So, maybe I should think in terms of the volume or something else. But the problem states that N varies as 1/plx^5, regardless of other factors.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. Since N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx = 1/d, then substituting gives N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power
