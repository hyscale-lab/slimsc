Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

So, the problem says one astronaut has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, while the other is 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one. 

Wait, the first part is the relative speed between them, and the second is the total energy of the system. I remember that in relativity, adding velocities isn't as straightforward as classical mechanics. Oh right, you can't just add them like 0.6c + 0.5c because that would exceed the speed of light, which isn't possible.

So, to find the relative speed, I think I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is v_rel = (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), where u is the velocity of one object as seen from the other's frame. Wait, no, wait. Actually, I'm getting confused. Let me think. If both are moving in the same direction, perhaps I should consider the frame of one astronaut and find the speed of the other relative to him.

Wait, the astronaut with mass 2m is moving at 0.6c, and the other (3m) is moving at 0.5c. So from the perspective of the 2m astronaut, the 3m astronaut is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) relative to him? No, wait, that would be negative, but velocities aren't just subtracted directly. So using the velocity addition formula.

Wait, the formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Let me clarify: if frame S is the rest frame of the 2m astronaut, then the 3m astronaut is moving at u = 0.5c. The 2m astronaut is at rest in S, so in the 3m astronaut's frame S', what is the speed of the 2m astronaut?

Wait no, the problem asks for the relative speed between the two as observed from one of their frames. Wait, but which one? Or do I need to compute the relative speed as one would see the other moving? Hmm, perhaps better to consider the relative velocity of the 3m astronaut as seen from the 2m astronaut's frame. Let's proceed.

So, in S (the 2m astronaut's frame), the 3m astronaut is moving at u = 0.5c in the positive x-direction. The 2m astronaut is at rest, so the relative speed is the speed of the 3m astronaut in S. Wait, no, that would just be 0.5c. But that can't be it because the options don't have 0.5c. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting confused about which frame is which.

Wait, maybe I should compute the relative speed as observed from the 3m astronaut's frame. So, in the 3m astronaut's frame, the 2m astronaut is moving at what speed?

Wait, let's get this straight. Let me denote the 2m astronaut as A and the 3m as B. From the Earth frame, A is moving at 0.6c, and B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame (S), B is moving at u = 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c, but that's in the negative direction. Wait, but that can't be right because the velocity addition formula is more complicated than that. Because in relativity, velocities don't simply add like that.

Wait, no, in the Earth frame, A is moving at 0.6c, B at 0.5c. So to find the speed of B as seen from A's frame, we use the velocity addition formula. Let me recall the formula correctly. The formula is: if an object has velocity u in the Earth frame, and Earth is moving at velocity v in the frame of A (so v is 0.6c), then the object's velocity u' in A's frame is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²).

Wait, wait. Let me think. If Earth is moving at velocity v = 0.6c in A's frame (since A is moving at 0.6c in Earth's frame, so Earth's frame is moving at -0.6c in A's frame, but maybe I got that reversed. Hmm. Alternatively, when you have two frames S and S', where S' is moving at velocity v relative to S, the velocity u' observed in S' is given by (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²).

So, in Earth's frame, B is moving at u = 0.5c. Now, what is B's velocity in A's frame? Since A is moving at v = 0.6c in Earth's frame, so in A's frame, Earth is moving at -0.6c. So, the velocity u' of B in A's frame is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²) = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Calculating numerator: -0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So u' = (-0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ -0.142857 c, which is approximately -0.14c. So the relative speed is the magnitude, which is 0.14c. That's one of the options, like option C or D.

Wait, but I thought that B is moving slower than A, so from A's perspective, B would be moving backward at 0.14c? Or wait, in Earth's frame, both are moving in the same direction, but A is moving faster. So from A's perspective, B is moving in the opposite direction, hence negative velocity. But the question just asks for the relative speed, which is magnitude, so 0.14c. So that's the relative speed.

Now, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has their own relativistic energy, so the total energy would be the sum of their rest energies plus their kinetic energies.

Wait, no. Wait, the rest energy is mc^2. So for a moving object, the total energy is gamma times mc^2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. So let's compute gamma for each astronaut.

For astronaut A (mass 2m, velocity 0.6c):

gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy of A is E_A = gamma_A * (2m) c^2 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the rest energy is m c², so for A, it's (2m) c². So the total energy is gamma * (2m) c².

But I've heard that the total energy is gamma times mc^2, so for each astronaut, it's gamma * (mass) * c^2.

So for A: gamma_A = 1.25, mass_A = 2m. So E_A = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B (mass 3m, velocity 0.5c):

gamma_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E_B = gamma_B * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So the total energy of the system would be E_A + E_B ≈ 2.5 m c² + 3.464 m c² ≈ 5.964 m c², which is about 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C is v_rel = 0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2. So that matches.

Wait, but another thought: when they are moving in the same frame, is the total energy just the sum of their energies in that frame? Or do I need to consider a different frame?

Wait, the problem states "the total energy of the system." The system would consist of both astronauts, so the total energy would be the sum of their energies in the same frame. So, if we are in Earth's frame, compute each energy and sum them.

Yes, that's correct. Because from Earth's frame, each astronaut has their own kinetic energy, so the total energy is the sum of their energies in that frame.

So E_total = E_A + E_B in Earth's frame.

E_A is gamma_A * 2m c², E_B is gamma_B * 3m c².

As computed earlier, E_A is 2.5, E_B is approximately 3.464. Summing gives about 5.964, which is 5.96 mc². So option C says E=5.96 mc², and the relative speed is 0.14c.

So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system based on the given data.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed between the two astronauts is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u = 0.5c \) (velocity of the 3m astronaut in Earth's frame),
- \( v = 0.6c \) (velocity of the 2m astronaut in Earth's frame).

Substituting the values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1429c
\]

The negative sign indicates that the 3m astronaut appears to move backward relative to the 2m astronaut. The relative speed is the magnitude:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

#### For the 2m astronaut (velocity \( 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the 3m astronaut (velocity \( 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c \),
- The total energy is \( E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2 \).

This matches **Option C**, which states \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \) and \( E_{\text{total}} = 5.96m c^2 \).

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
