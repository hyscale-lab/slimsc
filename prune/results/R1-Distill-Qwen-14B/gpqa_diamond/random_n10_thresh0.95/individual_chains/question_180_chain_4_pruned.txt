Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their mass is negligible. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm. So, I remember that in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of charges is related to the work done to bring them together. And since the system is isolated and we’re looking for minimum energy, I think this is about finding the potential energy configuration.

Wait, wait. All charges are 2e. So each has a charge of 2 times the elementary charge, which is 2 * 1.6e-19 coulombs, so 3.2e-19 C each.

Now, the setup: 12 charges are at 2 meters from point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the 13th is at the center, and the other 12 are arranged on a sphere of radius 2 meters around it.

Wait, wait. Since the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P, that means each is at a distance of 2 meters from P. So the 13th is at P, so each of the other 12 is 2 meters away from it. So the distance between the 13th charge and each of the 12 is 2 meters.

But wait, the 12 charges are all at the same distance from P, but are they arranged in a particular way? Like, perhaps equally spaced on a sphere. But since they're identical charges, their mutual repulsion would determine the configuration. But since the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2m, maybe their arrangement doesn't affect the potential energy calculation because all that matters is the distance from the fixed charge.

Hmm. So the system has two types of interactions contributing to the potential energy: between the 13th charge (fixed at P) and each of the 12 charges, and between each pair of the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but since potential energy is a property of the entire system, the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So we have to calculate the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12, plus the potential energy between each of the 12 and each other.

Wait, but wait a second. The potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Since all charges are 2e, each is 2e. So the fixed charge is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e. So for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy between the fixed charge and that one is U1 = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m). Wait, but wait, no, no. Wait the distance between the fixed charge (at P) and each of the 12 is 2m. So, U1 for each pair is (k * (2e)^2) / (2 m). But wait, but wait, wait—no, no. Wait, the charges are each 2e, so q1 is 2e, q2 is 2e. So each pair contributes (k * (2e)^2) / (2 m). So for each of the 12, that's 12 * [ (k * (2e)^2) / (2 m) ].

Wait, but wait. Also, the 12 charges are each 2e, and each pair among them contributes some potential energy. So for the 12 charges arranged on a sphere of radius 2m, each pair is separated by a certain distance. But if they're all at the same distance from P, but not necessarily from each other, that complicates things. Wait, but in reality, the mutual distances between the 12 charges would vary. But perhaps the problem assumes that all the 12 are at a mutual distance where they form a regular dodecahedron or something, but that's complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the 12 are arranged in such a way that each is at 2m from P but their mutual distances are not given. Hmm, that's a problem because without knowing their mutual distances, we can't compute the potential energy between them.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So perhaps they're all on a sphere of radius 2m, but their exact arrangement isn't specified. But I'm supposed to find the minimum energy. Maybe the minimum energy occurs when the 12 charges are as far apart as possible, which would be when they're arranged in a way that minimizes repulsion, but that's not quite right because all are the same. Alternatively, perhaps the minimum potential energy would be when the charges are as close as possible, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the potential energy between two charges is positive if they're like charges, which they are here. So bringing them closer would increase the potential energy, but in this case, the 12 are fixed at 2m from P, but their mutual distances could vary. Hmm. But perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are placed in such a way that all mutual distances are 2m as well, but that doesn't make sense
