--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled with the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator models, but this says the non-rigid rotor, so maybe it's a bit different. Wait, non-rigid rotor might mean it allows for some stretching, but I'm not too sure. 

The question is about the fundamental state and the photon's momentum needed to switch to the next lowest state. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, when a molecule absorbs a photon, it transitions between energy levels. So I need to find the energy difference between the current state and the next, then relate that to the photon's momentum.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. Fundamental state usually refers to the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). But wait, the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So it's considering either a vibrational or rotational transition. Since the question mentions switching to the next state, which is the lowest possible, it's probably the first excited state, which could be either a change in J or a change in v.

Wait, the model is the rotation-vibration model, so both rotational and vibrational energies are considered. The fundamental state is the state with the lowest energy, which would be v=0, J=0. The next possible state could be either v=1 (vibrational excitation) or J=1 (rotational excitation). But which transition requires less energy? Because the photon's momentum is related to the energy difference.

I need to calculate the energy differences for both possible transitions and see which one is lower. The photon with the corresponding energy would have the momentum needed.

So first, let's think about the vibrational energy. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as:
E_v = (v + 1/2) h w
So the fundamental state is v=0, E_0 = (0 + 1/2) h w = (1/2) h w.
The first excited vibrational state is v=1, E_1 = (3/2) h w.
The energy difference ΔE_vib = E_1 - E_0 = h w.

For the rotational energy, the levels are given by:
E_J = B J (J + 1)
Where B is the rotational constant. The fundamental state is J=0, E_0 = 0. The next rotational state is J=1, E_1 = B * 1 * 2 = 2B.
So the energy difference is ΔE_rot = 2B.

Now, the question is whether the next state is a vibrational or rotational transition. Because the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next possible state in energy could be either J=1 (rotational) or v=1 (vibrational). So I need to compare the energies for these transitions.

So I should calculate both ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot, and see which one is smaller. The smaller energy would require a lower photon energy, so the photon momentum needed would correspond to that.

Let me compute both.

First, compute B for the rotational constant. B is given by (h)/(8 π² I c), but wait, I'm a bit confused. No, the rotational constant B is (h)/(8 π² I c) I think. Alternatively, sometimes it's given as ħ²/(2 I), but I need to get the right formula.

Wait, let me think again. The rotational energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant given by B = (ħ²)/(2 I), where I is the moment of inertia. Hmm, yes, that sounds right. I is the moment of inertia, which for a diatomic is I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

Wait, okay. So the moment of inertia I is μ r². And μ is (m_x m_y)/(m_x + m_y). So let's calculate that.

Given:
Mx = 20 amu
My = 2 amu
Bond length r = 2 angstroms. I should convert that to meters.

Wait, 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So r = 2e-10 m.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 /22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but I need to convert this to kg because the units for I are in SI units.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ let's calculate that.

1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ let's see:

1.8 * 1.66 is about 2.988e-27 kg. Wait,

1.818 * 1.6605 = ?

Well, 1.8 * 1.66 = approximately 2.988. Let me do it more accurately.

1.818 * 1.6605 = 

Let me compute:

1.818 * 1.6605:

1.818 * 1 = 1.818

1.818 * 0.6 = 1.0908

1.818 * 0.06 = 0.10908

1.818 * 0.0005 = 0.000909

Adding them up:

1.818 + 1.0908 = 2.9088

+ 0.10908 → 3.01788

+ 0.000909 → ≈3.01879 kg.

Wait, no, wait: 1.818 * 1.6605 is actually (approximated) 3.0188e-27 kg.

So μ ≈ 3.0188e-27 kg.

I = μ r² = 3.0188e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10 m)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.0188e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.2075e-46 kg m².

Now, B is ħ²/(2 I). ħ is h-bar, which is h/(2π). Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 6.626e-34 / 6.283 ≈ 1.054e-33 J·s.

So B = (ħ²)/(2 I) → ( (1.054e-33)^2 ) / (2 * 1.2075e-46 )

Compute numerator: (1.054e-33)^2 ≈ 1.11e-66 (since 1e-33 squared is 1e-66).

Denominator: 2 * 1.2075e-46 ≈ 2.415e-46.

So B = 1.11e-66 / 2.415e-46 ≈ (1.11 / 2.415 )e-20 ≈ 0.46e-20 → 4.6e-21 J.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation:

Wait, 1.054e-33 squared is:

(1.054e-33)^2 = (1.054)^2 * (1e-33)^2 = 1.1109 * 1e-66 = 1.1109e-66.

Denominator: 2 * 1.2075e-46 = 2.415e-46.

So B = 1.1109e-66 / 2.415e-46 = (1.1109 / 2.415) ) * 1e-20.

1.1109 / 2.415 ≈ 0.46.

So B ≈ 0.46e-20 J → 4.6e-21 J.

Wait, but what's the rotational energy difference between J=0 and J=1?

E_J=0 is 0, E_J=1 is 2B. So ΔE_rot = 2B = 2 * 4.6e-21 J = 9.2e-21 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference is ΔE_vib = h w.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s. Angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

So ΔE_vib = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Now, comparing the two energy differences: ΔE_rot is 9.2e-21 J and ΔE_vib is 2.65e-19 J.

Which is smaller? 9.2e-21 is smaller than 2.65e-19. So the rotational transition requires less energy. Therefore, the photon would need to have that lower energy to cause the transition.

Wait, but wait a second. The molecule is in the fundamental state, which is both v=0 and J=0. So the next state with the lowest possible energy could be either J=1 or v=1. Which one has lower energy difference?

Yes, that's correct. The rotational transition (J=1) requires less energy, so the photon should have that energy. So the energy of the photon (E_photon) should be equal to ΔE_rot = 9.2e-21 J.

Now, the question is about the photon's momentum. Since E = p c, where p is momentum and c is speed of light, but wait, actually, for photons, E = pc, because their mass is zero. So p = E / c.

Wait, E = h f, and since c = f λ, but for momentum, p = E/c.

So p = E_photon / c.

So let's compute that.

E_photon = 9.2e-21 J.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.2e-21 J / 3e8 m/s = (9.2 /3 )e-29 kg m/s.

But wait, 9.2e-21 divided by 3e8 is (9.2/3) * 1e-29.

9.2/3 ≈ 3.0667.

So p ≈3.0667e-29 kg·m/s.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

Wait, 9.2e-21 / 3e8 = (9.2 /3) * 1e-29 → approximately 3.0667e-29 kg·m/s.

But wait, looking at the options:

Options are in the range of 1e-28 to 2e-27 N s.

Wait, because 1 N s = 1 kg m/s.

So 3.0667e-29 kg m/s is 3.0667e-29 N·s.

But looking at the options, the smallest option is A) 1.9e-28, which is about 19 times larger than 3e-29.

Hmm, so none of the options match my calculation. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the rotational constant B. Let me re-examine the steps.

Alternatively, could I have made a mistake in calculating the moment of inertia?

Wait, let's recalculate the moment of inertia.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

In kg: 1.81818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu.

So 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 = let's compute:

1.81818 * 1.6605 = ?

Let me calculate:

1.81818 * 1 = 1.81818

1.81818 * 0.6 = 1.090908

1.81818 * 0.06 = 0.1090908

1.81818 * 0.0005 = 0.00090909

Adding them up:

1.81818 + 1.090908 = 2.909088

+ 0.1090908 = 3.0181788

+ 0.00090909 ≈ 3.01908789.

So approximately 3.01908789e-27 kg.

Oh wait, wait, no: 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg, so 1.81818 amu is 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27.

Wait, 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 = ?

Let me compute 1.81818 * 1.6605.

1.81818 * 1.6605:

Let me do 1.81818 *1.6605.

Let me compute it as:

1.81818 * 1 = 1.81818

1.81818 * 0.6 = 1.090908

1.81818 *0.06 = 0.1090908

1.81818 *0.0005= 0.00090909

Adding them: 1.81818 + 1.090908 = 2.909088.

+ 0.1090908 → 3.0181788.

+ 0.00090909 → 3.01908789.

So 3.01908789e-27 kg.

So μ ≈3.0191e-27 kg.

r = 2e-10 m, so I =μ r² = 3.0191e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 is 4e-20 m².

So I =3.0191e-27 *4e-20 = 1.20764e-46 kg m².

Now, B = ħ²/(2I).

ħ = h/(2π) → h=6.626e-34, so ħ ≈ 1.05457e-33 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.05457e-33)^2 = approx 1.112e-66 (J·s)^2.

So B = (1.112e-66) / (2 * 1.20764e-46) = 1.112e-66 / 2.415e-46.

Compute 1.112e-66 / 2.415e-46 = (1.112 / 2.415 )e-20 → approximately 0.4604e-20 → 4.604e-21 J.

So B ≈ 4.604e-21 J.

So the rotational energy difference is 2B = 9.208e-21 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference is h w.

h =6.626e-34 J·s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

So ΔE_vib =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

So comparing the two, the rotational transition is about 9.2e-21 J, which is much less than the vibrational, so the photon should have that energy.

So E_photon =9.2e-21 J.

Then, the momentum p_photon = E_photon / c.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So p =9.2e-21 / 3e8 = 3.0667e-29 kg m/s.

Which is 3.0667e-29 N s (since 1 N s = 1 kg m/s).

Looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns → 1.9e-28 kg·m/s → 19e-29 → which is about 6 times larger than our 3e-29.

B) 2.3e-27 → 23e-28 → way higher.

C) 1.1e-27 → 11e-28 → higher.

D) 1.4e-28 → 14e-29 → higher than 3e-29.

Hmm, none of the options match. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption. The question asks for the next state with the lowest possible energy. Maybe it's considering a transition that includes both rotational and vibrational changes. Alternatively, perhaps the model is different.

Wait, another possibility: in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length can change, so the moment of inertia isn't constant. But I'm not sure how that affects the energy levels. Alternatively, perhaps it's a rigid rotor but with both rotational and vibrational transitions.

Wait, the problem states that the model is the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is a combination of both rotational and vibrational models. So the energy levels are given by the sum of the rotational and vibrational energies.

In that case, the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next possible state could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. Which of these has the lower energy?

Compute both possibilities.

For v=1, J=0:

E = E_v=1 + E_J=0 = (3/2) h w + 0 = 3/2 h w.

For v=0, J=1:

E = 0 + 2B = 2B.

So the energy difference for v=1 transition is higher than that for J=1, because 3/2 h w is much larger than 2B.

So the molecule would transition to J=1 first. So the photon's energy is 2B, and the corresponding momentum is (2B)/c.

Wait, but earlier calculation of 2B =9.2e-21 J.

So p =9.2e-21 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.066e-29 kg m/s = 3.066e-29 N s.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula for the rotational energy. Let me double-check.

Wait, some sources say that the rotational energy levels are given by E_J = ( ħ² / (2 I) ) J (J+1) = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, which is ħ²/(2 I).

Yes, that's what I used. So that part seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used a different expression for the rotational energy.

Wait, another approach: calculate the rotational constant B in terms of the bond length and the reduced mass.

Another formula for B is B = (h)/(8 π² I c) → No, wait, perhaps that's the rotational constant in cm^-1. Hmm, perhaps I should be using wavenumbers or something else.

Wait, maybe I should calculate B in terms of the frequency or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the rotational energy is given by E_J = B J (J+1), where B is in terms of energy (in Joules). So I think I did that correctly.

Wait, another way: perhaps using the bond length in angstroms and mass in amu, I can use a shortcut formula for B.

I recall that B can be approximated using the formula:

B (cm⁻¹) ≈ (h c)/(8 π² μ r²) ), where c is speed of light in cm/s, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think. The rotational constant in terms of wavenumbers is B̃ = h/(8 π² c I), where I is the moment of inertia in g·cm².

Wait, perhaps I should convert μ and r into suitable units.

Wait, alternative approach: Let's compute the moment of inertia I in terms of units suitable for B.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute B in terms of the rotational frequency. Oh wait, wait, the rotational energy is E_J = B J (J+1), but B is the rotational constant. So I need to find B in J.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute B using the formula:

B = (h)/(8 π² I c), but no, I think that gives the rotational constant in terms of cm⁻¹. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up different forms of the rotational constant.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in Joules.

Wait, I think the approach I took before was correct. Let me check the calculation again.

Compute B:

B = ħ²/(2 I) → ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

I is 1.20764e-46 kg·m².

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.20764e-46) ) → denominator is 2.415e-46.

So 1.112e-68 / 2.415e-46 = (1.112 / 2.415 )e-22 → approx 0.46e-22 → 4.6e-23 J. Wait, wait, that can't be right because 1e-68 / 1e-46 is 1e-22.

Wait, wait, wait. 1.112e-68 / 2.415e-46 = (1.112 / 2.415) ) * 1e(-68 +46) → because when you divide exponents 1e-68 / 1e-46 = 1e-22.

So 1.112/2.415 is approximately 0.46. So 0.46 * 1e-22 → 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, so B = 4.6e-23 J.

Then the rotational energy difference is 2B → 9.2e-23 J.

Ah, so I think I made a mistake in the exponent earlier. Let me see:

Wait, no, earlier I thought B was 4.6e-21 J, but now I'm getting 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, that was a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the B value properly.

Compute B = ħ²/(2 I).

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

I is 1.20764e-46 kg·m².

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.20764e-46) = 1.112e-68 / 2.415e-46.

Now, 1e-68 /1e-46 =1e-22.

So 1.112e-68 / 2.415e-46 = (1.112 /2.415) ) * 1e-22.

1.112 /2.415 ≈ 0.4604.

So B =0.4604e-22 =4.604e-23 J.

So 2B =9.208e-23 J.

Hmm, that's a big difference. Earlier I thought B was 4.6e-21, but now it's 4.6e-23. That's two orders of magnitude difference. So where did I go wrong earlier?

Ah, I think I messed up the exponents. Let me recompute the ħ squared.

Wait, ħ is approximately 1.05457e-34 J·s.

(1.05457e-34)^2 = (1.05457)^2 * 1e-68 → 1.112e-68.

Yes, correct.

I is 3.0188e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 → 3.0188e-27 *4e-20 =1.2075e-46 kg m².

Yes.

So B = (1.112e-68 ) / (2 * 1.2075e-46 ) → denominator is 2.415e-46.

So 1.112e-68 /2.415e-46 = (1.112 /2.415) ) *1e(-68 +46) → 1e-22.

So 0.4604e-22 → 4.604e-23 J.

So the energy difference ΔE_rot = 2B = 9.208e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference was ΔE_vib = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So now, comparing the two, ΔE_rot is 9.2e-23 J, which is much less than 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy.

So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J.

Thus, the momentum p is E/c = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.0667e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, 9.2e-23 /3e8 = (9.2 /3e8 )e-23 → 3.0667e-31.

But this is 3.0667e-31 Ns, which is way smaller than the options given.

Wait, none of the options are anywhere near that. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Perhaps I should consider that the model is the non-rigid rotor, which includes vibrational and rotational energy. So the energy levels are a combination of both.

Wait, the question says "non-rigid rotor model," which allows for the bond length to change, but in the rigid rotor model, the bond length is fixed. So perhaps for a non-rigid rotor, the energy levels are different. But I'm not sure about the exact treatment.

Alternatively, perhaps the model being used is the vibration-rotation coupling model, leading to energy levels that are a combination.

But I'm not familiar with the exact formula for the non-rigid rotor. Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming the rotor is rigid, and the model is to consider both rotational and vibrational transitions.

Wait, but in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are purely rotational, and the vibrational and rotational are treated separately. So the total energy is the sum.

So the question is about the fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest energy could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1.

So compute both energy differences.

ΔE for v=1, J=0: E_v=1, J=0 - E_v=0, J=0 = (3/2 h w ) - (1/2 h w ) = h w.

ΔE for v=0, J=1: E_v=0, J=1 - E_v=0, J=0 = 2B - 0 = 2B.

So the photon should have the lower energy of the two, which is 2B.

But earlier, I found 2B =9.208e-23 J, which gives p =3e-31 Ns, but the options are all around 1e-28 to 2e-27 Ns.

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's check all steps again.

Wait, perhaps the model is the non-rigid rotor, but for diatomic molecules, the non-rigid rotor might have a different expression for the energy levels, perhaps including centrifugal distortion. But I'm not familiar enough with that to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the vibrational transition's required momentum.

Wait, the vibrational energy difference is h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Then, p = E/c → 2.6504e-19 /3e8 = 8.835e-28 kg m/s → 8.835e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28 Ns, which is close but not exact.

Hmm, but earlier I thought the rotational transition required less energy, but that gave me a much smaller p than any option. So perhaps the correct approach is to take the vibrational transition, giving p≈8.8e-28 Ns, which is closest to option A (1.9e-28) but not exactly. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B again.

Wait, perhaps I should use the bond length in angstroms and the reduced mass in atomic mass units, and find B in cm^-1, then convert to energy.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula B (cm^-1) = (h c)/(8 π² μ r²), where μ is in g, r in cm.

Let me try that.

First, convert μ to grams.

μ = 3.019e-27 kg = 3.019e-27 kg * (1000 g/kg) )=3.019e-24 g.

r =2 angstroms = 2e-8 cm.

So, B (cm⁻¹) = (h c)/(8 π² μ r²).

h = Planck's constant =6.626e-34 J·s.

c = 3e8 m/s = 3e10 cm/s.

μ =3.019e-24 g.

r =2e-8 cm.

So,

h c =6.626e-34 J·s *3e10 cm/s =1.9878e-23 J·cm.

But wait, J is kg·m²/s². Let me think about units.

Alternatively, perhaps better to compute B in cm^-1 using the formula.

But perhaps I can plug in the numbers.

Compute numerator h c =6.626e-34 *3e10 =1.9878e-23 J·cm.

Denominator: 8 π² μ r².

Compute denominator:

8 * (pi)^2 =8*(9.8696)≈78.9568.

μ =3.019e-24 g.

r=2e-8 cm.

r²=4e-16 cm².

So denominator: 78.9568 * 3.019e-24 g *4e-16 cm² =78.9568 *3.019e-24 *4e-16.

Multiply constants:78.9568 *3.019 ≈ 78.9568 *3=236.87, 78.9568 *0.019=1.500, total ≈238.37.

Then 238.37 *4e-16 = 953.48e-16 =9.5348e-14.

So denominator is 9.5348e-14 g·cm².

Wait, but wait, the units for B are cm⁻¹, so let me compute:

B = (h c) / (8 π² μ r²) → (1.9878e-23 J·cm) / (9.5348e-14 g·cm²).

Wait, but I have to make sure the units are correct. J is kg·m²/s².

1 J =1 kg m²/s² = 10^7 erg.

But perhaps I'm getting stuck on the units. Let me proceed numerically.

B = (1.9878e-23 ) / (9.5348e-14 ) → approx 2.083e-10 cm⁻¹.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1.9878e-23 divided by 9.5348e-14 is roughly (2e-23)/(1e-13) )= 2e-10.

So B ≈ 2.08e-10 cm⁻¹.

But that's 2.08e-10 cm⁻¹, which is 2.08e-12 m⁻¹.

Hmm, but to find the energy, we can compute E = h c B.

Wait, no, in this case, B is in cm⁻¹, so E = h c B (in Joules).

So E_photon = h c * B.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

c=3e8 m/s.

But B is 2.08e-10 cm⁻¹ → convert to m⁻¹: 2.08e-10 cm⁻¹ * 100 cm/m = 2.08e-8 m⁻¹.

So E_photon =6.626e-34 *3e8 * 2.08e-8.

Compute:

6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25.

1.9878e-25 *2.08e-8 =4.138e-33 J.

Wait, that's way too small.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach. Maybe I should compute B in terms of energy.

Another approach: The rotational constant B is given by B = (h/(8 π² I c)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy using the bond length and masses without considering the non-rigid aspects.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. Since the molecule is in its fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next state would be the first excited state, which could be either J=1, v=0 or v=1, J=0.

The question is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule transitions to the next lowest state, which would be the one with the smaller energy difference.

So I need to compute both possible transitions and see which one requires less energy.

Earlier, I have:

ΔE_rot =2B =9.2e-23 J.

ΔE_vib =h w = 2.65e-19 J.

So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J.

p= E_photon /c =9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.066e-31 kg·m/s =3.066e-31 Ns.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for B in terms of the rotational frequency.

Wait, perhaps the formula is B = h/(8 π² I c).

Wait, let me try that.

I =1.20764e-46 kg m².

So B =6.626e-34 / (8 * pi² *1.20764e-46 *3e8).

Compute denominator:

8 * pi² ≈78.9568.

1.20764e-46 *3e8 =3.62292e-38.

So denominator =78.9568 *3.62292e-38 ≈ 78.9568 *3.62292 = approx 78.9568 *3=236.87, 78.9568 *0.62292≈49.12 → total ≈ 285.99 → 285.99e-38 =2.8599e-36.

So B =6.626e-34 / 2.8599e-36 = (6.626 / 2.8599 )e2 → approx 2.318 *1e2 → 231.8 (unit?).

Wait, the units would be (J·s) / (kg·m²/s² * m) ) → J·s/(kg·m³/s²) ) → kg m/s² * s → kg m/s → which is N·s·m → not sure. But the value is 231.8 J·s/(kg m²/s² * m) → wait, this approach might not be right.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting confused, and perhaps the correct approach is to look for the energy difference between the states and then compute the photon's momentum.

But given the time I have, perhaps I should look for another approach or see if I can find the correct option based on the given data.

Wait, looking back at the problem, perhaps I made a mistake in the reduced mass calculation.

The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 *2)/(22) =40/22≈1.818 amu.

Yes, that's correct.

So, perhaps the problem is designed to have the photon causing a vibrational transition, which would have a higher energy, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct approach is to take the vibrational transition, even though it requires more energy.

Wait, but the question asks for the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the rotational transition.

But given that none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the B calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference is the sum of the vibrational and rotational changes. But that would be a higher energy.

Wait, another possibility: the 'fundamental state' is sometimes considered as the first excited state, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0, v=0 to J=1, v=1. But that would be a higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy of the photon that causes the transition from the ground state to the next state, regardless of type. But I'm not making progress.

Let me try to compute the momentum for the vibrational transition.

E_photon = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p = E/c =2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 kg m/s → 8.8347e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about half of this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the correct energy difference is (3/2 h w) - (1/2 h w) = h w. So that's correct.

Wait, another thing, perhaps the model includes both rotational and vibrational contributions, so the next state is a combination, but that's beyond my current knowledge.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is the rotational transition, but since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the angular frequency of the rotation and then find the photon's energy based on that.

Another approach: the rotational energy levels are given by E_J = B J (J+1), and the vibrational by E_v = (v + ½) h w.

The fundamental state is v=0, J=0: E= (½ h w) + 0 = ½ h w.

The next state could be either J=1, v=0: E=2B +½ h w.

Or v=1, J=0: E= (3/2 h w) +½ h w = 2 h w.

So the energy difference for J=1 transition is (2B +½ h w) - (½ h w ) = 2B.

For the v=1 transition, it's 2 h w - ½ h w = 3/2 h w.

So the smaller energy difference is 2B.

So the photon's energy must match 2B.

Now, to find B, perhaps using the moment of inertia I = μ r².

μ = (20 *2)/(22) amu = (40)/(22) ≈1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈3.018e-27 kg.

r =2 angstrom =2e-10 m.

I =3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.018e-27 *4e-20 =1.207e-46 kg m².

Rotational constant B = ħ²/(2 I), where ħ = h/(2π) =1.05457e-34 J·s.

So B = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 *1.207e-46) = (1.112e-68) / (2.414e-46) = 4.607e-23 J.

So 2B =9.214e-23 J.

Photon energy E_photon =9.214e-23 J.

p =E_photon /c =9.214e-23 /3e8 =3.071e-31 kg m/s =3.071e-31 Ns.

But the options are much higher.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in terms of energy per molecule, but I don't think that's the issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the next state with the same J but higher v, which would be the vibrational transition.

But that requires higher energy.

Wait, perhaps the model is considering that the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0) but any rotational state. So the next state would be J=1, v=0.

Thus, the photon's energy is 2B.

But with B as 4.6e-23 J, 2B is 9.2e-23 J, which gives p=3.07e-31 Ns. Which is not among the options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different formula for B. Another approach: B is given by (h c)/(8 π² I), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me try computing B in terms of wavenumbers.

B̃ (cm⁻¹) = (h)/(8 π² I c) → where I is in g·cm².

I = μ r² = (3.018e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, I need to convert I into g·cm².

1 kg =1000 g.

1 m =100 cm → 1 m² = (100 cm)^2=1e4 cm².

So I =3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.018e-27 kg *4e-20 m².

Convert kg to g: 3.018e-27 kg =3.018e-24 g.

m² to cm²: 4e-20 m² =4e-20 *1e4 cm² =4e-16 cm².

So I =3.018e-24 g *4e-16 cm² =1.2072e-39 g cm².

Then, B̃ = h/(8 π² I c).

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

But to use c in cm/s: c=3e10 cm/s.

So,

B̃ =6.626e-34 / (8 * pi^2 *1.2072e-39 * 3e10 )

Compute denominator:

8 * pi^2 ≈78.956.

1.2072e-39 *3e10 =3.6216e-29.

So denominator =78.956 *3.6216e-29 ≈ 285.99e-29 =2.8599e-27.

So B̃ =6.626e-34 /2.8599e-27 → ≈2.317e-7 cm⁻¹ → which is 2.317e-7 cm⁻¹.

So, E_photon = h c B̃.

But wait, B̃ is in cm⁻¹, so E_photon (J) = h * c * B̃.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

c=3e8 m/s =3e10 cm/s.

B̃=2.317e-7 cm⁻¹.

So,

E_photon =6.626e-34 *3e10 *2.317e-7.

Compute:

6.626e-34 *3e10 =1.9878e-23.

1.9878e-23 *2.317e-7 ≈4.615e-30 J.

So p =E_photon /c =4.615e-30 /3e8 =1.538e-38 kg m/s → 1.538e-38 Ns.

Again, way too small, so that's not matching options.

I'm stuck. Perhaps I should go back and see if any of the options match any of my earlier results.

Earlier, for the vibrational transition, I had p=8.835e-28 Ns, which is close to option A (1.9e-28), but not by much.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h w.

Wait, h=6.626e-34 J·s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E_photon =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p= E_photon /c →2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 kg m/s =8.8347e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about half of this.

Wait, but 8.8347e-28 is roughly 4.6 times option A's 1.9e-28.

But why would that be? Did I miss a factor somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the model includes both vibrational and rotational transitions, and the photon's energy is the sum of both.

Wait, no, because the next state is the lowest possible energy state, which would be either a vibrational or rotational transition, whichever requires less energy.

In this case, the rotational transition requires less energy, but the photon's momentum corresponding to that is much smaller than any of the options.

So perhaps the correct approach is to take the vibrational transition, giving p=8.83e-28 Ns. But none of the options match exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the question wants the photon's momentum that allows the molecule to go from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which could be J=1 or v=1, whichever has the lower energy.

But according to the calculations, the rotational transition is lower, but the calculated p is 3e-31 Ns, which is way below the options.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the bond length in meters correctly. Wait, 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters, correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the formula used for the rotational energy is E_J = (J (J+1)) * (h c B̃ ), where B̃ is in cm⁻¹. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the rotational energy difference is h c B̃, where B̃ is the rotational constant in wavenumbers.

Earlier, I found B̃ ≈2.3e-7 cm⁻¹.

So E_photon = h c B̃ →6.626e-34 *3e10 *2.3e-7 →6.626e-34 *6.9e3 → 4.6e-30 J.

p= E/c →4.6e-30 /3e8 →1.53e-38 Ns → way too small.

I'm stuck. Based on the given options, the closest is option A:1.9e-28 Ns, which corresponds to the vibrational transition.

But according to the calculations, the rotational transition requires less energy. But since the options don't have a value near 3e-31 Ns, perhaps the intended answer is the vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated B. Let me try a different approach.

Another way to compute B is:

B = (h)/(8 π² I c) → using I in kg m².

I=1.2076e-46 kg m².

So,

B =6.626e-34 / (8 * pi² * 1.2076e-46 *3e8 )

Compute denominator:

8 * pi² ≈78.9568.

1.2076e-46 *3e8 =3.6228e-40.

So denominator =78.9568 *3.6228e-40 = 2.859e-38.

So B=6.626e-34 /2.859e-38 = 2317.4 J.

Wait, that can't be right because B is supposed to be a small value for diatomic molecules. For example, O2 has B around 2e-23 J.

Wait, so perhaps I have a mistake in the denominator.

Wait, the formula is B = h/(8 pi² I c).

So:

h =6.626e-34 J·s.

8 pi² I c =8 *9.8696 *1.2076e-46 *3e8.

Compute:

8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568.

78.9568 *1.2076e-46 =95.29e-46 →9.529e-45.

9.529e-45 *3e8 =2.8587e-36.

So denominator is 2.8587e-36.

Thus, B =6.626e-34 /2.8587e-36 = approx 2317 J.

That's way too high. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for B is B = ħ²/(2 I).

As I did earlier.

Yes, that gives B =4.6e-23 J.

So 2B =9.2e-23 J → p=3.07e-31 Ns.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the photon's momentum is given by p = h/(lambda), but that's for momentum, and E = h f. Since p = E/(c), that's correct.

But I'm stuck. I think I have to conclude that the correct answer is option A:1.9e-28 Ns, which corresponds to the vibrational transition, even though the rotational transition requires less energy. Perhaps the problem expects that the next state is the first vibrational state, not the rotational.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B, and the correct value is higher. Let me recompute B.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the moment of inertia in terms of u, the bond length, and the reduced mass.

Wait, I'm not making progress, so I'll have to make a guess. Based on the calculations, the rotational transition's photon momentum is way too small, so perhaps the correct answer is option A:1.9e-28 Ns, which matches the vibrational transition.

Wait, but earlier I found the vibrational p as 8.8e-28 Ns, which is option not present. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the angular frequency given (w=4e14 rad/s) is the rotational frequency, but that's the vibrational frequency.

Hmm, the question gives w as the angular frequency of vibration. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the photon's momentum using the vibrational transition. So p = h w /c.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg·m/s → 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, the closest value is option B:2.3e-27, which is an order of magnitude higher. So I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the energy of the photon as the difference between the first excited state of rotation and vibration.

But I think I'm stuck, so perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option A:1.9e-28 Ns.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition a diatomic molecule from its fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences for both vibrational and rotational transitions.

### Key Information:
- **Masses**:  
  \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}, \, M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)  
  Reduced mass:  
  \[
  \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
  \]
  Convert to kilograms:  
  \[
  \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
  \]

- **Bond length**:  
  \( r = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)

- **Moment of inertia**:  
  \[
  I = \mu r^2 = (3.018 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2072 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
  \]

- **Rotational constant**:  
  \[
  B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I}, \quad \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx 1.0546 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}
  \]
  Substituting values:  
  \[
  B = \frac{(1.0546 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \cdot 1.2072 \times 10^{-46}} \approx \frac{1.112 \times 10^{-68}}{2.414 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.604 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
  \]

- **Vibrational energy difference**:  
  The vibrational energy levels are given by:  
  \[
  E_v = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) h \omega
  \]
  For \( v = 0 \to v = 1 \):  
  \[
  \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
  \]

- **Rotational energy difference**:  
  The rotational energy levels are given by:  
  \[
  E_J = B J (J + 1)
  \]
  For \( J = 0 \to J = 1 \):  
  \[
  \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \cdot (4.604 \times 10^{-23}) \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
  \]

### Comparison of Energy Differences:
- \(\Delta E_{\text{rot}} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\)  
- \(\Delta E_{\text{vib}} \approx 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)  

The rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition. Therefore, the photon must have energy corresponding to the rotational transition.

### Photon Momentum:
The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by:  
\[
p = \frac{E}{c}
\]
For the rotational transition:  
\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.21 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}
\]

### Issue with Options:
The calculated momentum for the rotational transition (\(3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}\)) is far smaller than any of the given options. This discrepancy suggests either a miscalculation or that the problem expects the vibrational transition to be considered instead. For the vibrational transition:  
\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}
\]

Among the options, the closest match to this value is **Option A: \(1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}\)**. While this does not perfectly match the calculated value, it is the most reasonable choice given the provided options.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: A**
