Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So first, I need to normalize this state because the question says it's proportional, meaning it hasn't been normalized yet.

Then, we have another operator whose matrix representation is given. Each element A_ij is ħ/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so it's a 2x2 matrix since we're dealing with spin-½ particles. So for 2x2 matrix, the indices i and j can be 1 and 2, or up and down.

Wait, let me think about the matrix. If i ≠ j, the element is ħ/2. So the diagonal elements (i=j) would be zero. So the matrix looks like:

[ [0, ħ/2],
  [ħ/2, 0] ]

Hmm, that's interesting. So this matrix is like the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix has 1s off the diagonal and 0s on the diagonal. So A is (ħ/2) times σ_x.

Wait, but wait, the Pauli matrices are usually defined with σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], so yeah, this A is (ħ/2)σ_x.

Now, the question asks for two things: the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator A, and the average value of A.

Wait, but the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of σ_x, right? Because A is proportional to σ_x. So the eigenstates of A would be the eigenstates of σ_x, which are the |+x> and |-x> states.

So first, let's find the probabilities. But wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, the operator A has eigenstates, which are the same as σ_x's. But the state |alpha> is given in the z-basis. So to find the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue of A, we need to project |alpha> onto each of A's eigenstates.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to diagonalize A and express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, then find the probabilities as the square of the coefficients.

But wait, maybe another approach: since A is proportional to σ_x, its eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>. So to find the probabilities, I can express |alpha> in the x-basis (i.e., in terms of |+x> and |-x>), and the coefficients' squares will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is Hermitian, the probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the projections of |alpha> onto each eigenstate of A.

Wait, but let me think again. The operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>. So the probability of measuring the eigenvalue +ħ/2 (since A is (ħ/2)σ_x, and σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1) would be the square of the amplitude of |alpha> in the |+x> state. Similarly for the -ħ/2 eigenvalue.

Wait, but maybe I should compute the probabilities as the expectation values for each eigenstate. But perhaps another way is to compute the expectation value of A, which would be the average value.

Wait, but first, let's normalize |alpha>. So the state is given as (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, but it's proportional, so we need to find the normalization factor.

The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1. Let me compute that.

The state is:

|alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>

So the inner product <alpha|alpha> is:

(1-i)(2+i) [from |up> inner product with |up>]
plus (2+i)(2-i) [from |down> inner product with |down>]
Wait, no, wait. Wait, the inner product is:

(1+i)^* (1+i) + (2-i)^* (2-i)

Because |up> and |down> are orthonormal, so cross terms vanish.

So (1+i) is a complex number. Its conjugate is (1-i). So (1+i)(1-i) = 1 + i -i -i² = 1 + 0 - (-1) = 2.

Similarly, (2-i)^* is (2+i), so (2+i)(2 -i) = 4 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5.

Wait, wait: (a - b i)^*(a + b i) = a² + b². So (1+i)(1-i) = 1² +1² = 2. (2-i)(2+i) = 2² + (1)^2 = 4 +1=5.

So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), because |alpha> is proportional to that, so |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, no. Wait, the original state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> }, and the norm squared is 7, so the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So now, the state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x. So the eigenstates are the same as σ_x's, which are |+x> and |-x>, with eigenvalues +1 and -1 multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, but I think the eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up
