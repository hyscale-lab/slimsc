Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The temperature is 25°C, and the K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. I remember that K here is the formation constant, which tells me about the stability of the complex.

Hmm, wait, what's the reaction here? Oh right, when Ca and EDTA form a complex, the reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−. The formation constant Kf is the equilibrium constant for this reaction. So Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in this problem, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, I guess that's the concentration of the complex. Since the complex dissociates in solution, there's some free Ca²+ and EDTA^4- in solution.

Wait, but the problem says the solution is stoichiometric, which I think means that the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are such that they are in a 1:1 ratio. Because the complex is Ca-EDTA, each mole of complex gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a minute. If the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA²-, that's the initial concentration. So when it dissociates, each mole of the complex gives one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-. So if the complex is fully dissociated, the concentration of Ca²+ would be 0.02 M, but that's not the case because the complex is stable, so it doesn't completely dissociate.

Wait, but wait. Oh, no, because K is so large (5e10), that suggests the complex is very stable. So the dissociation is minimal, meaning that almost all the Ca is in the complex form, and the free Ca²+ concentration is very low.

Wait, but the problem is about finding the concentration of free calcium ions. So I need to calculate [Ca²+], given that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M and K is 5e10.

Let me think about the equilibrium. Let me write the dissociation reaction:

CaEDTA²− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−

The K for the dissociation would be 1/Kf, right? Because Kf is the formation constant, which is the reverse of this dissociation. So Kd = 1/Kf = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, yes. Because Kf is the formation constant, so Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). So the dissociation constant Kd would be [Ca²+][EDTA^4−]/[CaEDTA²−] = 1/Kf.

So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Now, let's think about the initial situation. The solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA²−. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. Then, in equilibrium, the concentration of Ca²+ is x, and EDTA^4− is also x, because the stoichiometry is 1:1. The concentration of the complex would then be 0.02 - x. But since Kd is so small (2e-11), x is going to be very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So the expression for Kd becomes:

Kd = (x)(x) / 0.02 = x² / 0.02.

Set this equal to Kd:

x² / 0.02 = 2e-11.

Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13.

Taking the square root: x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7? Because 10^-7 is 1e-7, approximately 3.16e-7 is 10^-6.5.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(4e-13) more accurately. 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. The square root of 4 is 2. The square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7.

So x = 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M. Hmm, that's approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7 M. So that's our answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me go through the steps again.

We have [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M. The dissociation is CaEDTA²− ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−.

At equilibrium, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4−] = x, [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

Kd = x² / 0.02 = (x²) / 0.02 = 2e-11.

x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13.

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7, which rounds to 6.3e-7.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we analyze the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the equilibrium concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\). Since the dissociation is minimal (due to the small \( K_d \)), the concentration of the complex remains approximately \( 0.02 \, \text{M} \). The equilibrium expression for \( K_d \) is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Substituting \( K_d = 2 \times 10^{-11} \):

\[
\frac{x^2}{0.02} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = 0.02 \times 2 \times 10^{-11} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
