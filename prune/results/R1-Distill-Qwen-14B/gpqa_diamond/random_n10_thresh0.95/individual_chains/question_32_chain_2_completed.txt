--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, I remember RHIC is used to collide heavy ions, like gold nuclei or something, but this question is about a nucleus X which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would be lithium-6 because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6.

The question is asking for the energy of RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. I think the energy here refers to the kinetic energy, but wait, no, in particle physics, when they talk about energy of the collider, it's usually the total energy, which includes rest mass energy plus kinetic. But wait, I'm a bit confused. I think for heavy ions, sometimes they talk about the kinetic energy per nucleon or something like that. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says the speed is 0.96c. So I need to find the total energy (gamma * m c²) or maybe kinetic energy (gamma -1)* m c². But the question says, what is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c. So probably, since it's a collider, each nucleus is accelerated to that speed, so the energy would relate to gamma times the rest mass energy of the nucleus.

So first, I need to find the gamma factor when the speed v is 0.96c. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that.

v = 0.96c. So v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

Wait, more accurately, 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that. 0.28 is 28/100, so 1 / 0.28 = 100/28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the nucleus X (Li-6). The rest mass of a nucleus is the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons minus the binding energy, but for rough calculations, we can approximate it as the mass number times the mass of a nucleon. But wait, more accurately, the rest mass of Li-6 can be found using the atomic mass.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0138 g/mol. Wait, but wait, I remember that the mass of a nucleus is given by the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons minus the mass defect. Alternatively, I can use the atomic mass. For a single atom, the mass is m = M_A / (N_A), where M_A is molar mass and N_A is Avogadro's number.

Let me think. The molar mass of Li is about 6.94 g/mol, but Li-6 is a specific isotope. Wait, I think the exact value is needed. Alternatively, I can look up the atomic mass of Li-6, which is about 6.0138 u (atomic mass units). Wait, let me confirm. Yes, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0138 u.

So the rest mass energy of the nucleus is m c², where m is 6.0138 u. I need to convert this into GeV.

Wait, 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So m c² is 6.0138 u * 931.5 MeV/c²/u. Let me compute that. 6.0138 * 931.5 = ?

Calculating:

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.0138 * 931.5 ≈ 12.87 MeV.

So total is approximately 5601.87 MeV, which is 5.60187 GeV.

Wait, wait, let me compute it more accurately.

6.0138 * 931.5 = ?

Let's compute 6 * 931.5 = 5589.

0.0138 * 931.5:

0.01 * 931.5 = 9.315.

0.0038 * 931.5 = approx 3.54. So total 9.315 +3.54=12.855.

So 5589 +12.855=5601.855 MeV = 5.601855 GeV.

So the rest energy is approximately 5.601855 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Li-6 has 3 neutrons and 3 protons. Each proton is about 938 MeV/c². Each neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So the total rest mass is 3*(938) + 3*(939.565) = let me compute that.

3*938 = 2814 MeV.

3*939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.

Total is 2814 + 2818.695 = 5632.695 MeV, which is 5.632695 GeV.

Wait, but this is higher than the 5.601855 GeV I got earlier from the atomic mass. Hmm, that's because the actual atomic mass accounts for binding energy. So the atomic mass is less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons. So the correct rest mass is approximately 5.6 GeV.

Wait, but let me get this straight. The mass of a nucleus is less than the sum of the masses of its individual nucleons because of the mass defect (binding energy). So the rest mass of Li-6 is about 5.6 GeV.

But wait, perhaps I should use the exact value from the periodic table. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0138 atomic mass units (u). Since 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c², so 6.0138 u is 6.0138 * 931.5 ≈ 5601.8 MeV, which is 5.6018 GeV.

So the rest energy is 5.6018 GeV.

Now, the total energy (gamma * m c²) is gamma multiplied by 5.6018 GeV.

Gamma is approximately 3.57142857, so 5.6018 * 3.5714.

Let me compute that: 5.6018 * 3.5714.

Breaking it down: 5 * 3.5714 is 17.857, and 0.6018 *3.5714 is about 2.15.

Wait, perhaps more accurately:

5.6018 × 3.5714:

Let me compute 5.6 ×3.5714.

5 ×3.5714 = 17.857.

0.6 ×3.5714= 2.14284.

Total 17.857 +2.14284=19.99984. So approximately 20 GeV.

But wait, I should be precise. Let's do it more accurately.

Wait, 5.6018 ×3.57142857.

Let me compute 5.6018 *3.57142857.

Let me compute 5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285.

0.6018 *3.57142857.

Let's compute 0.6 *3.57142857 =2.14285714.

0.0018 *3.57142857 = approx 0.00642857.

So 2.14285714 +0.00642857=2.1492857.

So adding to the 17.85714285, total is 17.85714285 +2.1492857=20.00642855 GeV.

So approximately 20.0064 GeV.

But looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

Hmm, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. Wait, perhaps I made an approximation earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me check.

v = 0.96c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

Computing (0.96)^2: 0.96 *0.96 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. Because 0.28^2=0.0784.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Wait, but perhaps more precisely, 0.0784 is exactly (0.28)^2, so no approximation needed.

So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Wait, another approach: to compute beta = 0.96, so gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

So yes, gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

So then, the total energy is gamma * m c².

m c² is 5.6018 GeV.

So 5.6018 * 3.57142857 = ?

Let me compute that precisely.

Compute 5.6018 *3.57142857.

Hmm, perhaps better to compute 5.6018 *3.57142857.

Let me write 3.57142857 as 3 + 0.5 + 0.07142857.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 5.6018 *3.57142857.

Let me compute 5 *3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.6 *3.57142857=2.14285714.

0.0018 *3.57142857= 0.00642857.

Adding them up: 17.85714285 +2.14285714=20.0, and 20.0 +0.00642857=20.00642857 GeV.

So approximately 20.0064 GeV.

But the options don't have 20 GeV. The closest is option C, 20.132 GeV, which is higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute more accurately the rest mass energy.

Wait, I used 6.0138 u for Li-6. Let me double-check the exact value. The standard atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.013897 u. So m=6.013897 u.

Then, m c²=6.013897 *931.5 MeV/u = ?

6.013897 *931.5 = let's compute that.

Compute 6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.013897 *931.5 = let's compute that.

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.003897 *931.5= approximately 3.634 MeV.

So 9.315 +3.634 ≈12.949 MeV.

Total m c²=5589 +12.949=5601.949 MeV=5.601949 GeV.

So m c²=5.601949 GeV.

Then gamma=3.57142857.

So 5.601949 *3.57142857.

Let me compute that more accurately.

5.601949 *3.57142857.

Let me compute 5.601949 *3.57142857.

Perhaps I can compute it step by step.

3.57142857 is approximately 25/7.

So 5.601949 * (25/7).

25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

So 5.601949 *25 = 140.048725.

Divided by 7: 140.048725 /7=20.0069607 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.007 GeV.

But the options don't have that. Hmm, but the options' given choices have option C as 20.132 GeV and option D as 21.419 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass. Let me check again.

Wait, another approach: the rest mass of Li-6 is 6.013897 u. So m c² is 6.013897 * 931.5 MeV.

But wait, 1 u is 931.4941 MeV/c², right? So perhaps a more accurate value is 931.4941 MeV/u.

So m c² =6.013897 u *931.4941 MeV/u = ?

Let me compute 6 *931.4941=5588.9646.

0.013897 *931.4941≈ let's compute that.

0.01 *931.4941=9.314941.

0.003897 *931.4941: let me compute 0.003 *931.4941=2.7944823.

0.000897 *931.4941≈0.8336.

So 2.7944823 +0.8336=3.6280823.

So 9.314941 +3.6280823=12.9430233 MeV.

So total m c²=5588.9646 +12.9430233=5601.9076 MeV, which is 5.6019076 GeV.

So then, total energy is gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.6019076.

Let me compute that.

3.57142857 *5.6019076.

I can compute 5.6019076 *3.57142857.

Alternatively, let me think of 5.6019076 *3.57142857 as (5 + 0.6019076) *3.57142857.

5 *3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.6019076 *3.57142857.

Let me compute 0.6 *3.57142857=2.14285714.

0.0019076 *3.57142857≈ approx 0.00682857.

So 2.14285714 +0.00682857≈2.1496857.

So total is 17.85714285 +2.1496857=20.00682855 GeV.

So approximately 20.0068 GeV.

But looking at the options, the closest is option C (20.132 GeV) and option D (21.419 GeV). Hmm, so 20.0068 is closest to option C, but it's about 20.0068, so why is option C at 20.132?

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation of gamma?

No, beta is 0.96, so gamma is 3.57142857, correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that in the RHIC, the energy per nucleon is a factor. Wait, but the problem states it's a nucleus, not per nucleon. So I think the calculation is correct. So why is the option C higher?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in considering whether it's gamma times m c² or whether the energy is kinetic. Because if the question is about kinetic energy, then the energy would be (gamma -1)*m c².

So let's compute that. Gamma is 3.5714.

Gamma -1 = 2.5714.

So 2.5714 *5.6019076 GeV.

Let me compute that.

5.6019076 *2.5714.

5 *2.5714=12.857.

0.6019076 *2.5714≈1.548.

So total is about 14.405 GeV. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is about the total energy, not just kinetic.

So, going back, the total energy is about 20.0068 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C at 20.132 GeV, but that's about 0.125 GeV higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me check another approach.

Another approach: perhaps the mass of the nucleus is (number of nucleons) * average mass of a nucleon, but considering binding energy.

Wait, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so 6 nucleons.

Each proton is about 938 MeV/c².

Each neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c².

So total rest mass is 3*(938+939.565) = 3*(1877.565) MeV.

Wait, no, each proton is 938, each neutron is 939.565, so 3*(938) +3*(939.565) =2814 + 2818.695 =5632.695 MeV, which is 5.632695 GeV.

Ah, so perhaps I should calculate the rest mass as 5.632695 GeV instead of 5.6018 GeV. Wait, but that's without considering binding energy. Because the actual mass is less than the sum.

Wait, if I take each proton as 938 MeV and each neutron as about 939.57 MeV, summing for Li-6 gives (3×938)+(3×939.57)=5632.71 MeV, which is 5.6327 GeV. But the actual mass is less because of binding energy (mass defect). So using 5.6327 GeV as the rest mass would overestimate the actual rest mass.

Wait, but the exact rest mass of Li-6 is about 5.6019 GeV as per the earlier calculation. So perhaps that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma*m c² with m=5.6019 GeV.

So 5.6019 *3.57142857 ≈20.0068 GeV.

So why is option C 20.132? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the beta calculation.

Wait, beta is 0.96, correct. Let me verify gamma again.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784).

What's sqrt(0.0784) exactly? 0.28^2 is 0.0784, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma is 3.57142857.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer is approximately 20.007 GeV. But the options don't have that. The closest is C)20.132 GeV, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in m c². Let me think again about the mass of Li-6.

Li-6 has a mass of approximately 6.013897 u. So m =6.013897 u.

m c² is 6.013897 *931.4941 MeV = ?

6 *931.4941 =5588.9646 MeV.

0.013897 *931.4941= let's compute that more accurately.

0.01 *931.4941=9.314941.

0.003897 *931.4941= let's compute:

0.003 *931.4941=2.7944823.

0.000897 *931.4941= approx 0.8336.

Wait, 0.000897 *931.4941 = 0.8336.

So total for 0.003897 *931.4941=2.7944823 +0.8336=3.6280823.

So 9.314941 +3.6280823=12.9430233 MeV.

So m c²=5588.9646 +12.9430233=5601.9076 MeV, which is 5.6019076 GeV.

So that's correct.

So 5.6019 GeV *3.57142857=?

Let me compute 5.6019 *3.57142857.

Let me write 3.57142857 as 25/7.

So 5.6019 *25 = 140.0475.

Divided by 7: 140.0475 /7=20.0067857 GeV.

So approximately 20.0068 GeV.

But the options don't have that number. So perhaps the correct option is C)20.132 GeV?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the multiplication. Let me do it more accurately.

Let me compute 5.6019 *3.57142857.

We can write 3.57142857 as 25/7. So 5.6019 *25 =140.0475.

140.0475 /7 =20.0067857 GeV.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy. Wait, if the question is about the kinetic energy, then the energy would be (gamma-1)*m c².

Gamma is 3.57142857.

Gamma -1 =2.57142857.

So 2.57142857 *5.6019076=?

2.57142857 *5=12.85714285.

2.57142857 *0.6019076=?

Let me compute 2.57142857 *0.6=1.54285714.

2.57142857 *0.0019076= approximately 0.004907.

So 1.54285714 +0.004907=1.547764.

So total is 12.85714285 +1.547764=14.4049 GeV.

But that's the kinetic energy, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps the problem is asking for the total energy, which is about 20 GeV, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the error is that I calculated gamma correctly, but I should use the relativistic energy formula E=gamma m c². So the calculation is correct, but the options don't have the correct value. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the speed value.

Wait, the question says the speed is 0.96c. Did I compute gamma correctly? Yes, because beta=0.96, so gamma=3.57142857.

Wait, maybe I should compute gamma more accurately, perhaps with more decimal places.

Wait, 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 -0.9216=0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.57142857.

Hmm. I'm confused why none of the options match. Let me look at the options again:

Options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Wait, option C is 20.132 GeV. My calculation is 20.0068 GeV. Hmm, that's about 0.125 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass. Let me see.

Wait, another way: perhaps the rest mass is calculated as (number of nucleons) *931.5 MeV/c² minus the binding energy.

Li-6 has 6 nucleons. So 6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

The binding energy (mass defect) for Li-6 is about 5601.949 -5589 =12.949 MeV? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the binding energy is the mass defect, which is (sum of individual masses) - (nucleus mass).

Wait, sum of individual masses is 6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

Nucleus mass is 5601.949 MeV.

Wait, that can't be right because the nucleus mass is less than the sum, so the binding energy is (5589 -5601.949) = negative, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no, that's impossible. Wait, no, the nucleus mass should be less than the sum, so the mass defect is (sum) - (nucleus mass).

So mass defect is 5589 MeV -5601.949 MeV? No, that would be negative. That's not possible. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no, I think I messed up. The sum of the individual nucleon masses is 6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

The actual nucleus mass (m c²) is 5601.949 MeV. So that would mean the nucleus is more massive than the sum, which can't be right because binding energy should reduce the mass. So I must have an error in the calculation.

Ah! Oh no, I think I made a mistake. The problem is in the calculation of the nucleus mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.013897 u. But the molar mass is the mass per mole, so the mass of a single Li-6 nucleus is (6.013897 u) * (1 g/mol) / Avogadro's number. But when we convert that to energy, 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c², so the rest energy is 6.013897 *931.5 MeV =5.6019 GeV.

But wait, that can't be correct because the sum of the nucleon masses (6 *938.3 MeV) is about 5.6298 GeV, so the nucleus mass should be less than that. So 5.6019 GeV is correct, as it's less than 5.6298 GeV.

Wait, but then 5.6019 GeV is the rest mass, and the sum of the individual nucleons is about 5.63 GeV, so the binding energy is 5.63 -5.6019=0.0281 GeV, or about 28.1 MeV. That seems plausible.

So I think my calculation is correct.

Hmm. So with gamma=3.57142857 and m c²=5.6019 GeV, the total energy is 20.0068 GeV. So why isn't that an option?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy, but earlier we saw that the kinetic energy is about 14.4 GeV, which isn't in the options.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Let me see if I can find a way to get that number. It's approximately 3.5714 *5.62 GeV.

Wait, 3.5714 *5.62=?

3 *5.62=16.86.

0.5714 *5.62≈3.206.

Total≈20.066 GeV. Close to 20.06, which is still less than option C's 20.132.

Hmm, perhaps I should check if the mass is 6.013897 u, which is 5.6019 GeV, correct. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the fact that the problem states that X is Li with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6. So perhaps the mass is being taken as 6 *938 MeV/c², which would be 5.628 GeV.

So if the rest mass is 5.628 GeV, then total energy would be 5.628 *3.5714≈20.07 GeV. Still not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy more precisely.

Wait, 5.6019076 *3.57142857.

Let me compute 5.6019076 *3.57142857.

We can write 3.57142857 as 25/7.

So 5.6019076 *25 = 140.04769.

Divided by 7: 140.04769 /7 =20.00681286 GeV.

So exactly 20.00681286 GeV.

Hmm, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass as 6 *938 MeV/c², which is 5.628 GeV.

So 5.628 *3.57142857=?

5.628 *3=16.884.

5.628 *0.57142857= approximately 3.207.

Total 16.884 +3.207=20.091 GeV.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the exact gamma is 3.57142857, and the energy is 5.6019 *3.57142857 =20.0068 GeV. But the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about whether the question is asking for the kinetic energy or the total energy. Earlier, I thought it was total, but perhaps it's kinetic. So let me compute (gamma -1) * m c².

Gamma is 3.57142857, so gamma-1=2.57142857.

2.57142857 *5.6019076=?

2 *5.6019076=11.2038152.

0.57142857 *5.6019076.

0.5 *5.6019076=2.8009538.

0.07142857 *5.6019076≈0.401.

So 2.8009538 +0.401=3.2019538.

So total is 11.2038152 +3.2019538=14.405769 GeV.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the error is that I'm using the rest mass energy correctly. Another approach: perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy, but given the options, perhaps it's the total energy.

Wait, I'm stuck. The calculation leads me to 20.0068 GeV, but the options don't have that. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass. Let me think about the binding energy again.

Wait, the binding energy of Li-6 is about 5.6327 -5.6019=0.0308 GeV, which is 30.8 MeV. That seems a bit low, but perhaps it's correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for c, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different formula. Let me think about the relation between kinetic energy and velocity.

The formula for relativistic energy is E=gamma m c².

But perhaps the question is using the non-relativistic formula for kinetic energy, but that wouldn't make sense because at 0.96c, it's definitely relativistic.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is talking about the energy per nucleon, not the total energy of the nucleus. So perhaps the nucleus has a mass of 6 nucleons, and the energy is per nucleon.

So if the total energy is 20.0068 GeV, then per nucleon it's about 3.334 GeV. But that's not one of the options either.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rest energy of a single nucleon, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 5.6019 *3.57142857 exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator would help, but since I don't have one, perhaps I can think about it as 5.6019 *3.57142857 = 5.6019 * (25/7) = (5.6019 *25)/7.

5.6019 *25 =140.0475.

140.0475 /7 =20.0067857 GeV.

So about 20.0068 GeV.

Hmm. None of the options match, but perhaps the correct answer is option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should consider more precise values for gamma. Let me recompute gamma with more precision.

Beta =0.96.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta²) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784).

Wait, perhaps the square root of 0.0784 is not exactly 0.28. Let me compute it more accurately.

0.28^2=0.0784, correct. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Hmm. So I'm back to the same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the correct answer is 20.007 GeV, which is not listed. But the options given don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps I should pick the closest option, which is option C at 20.132 GeV.

Wait, 20.0068 is close to option C (20.132), but perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the rest mass is calculated as 6.013897 u *931 MeV/u.

So 6.013897 *931 = ?

6 *931=5586.

0.013897 *931=12.917.

Total=5586 +12.917=5598.917 MeV=5.598917 GeV.

So then, 5.598917 *3.57142857=?

5 *3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.598917 *3.57142857.

0.5 *3.57142857=1.785714285.

0.098917 *3.57142857≈0.354.

So 1.785714285 +0.354=2.1397.

So total is 17.85714285 +2.1397=20. (Wait, 17.85714285 +2.1397=19.9968 GeV.)

So about 19.9968 GeV. Hmm, that's even closer to 20 GeV.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I've spent too much time and I should conclude that the correct answer is approximately 20 GeV, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation, thinking that the Li-6 nucleus has a higher rest mass than 5.6 GeV.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should compute the energy using the relativistic kinetic energy formula, which is K = (gamma -1) m c².

In that case, K = (3.57142857 -1) *5.6019076 =2.57142857 *5.6019076.

Which is approximately 14.4057 GeV, but that's not an option.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option C:20.132 GeV, but I'm not sure how to get there.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass. Let me compute 6.013897 u *931.4941 MeV/u.

Let me compute 6.013897 *931.4941.

Let me compute 6 *931.4941=5588.9646.

0.013897 *931.4941=12.943.

So total is 5588.9646 +12.943=5601.9076 MeV=5.6019076 GeV.

Yes, correct.

Hmm. I'm running out of ideas. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the invariant mass formula, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the speed in terms of the lab frame, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is per nucleon, but earlier that didn't help.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C:20.132 GeV, and I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate 5.6019 *3.57142857.

5.6019 ×3.57142857.

Let me compute 5 ×3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.6019 ×3.57142857=2.1496857.

So total=17.85714285 +2.1496857=20.00682855 GeV.

Still about 20.0068 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass as 6.013897 u *931.5 MeV/u, which is 5.6019 GeV, correct.

Hmm. I'm not finding any error in the calculation, but the options don't have this value. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is option C:20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not seeing why.

Wait, perhaps I should try to compute 5.6019 *3.57142857 more accurately.

5.6019 ×3.57142857.

Let me write 3.57142857 as 3 + 0.5 + 0.07142857.

So 5.6019 ×3 =16.8057.

5.6019 ×0.5=2.80095.

5.6019 ×0.07142857≈5.6019 ×(1/14) ≈0.4001357.

Adding them up:16.8057 +2.80095=19.60665 +0.4001357=20.0067857 GeV.

So again, 20.0067857 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the exact answer is 20.0068 GeV, which rounds to 20.007 GeV, but none of the options are that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem made a mistake in the options, but that's not helpful.

Given the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV, but my calculation doesn't reach that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass, but I think the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the energy as the kinetic energy multiplied by gamma. No, that doesn't make sense.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think the correct answer based on the calculations is approximately 20.007 GeV, but since that's not an option, perhaps option C is meant to be the answer. But why?

Wait, perhaps I should check if the speed is actually 0.96c, but in the problem statement, perhaps it's 0.996c. No, the problem says 0.96c.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more accurately the square root of 0.0784.

Wait, 0.0784 is (0.28)^2, so sqrt is exactly 0.28.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all options. The correct calculation leads to approximately 20.007 GeV, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV.

But perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is 5.6327 GeV (sum of nucleons without binding energy), leading to 5.6327 *3.57142857≈20.096 GeV, which is close to option C's 20.132.

But earlier I thought that the rest mass should be less than the sum, so perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass as 6 ×938 MeV/c² =5.628 GeV.

So 5.628 ×3.57142857=?

5 ×3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.628 ×3.57142857≈2.234.

Total=17.85714285 +2.234≈20.091 GeV.

Still not matching option C.

Hmm. I'm not sure. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but I can't see how to get that with the given data.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for c. For example, if c is taken as 3×10^8 m/s, but I don't think that affects the gamma calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of the deuteron or something else. But I think it's about Li-6.

I think I've thought this through as much as I can. The correct answer based on the calculations is approximately 20.007 GeV, but since that's not an option, perhaps option C is the intended choice.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus \( X \) (Li-6) is \( 0.96c \), we start by calculating the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) using the formula:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

Next, we calculate the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 6.013897 \, u \), where \( 1 \, u = 931.4941 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Thus:

\[
m c^2 = 6.013897 \, u \times 931.4941 \, \text{MeV}/u = 5601.9076 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6019 \, \text{GeV}
\]

The total energy of the nucleus is then given by:

\[
E = \gamma \cdot m c^2 = 3.5714 \cdot 5.6019 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:

\[
3.5714 \cdot 5 = 17.857, \quad 3.5714 \cdot 0.6019 \approx 2.1497
\]

\[
E = 17.857 + 2.1497 \approx 20.0067 \, \text{GeV}
\]

This result, \( 20.0067 \, \text{GeV} \), is very close to \( 20.007 \, \text{GeV} \). However, none of the provided options exactly match this value. The closest option is **C) 20.132 GeV**, which is slightly higher than the calculated result. Given the precision of the problem and the available options, the intended answer is likely **C) 20.132 GeV**.

Answer: C
