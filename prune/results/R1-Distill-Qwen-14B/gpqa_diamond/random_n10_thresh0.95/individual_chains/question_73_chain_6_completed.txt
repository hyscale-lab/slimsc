Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to relativity, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Hmm, so first, I think I need to figure out the relative speed between the two astronauts. Wait, but wait—relativistic speeds mean I can't just subtract their velocities like I would in classical mechanics. Oh right, I remember that to find the relative velocity between two objects moving at relativistic speeds, I have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula is something like u' = (u - v) / (1 - (uv)/c²), right? But wait, wait, I think I might have it backwards. Let me think. If astronaut A is moving at velocity u and astronaut B is moving at velocity v relative to the same frame, then from A's perspective, B's velocity would be (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/c²), or maybe (u - v) over that denominator. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me double-check the formula.

Wait, no, the correct formula for the relative velocity of object B as seen from object A is (v - u) / (1 - (uv)/c²), but wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. Suppose the frame S sees A moving at u and B moving at v. Then from A's frame S', what is the velocity of B?

Oh wait, I think I have it the other way around. The formula is (v - u) divided by (1 - (uv)/c²). Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the direction. If both are moving in the same direction, u is 0.6c for astronaut 1, and v is 0.5c for astronaut 2. Wait, no, wait: in the rest frame of the system, astronaut 1 is moving at u = 0.6c, astronaut 2 at v = 0.5c. So when astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, what's the speed of astronaut 2 relative to astronaut 1?

So astronaut 2's speed relative to astronaut 1 would be (v - u) / (1 - (uv/c²)) ), but wait, no. Because in the frame S, the other frame is moving at u, so when you switch frames, the formula is (v' = (v - u) / (1 - (uv)/c²)).

Wait, no, maybe it's (u' = (v - u) ) / (1 - (u v)/(c^2)) ), but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to pick a reference frame and compute everything.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the velocity of astronaut 2 as seen from astronaut 1's frame. So, since astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, from astronaut 1's frame, astronaut 2 is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)) )

Wait, that gives ( -0.1c ) / (1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/(0.7) )= approximately -0.1428c. But since we're talking about speed, the magnitude would be 0.1428c.

Wait, so the relative speed would be about 0.14c, which is one of the options. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c for v_rel. So that's a clue.

Now, the other part is the total energy of the system. So relativistic energy for each astronaut would be gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

So for astronaut 1: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma1 * (2m) c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, E = gamma * m c². So for 2m, it's gamma * 2m c². So yes, 1.25 * 2m c² is 2.5 m c².

For astronaut 2: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. Let me compute that more accurately. sqrt(3/4) is sqrt(0.75) which is approx 0.8660. So 1/0.8660 is approximately 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So the total energy of the system is E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c².

Looking at the options:

Option C: v_rel =0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

That's matching. So the relative speed is 0.14c, and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C is v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². So that's the correct option.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The two astronauts are moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds of \( 0.6c \) and \( 0.5c \). The relative speed between them is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v - u}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) (velocity of astronaut 1) and \( v = 0.5c \) (velocity of astronaut 2). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the magnitude of the relative speed is \( 0.14c \).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of astronaut 1:
Mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of astronaut 2:
Mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching the Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \( 0.14c \).
- The total energy is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \).

Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5.96m c^2 \)**.

Answer: C
