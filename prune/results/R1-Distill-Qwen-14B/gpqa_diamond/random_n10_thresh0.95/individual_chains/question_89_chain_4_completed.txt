--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH to give product 1, which is a light yellow solid. The data provided includes the 1H NMR spectrum and an IR absorption. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to give product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR, excluding exchangeable protons.

Hmm, let me break this down.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. KOH is a strong base. Since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, the bromine is probably on two non-adjacent carbons. Heating with KOH likely leads to an elimination reaction. Wait, dibromide with KOH would usually undergo dehydrohalogenation if there's a beta hydrogen. But wait, adamantane is a highly branched structure with no available hydrogens adjacent to each bromine? Or does it have some?

Wait, maybe the reaction is more about elimination. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two equivalents of HBr, right? So each bromine is on a bridgehead carbon, which in adamantane are typically quaternary or have limited H. Wait, but in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, each bridgehead might have one H each. No, wait, the bridgehead carbons in adamantane are typically quaternary. Hmm, perhaps the structure isn't such that elimination can occur.

Wait, wait, another possibility: Maybe it's a Vicarious Nucleophilic Substitution (VNS)? Or maybe it's an E2 elimination. But if the carbons are bridgeheads, maybe the reaction forms a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination scenario.

Wait, the product after KOH is a light yellow solid. The NMR data: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Let's think about this.

The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. So the reaction with KOH could be a substitution to form a ketone? Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement.

Wait, when two vicinal bromides are treated with a strong base like KOH, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But wait, the IR doesn't show an alkene (which would have a peak around 1650-1600 cm-1). So maybe it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is symmetric. Maybe when treated with KOH, each Br is replaced by an -OH group? But that would give a diol, which doesn't have a carbonyl. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a solvolysis, like a SN2 reaction, but adamantane's structure is such that the carbons are very hindered. So SN2 is unlikely. Maybe it's more like an E2 elimination, forming a carbonyl.

Wait, if each Br is on a bridgehead, perhaps elimination leads to a ketone. Let me think about the structure. Adamantane has four bridgehead carbons. Wait, no, the structure of adamantane is a four-fused cyclohexane rings. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on two bridgeheads opposite each other.

Elimination of HBr from each would form a double bond, but wait, in a bridge structure, that's difficult. Alternatively, perhaps the two HBr eliminations form a ketone group. Wait, perhaps each Br is adjacent to a bridgehead that can lose HBr and form a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's a pinacol-like elimination. Pinacol is a vicinal diol that eliminates water to form a ketone. But here, we have a vicinal dibromide, so elimination of two HBr molecules could form a ketone. Oh, wait! The reaction is dehydrohalogenation leading to a diketone? Or maybe not.

Wait, another approach: The NMR of product 1. The peaks are at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 is probably a triplet of two hydrogens. Maybe a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. The 10H in the 2.4-2.2 region suggests perhaps some CH2 groups near a carbonyl. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group.

Wait, the IR at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. So, product 1 is likely a ketone. So, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, each Br being replaced by an oxygen group, but that wouldn't explain the carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dearomatization or a ring opening, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the initial structure is more like a bicyclic compound. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing an elimination to form a ketone. Wait, if each Br is on a CH2Br group attached to a bridge, then eliminating HBr from each would form a double bond, but that doesn't give a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility. Maybe the reaction is a Diels-Alder type, but that seems unrelated. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction, but that's usually for aromatic rings, and the product is a diol. But the IR here suggests a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where each Br is replaced by an O- group. But then, in KOH, that would form a diol again. But that would have OH groups, which would show broad peaks in NMR, possibly not seen if exchanged with D2O. But the product's NMR doesn't show broad peaks, so maybe they are deuterated.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a double substitution, each Br being replaced by an O- group, but then upon acidic workup, it's a diol. But the IR shows a carbonyl, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination forming an enol, but that doesn't directly lead to a ketone. Maybe it's more about forming an epoxide? No, because the IR doesn't show an epoxide's C-O-C peak around 1250 cm-1.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. If the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, then each elimination would form a ketone group. So, two Br's on adjacent carbons, elimination of two HBr's, forming a conjugated diene, but that doesn't fit the IR. Alternatively, maybe each Br is on a carbon that, upon elimination, forms a carbonyl group. Wait, if each Br is on a CH2Br group attached to a bridge, then eliminating HBr from each would form a double bond between the two carbons. But that would not form a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think of the product's NMR. The 4.79 ppm is a triplet, 2H. That could be a CH2 next to an oxygen, like an ether or ester. The 10H between 2.41 and 2.23 ppm suggests perhaps some equivalent CH2 groups adjacent to a carbonyl. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another CH2 group, perhaps in a different environment.

Wait, the IR at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. So, product 1 is a ketone. So, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic ketone. Since adamantane is a diamondoid, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a ketone within the structure.

Wait, another approach: The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with KOH (excess) would likely cause an elimination reaction. Each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. For each Br, the base abstracts a beta hydrogen leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond. But adamantane's structure doesn't have available beta hydrogens on the bridgehead, so maybe this is not possible.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a single elimination, but that would leave one Br. Alternatively, perhaps it's a rearrangement where both Brs are involved in a ring expansion, leading to a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Fittig-like reaction, but that's for coupling two aryl halides, which doesn't fit here.

Wait, another angle: When dibromides react with excess base, sometimes they form epoxides, but that would require a neighboring group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a solvolysis to form a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I should think about the NMR signals. The 4.79 (2H) could be a CH2 group attached to an oxygen, like an ether or ester. The 10H at 2.4-2.2 ppm could be several equivalent CH2 groups adjacent to a carbonyl. The 1.94 (2H) might be a CH2 group further away.

Wait, one possibility is that product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone. But wait, 1,3-adamantane would have two ketone groups if both Brs were replaced. Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by an O group, but that would give a diol. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination to form a conjugated diene, but the IR doesn't support that.

Wait, perhaps it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but I don't think that applies here. Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen-like elimination.

Wait, let me think about the IR again. The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong, probably sharp peak, indicative of a ketone. So, product 1 is a ketone. So, the reaction must be converting the dibromide into a ketone.

So, let's imagine that each Br is on a carbon adjacent to another Br. Wait, in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps the two Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads. So, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from each adjacent carbon, leading to elimination of two HBr molecules and forming a double bond. But that would form an alkene, not a ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps each Br is on a CH2 group attached to the adamantane structure. Then, elimination of HBr from each CH2Br would form a carbonyl group. So, each CH2Br becomes a carbonyl. So, two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but that would require two elimination events. Each Br is on a CH2Br, so the base could abstract a hydrogen adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of a carbonyl.

So, for each Br, the structure is CH2Br attached to adamantane. KOH (strong base) deprotonates the adjacent hydrogen, leading to elimination of Br- and forming a carbonyl. So, each Br site becomes a ketone.

Wait, but if both Brs are on the same type of carbon, then product 1 would be 1,3-diketone adamantane? But wait, the NMR suggests only one carbonyl peak? No, the NMR doesn't have a peak for carbonyls because they are usually around 200 ppm, but the IR shows a strong peak, so that's fine.

Wait, the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 (2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen. But if product 1 is a diketone, then where does the CH2 come from? Hmm, perhaps the initial structure has more than just Br on the adamantane.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR data.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a double elimination, each Br leading to a carbonyl group, but that would require that each CH2Br becomes a carbonyl. So, two carbonyls in product 1. But the IR only shows one strong peak. Maybe they are equivalent, so only one peak.

But then, the NMR shows a triplet at 4.79 (2H). That could be a CH2 connected to an oxygen, perhaps an ether or an ester. Wait, but product 1 is a ketone. So, maybe product 1 is not a ketone, but an ester or something else.

Wait, but the IR says carbonyl, so it's a ketone, ester, amide, or similar. If the product is an ester, but that would require an alcohol and a carboxylic acid, which doesn't fit the KOH reaction.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the next steps to see if that helps.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is typically a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 is a ketone, so perhaps product 2 is the result of some alkylation or acylation.

Wait, but product 1 is a ketone. So, maybe product 2 is a dienone or a more substituted ketone. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acylation product. Wait, but without an acyl chloride, maybe not.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe product 1 is a diol, but the IR doesn't support that, as it shows a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but again, the IR doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, going back, maybe I'm overcomplicating the first step. Let me think about the product 1's NMR: 4.79 (2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen. The 1.94 (2H) could be a CH2 that's deshielded, perhaps near a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction could be a substitution where each Br is replaced by an O- group, but then acid workup would give a diol. But that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution with a different mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps it's an oxidative cleavage, but that would require something like Ozone, which is used later in the reaction steps.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on product 1. Maybe I should proceed to the next steps and see if that gives me any clues.

Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78Â°C, followed by dimethylsulfide, giving product 3. Ozone is used in ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond.

Wait, product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide. So if product 1 is a ketone, heating with a Lewis acid could induce some kind of rearrangement, possibly forming an enol or creating a conjugated system.

Wait, product 1 is a ketone. If product 2 has a double bond, then perhaps product 1 is a diol that upon treatment with Lewis acid forms an acetal or undergoes dehydration to form an alkene. But product 1's NMR doesn't show broad OH peaks, so it's likely not a diol.

Wait, but if product 1 is a ketone, how does product 2 get a double bond? Maybe product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and under Lewis acid conditions, it undergoes ring-opening or rearrangement to form a conjugated diene. Alternatively, maybe product 1 undergoes some elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, but product 1's NMR doesn't show any peaks indicative of a double bond. The IR shows a carbonyl, but no C=C peak around 1600 cm-1.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a compound that has a ring which, under Lewis acid conditions, becomes more reactive, leading to the formation of a double bond upon heating.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, and product 2 is a more substituted diene. Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

But I'm not entirely certain about product 1 and 2. Let me try to map this out.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 has a double bond. Ozonolysis of product 2 would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. Then, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR.

In product 3, after ozonolysis, possible structures could have carbonyl groups adjacent to CH2 or CH groups. The most deshielded proton would likely be near an electronegative group, like oxygen, or in an environment with high electron withdrawal.

Wait, ozonolysis of a diene (if product 2 is a diene) would typically break it into two carbonyl compounds. But depending on the diene's structure, the resulting carbonyl groups could have different adjacent groups.

But let me try to think about the NMR of product 3. The most deshielded proton would be the one closest to an electronegative atom or in an environment with high deshielding, such as near a carbonyl.

In ozonolysis, after work-up with dimethylsulfide, the products are typically aldehydes or ketones, depending on the substitution of the double bond.

Assuming product 2 is a diene, product 3 could be a dialdehyde or diketone, but more likely, if the diene is symmetric, product 3 might be a single carbonyl compound.

Wait, but product 3 is formed after ozonolysis of product 2. So, perhaps product 2 is a monoene. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

For example, if product 2 is a mono-alkene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. The resulting product 3 would have two carbonyls. The NMR of product 3 would have protons adjacent to these carbonyls.

The most deshielded proton would be the one next to the carbonyl, perhaps as a CH2 or CH group. The coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring protons.

If the CH2 group is adjacent to a carbonyl, each proton on the CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH2 protons. Let's say a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. If the CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, each H would be coupled with the two Hs on the same CH2 (geminal coupling, but usually negligible) and the adjacent CH2's Hs, which would be two Hs (so triplet).

Wait, but if each CH2 is adjacent to a carbonyl on one side, and maybe a CH2 or CH group on the other, the coupling could be more complex.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that the CH group is adjacent to a carbonyl, then each H on the CH would couple with adjacent protons.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group adjacent to two carbonyl groups. So, each H on the CH2 would be coupled with two Hs on the same CH2 (but geminal coupling is usually not observed, as they're equivalent) and the adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, but if it's a CH2 between two carbonyls, then each H on that CH2 would be coupled with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group. So, each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Wait, for example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, the central CH2 groups would each have two neighboring Hs on adjacent CH2 groups. So, each H would couple with two Hs, leading to a triplet.

But wait, in that case, all four Hs in the central CH2 groups would be equivalent, so they'd show up as a quartet, because each H is next to two Hs on each side. Wait, no, each H is adjacent to two Hs on one side.

Wait, correct me if I'm wrong, but in an ABX system, if you have a CH2-CH2 group, each CH2's Hs are adjacent to two Hs on the neighboring CH2. So, each H would be a triplet because it has two neighboring Hs on one side. But in reality, it's a quartet because each H is next to two Hs on each adjacent group.

Wait, no, let me think again. For a CH2-CH2 group, each H on the first CH2 is adjacent to two Hs on the second CH2. So, each H would split into a triplet. But if the two CH2 groups are equivalent, the splitting becomes a triplet of triplets? Or perhaps a sextet due to two neighboring CH2 groups each with two Hs.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think with an example. Suppose I have a structure like CH2-CH2, each CH2 connected to a carbonyl.

Each H on the first CH2 is adjacent to two Hs on the second CH2. So each H would split into a triplet (n=2, so 2+1=3). But wait, if the two CH2 groups are in a symmetrical environment, maybe the splitting is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are in a more complex environment, like being adjacent to two different groups. For instance, if the CH2 is next to a carbonyl and a CH group.

Wait, but perhaps the correct approach is to consider the coupling in the resulting product.

Assume that product 3 has a structure where a CH2 group is next to a carbonyl and another CH2 group. Then, each H in the CH2 would be coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But if there are other coupling partners, like the Hs on the same CH2, but those are equivalent and usually don't split the signal.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think of another approach.

In the initial steps, product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 could be an enone (conjugated enol ether), which upon ozonolysis would break into two carbonyl groups. Alternatively, if product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would yield two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 is a monoene, product 3 will have two carbonyl groups. But if product 2 is a diene, perhaps it's cleaved into more than two carbonyls, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe product 2 is a mono-alkene, and ozonolysis breaks it into two carbonyls. Then, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, and the most deshielded H would be adjacent to them.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the options given.

The options for the coupling pattern are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

So, what would cause a proton to be a triplet? If it's coupled with two equivalent protons. For example, a CH2 group next to another CH2 group.

If the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group next to another CH2 group with two Hs, then the H would be a triplet.

But if the H is coupled with two sets of two Hs each (like two different neighboring CH2 groups), then it might be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, another possibility: The H is part of a CH group that is adjacent to two CH2 groups. Each CH2 has two Hs, so the H would couple with each of those, leading to a doublet of doublets, which could appear as a quartet. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, if the H is coupled with two Hs from one group and two from another, it would be a triplet of triplets (each coupling splits the peak into triplet, and then each of those into triplets again, leading to a 9-line pattern, but in practice, it's observed as a triplet of triplets).

But I'm not entirely certain. Let me think of a specific structure.

Suppose after ozonolysis, product 3 has a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, the CH2 groups in the middle would each have two neighboring Hs. Each H on a CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 (but those are equivalent) and two Hs on the neighboring CH2. So, each H would be split by two Hs (from the same CH2) and two Hs (from the adjacent CH2). Wait, but wait, the same CH2's Hs are equivalent, so the splitting would be n+1 for each coupling. So, for the adjacent CH2, each H on the central CH2 is coupled with two Hs, leading to a triplet. But the same CH2's Hs are two, leading to another triplet. So the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, no. Because the same CH2's Hs are equivalent, they don't split each other. So each H is only coupled with the Hs from the adjacent CH2. Each H on the central CH2 is adjacent to two Hs on the neighboring CH2, so each H would be a triplet. But the central CH2 is itself two Hs, so perhaps each H is a triplet, but the two Hs in the central CH2 are equivalent, so the peak would be a triplet.

Wait, but that doesn't result in a triplet of triplets. Hmm.

Alternatively, if the H is coupled with two different sets of two Hs each, it would be a triplet of triplets. For example, if a CH is adjacent to two CH2 groups, each with two Hs, then each H would couple with two from one CH2 and two from another, leading to a triplet for each coupling, hence a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Another possibility: The most deshielded H is part of a CH group next to a carbonyl and a CH2 group. So, the H would be coupled with the two Hs from the CH2 group, resulting in a triplet.

But the options include a triplet, so that's a possibility.

Alternatively, if the H is part of a CH2 group next to a CH group, which has two Hs, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to think of the possible structures.

If product 3 is derived from ozonolysis of product 2, which came from product 1.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, product 2 is perhaps an enol ether or an alkene.

Wait, another angle: Product 1's 1H NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is probably a CH2-O group. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be several CH2 groups adjacent to a carbonyl or in a ring. The 1.94 (2H) could be a CH2 that's more shielded.

So, perhaps product 1 is a diethyl ketone or similar. Wait, but the structure is more likely to be adamantane-based.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with aluminum isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid. Maybe it induces ring expansion or forms an enol.

But if product 2 is an enol, it would have a double bond. Ozonolysis would break that, but enols are usually conjugated and might not give straightforward ozonolysis products.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond to form two carbonyl groups.

For example, if product 2 is 1,3-adamantanone with an added double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two ketones.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone (a ketone). Product 2 is a conjugated dienone, formed via some rearrangement under Lewis acid conditions. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, forming two carbonyl groups.

Assuming the structure after ozonolysis would have two ketone groups, the Hs adjacent to them would be deshielded.

Now, the most deshielded H would be next to a ketone, perhaps on a CH2 group.

In that case, each H on the CH2 would be next to two Hs on the same CH2 (no splitting) and two Hs on an adjacent CH2 group. So each H would be a triplet.

Wait, but if the CH2 is next to another CH2 group with two Hs, each H on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs, leading to a triplet.

So, in product 3, the most deshielded H would be a triplet.

But the options include triplet (A), triplet of triplets (B), doublet of triplets (C), pentet (D).

So, based on this reasoning, the answer would be a triplet. But wait, another possibility is that the H is coupled with two different sets of two Hs, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH group adjacent to two CH2 groups. Each CH2 has two Hs, so the H would couple with each set, leading to a doublet of doublets. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to two different CH2 groups, each contributing two Hs. So, each H would be coupled with two Hs (from one CH2) and two Hs (from another CH2), leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but that would require the H to be adjacent to two different CH2 groups, each with two Hs. For example, if the structure is CH2-C=O and also connected to another CH2 group. But that's getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH group that's adjacent to two CH2 groups, each with two Hs. So, the H would have two coupling constants, each leading to a triplet. That would result in a triplet of triplets.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely confident.

Another approach: Looking at the options, the most common coupling pattern for a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 is a triplet. So, perhaps the correct answer is triplet (A).

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps after ozonolysis, the structure has a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and a CH group, leading to more complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is a diketone with a CH2 group between them. Each CH2 H would be next to two Hs from the same group and two from the adjacent group. But as the same group's Hs are equivalent, the splitting comes from the adjacent group, leading to a triplet.

So, each H would be a triplet.

Thus, the coupling pattern would be a triplet.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH likely results in a double elimination of HBr, forming a ketone. The IR spectrum shows a strong absorption at 1720 cmâ»Â¹, consistent with a carbonyl group. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41â2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a ketone structure, possibly 1,3-adamantanone.

2. **Reaction with aluminum isopropoxide**: Heating the ketone with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely induces a rearrangement or forms an Î±,Î²-unsaturated ketone (enone). This product (product 2) contains a double bond, as it undergoes ozonolysis in the next step.

3. **Ozonolysis**: Ozonolysis of product 2 at -78Â°C followed by dimethylsulfide cleaves the double bond, forming product 3. Ozonolysis typically converts double bonds into carbonyl groups. If product 2 is an enone, product 3 would likely be a diketone or a compound with carbonyl groups.

4. **Coupling pattern in product 3**: The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. If this hydrogen is part of a CHâ group flanked by two equivalent CHâ groups, it would couple with two hydrogens from each adjacent CHâ, resulting in a triplet of triplets. This pattern arises because the hydrogen is coupled with two sets of two equivalent hydrogens, each set contributing a triplet splitting.

Given the reasoning above, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet of triplets**.

Answer: B
