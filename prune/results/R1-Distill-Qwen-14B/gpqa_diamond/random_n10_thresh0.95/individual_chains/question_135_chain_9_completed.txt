Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slowly.

The problem says the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by this Lagrangian: L(y) = -λf f(y)(ῡ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, that notation is a bit confusing. Oh right, I think that's probably a typo, and the correct form should be something like L = λ ψ_f† (ῡ + X) ψ_f, which is a Yukawa interaction. So the boson X couples to fermions via this term.

The mass of X is 6 GeV, and we need to find the kinematically allowed decays. So, the question is about what particles X can decay into, considering their masses.

In particle physics, a boson can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if the sum of the fermion masses is less than the mass of the boson. Because, you know, energy and conservation laws. So, if the fermion mass is too high, the boson can't decay into that pair because it doesn't have enough energy.

So, the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. Let's list out the possible fermions and their masses to see which ones are allowed.

Quarks: The up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), top (t) quarks. Their masses (approximate):

u: around 2 MeV (so negligible compared to 6 GeV)
d: about 4-5 MeV (also negligible)
s: around 95-100 MeV (negligible)
c: about 1.2-1.5 GeV
b: around 4.1-4.7 GeV
t: about 173 GeV (way too heavy)
So, top quark is out because 6 GeV is less than 173 GeV.

So for quarks, X can decay into c c-bar (since 1.5 GeV *2 is 3 GeV, which is under 6 GeV), but not into b b-bar because each b is about 4.5 GeV, so two would be 9 GeV, which is more than 6. So X can't decay into b quarks.

Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, X's mass is 6 GeV. So for a fermion pair, like f and f-bar, the total mass would be 2 * m_f. So, if 2 m_f ≤ m_X, then it's allowed.

So for c quarks: 2 * 1.5 GeV = 3 GeV ≤ 6 GeV → allowed.
For b quarks: 2 * 4.5 GeV = 9 GeV >6 GeV → not allowed.
t is even heavier, so also no.

What about leptons? Let's see:

Electron (e-): about 0.511 MeV → 2 * 0.511 is negligible, allowed.
Muon (mu-): about 105.7 MeV → 2*105.7=211.4 MeV <<6 GeV (which is 6000 MeV), so allowed.
Tau (tau-): about 1.78 GeV → 2 * 1.78 = 3.56 GeV ≤6 GeV → allowed.

So, for leptons, all three generations are allowed: e, mu, tau pairs.

So, for fermion decays:

Quarks: c c-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar. Wait, but wait, u and d are really light, but they are allowed since their total mass is negligible compared to 6 GeV. So X can decay into any of these.

But let's think about which fermions are present in the Standard Model. The interaction term given is L = λ ψ_f† (ῡ + X) ψ_f. So ψ_f is a fermion field. So X can interact with any fermion ψ_f as long as the term is present. But the problem probably implies that X couples to all fermions, not just some.

Wait, but in the Lagrangian, the interaction is written as between X and a fermion ψ_f. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the sum of their masses is less than 6 GeV.

So, possible fermion pairs: c c-bar (allowed), s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, and all three leptons (e, mu, tau) pairs.

Wait, but what about the bottom quark? As I thought earlier, 2 * m_b is about 8.5 GeV, which is larger than 6 GeV, so X can't decay into b b-bar.

So the allowed fermion pairs are:

c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, and e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau, e. Wait, but that includes b which we can't have. So A is incorrect.

Option B: c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau, mu, e. Yes, that's exactly what I thought. But wait, option B also includes c c-bar. So B is correct for fermion decays.

Wait, but let me check the options.

Option B: c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So that's all the allowed decays. So option B is a possibility.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is too heavy, so C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But b is too heavy, so D is incorrect.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me make sure. So X can decay into any fermion pair where 2 m_f <= m_X.

So, for quarks:

u: m_u ~2 MeV → 2m_u ~4 MeV <<6 GeV → allowed.
d: same as u, allowed.
s: ~100 MeV → 200 MeV <<6 GeV → allowed.
c: ~1.5 GeV → 3 GeV <6 → allowed.
b: ~4.5 GeV → 9 GeV >6 → not allowed.

So X can decay into u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar, and the leptons e, mu, tau.

So the possible decay channels are: c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Which is exactly option B.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option B says: c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's correct. So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction between \( X \) and fermions is described by the Lagrangian term \( \mathcal{L} = \lambda \bar{\psi}_f (\upsilon + X) \psi_f \), which indicates that \( X \) can couple to any fermion \( \psi_f \). For a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair \( f \bar{f} \), the total mass of the fermion pair \( 2m_f \) must be less than or equal to the mass of the boson \( m_X \).

### Step 1: Analyze fermion masses and allowed decays
The approximate masses of fermions in the Standard Model are:
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( \sim 4-5 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( \sim 95-100 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.2-1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.1-4.7 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy for \( X \))
- Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)

For \( X \) with \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), the condition \( 2m_f \leq m_X \) determines the allowed decays:
- \( u \bar{u} \): \( 2m_u \sim 4 \, \text{MeV} \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → allowed.
- \( d \bar{d} \): \( 2m_d \sim 8-10 \, \text{MeV} \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → allowed.
- \( s \bar{s} \): \( 2m_s \sim 190-200 \, \text{MeV} \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → allowed.
- \( c \bar{c} \): \( 2m_c \sim 3 \, \text{GeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → allowed.
- \( b \bar{b} \): \( 2m_b \sim 8.2-9.4 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → not allowed.
- \( t \bar{t} \): \( 2m_t \sim 346 \, \text{GeV} \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → not allowed.
- \( e^+ e^- \): \( 2m_e \sim 1.022 \, \text{MeV} \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → allowed.
- \( \mu^+ \mu^- \): \( 2m_\mu \sim 211.4 \, \text{MeV} \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → allowed.
- \( \tau^+ \tau^- \): \( 2m_\tau \sim 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → allowed.

Thus, the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are:
\[
X \rightarrow u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c}, e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-, \tau^+\tau^-.
\]

### Step 2: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > m_X \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), which matches the allowed decays. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t \gg m_X \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Final Answer
The correct option is **B**, as it accurately lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
