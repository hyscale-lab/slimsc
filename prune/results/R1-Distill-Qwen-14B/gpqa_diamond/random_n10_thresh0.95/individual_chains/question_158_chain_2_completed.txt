Okay, I'm trying to tackle this question about transcription factors and mutations. Let me break it down step by step.

So, the scenario is about a transcription factor subunit that's inactive until it gets a signal. When it's phosphorylated on serine residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, moves to the nucleus, and helps with gene transcription.

There are two mutations mentioned here: mutation X and mutation Y. 

Mutation X is a missense in the transactivation domain and is recessive loss-of-function. Recessive means that both alleles need to be mutated for the phenotype to show. So in a heterozygous state, the wild-type allele would still function.

Then there's mutation Y, which is in the dimerization domain and acts as a dominant-negative. Dominant-negative mutations interfere with the normal function of the protein, even when only one copy is mutated. So if someone has one wild-type and one Y-mutated allele, the Y allele would mess up the function.

The question is asking, what molecular phenotype occurs when mutation Y is present?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Change of conformation and gain-of-function. Well, dominant-negative usually doesn't lead to gain-of-function. It's more about disrupting the normal process. So I'm not sure, but I think this might not be it.

Option B: Protein degradation and loss of wild-type. Hmm, I'm not sure if dominant-negative causes degradation. I think dominant-negative mutations might interfere with the protein's ability to function, maybe by preventing proper folding or dimerization. But protein degradation isn't the primary effect here. Maybe this isn't the right choice.

Option C: Loss of dimerization and wild-type phenotype. Wait, no. If dimerization is disrupted, then the transcription factor can't function. So the phenotype would be loss of function, not wild-type. So this option seems incorrect.

Option D: Protein aggregation and loss of function. Aggregation could happen if the mutated protein forms misfolded structures that aggregate, preventing the wild-type proteins from working. That sounds plausible. Dominant-negative mutations often lead to this because the mutant proteins interfere with the normal ones.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The mutation Y is in the dimerization domain. So the mutant might not be able to dimerize correctly. If it's a dominant-negative, the wild-type and mutant proteins might form aggregates or nonfunctional dimers. So the normal transcription factor can't function because the mutant is interfering.

So the presence of Y would lead to the inability of the transcription factor to dimerize properly, leading to loss of function. But how about the options? Option D says protein aggregation and loss of function. That makes sense because the mutant proteins might cause the wild-type ones to aggregate, making them nonfunctional.

Option B mentions protein degradation, but I don't remember if dominant-negative mutations typically cause that. Maybe more about misfolding and aggregation. So D could be the answer.

So the correct answer is D: protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype.


The question involves a transcription factor subunit that becomes active upon phosphorylation, leading to dimerization, nuclear translocation, and gene transcription. Two mutations are described: mutation X, a recessive loss-of-function mutation in the transactivation domain, and mutation Y, a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain. The task is to determine the molecular phenotype caused by mutation Y.

Mutation Y, being dominant-negative, disrupts the function of the transcription factor even when only one allele is mutated. Since it is located in the dimerization domain, it likely prevents proper dimerization or causes the formation of nonfunctional dimers. This interference can lead to the aggregation of misfolded proteins, which in turn prevents the wild-type transcription factor from functioning normally. This results in a loss-of-function phenotype.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A** suggests a gain-of-function phenotype, which is inconsistent with the dominant-negative nature of mutation Y.
- **Option B** mentions protein degradation, but dominant-negative mutations typically disrupt function through misfolding or aggregation rather than degradation.
- **Option C** claims a wild-type phenotype, which is incorrect because the dominant-negative mutation disrupts normal function.
- **Option D** describes protein aggregation and loss of function, which aligns with the expected outcome of mutation Y interfering with dimerization and causing misfolded protein aggregates.

Thus, the most likely molecular phenotype caused by mutation Y is protein aggregation and loss of function.

Answer: D
