Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal, but the angles between them are the same and not necessarily 90 degrees. So it's a type of crystal system where all three axes are equal, but the angles can vary.

The given interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance in a crystal usually refers to the distance between atoms along the basis vectors, right? So in a rhombohedral system, the lattice constant 'a' is the same for all three axes. So a = 10 Angstrom here.

The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Hmm, but wait... in a rhombohedral system, all three angles are equal, which they are here. So that makes sense.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I remember that the interplanar distance (d_hkl) is calculated using the formula derived from the structure factor. The formula is something like d_hkl = a/(sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (h²*α² + k²*β² + l²*γ²)/2 )) or wait, no, maybe that's not quite right. Alternatively, maybe it's using the reciprocal of the metric tensor.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the interplanar distance in any crystal system is given by:

1/d^2 = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (h² cos^2 α + k² cos^2 β + l² cos^2 γ) / (a² sin^2 θ), but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is based on the reciprocal of the metric tensor components.

The metric tensor (also known as the Gram matrix) for a crystal system relates the reciprocal lattice vectors to the direct lattice vectors. The general formula for the interplanar distance is:

d^2 = (a^2 b^2 c^2) / ( (h^2 (b·c)^2 + ... )) No, that's not right either. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The standard formula for the interplanar distance in terms of the Miller indices (hkl) is given by:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2/l^2) + (k^2/m^2) + (l^2/n^2) - 2 hk cosθ/(lm) - 2 hk cosφ/(ln) - 2 kl cosψ/(mn)) )

Wait, no, that's for a general hexagonal system or something else. I'm getting confused because I'm trying to recall the general formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

1/(d_{hkl})^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) - (hk (cos α + cos β ) )/(a^2 something) ?

I think another approach is the use of the reciprocal lattice vectors. The (hkl) plane corresponds to the reciprocal lattice vector components (h, k, l). The interplanar distance d is given by the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector's projection onto the plane perpendicular to (hkl), but I'm not exactly sure how to compute that.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to construct the metric tensor. The metric tensor for a rhombohedral system can be represented as a 3x3 matrix. Since all a, b, c are equal (a = b = c) and all angles are equal (alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees), the metric tensor will have a specific form.

The metric tensor (G) in a crystal system is given by:

G = [ [a², a b cos γ, a c cos β ],
       [a b cos γ, b², b c cos α ],
       [a c cos β, b c cos α, c² ] ]

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0 (let's denote this as a for simplicity), and alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees.

So substituting, each of the off-diagonal terms becomes a² cos 30°.

So the metric tensor G becomes:

G = [ [a², a² cos 30°, a² cos 30° ],
       [a² cos 30°, a², a² cos 30° ],
       [a² cos 30°, a² cos 30°, a² ] ]

Now, the reciprocal lattice vectors' components (h, k, l) are related to the metric tensor. The interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by the inverse square root of (h² + k² + l²) in reciprocal space, but adjusted by the metric tensor.

Wait, no. The formula for d_{hkl} is given by:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk cos(180 - alpha) + ... ) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the reciprocal of the metric tensor. The (hkl) plane corresponds to the reciprocal lattice vector components, and the interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the magnitude of this vector in the reciprocal lattice.

Alternatively, the interplanar distance d is given by:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(h k cos α + h l cos β + k l cos γ) )

Wait, wait. I'm getting mixed up between different systems. I think the correct formula for a rhombohedral system is:

1/d_{hkl}^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) * cos θ,

where θ is the angle between the axes, which in this case is 30 degrees for all angles. Wait, no. I think the formula is more about the dot products between the reciprocal vectors.

Alternatively, let me recall the formula correctly. For any cubic lattice, the interplanar distance is a/sqrt(h² +k² +l²). But for non-cubic systems like rhombohedral, the formula is more complex.

The correct formula, as I recall, is:

1/d^2 = (h² +k² +l²) * (1/(a²)) - 2 hk cos γ/(a²) - 2 hl cos β/(a²) - 2 kl cos alpha/(a²) )

Wait, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the general formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 (1/a^2) ) + (k^2 (1/b^2) ) + (l^2 (1/c^2) ) - 2 hk (cos gamma)/(a b) - 2 hl (cos beta)/(a c) - 2 kl (cos alpha)/(b c) ) )

In our case, a = b = c =10 Angstrom, and alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees.

So substituting, the equation becomes:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (2hk cos 30)/(a²) - (2hl cos 30)/(a²) - (2kl cos 30)/(a²) )

Wait, but wait, the denominator in the formula is the sum of (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) minus the cross terms, which are 2 hk cos gamma/(a b) etc.

Wait, so given that a = b = c = a0, and angles alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees, the formula becomes:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²)/(a0^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ / a0^2 )

Where θ is 30 degrees.

So for the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1.

Plugging these into the formula:

d^2 = 1 / [ ( (1+1+1)/a0^2 ) - 2( (1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 ) * cos 30 ) / a0^2 ) ]

Simplify the numerator inside the square root:

= (3)/(a0^2) - 2*(3 * cos 30)/(a0^2 )

Factor out 1/a0²:

= [3 - 6 cos30 ] / a0²

So d^2 = 1 / [ (3 - 6 cos30 ) / a0² ] = a0² / (3 - 6 cos30 )

Thus, d = a0 / sqrt(3 - 6 cos30 )

Wait, let me compute that.

First, compute cos30 degrees. Cos 30 is √3/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 3 - 6*(√3/2) = 3 - 3√3.

So denominator inside the square root is 3 - 3√3 ≈ 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, that can't be right because d^2 can't be negative. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I do the sign correctly?

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the formula. Because if the angles are all 30 degrees, perhaps I should have taken the angles between the axes as 180 - 30 = 150 degrees? Because sometimes the angles in the metric tensor are considered as the angles between the reciprocal vectors, which are 180 minus the direct lattice angles.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me think again about the angles in the metric tensor.

In the metric tensor, the angles between the vectors are the angles between the direct lattice vectors as they are. So, for a rhombohedral lattice with angles alpha, beta, gamma, the metric tensor uses these angles as is.

Wait, but in the formula for the interplanar distance, the angles between the lattice vectors (a, b, c) are used as the angles in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Let me re-examine.

The formula I used earlier:

1/d^2 = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2 hk cos gamma/(a b) - 2 hl cos beta/(a c) - 2 kl cos alpha/(b c)

In our case, since a = b = c = 10 Angstrom, and alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees, the formula becomes:

1/d² = [ (1 + 1 + 1) / (10^2) ] - 2 [ (1*1 cos30) + (1*1 cos30) + (1*1 cos30) ] / (10^2 )

Simplify:

1/d² = (3/100) - 2*(3 * (√3/2 )) / 100

Simplify further:

Each cos30 is √3/2. So 3 * cos30 is 3*(√3/2 )= (3√3)/2.

Multiply by 2: 2 * (3√3/2) =
