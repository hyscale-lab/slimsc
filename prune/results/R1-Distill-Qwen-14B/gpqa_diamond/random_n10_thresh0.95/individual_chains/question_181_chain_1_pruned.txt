Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how their flux changes when a certain reaction stops. Hmm. Let me try to break it down.

So, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Then, we're looking at the ratio of neutrino flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A to D, with various ratios.

Wait, I remember that the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton cycle in the Sun's core fusion. The pp chain has several branches. Oh right, the pp-I branch produces mainly positrons, pp-II produces neutrons and protons, and pp-III is the dominant one, which produces gamma rays. Oh wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think: the dominant pp reaction is the one that produces two protons, a positron, and a neutrino. So that's the main source of high-energy neutrinos.

But wait, the pp-III branch—I think it's the main branch where two protons collide, one becomes a neutron, emits a positron and a neutrino. So, the neutrinos from the Sun are mostly from this branch, called the pep (proton-electron-proton) branch? Or wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Oh, the main proton-proton chain produces a lot of neutrinos, especially the pp-I branch which is the most significant, producing about 90% of the neutrinos. The other branches are less dominant.

So if the pp-III branch stops, but others remain, what happens to the neutrino flux? Wait, the question says only the pp-III branch stops. So, the other branches (like pp-I and pp-II) continue as normal.

But wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think about the neutrino production. The main source is the pp-I branch, which produces a lot of neutrinos. The pp-III is a minor branch, I think. Wait, no, perhaps the pp-III is a different part of the cycle. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me recall: the pp chain starts with two protons fusing. The dominant process is where a proton captures a proton to form a diproton, which then emits a positron and a neutrino, turning into two separate protons. That's the pp-I branch, and it produces a lot of neutrinos. The pp-II branch is another possible path, but it's less significant because it requires a neutron, which is less abundant. The pp-III branch is perhaps another process, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the neutrino energies.

Wait, the neutrino energies from the Sun are in the MeV range. The pp-I branch emits neutrinos with energies around 0.42 MeV (420 keV), I think. The other branches, like the CNO cycle, produce higher-energy neutrinos, but wait, no, the CNO cycle is in the outer regions, but I'm not sure if they contribute much to the neutrino flux compared to the pp chain.

Wait, no, the CNO cycle is a different fusion process, but the majority of the Sun's energy comes from the pp chain, which is in the core. So the neutrinos from the Sun are mostly from the pp chain.

So the main neutrinos are from the pp-I branch, producing about 420 keV neutrinos. The other branches, perhaps like the pp-II and pp-III, might produce higher or lower energy neutrinos? Or maybe I'm mixing up the energies.

Wait, the pp-I branch produces 420 keV neutrinos. The pp-II branch would have a different energy because it involves a neutron. So for the pp-II branch, maybe the neutrino energy is higher. For example, the reaction might be something like p + p → 2p + e+ + νe, but that's similar to pp-I. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-II branch emits a higher-energy neutrino. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-II and pp-III branches are not as dominant as pp-I, so their neutrino contributions are smaller.

Wait, but the question says that the pp-III branch stopped. So, assuming that the pp-III branch is a source of neutrinos, and if it stops, the flux from that source would drop, but the other sources (like pp-I and pp-II) continue. So, what neutrino energies are associated with the pp-III branch?

I remember that the Solar neutrinos observed by experiments like SNO have different energy spectra. The 7Be neutrinos are around 0.9 MeV, and the Beryllium-7 decay produces neutrinos with higher energies, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the main pp neutrinos are around 0.4 MeV, and the other branches produce higher energies.

Wait, let me think. The main proton-proton chain is pp-I, which produces a neutrino with about 0.42 MeV. The pp-II branch, which involves a neutron, produces a neutrino with about 0.8 MeV. Oh, that's a possibility. So, if the pp-II branch is active, it contributes neutrinos in the 0.8 MeV range. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact energies.

Wait, but the question is about the flux in two bands: 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV) and 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV). So, band 1 is 0.7-0.8 MeV, and band 2 is 0.8-0.9 MeV.

Now, if the pp-III branch stops, what does that affect? I think that the pp-II branch, which produces higher-energy neutrinos, might be the one affected. Wait, no, the question says pp-III is stopping. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch is the same as the pp-II branch? Or maybe I'm getting the branches mixed up. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is the one that produces the higher-energy neutrinos.

Let me try to find out about the pp chain branches and their neutrino energies.

The pp chain has three main branches. The dominant one is the pp-I branch:

p + p → 2p + e+ + νe (this is the main branch, about 90% of neutrinos).

The other branches are:

pp-II: p + p → 2p + e+ + νe via a neutron intermediate. The reaction is p + p → 2p + e+ + νe via the neutron. Wait, no, perhaps it's p + p → neutron + p + e+ + νe. So the neutrino energy in this case is higher because the neutron's binding energy is higher. So the neutrino energy would be around 1.4 MeV? Or perhaps 0.8 MeV? I'm a bit unsure.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-II branch produces neutrinos with energies around 0.8 MeV. So if the pp-III branch is another minor branch, perhaps it produces even higher energy neutrinos, like around 0.9 MeV? Or maybe not. This is getting a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the main contributors to the flux in the given bands.

If the pp-III branch stops, and it's a source of neutrinos in the 0.8-0.9 MeV range, then the flux in band 2 (0.8-0.9 MeV) would be reduced, while the flux in band 1 (0.7-0.8 MeV) remains more or less the same.

Wait, but the question says the pp-III branch stopped, not the pp-II. So what if the pp-III branch is the one that contributes to the higher energy neutrinos, around 0.8-0.9 MeV. So if pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 (0.8-0.9) would drop, while band 1 (0.7-0.8) is from pp-I and pp-II, which are still active.

So let's think:

- pp-I produces neutrinos around 0.42 MeV, so in band 1 (0.7-0.8 MeV), this is higher than that. So maybe pp-I doesn't contribute here.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's re-examine the neutrino energies.

Wait, the dominant neutrino flux is from the main pp branch (pp-I) at about 0.42 MeV. Then, other branches, like the pp-II, contribute higher energy neutrinos. For example, the pp-II branch produces neutrinos around 0.8 MeV. And perhaps the pp-III branch produces even higher energy neutrinos, maybe around 0.9 MeV, which would be in band 2.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, then the neutrinos in band 2 (0.8-0.9) would lose their main source. But the pp-II branch's neutrinos are around 0.8 MeV, which would fall into band 2 as well. Hmm, but then the flux in band 2 would be affected by both pp-II and pp-III.

Wait, but in reality, the pp-II branch is less significant than pp-I, and perhaps the neutrino energy is around 1.4 MeV? Or is it lower?

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-II branch produces neutrinos around 0.8 MeV. So, if the pp-III branch is stopped, and it produces, say, 0.9 MeV neutrinos, then the flux in band 2 (0.8-0.9) would lose that contribution. But the pp-II branch would still be contributing around 0.8 MeV, so some neutrinos in band 2 would still come from pp-II.

Wait, but the question states that only the pp-III branch is stopped. So, what were the contributions before and after?

Assuming that band 1 (0.7-0.8 MeV) is mainly from the pp-II branch, and band 2 (0.8-0.9 MeV) is from both pp-II and pp-III. If pp-III is stopped, then band 2's flux would be reduced, while band 1's flux remains the same.

Wait, but if pp-II produces neutrinos around 0.8 MeV, then they would appear in band 2 (0.8-0.9) and perhaps also in the lower part of band 1 (0.7-0.8)?

No, 0.8 is the upper limit of band 1 and the lower limit of band 2. So, if the pp-II neutrinos are exactly at 0.8 MeV, they would be in band 2. But the question's bands are 700-800 KeV (0.7-0.8 MeV) and 800-900 KeV (0.8-0.9 MeV).

So if pp-II produces neutrinos at around 0.8 MeV, they would be in band 2.

But if pp-III produces higher energies, say 0.9 MeV, then stopping it would reduce the flux in band 2.

Wait, but if pp-III is a minor branch, then its contribution is small.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is not a main contributor. So when it stops, the dominant neutrino sources are pp-I and pp-II.

So, the main neutrinos in the Sun are from pp-I (0.42 MeV), pp-II (0.8 MeV), and pp-III (maybe 0.9 MeV?).

But without knowing exactly, perhaps I should think about the flux in each band.

In the scenario, the pp-III branch stops. So any neutrinos from this branch would no longer be produced.

If the pp-III neutrinos are in band 2 (0.8-0.9 MeV), then the flux in band 2 would decrease. Before the stoppage, the flux in band 2 was a sum of pp-II and pp-III contributions. After the stoppage, it's just pp-II.

But how much of each?

Assuming that pp-III produces a small fraction of the neutrinos compared to pp-II. So, perhaps the flux in band 2 was mainly from pp-II, and pp-III was a small part. So if pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 would decrease by the amount of pp-III's contribution, but the majority is still from pp-II.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of band 1 to band 2.

Before the stoppage:

Flux_band1 = F1 = mainly from pp-I?

Wait, no. pp-I is at 0.42, which is below band1 (0.7-0.8). So pp-I doesn't contribute to band1. So where does band1's flux come from?

Ah, maybe the question is considering the neutrinos that are in the bands when they reach Earth, but the energies would be lower due to the inverse square law and other effects. Wait, no, the question says the flux is defined as the number per cm² per second, so we're looking at the production rates, not the detection rates.

Wait, but the neutrinos are produced with certain energies, and their flux depends on their production rates.

So, if band 1 is 0.7-0.8 MeV, which is higher than the 0.42 MeV from pp-I. So, pp-I doesn't contribute to band 1. So what produces neutrinos in that band?

Ah, perhaps the other branches. So, pp-II produces around 0.8 MeV, which is in band 2. Hmm, but band 1 is 0.7-0.8, which is just below.

Wait, perhaps pp-III produces neutrinos in band 1, and pp-II in band 2. Or perhaps I'm getting the energies wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-I has 0.42 MeV, which is too low for both bands. So band1 (0.7-0.8 MeV) and band2 (0.8-0.9) must be from other branches like pp-II and pp-III.

If pp-II produces 0.8 MeV, which is in band2, and pp-III produces 0.9 MeV, which is in band2.

Wait, but then band1 would have less contribution. Maybe there's another source.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in band1 (0.7-0.8), and pp-II produces in band2.

If that's the case, then when pp-III stops, band1's flux would drop significantly, while band2's remains same. So the ratio F1/F2 would decrease.

Alternatively, perhaps the main source for band1 is from the pp-III, and band2 is from pp-II.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try a different approach.

The question is about the ratio of the flux in band1 to band2 when the pp-III branch stops.

Before the pp-III stopped, both bands would have some contributions. Let's say:

- Band1 (0.7-0.8) is mainly from pp-III.
- Band2 (0.8-0.9) is mainly from pp-II.

But after pp-
