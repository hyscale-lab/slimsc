Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Let me break down the information given.

Both planets are Earth-like and have the same mass. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period, three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3. 

The stars they're orbiting have the same radius. But the star hosting Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's star. Wait, but same radius? Hmm. Oh, because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved. So both stars have same R, but different masses. Star 1 (Planet_1's star) is more massive, twice that of Star 2 (Planet_2's star).

Transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The probability is higher when the planet's orbit is edge-on. But how does that relate to the parameters given?

I remember that the transit probability formula is P ∝ (R_p / a)^2 * (something else?), but wait, more accurately, the probability that a planet transits is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is negligible compared to R_star, it's approximately R_star / a.

Wait, no, I think the probability is proportional to (R_star / a), because the planet has to pass in front of the star. So the probability increases with a larger star (since R_star is bigger) and decreases with a larger a (since a is the orbital distance). 

Wait, what's the exact formula? The transit probability is given by the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance (a), multiplied by some factor based on the inclination. But more accurately, the probability is (R_star + R_planet) / (a * sqrt(1 - e²)), but since both have circular orbits, e=0. So it's (R_star) / a, because R_planet is much smaller.

So the probability is approximately (R* / a), where R* is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital radius. But wait, if the host stars have the same radius, then the probability depends inversely on a. So the planet with a smaller a (closer in) has a higher probability of transiting.

Now, how does the orbital period relate to a? Using Kepler's third law: (P^2) / (a^3) = (4π²)/(G(M + m)), but since M >> m (planet mass is much smaller), it's approximately P² = (4π² a³)/(G M*), where M* is the star's mass.

So a³ = (G M* P²)/(4π²). Taking cube roots, a is proportional to (M* P²)^(1/3).

So a = k * (M* P²)^(1/3), where k is a constant.

Since we're comparing a1 and a2, let's write:

a1 = k * (M1 (P1)^2)^(1/3)
a2 = k * (M2 (P2)^2)^(1/3)

Given:
M1 = 2 M2 (because Planet_1's star is twice as massive)
P1 = P2 / 3 (since Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter)

So substituting M1 = 2 M2 and P1 = P2/3 into a1:

a1 = k * (2 M2 * ( (P2/3) )² )^(1/3)
= k * (2 M2 * (P2²)/(9) )^(1/3)
= k * ( (2/9) M2 P2² )^(1/3 )
= k * ( (2/9) )^(1/3) * (M2 P2² )^(1/3 )

Now a2 is:

a2 = k * ( M2 (P2)^2 )^(1/3 )

So a1 / a2 = [ (2/9)^(1/3) * (M2 P2² )^(1/3 ) ] / [ (M2 P2² )^(1/3 ) ] 

The (M2 P2² ) terms cancel, so:

a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) 

Wait, 2/9 is (2)/(3²) → 2/(3^2) = 2/9. So (2/9)^(1/3) is equal to cube root of (2/9) ≈ cube root of ~0.222 ≈ 0.606.

So a1 is about 0.606 times a2. Since a1 is smaller than a2, the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher because the probability is inversely proportional to a.

But let me think again: the transit probability is proportional to (R*/a) since R* is same for both, the probability is inversely proportional to a.

So Planet_1 has a smaller a, so (R*/a) is larger, so higher probability.

So now, what's the ratio of probabilities?

Probability_1 / Probability_2 = ( (R*/a1) ) / ( (R*/a2) ) ) 

= a2 / a1 

Because R* is same and cancels.

We know a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3). So a2/a1 = 1 / (2/9)^(1/3) = (9/2)^(1/3) 

Let me compute (9/2)^(1/3). 9/2 is 4.5. Cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.65.

So (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65. So Probability_1 / Probability_2 ≈ 1.65.

Which means Planet_1 has about 1.65 times higher probability than Planet_2.

Wait, but let me double-check the ratio. If a1 is (2/9)^(1/3) * a2, then a2 = a1 * (9/2)^(1/3). So a2 is larger than a1.

So when we compute the probability ratio: P1 = (R*/a1), P2 = (R*/a2). So P1/P2 = a2/a1 = (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65.

So P1 is about 1.65 times P2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

So the researchers should choose Planet_1, as it's more likely to transit.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times, which is much higher. Hmm, why? Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me recheck the a1 and a2 computation.

Another approach: using Kepler's law for a in terms of period and mass.

a^3 = (G(M + m) P^2)/(4π²). Since m is negligible, a^3 ∝ (M* P²).

So a1^3 / a2^3 = (M1 P1²) / (M2 P2²)

Given M1 = 2 M2, P1 = P2/3.

So a1^3 / a2^3 = (2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 ) / ( M2 P2^2 )

= [2 * (P2² /9) * M2 ] / [ M2 P2² ]

The M2 and P2² terms cancel, leaving 2/9.

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3). As before.

So a2 is larger than a1 by a factor of (9/2)^(1/3) ≈
