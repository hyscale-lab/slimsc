Okay, so I've got this Michael addition problem in front of me. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question has three different reactions, and I need to figure out the products for each. Then, I have to match them with the options given. Let me take it step by step.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So the nucleophile, which would be the enolate in this case, attacks the beta position of the other carbonyl compound.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor. Its structure is CH2(CO2Me)2. When NaOEt is present, it deprotonates the alpha hydrogen to form the enolate. The enolate would attack the beta position of the acceptor, which is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

So the acceptor is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me think about its structure. The acrylate part is CH2=CH-CO2Me, but with the substituents. Wait, no, wait. The formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but the substituent is at the 3-position. Wait, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR, right? So 3-(p-tolyl) would mean that the substituent is on the beta carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group attached to the beta carbon? Or perhaps, wait, the carbon chain is longer. Let me think again.

Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C3. Wait, no, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So if it's 3-(p-tolyl), then the substituent is on the third carbon. But wait, that would make it CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? Or is the numbering different? Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. No, wait, the acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So if it's 3-(p-tolyl), that would mean the substituent is on the third carbon, but the acrylate is only three carbons: CH2=CH-COOR. So perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, that's not right. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the double bond is between carbons 1 and
