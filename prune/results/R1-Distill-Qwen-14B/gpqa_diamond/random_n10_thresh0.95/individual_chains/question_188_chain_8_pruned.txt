Okay, so I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that the interplanar distance formula involves the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. But wait, rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal, right? So the lattice is kind of a cube but with all angles the same and a= b= c.

Wait, the interatomic distance given is 10 Angstrom. But wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance would be the same as the lattice parameter 'a' because each atom is at the corners. Oh, right, because it's a simple cubic structure, so a is the distance between atoms along each axis. So a = 10 Angstrom.

The angles are all 30 degrees. Oh wait, but in the formula for interplanar distance, the angle terms come into play when the structure isn't cubic. So for a general rhombohedral lattice, the formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Wait, but since all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees, that simplifies things. So cos 30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So the formula becomes:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2hk*(cos 30) - 2hl*(cos 30) - 2kl*(cos 30) )

But wait, for a rhombohedral system, sometimes the formula uses a different approach because of the symmetry. Alternatively, maybe I should use the general formula for interplanar spacing:

d_{hkl} = (1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hk cos β + hk cos γ) )) ) * (1/a)

Wait, no, wait, no. Let me get this straight. The formula I remember is:

d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos γ_1 + hk cos γ_2 + hl cos γ_3 ) )

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the angles. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = [ (a²) / ( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hk cos β + hl cos γ) ) ]^(1/2)

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me recall the standard formula for interplanar distance in a crystal lattice.

The general formula for interplanar spacing in a cubic system is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² ), but that's only for a cubic system where all angles are 90 degrees and a = b = c.

But in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is not cubic. So the formula must account for the angles. The general formula is:

d_{hkl} = [ (1/(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hk cos β - 2hk cos γ )) ]^(1/2) * (1/a)

Wait, no, perhaps I should think about the reciprocal. Let me get this right.

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( ( (h/a)^2 + (k/b)^2 + (l/c)^2 ) - 2( (hk cos γ)/(a b) ) - 2( (hl cos β)/(a c) ) - 2( (kl cos α)/(b c) ) )

But since in the rhombohedral system, a = b = c = 10 Angstrom, and α = β = γ = 30 degrees.

So substituting a = b = c = 10, and all angles 30°, the formula simplifies.

So let's substitute:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2( (h k cos α + h l cos β + k l cos γ ) )/(a²) )

Because a = b = c, so each denominator becomes a squared. So factor out 1/a²:

d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Ah, that's the formula.

So for the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1.

So substituting these values:

d = a / sqrt( 1² +1² +1² - 2*(1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30) )

So compute the numerator and denominator.

Compute the numerator: a is 10.

Denominator inside the sqrt:

1 +1 +1  = 3.

Then subtract 2*( cos30 + cos30 + cos30 )

Each cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 2*(3 * cos30) = 6 * (sqrt(3)/2) )= 3*sqrt(3) ≈ 5.196.

So denominator: 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because the denominator inside the square root would be negative, and you can't take the square root of a negative number. That can't happen, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, that can't be possible. So perhaps I messed up the formula somewhere.

Wait, wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again.

The correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Wait, but in our case, alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. So:

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 - 2*( (1*1 cos30) + (1*1 cos30) + (1*1 cos30) )

So that's 3 - 2*(3 * cos30 )

So 3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 - 3*sqrt(3)

sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 3*1.732 is about 5.196.

So 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, but that gives a negative value under the square root. That can't be possible. So that suggests that maybe the (111) plane isn't allowed in this structure, but that's not possible. So I must have the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the signs. Let me check another source in my mind. Oh wait! I think I remember that the general formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system is:

d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ), where θ is the angle between the axes. Wait, no, that can't be right because in the cubic case, when θ is 90 degrees, cos θ is zero, and the formula reduces to the cubic case, which is correct.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. The correct formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = [ (1/(h² + k² + l²) + 2( (hk cos α) + (hl cos β) + (kl cos γ) )) ) ]^(-1/2) ) * a.

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = [ (a^2)/(h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ)) ) ]^(1/2)

Wait, that makes more sense. Because for a cubic system (α=β=γ=90),
