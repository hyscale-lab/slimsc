Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance in some way. Let me think.

Parallax, plx, is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. I think the formula for distance in parsecs is distance = 1 / plx. Oh right, so a star with a parallax of 1 arcsecond is 1 parsec away, and one with 0.5 would be 2 parsecs, etc.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So if plx increases (meaning the star is farther away), how does the number of stars in that range change?

Wait, the stars are uniformly distributed. That probably means that their spatial density is uniform, right? So the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume.

But wait, when considering parallax, we're dealing with how the density translates into the parallax space. Because plx is inversely proportional to distance, we have to think about how the volume element changes with distance.

Let me model this. Let's say I have a small change in parallax, dplx. I want to find out how many stars are in that dplx range.

Since plx = 1/distance (but wait, no, more accurately, plx (in arcseconds) is approximately 1 / (distance in parsecs). So, distance d = 1 / plx. So, if plx is small, the distance is large.

Now, considering a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr. The volume of that shell is 4πd² dr. Since the number of stars is proportional to the volume, the number in this shell would be n * 4πd² dr, where n is the number density (stars per volume).

But I want to express this in terms of parallax. Since d = 1/plx, then dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, that's because if d increases, plx decreases. So when plx is a function of d, plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. The derivative dd/dplx = -1/(plx^2).

So dr = (dd/dplx) dplx = (-1/plx²) dplx. Wait, but since we're dealing with small changes, maybe I should just substitute the variables.

So the volume element in terms of plx would be 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dr). But dr is related to dplx. Let me think again.

We have d = 1/plx → plx = 1/d.

Taking the derivative of plx with respect to d: dplx/dd = -1/d². So the change in plx is dplx = - (1/d²) dd.

But let's express everything in terms of plx. So, dr = (change in distance) = (change in d). So, if I have a small change in plx, dplx, then the change in d is dd = -d² dplx. Because from plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx, so dd = - (d²) dplx.

But for the volume, the shell at distance d has volume 4πd² dr, where dr is the thickness in distance. But dr is equal to dd, which is -d² dplx.

Wait, dr is the thickness in distance. So, substituting dr = -d² dplx.

Putting it all together, the number of stars in a shell of thickness dr is n * 4πd² dr.

Substituting dr = -d² dplx, we get:

Number of stars = n * 4πd² * (-d² dplx) ) → but the negative sign just indicates the direction, so for the magnitude, it's positive.

But wait, since d = 1/plx, substituting d into the equation:

Number of stars = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( (1/plx)^2 ) dplx )

Wait, let me compute each part. Let me substitute d = 1/plx.

So d² = (1/plx)^2 = 1/plx².

And dr = -d² dplx → so that's (1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, no, because dr is in terms of distance. Let me correct this step.

We have dr = dd = - (d^2) dplx = - ( (1/plx)^2 ) dplx.

But wait, if plx increases by dplx, then d decreases. So the volume shell at distance d is 4π d² dr, and dr is the change in d.

But perhaps another approach would be better. Let me think in terms of differential elements.

The number of stars in a small range of plx (dplx) is proportional to the volume of the spherical shell corresponding to that plx range.

Each shell at a particular plx (distance) has a volume of 4π d² dr, where dr is the thickness in distance.

But since plx = 1/d, dr = - (1/d^2) dplx = - plx^2 dplx.

So, substituting d = 1/plx and dr = -plx² dplx.

So the volume element becomes:

4π d² dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - plx^2 dplx ) )= 4π (1/plx²) * (- plx² dplx) ) = 4π (-dplx).

Wait, that can't be right because the negative sign indicates direction, not magnitude. So perhaps the volume element is 4π (1/plx²) * (plx² dplx) ) → because dr is in the negative direction, but for the magnitude, it's positive.

So the volume is 4π (1/plx²) * plx² dplx → which simplifies to 4π dplx.

Wait, that's interesting. So the volume element in terms of plx is 4π dplx.

But wait, that seems to suggest that the volume between plx and plx + dplx is 4π dplx. That would imply that the number of stars in a given plx range is proportional to dplx. But wait, because the number of stars is n * volume, which would be n * 4π dplx. Hmm, but that would mean that the number of stars per unit plx is constant? That doesn't make sense because as plx increases (distance decreases), more stars would be in a given plx range since they're closer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substituting. Let me go through the steps again carefully.

We have:

d = 1/plx → plx = 1/d.

The differential change in plx is dplx, which is related to the differential change in d: dplx = - (1/d²) dd → which can be rewritten as dd = -d² dplx.

The volume of a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² dd.

Substituting dd:

Volume = 4π d² (-d² dplx) ) = -4π d^4 dplx.

But since d = 1/plx, d^4 is (1/plx)^4.

So Volume = -4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

But we take the magnitude, so Volume = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, that makes sense because as plx decreases (distance increases), the volume of the shell increases. Wait no, if plx is small (distance is large), the shell volume would be larger because the sphere is bigger. Wait, no, wait: when you have a thin shell, the volume is 4π d² dr. So for larger d, the volume is bigger for the same dr. Now, dr is related to dplx via dr = -d^2 dplx.

So when plx is small (d is large), a small change in plx (dplx) leads to a larger change in d (since dr is proportional to d^2 * dplx). So the volume is 4π d² dr = 4π d² (d^2 dplx) → 4π d^4 dplx. But d = 1/plx, so d^4 is 1/plx^4. So volume is 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars in a dplx range is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit plx range (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So if we have a small dplx, the number of stars in that range is proportional to (1/plx^4) * dplx. So the number per unit plx (like per dplx) would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait no, the number of stars in each dplx is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number per dplx would be (n * 4π) * (1/plx^4) dplx.

But per unit plx, it's per dplx, so you can think of it as (number per dplx) = (n * 4π) * (1/plx^4).

Hmm, but wait, the options given are about how the number per unit plx changes with plx. So if you have a small change in plx (dplx), the number of stars in that interval is proportional to 1/plx^4 * dplx. So the number per unit plx (i.e., per dplx) would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased: "the number of stars per unit range of plx" changes with plx. So it's N per (plx range). So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/(plx^4) because for each unit plx change (dplx=1), the number is ~1/plx^4.

But wait, let me think again about the math. The number of stars in a small range dplx is proportional to (1/plx^4) * dplx. So the number per unit plx (dplx=1) would be proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number decreases as plx increases, which makes sense because closer stars (higher plx) are more densely populated, so you have more stars in a given plx range. Wait, no, wait: if plx is higher (closer stars), then 1/plx^4 is larger, so the number per unit plx is higher. So more stars per unit plx for higher plx, which aligns with intuition because more stars are nearby, so in a small plx range (like from 1 to 2 arcsec), you have many more stars than in a large plx range (say, 100 to 101 arcsec, which would be very far away, so few stars).

Wait, but wait, earlier when I thought through the volume, I thought that as plx increases (distance decreases), the number of stars per unit plx increases. So the number of stars per unit plx is higher for higher plx, which makes sense because more stars are closer.

But according to my calculation, the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. So as plx increases, 1/plx^4 decreases. That would imply that the number of stars per unit plx decreases as plx increases. But that contradicts the intuition that nearby stars are more numerous.

Wait, so maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me re-express everything.

We have a uniform distribution of stars, meaning the number density (stars per volume) is constant, say n.

The number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is the volume between those two plx values multiplied by n.

The volume between plx and plx + dplx is the integral from d to d + dd of 4π d² dd, where d = 1/plx.

Wait, but plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx.

So, the volume element between plx and plx + dplx is the integral from plx to plx + dplx of [4π (1/plx')^2 ] * [ (1/(plx')^2) dplx' ].

Wait, perhaps that's not the right approach. Another approach: the volume between plx and plx + dplx is the difference between two spherical shells.

The volume at plx is V1 = (4/3) π (1/plx)^3.

At plx + dplx, it's V2 = (4/3) π (1/(plx + dplx))^3.

The difference V2 - V1 is the volume of the shell between plx and plx + dplx.

But for very small dplx, this is approximately equal to the derivative of V with respect to plx multiplied by dplx.

So, dV = derivative of V with respect to plx multiplied by dplx.

V = (4/3) π (1/plx)^3.

dV/dplx = (4/3) π * (-3) (1/plx)^4 ) → dV/dplx = -4 π (1/plx)^4.

So the absolute value is 4 π (1/plx)^4.

Thus, the number of stars in that shell is n * 4 π (1/plx)^4 * dplx.

But wait, the number per unit plx (dplx) is n * 4 π (1/plx)^4.

So the number of stars per unit range of plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Which means as plx increases, the number per unit plx decreases. But that doesn't make sense because when plx is small (distance large), you expect fewer stars in a given plx range. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, for a small dplx, the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^4. So higher plx (closer stars) would have a higher number per unit plx. Because when plx increases, 1/plx^4 increases. So when plx is 1, 1/plx^4 is 1, when plx is 2, it's (1/16), wait no, wait: when plx is small (like 0.1), 1/(0.1)^4 = 10,000, which is larger than when plx is 2, which is 1/16 = 0.0625.

Wait, no, plx is in arcseconds, so as plx increases, 1/plx^4 actually decreases. So the number of stars per unit plx (dV) is proportional to 1/plx^4, which decreases as plx increases. So higher plx (farther stars) would have fewer stars per unit plx. That makes sense because as you go to larger distances, each unit of plx corresponds to a shell that is much larger in volume, but since the density is uniform, the number of stars in that shell depends on the volume.

Wait, no, that seems contradictory. Let me think about it in terms of the number of stars in a given range of plx. If I have a small dplx, like 0.1, how does the number of stars in that range change with plx.

At a small plx, say 0.1, the corresponding d is 10 pc. The shell at 10 pc with thickness corresponding to dplx=0.1 would have a very large volume, but if the number density is uniform, the number of stars would be n * volume, which is proportional to 1/(plx^4) * dplx.

So when plx is small (0.1), the number of stars in 0.1 plx is proportional to (1/0.1^4) * 0.1 = (10^4) *0.1=10^3.

At plx=1, the same dplx=0.1, the number is (1/1^4) *0.1=0.1.

So at plx=0.1, 0.1 plx range has 1000 stars, while at plx=1, same dplx has 0.1 star. So number increases as plx decreases. So the number per unit plx (dplx) is higher when plx is lower (farther away). Hmm, but that's the opposite of what I initially thought.

Wait, no, because when plx is lower, like 0.1, the distance is larger (10 pc), and the volume of the shell is much larger. So in that shell, you have more stars. So for a given dplx, say 0.1, you have more stars when plx is smaller.

Wait but when plx is 1, the shell is at 1 pc, and a small dplx of 0.1 would correspond to a small change in distance, but because the density is uniform, maybe that's why the number of stars per unit plx is lower.

So according to the calculation, the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the correct option should be A) ~ 1/plx^4.

But wait, the options are:

A) ~ 1/plx^4

B) ~ 1/plx^2

C) ~ 1/plx^1

D) ~ 1/plx^3

So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the number should increase with higher plx (more stars nearby). But according to this calculation, the number per unit plx is higher when plx is lower (farther away). That seems incorrect. But perhaps I'm confusing the number of stars in a given distance range with the number per unit plx.

Wait, let's think differently. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number in a volume dV is n*dV.

Each shell at distance d has volume 4πd² dr, where dr is the change in distance. But how does this translate to changes in plx?

Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx → dr = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So the volume of the shell is 4π (1/plx)^2 * [ -(1/plx²) dplx ].

So the absolute volume is 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Hence, the number per unit plx (dplx=1) is n *4π (1/plx^4).

So as plx increases, 1/plx^4 decreases, so the number of stars per unit plx decreases.

But that would mean that for higher plx (closer stars), the number of stars per unit plx is lower. That can't be right because when you look at a small range of plx near high values (like plx=1), the number of stars in that range should be higher than a similar range at low plx (because the volume is smaller but the density is the same). Wait no, no, because the volume is inversely proportional to plx^4. So for high plx (small d), the shell's volume is small, so the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think of it in terms of numbers.

Suppose the number density n is 1 star per cubic parsec.

At plx=1 (d=1 pc), the volume per unit plx (dplx=1) is 4π (1/1^4) * 1 =4π. So number of stars is 4π *1 ~12.57.

At plx=0.5 (d=2 pc), volume per unit plx is 4π (1/(0.5)^4) *1 =4π*(1/0.0625)=4π*16=64π ~201 stars.

At plx=2 (d=0.5 pc), volume is 4π (1/2^4) =4π*(1/16)= π/4 ~0.785 stars per unit plx.

So, indeed, the number of stars per unit plx is highest when plx is smallest. That's because for a given dplx=1, the shell at plx=0.5 includes a much larger volume (since d is larger), so more stars are found in that plx range.

So the number of stars per unit plx decreases as plx increases. So the correct option is A) ~ 1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely related to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. For a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume itself.

The volume of a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \) is \( 4\pi d^2 dr \). Since \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), we can express \( dr \) in terms of \( d\text{plx} \):  
\[
dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}.
\]  
Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dr \) into the volume formula, the volume of the shell becomes:  
\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]  
The number of stars in this shell is proportional to the volume and the number density \( n \):  
\[
\text{Number of stars} \propto n \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]  
Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (i.e., per \( d\text{plx} \)) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

This means that as \( \text{plx} \) increases (corresponding to larger distances), the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases. This aligns with the expectation that, for uniformly distributed stars, fewer stars are found in larger parallax ranges (farther distances).

The correct answer is **A) ~ 1/plx^4**.

Answer: A
