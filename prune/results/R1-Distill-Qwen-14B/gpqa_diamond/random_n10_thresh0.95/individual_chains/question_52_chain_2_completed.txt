Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Alright, the problem is about a star whose surface is partially covered by dark spots. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without the spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—comparing when the star doesn't have spots to when it does. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, and we can assume LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) holds.

Hmm, okay. So, in LTE, the distribution of atoms between energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations (n1/n2) is given by (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2-E1 is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature of the photosphere drops. Does that mean the temperature of the photosphere in the spotted regions is lower? Or is the effective temperature the average, and the actual photospheric temperatures in the unspotted and spotted regions are different?

Ah, right. Effective temperature is a measure of the total radiation emitted by the star. If 40% of the surface is covered by spots, which are cooler, the star's overall Teff is lower. But the photosphere itself—well, the spots are cooler regions, so the unspotted regions would have the original 6000 K, and the spotted regions are presumably at a lower temperature.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. Hmm, perhaps the photosphere's average T is now 5500 K. Wait no, I think the effective temperature is a global property. So when spots cover part of the surface, the star's total emitted flux (and thus effective temp) would be a weighted average between the unspotted and spotted regions.

But the problem states that the overall Teff is 5500 K when 40% is covered. So perhaps the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K, but the individual regions (unspotted and spotted) have higher and lower T, respectively.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So is the photosphere's temperature uniform? Or is it a mix of temperatures? Because if the spots are cooler, then the overall photosphere's average temperature has changed, but perhaps the line formation is happening in the unspotted regions. Wait, no. The photosphere is the star's atmosphere, so the spots would be part of the photosphere. So the photosphere has a lower average temperature when the spots are present.

Wait, but when the spots are present, the overall effective temperature of the star is 5500 K. But the star's photosphere isn't at a single temperature—so the presence of spots affects the average. But when considering the photosphere as a whole, perhaps the temperature is lower because spots are cooler.

But in any case, the ratio of Ti levels depends on the local temperature. So if the star has spots, the average temperature of the photosphere is 5500 K. So when spots are present, the photosphere's T is 5500 K, and without spots, it's 6000 K.

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The star without spots has a Teff of 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the Teff goes down to 5500 K. So the effective temperature is the average, but the actual photosphere has two regions: 60% at 6000 K and 40% at a lower T.

Wait, no. Because the spots are cooler regions, the star's total flux is a combination of the flux from the unspotted and spotted areas. The effective temperature (Teff) is defined such that the total luminosity is (4π R²) * σ Teff⁴. So when part of the surface is cooler, the overall Teff is lower.

But for the photosphere as a whole, each region may have a different effective temperature. So the line formation occurs in both regions, but if the line is formed in regions where the temperature is 6000 K, then the spots (which are cooler, say 5000 K) would not contribute to that line.

Wait, but the problem says that the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels decreases when the star has spots. So, perhaps the line forms in the unspotted regions, which are at 6000 K, but when spots are present, the overall photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K, but it's a mixture. But wait, no, because the line is formed in regions where the temperature is 6000 K, but when spots are present, the same regions may have lower T.

Wait, perhaps the starspots are cooler regions, so the Ti lines are formed in the surrounding hotter regions. So the presence of spots would change the overall temperature of the regions where the lines form. Or maybe the spots are so dark that they don't emit much, so the line formation is in the same regions as before, but the overall photospheric T is lower, thus the average is lower.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the problem in another way.

The ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So if T decreases, what happens to this ratio? Let's see. E2 is higher than E1 because the transition is from lower to higher energy (since emission is when the atom drops from E2 to E1, or absorption when it goes up). So E2 - E1 is positive. So as T decreases, the exponent -(E2-E1)/(k T) becomes more negative, so the exponential term becomes smaller. Therefore, exp() becomes smaller when T decreases.

So, n1/n2 ∝ exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

When T is lower (5500 K vs 6000 K), the exponential term is smaller. So n1/n2 is smaller when T is lower. So that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio n1/n2 decreases.

Which is exactly what the problem states: when spots are present, the ratio decreases.

But the problem is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. So, we need to find (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_has_spots.

Let me denote R as the ratio. So R = [n1/n2]_no_spots / [n1/n2]_has_spots.

Which is [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T_no) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T_has) ) ]

The g1/g2 terms cancel out, so R = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T_no) + ΔE/(k T_has) ] )

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T_has) - 1/(T_no) ] )

Wait, wait, let me compute the exponents correctly.

No spots: T_no = 6000 K.

Has spots: T_has = 5500 K.

So ΔE = E2 - E1 = h c / λ, where λ is 1448 Å.

Wait, but maybe I can compute ΔE in terms of k T.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the ratio of the Boltzmann factors, which is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_has_spots = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/(T_has) - 1/(T_no) ] )

Wait, let me re-express the exponent.

The exponent in the ratio R is:

[ (E2-E1) / (k T_has) ) - (E2-E1)/(k T_no) ) ]

Wait, no, the exponents are:

For no spots: exponent is -(E2-E1)/(k T_no)

For has spots: exponent is -(E2-E1)/(k T_has)

So when taking the ratio R = exp( [ -(E2-E1)/(k T_no) + (E2-E1)/(k T_has) ] )

Which is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/(T_has) - 1/(T_no) ] )

Now, 1/(T_has) is 1/5500 and 1/(T_no) is 1/6000.

So 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500/(5500*6000)

Calculate denominator: 5500 * 6000 = 3.3e7.

So 500 / 3.3e7 ≈ approx 1.515e-5.

So [ (E2-E1)/(k) ] * (1.515e-5 )

But what is E2-E1? It's the energy difference corresponding to 1448 Å.

E = h c / λ.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

λ is 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10 ) 

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ approx 1.372e-18 J.

But we can also express E in terms of k*T, where k is Boltzmann's constant (1.38e-23 J/K).

So E = 1.372e-18 J.

Compute E/(k):

E/(k) = (1.372e-18) / (1.38e-23) ≈ approx 9.95e4 ≈ approx 1e5.

Wait wait, let me compute that accurately.

1.372e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.372 / 1.38 ) * 1e5 ≈ (0.994) * 1e5 ≈ 99,400 ≈ approx 99,400 K.

Wait, because E/(k) has units of K, since J/(J/K) = K.

So E/(k) ≈ 99,400 K.

So now back to the exponent:

[ (E2 - E1)/(k) ] * [ 1/(T_has) - 1/(T_no) ]

Which is approximately 99,400 K * 1.515e-5 1/K.

Multiply 99,400 by 1.515e-5.

So 99,400 * 1.515e-5 = (99400 * 1.515) * 1e-5.

Compute 99400 * 1.515.

Well, 100,000 * 1.515 = 151,500.

But since it's 99400, which is 600 less than 100,000.

So 600 * 1.515 = 909.

So subtract that: 151,500 - 909 = 150,591.

So 150,591 * 1e-5 = 1.50591.

So the exponent is approximately 1.506.

So R = exp(1.506) ≈ e^1.506.

What's e^1.5?

e^1 is 2.71828.

e^0.5 is about 1.6487.

So e^1.5 is about 4.4817.

But 1.506 is slightly higher than 1.5. Let me compute more accurately.

e^1.506:

We can use the Taylor expansion, or perhaps just use calculator-like approximation.

Alternatively, since e^1.506 is approximately e^1.5 * e^0.006.

e^0.006 ≈ 1 + 0.006 + (0.006)^2/2 ≈ ~1.006018.

So e^1.506 ≈4.4817 *1.006018 ≈ approx 4.4817 *1.006 ≈ 4.4817 + 0.02689 ≈ 4.5086.

So approximately 4.51.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait. I thought the ratio was R = [n1/n2]_no_spots / [n1/n2]_has_spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower, so R is greater than 1. Which aligns with 4.5.

So the factor is about 4.5 times.

So I think the correct answer is option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \(\Delta E = E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The ratio of the populations depends on the temperature \(T\), and the problem specifies that the effective temperature of the star decreases from \(T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K}\) to \(T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K}\).

The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
R = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{spots}}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann equation into \(R\), we get:

\[
R = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right).
\]

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) corresponds to the wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\), and is calculated using \(\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h\) is Planck's constant and \(c\) is the speed of light. Substituting \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J s}\), \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\), we find:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

To express \(\Delta E\) in terms of \(kT\), we divide by \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99,400 \, \text{K}.
\]

Next, we calculate the temperature term:

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}.
\]

Finding a common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Substituting into the exponent:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right) = (99,400)(1.515 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 1.506.
\]

Thus:

\[
R = \exp(1.506) \approx 4.51.
\]

The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately \(4.5\). Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
