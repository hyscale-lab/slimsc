Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a sequence of reagents. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I'll try to visualize the target molecule. The formula seems to have a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), which I think means a CH2 group attached to the cyclohexane, and that CH2 is connected to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. Additionally, there's a carbaldehyde group (CHO) attached to the cyclohexane ring. So, the structure would have two substituents on the cyclohexane: a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group and a -CHO group. Wait, or maybe the numbering is different. Let me sketch this out.

Wait, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main ring is cyclohexane. The '1-' position has a substituent which is a methyl group (CH2-) attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the substituent at position 1 is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). Also, the carbaldehyde is at another position, perhaps position 4? Or maybe the same position? Wait, no, the name is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning the aldehyde is attached to the cyclohexane. So, the main ring is cyclohexane with an aldehyde group, and at position 1 there's this other substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is: the cyclohexane ring has two substituents. One is the aldehyde group (CHO) and the other is a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl. So, the molecule would look something like a cyclohexane with a CHO at position 1 and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group also at position 1? Or maybe the substituents are on adjacent carbons? Hmm, maybe I should think about the starting material and possible reactions instead.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, that's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond to a CH2 group). So, structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡C-CH2- attached to the cyclohexane? Or wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So, ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached.

So, starting from ethynylcyclohexane, I need to make this target molecule. Let's think about possible reaction pathways. The target has two new functional groups: a hydroxyl group attached to a methyl group (which is attached to the cyclohexane), and an aldehyde group.

Wait, but the starting material is an alkyne attached to cyclohexane. Maybe the first step is to add a substituent to the triple bond. So, ethynylcyclohexane is R-C≡CH, where R is cyclohexyl. So, perhaps we can perform some alkyne addition reactions.

Looking at the reagent options, I see NaNH2 and methyl chloride in option A and C. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation, especially in alkyne reactions. Methyl chloride could be a methylating agent. So, perhaps the first step is adding a methyl group to the alkyne.

Wait, but wait: when you have a terminal alkyne like R-C≡CH, treating with NaNH2 and an alkyl halide (like methyl chloride) might lead to alkyne alkylation. So, the alkyne could be extended by adding a methyl group. So, for example, R-C≡CH + NaNH2 (which deprotonates the alkyne to form a strong base, a triple bond anion) then reacts with methyl chloride to give R-C≡C-CH3. So, the product would be R-C≡C-CH3, but wait, in our target, I don't see a longer alkyne. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reagents are used for a different purpose. Alternatively, NaNH2 with methyl chloride could be for a substitution. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, but methyl chloride is a methylating agent. If the alkyne is deprotonated, maybe the methyl chloride would add to the triple bond. So, in that case, the alkyne would become R-C≡C-Me? Or perhaps it's a vinyl group.

Wait, maybe the first step is to perform a Grignard-like addition. But NaNH2 is a strong base, more commonly used in deprotonating alkynes. Alternatively, methyl chloride could be a methylating agent in an aromatic substitution, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reagent is for elimination. Wait, NaNH2 is used for elimination reactions as well, like in forming alkynes from alkenes. But in this case, we have an alkyne already.

Wait, perhaps the initial step is to add a methyl group to the triple bond. So, R-C≡CH would become R-C≡C-Me. So, the product after the first step would be 1-methyl-1-cyclohexylethylene? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, the first reaction in option A is NaNH2, methyl chloride. Another possibility is that NaNH2 is used to deprotonate the alkyne, making it a strong base, which then reacts with methyl chloride in an SN2 reaction. So, R-C≡CH + NaNH2 → R-C≡C^- NH2. Then, reacting with methyl chloride: R-C≡C^- + CH3Cl → R-C≡C-CH3 + Cl^- and other byproducts. So, the alkyne becomes R-C≡C-CH3.

Hmm, but then what's the next step? The second step in option A is H2/Pd. That's hydrogenation. So, hydrogenating the triple bond would turn R-C≡C-CH3 into R-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, after step 1 and 2, the molecule would be cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's a straight chain. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is in a different condition. Wait, H2 with a palladium catalyst usually hydrogenates triple bonds to single bonds, but sometimes with different catalysts, you might get different products. Alternatively, maybe it's a catalytic hydrogenation that adds across the triple bond, so R-C≡C-CH3 → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But that doesn't seem helpful for the target molecule, which has a cyclohexyl substituent attached via a hydroxyl and a methyl group. So, perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is not alkyne alkylation but something else. Wait, the reagents NaNH2 and methyl chloride—another possibility is that the NaNH2 is used to deprotonate a position on the cyclohexane ring, making an anion which then reacts with methyl chloride to add a methyl group. But that would be an alkylating the ring, but cyclohexane is generally unreactive unless under strong conditions. Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base and maybe can deprotonate the alkyne.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to add a methyl group to the triple bond, making R-C≡C-CH3. Then, the next step is hydrogenation to form R-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that doesn't seem to lead towards the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a substitution. Wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a terminal alkyne. If I use NaNH2, which is a strong base, perhaps it deprotonates the alkyne to form a triple bond anion. Then, if I add methyl chloride, it would methylate the alkyne. So, the triple bond would become R-C≡C-Me. Then, maybe the next step is hydrogenation, which would convert the triple bond to a single bond, making R-CH2-CMe2. Wait, no, hydrogenation of a triple bond typically adds two H's to each carbon. So, R-C≡C-Me would become R-CH2-CH2-Me. So, R would be cyclohexyl, so the molecule would be cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But the target molecule has a hydroxyl group and an aldehyde group. Hmm, maybe the aldehyde comes from oxidation. But I don't see that in the steps yet.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the main cyclohexane. So, maybe we need to form a cyclohexyl substituent via a substitution or elimination reaction.

Wait, perhaps the initial steps form a diol, which then undergoes some kind of oxidation or elimination. Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde comes from oxidation of a secondary alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step installs a methyl group adjacent to the triple bond, and then subsequent steps modify that.

Wait, let me think about the possible reactions again. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. The target has a substituent with a hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups attached to a methyl group, which is attached to the cyclohexane. Also, an aldehyde group is present.

Another approach: perhaps perform a hydroboration or some kind of hydration of the alkyne to form a ketone or an alcohol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to add a methyl group to the triple bond, then hydrogenate the triple bond, then perform some oxidation.

Wait, after adding methyl chloride, the triple bond is extended. Then, hydrogenation would convert the triple bond into a single bond, making the molecule longer. Then, perhaps an oxidation step?

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is in a different condition. Wait, another thought: Maybe after adding the methyl group, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond. But H2 with Pd would usually do a full hydrogenation to a single bond. Alternatively, if the catalyst is different, maybe it stops at the cis or trans double bond. But I don't think the options suggest that.

Wait, let me think about the target again. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is in turn attached to the cyclohexane. So, perhaps that substituent comes from some kind of substitution reaction, where a leaving group is replaced by the cyclohexyl group. But where would the leaving group come from?

Wait, another angle: the target has a substituent with a cyclohexyl group. That suggests that perhaps a cyclohexyl group is introduced via some kind of alkylation or substitution. But the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which doesn't have a cyclohexyl substituent. So, maybe that's introduced in a later step.

Wait, perhaps the initial steps form a benzyl-type structure, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a deprotonation with NaNH2, followed by alkylation, then hydrogenation, and then ozonolysis.

Wait, looking at the options, some of them have O3 as a reagent. Ozonolysis tends to break double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, if any step involves forming a double bond, ozonolysis could create the aldehyde group.

Wait, the target has an aldehyde group. So, perhaps ozonolysis is used to create that. So, maybe a double bond is formed in a prior step, which is then cleaved by ozonolysis to form the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde comes from oxidation of a primary alcohol.

But let's think about the steps again.

Option C has reagents: 1. NaNH2, MeCl; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2.

Wait, step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S as work-up. Ozonolysis followed by reductive work-up (like with Zn/H2O) gives aldehydes. But (CH3)2S is a mild reductant, perhaps leading to different products.

Wait, but let's try to follow each option.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, MeCl: Alkylation of the triple bond → R-C≡C-Me.

2. H2/Pd: Hydrogenate triple bond → R-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. Ba(OH)2: Maybe a Birch reduction or some kind of elimination. But Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and can cause elimination, perhaps forming a double bond.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O: Oxidative conditions? HgSO4 is used in the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids, perhaps.

Wait, but after step 2, the molecule would be a straight chain (cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me), which isn't helpful for forming the aldehyde.

Alternatively, maybe after step 2, there's a ring expansion or something else. Not sure.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride: So, adds an ethyl group to the alkyne → R-C≡C-Et.

2. Li/LiNH3: That's a strong base, used in deprotonation, perhaps for elimination. If you have R-C≡C-Et, treating with Li/NH3 (liquid) might cause elimination, but from where? Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction for aromatic rings, but cyclohexane isn't aromatic.

Wait, maybe after step 1, the molecule is R-C≡C-Et. Then, step 2 is Li/liquid NH3, which is a method for elimination—like forming a triple bond again, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps this step is for forming a Grignard-like reagent?

Wait, then step 3 is O3 and H2O. Ozonolysis of the triple bond? Wait, no, ozonolysis is for double bonds. Triple bonds are usually ozonolyzed under different conditions, but more likely, perhaps an earlier step forms a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 leads to a double bond. If step 1 gives R-C≡C-Et, then step 2 (Li, NH3) could cause elimination to form a double bond. Wait, but how? Maybe if there's a hydrogen adjacent to the triple bond. But R-C≡C-Et doesn't have adjacent H's for elimination. Hmm, not sure.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, MeCl → R-C≡C-Me.

2. H2/Pd-CaCO3 → hydrogenate triple bond to single bond: R-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis of a double bond. But wait, in step 2, we have a single bond. So, unless step 2 forms a double bond, but H2/Pd would hydrogenate a triple to a single. So, I'm confused. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond, but I don't think so because Pd is usually for full hydrogenation.

Wait, Pd with H2 typically fully hydrogenates triple bonds to single bonds. So, after step 2, the molecule is R-CH2-CH2-Me. Then, how would we get a double bond for ozonolysis?

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond, depending on the catalyst. Wait, some catalysts like Lindlar's catalyst hydrogenate triple bonds to cis double bonds, but I don't think that's the case here because the reagent is H2/Pd. So, Pd would hydrogenate to single bonds.

So, maybe this option isn't the right path.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol: Hmm, that's interesting. NaNH2 is a strong base, and methanol is a methylating agent. Wait, but MeOH is a poor methylating agent. Alternatively, perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by some reaction. Wait, but NaNH2 and methanol together—could it be a demethylation or something else?

Wait, perhaps the first step is a deprotonation. Ethynylcyclohexane's triple bond is acidic, so NaNH2 would deprotonate it, making the alkyne anion. Then, perhaps reacting with methanol would provide a methyl group. So, R-C≡C^- + MeOH → R-C≡C-O-Me? Or perhaps the alkyne anion attacks the methyl group. Wait, but NaNH2 and MeOH together—maybe the alkyne is alkylated. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to deprotonate the alkyne and then quench it with MeOH, leading to the formation of a ketone. Wait, that doesn't make sense. I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to do a deprotonation followed by alkylation using MeOH. Wait, but MeOH is a weak alkylating agent. Maybe this step leads to forming a cyclopropane or something else, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the main cyclohexane. So, perhaps the substituent comes from a substitution where a hydrogen is replaced by the cyclohexyl group. But how?

Wait, maybe the substituent is formed via a nucleophilic substitution. For that, you need a good leaving group. If the alkyne is converted into a leaving group, perhaps via oxidation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the starting material is functionalized to introduce an epoxide or some other group that can undergo ring-opening to form the substituent. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps the target molecule is formed via a Diels-Alder reaction, but I don't see how that would use the starting alkyne.

Wait, another thought: The target has an aldehyde group. So, perhaps one of the steps involves oxidizing an alcohol to an aldehyde. That would require a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized.

So, perhaps after some steps, we have a primary alcohol, which is oxidized to an aldehyde.

Alternatively, ozonolysis can produce aldehydes from double bonds. So, if a double bond is present, ozonolysis followed by reductive work-up can give carbonyl groups.

So, maybe the sequence involves forming a double bond, then ozonolysis to make the aldehyde.

Wait, looking again at the options, option C has ozonolysis. Let's think about that. If the first two steps in option C produce a molecule with a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, step 1 in option C: NaNH2 and MeCl. As before, this would add a methyl group to the triple bond, making R-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: H2/Pd-CaCO3. So, hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making R-CH2-CH2-Me.

Wait, but now the molecule is a straight chain. How would a double bond form? Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the hydrogenation doesn't go all the way? But I thought Pd with H2 goes to full hydrogenation.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is used to add hydrogen in a different way. Not sure.

Wait, maybe the initial steps are to create a cyclopropane or some ring. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a cyclopropane via [2+2] addition, but I don't think that's the case here.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the target again. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main ring is cyclohexane with an aldehyde group (carbaldehyde) and another substituent at position 1, which is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

So, perhaps the aldehyde comes from an oxidation of a primary alcohol, and the CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) comes from some kind of substitution or addition.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the starting material undergoes a substitution reaction where the alkyne is replaced by a hydroxyl group, but that doesn't seem straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone via oxidation, and then subjected to some kind of addition.

Wait, perhaps the sequence involves adding a methyl group to the alkyne, then hydrogenating to form an ethyl group, then oxidizing to form a ketone, and then doing some kind of aldol addition. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is synthesized via a cyclopropane ring-opening. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the first step adds a methyl group to the alkyne, making R-C≡C-Me. Then, hydrogenation makes R-CH2-CH2-Me. Then, perhaps an oxidation step to form an epoxide or something else. But I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, another angle: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group. So, maybe the cyclohexyl group is introduced via some kind of alkylation, perhaps using a good leaving group.

Wait, perhaps in one of the steps, a hydrogen is replaced by a cyclohexyl group. For that, a good leaving group is needed. Maybe the alkyne is converted into a bromide or chloride, then substituted with cyclohexyl.

But how? The starting material is R-C≡CH. To make R-C≡C-Br would require some kind of substitution, but alkynes are not very reactive towards substitution unless activated. Maybe via a mercury(II) acetate complex, but that's for hydration.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a nitrile, which is more reactive towards substitution. Then, perhaps a nucleophilic substitution could add the cyclohexyl group.

But I don't see nitriles in the reagents listed.

Wait, let's go back to the options and see which option leads to the formation of an aldehyde.

Option D includes O3 and (CH3)2S, same as option C. Wait, no, option D has NH4OH after ozonolysis. Wait, no, looking again:

Option C:

3. O3/ (CH3)2S

4. Ba(OH)2

Option D:

3. O3/(CH3)2S

4. NH4OH

So, after ozonolysis, option C uses Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Option D uses NH4OH, which is a weak base and may not cause much elimination.

Hmm, perhaps the aldehyde is formed via ozonolysis. So, the molecule must have a double bond prior to ozonolysis.

So, in which option is a double bond formed before ozonolysis?

Looking at option C, step 2 is H2/Pd-CaCO3. So, if step 1 is alkyne alkylation (R-C≡C-Me), step 2 would hydrogenate it to R-CH2-CH2-Me. No double bond formed.

Option D: step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. Not sure what that does. Maybe it forms a ketone via hydration? Or perhaps it's a deprotonation and then something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the initial step is a deprotonation of the alkyne, making R-C≡C^-, which then reacts with something else. But with methanol, perhaps it's adding a hydroxymethyl group? Not sure.

Wait, if the first reagent is NaNH2 and methanol, perhaps the alkyne is deprotonated and then quenched with methanol to form an enol or something. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a deprotonation to form an alkyne anion, which then undergoes some kind of alkylation with methanol. But I don't think methanol would act as an alkylating agent here.

Hmm, perhaps this is a dead end. Let me think of another approach. Let's try to outline the possible steps needed to form the target.

1. Start with ethynylcyclohexane (R-C≡CH).

2. Need to form a substituent with a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group.

So, perhaps the alkyne is functionalized to add a cyclohexyl group adjacent to the ring. Maybe via a substitution reaction, but how?

Wait, perhaps the target's substituent is a result of a hydride shift or some kind of ring expansion. Not sure.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the alkyne is converted into an epoxide, but I don't see that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond, then undergoes some addition.

Wait, but the target has a cyclohexyl group attached. So, perhaps that group is added via a substitution. But how?

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a bromide (R-C≡C-Br), which can then undergo substitution with a cyclohexyl group. But how would that happen? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is functionalized to form a ketone, which then undergoes a cycloaddition or some kind of conjugate addition.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a nitrile, which is then subjected to nucleophilic substitution. But I don't see nitriles in the reagents.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkyne alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to make a CH2-CH2-Me group.

3. Oxidation to form a ketone.

4. Some kind of oxidation to form an aldehyde.

But I'm not seeing that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve forming a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that can be oxidized.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C. Let me see:

Option C steps:
1. NaNH2, MeCl → R-C≡C-Me
2. H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-Me
3. O3, (CH3)2S → Ozonolysis would act on a double bond. But after step 2, we have a single bond. So, maybe I'm missing a step where a double bond is formed.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation using a different condition that stops at the double bond. But I thought H2/Pd would fully hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond in step 2. But that would require a different catalyst, like Lindlar's, which isn't mentioned.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to analyze each option's reagents and see which sequence could lead to the target.

Looking at option C again:

After step 1, R-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-Me.

But that gives a single bond, so no double bond for ozonolysis in step 3. So, that doesn't make sense unless ozonolysis is acting on a different part.

Wait, maybe the molecule is being hydrogenated in such a way that a ring is formed, leading to a double bond. But I'm not seeing that.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial steps form a di-substituted cyclohexane with a double bond, which is then ozonolysed.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (R-C≡CH). Step 1: alkyne alkylation to R-C≡C-Me. Step 2: hydrogenation to R-CH2-CH2-Me. Now, maybe step 3 is ozonolysis, but where's the double bond?

No, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct path is to form a cyclopropane ring. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkyne alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis of a ring-opening to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, but I don't see how that would happen.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the target is synthesized via a conjugated diene. So, the alkyne is converted into a diene, which is then ozonolyzed.

But I don't see any steps that would form a diene.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol, which then can form a diene under certain conditions. But I don't see diol formation in the reagents.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the reagents in the options.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2, methanol. Maybe this is a deprotonation and then a reaction with methanol.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. So, it could deprotonate the alkyne, making R-C≡C^-NH2. Then, perhaps reacting with methanol (MeOH) would quench it, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps MeOH acts as a methylating agent, but with NaNH2, which is a strong base, perhaps the alkyne anion attacks the methyl group from MeOH. So, R-C≡C^- + CH3OH → R-C≡C-OCH3. But that would form a methyl ether, which doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step forms a Grignard-like reagent, but I don't think so.

Another approach: Perhaps the alkyne is converted into an alkyne with a substituent that can form a carbonyl group upon hydrogenation.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for the correct answer based on the presence of necessary reagents.

The target has an aldehyde group. So, perhaps ozonolysis is used, which is present in options C and D. So, let's focus on those.

In option C, after ozonolysis, the work-up is (CH3)2S. That's a reductive work-up, which would give aldehydes from ozonolysis. Then step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Maybe it's for elimination or forming an epoxide.

In option D, after ozonolysis, the work-up is NH4OH, which is a neutral work-up. That would typically give aldehydes as well.

Hmm.

Let me think about the steps in option C:

1. Alkyne alkylation → R-C≡C-Me.

2. Hydrogenation → R-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. Ozonolysis → but where is the double bond? Unless the hydrogenation step stops at a double bond. But using H2/Pd, it's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation step is partial, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the initial steps form a cyclohexene ring, which would have a double bond. How?

Wait, another possibility: After step 1 and 2, perhaps the molecule undergoes a ring-opening or some kind of cyclization to form a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing the fact that the hydrogenation is not of the alkyne but of another double bond formed earlier.

Wait, perhaps step 1 and 2 are not about the alkyne but about another part of the molecule. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation step is for reducing a ketone to an alcohol, but I don't see that in the steps.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the steps.

The target has an aldehyde group, which suggests that ozonolysis is involved, as in options C and D. So, let's focus on those.

In option C, after ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, step 4 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and can cause elimination reactions. So, maybe after ozonolysis, which creates aldehyde groups, Ba(OH)2 could induce some kind of elimination to form a new double bond or ring structure.

In the target, the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). So, perhaps that's formed via a substitution where a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group are added.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxidation, but that's not its typical use.

Wait, another thought: Ba(OH)2 is used in the Birch reduction, which reduces aromatic rings, but cyclohexane isn't aromatic. Alternatively, it can cause elimination to form double bonds.

So, in option C, after ozonolysis, which forms aldehyde groups, Ba(OH)2 might do something else, like form a hydrate or cause a ring-opening.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is:

1. Alkyne alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Partial hydrogenation to form a double bond (but I thought H2/Pd doesn't stop at double bonds).

3. Ozonolysis of the double bond to form aldehyde groups.

4. Base treatment to form the substituent.

But without a double bond, this doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to add a methyl group, then the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis double bond using a different catalyst, but in the options, the catalyst is H2/Pd.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C, and the steps are:

R-C≡CH → R-C≡C-Me → R-CH2-CH2-Me → ozonolysis (but no double bond; perhaps the ozonolysis is acting on another part, but I don't see how).

Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde comes from oxidation. Wait, step 4 in option C is Ba(OH)2. Maybe Ba(OH)2 is used for oxidation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should instead consider the oxidation state. The starting material is an alkyne (sp hybridized). The target has an aldehyde (sp²). So, perhaps the alkyne is oxidized to a nitrile, then hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid, then reduced to an aldehyde. But I don't see that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone via hydration, then reduced to a secondary alcohol, then oxidized to a ketone again, but I don't see that path.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a trans double bond, which is then oxidized to a diol, and then further processed. But I don't see that in the steps.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because after the first two steps, it's R-CH2-CH2-Me. Then, perhaps ozonolysis isn't applicable, but maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkyne alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to single bond.

3. Ozonolysis isn't applicable here, so maybe the correct path isn't in option C.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about the reagents leading to the correct functional groups.

The target has a hydroxyl group attached to a cyclohexane ring. So, perhaps one of the steps is a hydroboration or some kind of epoxide opening.

Wait, looking at option D:

Step 1: NaNH2, methanol → perhaps forms an enol or something else.

Step 2: Li/LiNH3 → perhaps deprotonates to form a strong base, leading to elimination.

Wait, Li and liquid NH3 is a strong base used for eliminations, like forming alkynes from alkenes, but not sure.

Step 3: Ozonolysis → but again, where is the double bond?

Hmm, not helpful.

Another approach: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group. So, perhaps that's a result of a substitution where a hydrogen is replaced by a cyclohexyl group attached via an -OH.

But how would that happen? Maybe through an SN2 reaction, but where's the leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction. So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which then reacts with a Grignard reagent. But I don't see a ketone in the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a bromide, which then undergoes substitution with a Grignard reagent.

But again, I don't see the reagents for that.

Wait, maybe the target is synthesized by forming a gem-diol from an alkyne, which then undergoes some kind of elimination.

Wait, but that would require hydration of the alkyne, which typically uses HgSO4/H2SO4 as a catalyst. Oh, wait, one of the options has that as step 3.

Looking at option A:

Step 3: Ba(OH)2.

Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Ah, that could be the hydration of a triple bond. So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to single bond.

3. Ba(OH)2 → Perhaps a Birch reduction or elimination.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → hydration of a triple bond, but wait, the triple bond was hydrogenated earlier.

Hmm, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkyne alkylation → R-C≡C-Me.

2. Hydrogenation → R-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. Ozonolysis → but no double bond.

So, perhaps the correct option isn't C.

I'm really not making progress. Perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the presence of ozonolysis and the formation of the aldehyde.

The target has an aldehyde group, which is likely formed via ozonolysis of a double bond. So, the correct option must have ozonolysis, which is options C and D.

Now, which of these options includes a step that forms a double bond before ozonolysis.

Wait, option D: step 2 is Li/LiNH3. Li and NH3 (liquid) is a strong base used for elimination reactions. So, perhaps after step 1, the molecule has a structure that can eliminate to form a double bond.

So, let's think about option D:

Step 1: NaNH2, methanol → perhaps forms R-C≡C-OCH3? Or maybe it's a deprotonation and quenching with methanol, leading to something else.

Wait, NaNH2 and MeOH: Maybe the alkyne is deprotonated to R-C≡C^-, then reacts with MeOH to form R-C≡C-O-Me. So, an ether.

But then, step 2 is Li/LiNH3 → a strong base. Maybe it deprotonates the ether, leading to elimination. So, perhaps the ether would eliminate to form a triple bond again, but that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a Grignard-like reaction, adding a methyl group to the alkyne.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should think that option C is correct.

Wait, after step 1 and 2 in option C, the molecule is R-CH2-CH2-Me. Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which requires a double bond. But where is it?

Unless the molecule undergoes some cyclization to form a ring with a double bond. For example, perhaps the straight chain becomes a ring via some process, creating a cyclohexene ring which has a double bond. Then, ozonolysis would cleave that.

But I don't see any steps that would induce cyclization into a cyclohexene.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is D.

Option D steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → Maybe forms R-C≡C-OCH3.

2. Li/LiNH3 → strong base, perhaps eliminates to form a triple bond (but why? Maybe it's a Birch reduction, but I'm not sure.

3. Ozonolysis → but again, no double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 in option D forms a double bond via elimination.

Wait, if step 1 produces R-C≡C-OCH3, then step 2 (Li, NH3) could eliminate the ether oxygen, forming a triple bond again. But that doesn't help with ozonolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm way off track.

I think I'm stuck and need to make a best guess. The target has an aldehyde group, so ozonolysis must be part of the correct sequence. Looking at the options, C and D have ozonolysis. Between these, perhaps the correct sequence is option C.

But wait, considering the substituents, the Ba(OH)2 in option C's step 4 is a strong base, which could cause elimination or ring formation. Perhaps after ozonolysis, which forms an aldehyde, Ba(OH)2 could lead to the formation of the hydroxyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

Alternatively, perhaps in option C, the steps are:

1. Alkyne + MeCl → R-C≡C-Me.

2. Hydrogenation → R-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. Ozonolysis: Wait, no double bond, so maybe this step isn't applicable. So perhaps option C isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option D.

In option D, step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol, which may lead to a different structure. Let's imagine:

Step 1: NaNH2 deprotonates R-C≡CH to R-C≡C^−, which reacts with methanol to form R-C≡C-O-Me.

Step 2: Li/LiNH3 → strong base, perhaps eliminates to form a triple bond again, but that doesn't add anything.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li/LiNH3 is used to form a Grignard reagent, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is option C, but I'm not confident.


The question involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane using a sequence of reagents. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: a hydroxyl group attached to a methyl group (which is further attached to a cyclohexyl group) and an aldehyde group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride likely alkylate the alkyne, forming R-C≡C-Me.
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd fully hydrogenates the alkyne to R-CH₂-CH₂-Me.
   - Step 3: Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, potentially causing elimination or ring-opening.
   - Step 4: H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O are conditions for hydration or oxidation.
   - However, this sequence does not clearly explain the formation of the aldehyde group or the hydroxylated substituent.

2. **Option B**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and ethyl chloride alkylate the alkyne, forming R-C≡C-Et.
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH₃ is a strong base, possibly causing elimination to form a double bond.
   - Step 3: O₃/H₂O performs ozonolysis, which could cleave the double bond to form carbonyl groups.
   - Step 4: NH₄OH is a neutral work-up for ozonolysis.
   - However, the sequence does not align well with the target molecule's structure, particularly the formation of the hydroxylated substituent.

3. **Option C**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride alkylate the alkyne, forming R-C≡C-Me.
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd fully hydrogenates the alkyne to R-CH₂-CH₂-Me.
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S performs ozonolysis, but no double bond is present after step 2, making this step unclear.
   - Step 4: Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, potentially causing elimination or forming a hydroxyl group.
   - While ozonolysis could form the aldehyde, the absence of a double bond before this step is problematic.

4. **Option D**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methanol likely deprotonate the alkyne and form an ether, R-C≡C-OCH₃.
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH₃ is a strong base, possibly causing elimination or forming a triple bond.
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S performs ozonolysis, but the formation of a double bond before this step is unclear.
   - Step 4: NH₄OH is a neutral work-up for ozonolysis.
   - This sequence also does not clearly explain the formation of the hydroxylated substituent.

### Conclusion:
The target molecule's aldehyde group suggests that ozonolysis is likely involved in the correct sequence. Options C and D include ozonolysis, but the formation of the hydroxylated substituent and the necessary double bond for ozonolysis are unclear in both. Based on the analysis, **Option C** is the most plausible, as it aligns with the formation of the aldehyde group via ozonolysis, even though the sequence has ambiguities.

**Answer: C**
