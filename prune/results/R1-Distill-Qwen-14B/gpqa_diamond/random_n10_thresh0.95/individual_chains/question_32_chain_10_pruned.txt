Okay, so I have this physics problem about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) for a specific nucleus moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

First, the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So, lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes the mass number 3 + 3 = 6. So the nucleus is Li-6. So the mass of the nucleus is important here. I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be found using the mass number and the atomic mass of the element.

But wait, I think the mass of the nucleus is approximately the atomic mass (in atomic mass units) converted into kilograms. Oh, right, the atomic mass unit (u) is 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So the mass of Li-6 would be 6 u times that constant.

Wait, but do I need to calculate the exact mass, or is there another way? Alternatively, maybe I can use the approximation where the rest mass energy is calculated using the mass number. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should proceed with the exact calculation.

So, the rest mass energy (m0c²) is needed to compute the total energy. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, I can compute gamma.

Let me compute gamma first. v = 0.96c, so (v/c) = 0.96. Then (v/c)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that: 1 / 0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that square root. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, but wait, 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So yes, right. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is about 3.57142857.

Now, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The atomic mass of Li-6 can be found in a table. I don't remember the exact value, but maybe I can approximate it. Alternatively, perhaps the mass can be calculated using the standard atomic weight, which for Li is about 6.941 g/mol, but that's the average for natural abundance. Since Li-6 is a specific isotope, maybe its exact mass is known.

Wait, I think the exact mass of Li-6 is perhaps around 6.015 atomic mass units. Let's see, I remember that for carbon-12, the mass is exactly 12 u. So for Li-6, the mass would be 6.015 u or something close. Let me check my notes. Oh wait, perhaps I can look up the exact value, but since I can't, I'll proceed with an approximate value.

Wait, but perhaps I have another approach. The mass number A is 6, so the approximate mass is about 6 * 1.66e-27 kg. But wait, that's just the mass if it were composed of protons and neutrons each of mass about u. But the actual mass is a bit less due to binding energy, but maybe for this problem, that approximation is acceptable.

Wait, but in reality, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.015 atomic mass units. Let me take it as 6.015 u. So the mass m is 6.015 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg. Let me compute that:

6.015 * 1.6605e-27 kg = approximately 6.015 * 1.6605 = let's compute 6 * 1.6605 is 9.963. 0.015 * 1.6605 is about 0.0249. So total around 9.963 + 0.0249 = 9.9879e-27 kg. So m ≈ 9.9879e-27 kg.

Now, the rest mass energy m0c² is m * c². The speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. So c² is 9e16 m²/s².

So m0c² = 9.9879e-27 kg * 9e16 m²/s².

Let me compute that:

9.9879e-27 * 9e16 = 9.9879 * 9 * 1e-11. 9.9879 *9 is approximately 89.8911. So 89.8911e-11 J. Converting that to GeV.

Wait, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 1 GeV is 1e9 eV = 1.602e-10 J.

So m0c² in GeV: (89.8911e-11 J) / (1.602e-10 J/eV) ) = (89.8911e-11 / 1.602e-10) eV.

Let me compute that: 89.8911e-11 is 8.98911e-10 J. So 8.98911e-10 / 1.602e-10 = approx 5.61 GeV.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because 6 u is about 6 * 0.000549 GeV (since 1 u is about 0.9315 GeV). Wait, no, wait. 1 u is about 931.5 MeV, so 0.9315 GeV.

So 6 u is 6 * 0.9315 = about 5.589 GeV. Which is close to the 5.61 GeV I calculated earlier. So that seems correct.

But wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me redo the calculation of m0c².

Wait, m = 6.015 u = 6.015 * 1.660539e-27 kg = approx 6.015 * 1.66e-27 ≈ 9.987e-27 kg.

m0c² = 9.987e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 9.987e-27 * 9e16 = 8.9883e-10 J.

Converting to GeV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 1 GeV = 1.602e-10 J.

So 8.9883e-10 J / 1.602e-10 J/GeV = 5.61 GeV approximately.

Wait, but wait, 5.61 GeV is the rest mass energy. But the problem is asking for the total energy, which is gamma times m0c². So gamma is 3.5714, so E = 3.5714 * 5.61 GeV.

Let me compute that: 3.5714 *5.61.

Hmm, 3.5 *5.61 is 19.635, and 0.0714 *5.61 is about 0.402. So total around 20.037 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, option D is 21.419 GeV, which is higher, option B is 23 GeV, which is higher, option A is ~18 GeV, which is lower.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the Lorentz factor. v = 0.96c, so beta = 0.96.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784).

What's sqrt(0.0784)? Hmm, 0.0784 is (0.28)^2, because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28, so gamma=1/0.28≈3.57142857. So that part is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the mass of Li-6 is more accurately 6.015074 atomic mass units. Let me recalculate the rest mass energy with more precision.

So m = 6.015074 u.

So m in kg is 6.015074 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

Calculating that: 6 * 1.66053906660e-27 = 9.9632344e-27 kg.

0.015074 * 1.66053906660e-27 = 0.015074 * 1.6605390666e-27 = let's compute 0.015 *1.660539 = 0.024908085e-27 kg. So total m is 9.9632344e-27 + 0.024908085e-27 = approximately 9.9881425e-27 kg.

Then m0c^2 = 9.9881425e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 9.9881425e-27 *9e16 = 8.98932825e-10 J.

Convert that to GeV:

1 GeV = 1.602176634e-10 J.

So m0c^2 = 8.98932825e-10 J / 1.602176634e-10 J/GeV ≈ 5.610 GeV.

Wait, 8.98932825e-10 / 1.602176634e-10 = 5.610 GeV exactly? Let me compute 8.98932825 /1.602176634.

Let me compute numerically:

1.602176634 × 5 = 8.01088317. So 5 gives 8.01, which is less than 8.989. 5.6 ×1.602176634 is 5×1.602176634 =8.01088317, plus 0.6×1.602176634=0.961306. So 8.01088317 + 0.961306 = 8.972189.

So 5.6 gives 8.972189. The numerator is 8.98932825. The difference is 8.98932825 -8.972189=0.017139.

Each 0.01 increase in the multiplier gives an increase of 1.602176634e-2. Because 0.01 *1.602176634e-10 is 0.01 times the value. Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute (8.98932825e-10) / (1.602176634e-10) = (8.98932825 /1.602176634) GeV.

So 8.98932825 /1.602176634 = let's compute it:

1.602176634 ×5 =8.01088317.

8.98932825 -8.01088317=0.97844508.

Now, 0.97844508 /1.602176634 ≈ 0.6104.

So total is 5.6104 GeV. So m0c² is approximately 5.6104 GeV.

Then, E = gamma * m0c² = 3.57142857 *5.6104 GeV.

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.6104.

3 ×5.6104=16.8312

0.57142857 ×5.6104: let's compute 0.5 *5.6104 =2.8052, 0.07142857 *5.6104 ≈ 0.4022.

So 2.8052 +0.4022 =3.2074.

Total E=16.8312 +3.2074=20.0386 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close but a bit higher. Hmm, perhaps I made an approximation error in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6104 more accurately.

Compute 3.57142857 ×5.6104:

We can write 3.57142857 as 25/7, since 25/7=3.57142857.

So 25/7 ×5.6104 = (25 ×5.6104) /7 =140.26 /7 =20.0371428 GeV.

So approximately 20.037 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132, which is higher. So perhaps my calculation is slightly off. Maybe I made a mistake in the mass of Li-6.

Wait, let me check the exact mass of Li-6. I think the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.015074 u.

So m =6.015074 u.

So m =6.015074 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

Let me compute that accurately:

6.015074 *1.66053906660e-27 = let's compute step by step.

Compute 6 *1.66053906660e-27 =9.9632344e-27 kg.

0.015074 *1.66053906660e-27 = let me calculate:

0.01 *1.6605390666e-27 =1.6605390666e-29 kg.

0.005074 *1.6605390666e-27 = let's compute 0.005 *1.6605390666e-27=8.302695333e-30 kg.

0.000074 *1.6605390666e-27= approx 1.2247e-31 kg.

So adding those:

1.6605390666e-29 =1.6605390666e-29

8.302695333e-30 = 0.8302695333e-29

1.2247e-31 =0.012247e-29

Adding together: 1.6605390666 + 0.8302695333 =2.4908086e-29, plus 0.012247e-29 gives 2.5030556e-29 kg.

So total m =9.9632344e-27 + 2.5030556e-29 = 9.9632344e-27 + 0.025030556e-27 = 9.98826496e-27 kg.

So m0c² = 9.98826496e-27 kg * (3e8)^2 m²/s².

(3e8)^2 =9e16 m²/s².

So m0c² =9.98826496e-27 kg *9e16 = 8.989438464e-10 J.

Now, convert to GeV: 8.989438464e-10 J / 1.602176634e-10 J/GeV = 8.989438464 /1.602176634 ≈ 5.6098 GeV.

Wait, let me compute 8.989438464 / 1.602176634.

Using a calculator, 8.989438464 ÷1.602176634 = approximately 5.6098 GeV.

So m0c² = approximately 5.6098 GeV.

Then, E = gamma * m0c² =3.57142857 *5.6098.

Let me compute that more accurately.

3.57142857 ×5.6098:

Let me break it down:

3 ×
