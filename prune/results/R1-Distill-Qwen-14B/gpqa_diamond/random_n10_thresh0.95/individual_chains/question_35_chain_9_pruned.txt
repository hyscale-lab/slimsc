Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let me try to unpack it step by step.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, of a muon. The operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row [0, -i] and the second row [i, 0].

So the problem asks me to find the eigenvalue and eigenvectors of Ay. And from the options, I need to pick which statement is correct about the process.

Let me think about the structure here. Since Ay is c times S, which is a 2x2 matrix, I can write Ay as:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Wait, that would make Ay a 2x2 matrix. Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0.

But perhaps it's easier to note that S is a Pauli matrix. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Wait, let me recall their forms. σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So S here is actually σy.

So S is the Pauli Y matrix. Then, since Ay = c * S, where c = h/(4π), maybe I can use properties of Pauli matrices to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Wait, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues of ±1. So if S has eigenvalues +1 and -1, then Ay would have eigenvalues c*(1) and c*(-1), which would be c and -c.

Let me compute c: c = h/(4π), so the eigenvalues of Ay are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). But wait, wait, no: S is actually σy, which has eigenvalues ±1. So when multiplied by c, Ay's eigenvalues are c*(1) and c*(-1), which are c and -c. So eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). But wait, let's double-check.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute it directly. Let's compute the matrix Ay.

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So the matrix elements are Ay_11=0, Ay_12= -i h/(4π), Ay_21= i h/(4π), Ay_22=0.

To find the eigenvalues, compute the trace and determinant. The trace is 0 + 0 =0. The determinant is (0)(0) - (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)).

Wait, the determinant is (0)(0) - ( (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) )

Let me compute that:

(-i) * i = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

So the second term is (-i * i ) (h^2/(16 π²)) ) → (1) (h²/(16 π²)).

So determinant is 0 - [ (1) (h²/(16 π²)) ) ] * ( (-i)(i) ) → Wait, wait, perhaps I should re-calculate:

The determinant is (0)(0) - ( (-i h/(4π)) )*( i h/(4π) )

So that's 0 - [ (-i)(i) * (h^2/(4π)^2) ) ]

Compute (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

So determinant is - [ 1 * (h^2/(16 π²)) ] = - h²/(16 π²)

Wait, but wait, for a 2x2 matrix, the characteristic equation is λ^2 - Tr(Ay) λ + Det(Ay) = 0.

Since Tr(Ay)=0, the equation becomes λ² + ( - Det(Ay) ) =0. Wait, no: the standard equation is λ² - Tr(Ay) λ + Det(Ay) =0. Since Tr is zero, it becomes λ² + Det(Ay) =0.

Wait, no, more precisely: the equation is λ² - (trace) λ + determinant = 0. Since the trace is zero, it's λ² + determinant = 0.

So λ² = - determinant → λ² = h²/(16 π²) → λ =
