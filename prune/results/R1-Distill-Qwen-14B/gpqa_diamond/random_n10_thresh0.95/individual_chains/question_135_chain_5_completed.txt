Okay, so I'm trying to solve this particle physics problem. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X, given its interaction with fermions. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f f̄ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f (y). Hmm, I think I remember that in particle physics, the Lagrangian terms dictate how particles interact. So this term suggests that the boson X is interacting with fermions, which are represented by ψ_f.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So the question is asking which fermions can X decay into. So decay products must be allowed both by conservation laws and energy considerations.

First, I need to figure out the possible fermion pairs that X can decay into. Since X is a boson, it can couple to fermions in pairs. Each fermion has an anti-fermion partner, so possible decay products are like f f̄, such as electron-positron, muon-antimuon, etc.

But wait, what determines which fermions can be produced? Well, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because in a decay, the parent particle's mass must be equal to or greater than the sum of the rest masses of the decay products. Otherwise, the decay is kinematically forbidden.

So I need to know the masses of the fermions. Let's list them:

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~2.2 MeV (0.0022 GeV)
- Down quark (d): ~4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)
- Strange (s): ~100 MeV (0.1 GeV)
- Charm (c): ~1.275 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.7 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV

Wait, but wait, the X has a mass of 6 GeV. So for each fermion pair f f̄, 2m_f must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let me compute 2m_f for each:

- e: 2 * 0.0005 = 0.001 GeV --> way less than 6 GeV. So allowed.
- μ: 0.21 GeV --> allowed.
- τ: 3.554 GeV. 3.554 <6, so allowed.
- u: 0.0044 GeV --> allowed.
- d: 0.0094 GeV --> allowed.
- s: 0.2 GeV --> allowed.
- c: 2.55 GeV --> allowed.
- b: 9.4 GeV --> 9.4 >6, not allowed.
- t: 346 GeV --> way above, so no.

So, X can decay into pairs where 2m_f ≤6 GeV. So which fermions are these?

The cutoff is at 3 GeV because 6 GeV is the mass of X. Wait, no, because 2m_f ≤6 GeV → m_f ≤3 GeV.

Wait, looking at the fermions:

m_f must be ≤3 GeV for 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

So checking each:

e (~0.0005 GeV): yes.
μ (~0.105): yes.
τ (~1.777): yes, 1.777 <3.
c (~1.275): yes, 1.275 <3.
s (~0.1): yes.
u and d are way under.

But b is 4.7 GeV, so 2m_b=9.4 GeV >6 GeV → not allowed.

So possible decay products are any fermion pair where m_f ≤3 GeV.

So which fermions have m_f ≤3 GeV?

e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c. So all except b and t.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but b is 4.7 GeV, so 2mb=9.4 GeV>6 GeV → decay into b b-bar is not allowed. So option A includes b, which is forbidden. So A is wrong.

Option B: includes c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, c's mass is about 1.275 GeV, so 2mc=2.55 GeV ≤6 → allowed. So yes, c is allowed.

So in option B, the decay includes c, which is allowed. Also, they have s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So these are all allowed. So B seems possible.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. Wait, t is top quark, which is way too heavy—m_t is ~173 GeV. So 2mt is ~346 GeV >>6 GeV. So decay into t is impossible. So option C is invalid.

Option D: X→ b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But again, b is 4.7 GeV, so can't decay into b. So D is wrong.

So the correct option is B because it includes all the allowed fermion pairs except for b and t. Let me check option B again.

Option B: c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, these are all allowed. So the answer should be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on its interaction with fermions. The Lagrangian provided indicates that \( X \) couples to fermion-antifermion pairs (\( f\bar{f} \)). For a decay \( X \to f\bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the mass of \( X \) must be at least twice the mass of the fermion (\( 2m_f \leq m_X \)).

The masses of the fermions are as follows:
- \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_u \approx 0.0022 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_d \approx 0.0047 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_s \approx 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_c \approx 1.275 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_b \approx 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

For \( X \) with \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), the condition \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) implies \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This allows the following fermions:
- \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \)

Decays into \( b \bar{b} \) (\( m_b = 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \)) and \( t \bar{t} \) (\( m_t = 173 \, \text{GeV} \)) are forbidden because \( 2m_b = 9.4 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

Now, analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is forbidden. Hence, A is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Hence, B is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is forbidden. Hence, C is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is forbidden. Hence, D is incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \).

Answer: B
