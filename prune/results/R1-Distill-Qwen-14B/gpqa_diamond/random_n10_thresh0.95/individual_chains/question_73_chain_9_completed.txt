Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about relativity. But I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get it right.

The problem says: Two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is about finding their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that in relativity, adding speeds isn't as straightforward as classical mechanics. Oh right, you can't just add them because that could exceed the speed of light, which isn't possible. So I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

Wait, what's the formula again? Oh yeah, the formula for relative velocity u' when two objects are moving at u and v relative to each other. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. Oh right, the formula is u' = (u - v) / (1 - (uv)/c²), but wait, I'm not sure about the direction. Wait, no, I think that's when u is the velocity of the object in one frame and v is the velocity of that frame relative to another. So in this case, I guess one astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the other at 0.5c, but in the same direction. So to find the relative speed of one from the other's frame, I need to use this formula.

Wait, wait—let's get this right. Let me visualize it. Let's say we have astronaut A moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So in the rest frame of astronaut B, what's the speed of astronaut A?

So in this case, u (the velocity of the object, which is astronaut A) is 0.6c, and the frame's velocity v is 0.5c. So plugging into the formula, u' = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c²). Simplify the numerator: 0.1c. The denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So u' = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. So approximately 0.14c. Hmm, looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that's a start.

Now, what about the total energy of the system? The total energy for each astronaut would be their relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared. So I need to calculate each astronaut's energy and sum them up.

Wait, but the problem says the masses are 2m and 3m. So astronaut A has mass 2m, moving at 0.6c. Let's compute their gamma: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

For astronaut A: v = 0.6c, so v²/c² is 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E_A is gamma * m_total * c². Wait, but wait, their mass is 2m, so E_A = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Wait, wait, no, the energy equation is E = gamma * m_rest * c². So for astronaut A: m_rest is 2m. So 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

For astronaut B: mass is 3m, speed 0.5c. So v²/c² is 0.25. 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660, so gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So E_B is 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 3 * 1.1547 = 3.4641, so E_B ≈ 3.4641 mc².

Adding E_A and E_B: 2.5 + 3.4641 ≈ 5.9641 mc². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc², which is less than what I calculated. So the E is 5.96 mc².

So the correct option should have relative speed 0.14c and E=5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C is v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². So the answer should be option C.

Wait but wait another thing. The relative speed I calculated is when one is moving at 0.6c and the other at 0.5c, same direction. So when B is moving at 0.5c, and A is moving at 0.6c, so from B's perspective, A's speed is 0.14c. But the question is about the relative speed of the system. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the center of momentum frame. Oh wait, no, the question is about the relative speed between the two astronauts. Hmm, but the problem says, "the relative speed and the total energy of the system." Wait, no, the question is about "the relative speed and the total energy of the system." Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Because the total energy of the system would be the sum of their relativistic energies.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the two astronauts are moving in the same direction. So when I calculate the relative speed, it's about how fast one is moving relative to the other. So the calculation I did earlier is correct, giving approx 0.14c.

Now, looking back at the options, option C matches: 0.14c and 5.96 mc². Option D has E as 5 mc², which is lower. So the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(u = 0.6c\) (speed of astronaut A), \(v = 0.5c\) (speed of astronaut B), and \(c\) is the speed of light. Substituting these values:

\[
u' = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system. The relativistic energy of each astronaut is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For astronaut A (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

For astronaut B (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

The total energy of the system is the sum of the two energies:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

Finally, comparing the results with the options, the relative speed is \(0.14c\) and the total energy is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). These match the values in option C.
