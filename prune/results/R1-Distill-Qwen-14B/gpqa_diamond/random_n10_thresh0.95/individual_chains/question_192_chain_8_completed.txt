Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields around a conductor. Let me read the question again and make sure I understand it.

Alright, we've got an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity has radius r, and its center is separated by distance s from the center of the conductor. So the conductor's center and the cavity's center are not the same point because s isn't zero. The radius of the cavity is smaller than R, which makes sense because it's inside the conductor.

Now, someone places a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the conductor's center, and it's at a distance l from the cavity's center. Both L and l are greater than R, so point P is outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options given are four different expressions for E. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with conductors, the charges redistribute themselves in certain ways. Since the conductor is uncharged, the total charge on it is zero. But wait, we placed a charge +q inside the cavity. How does that affect the conductor?

Oh right, when a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, it induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor. The inner surface will have an induced charge of -q because the conductor's material must cancel the electric field within the conductor itself. But wait, wait—the conductor was initially neutral, so the inner surface will have -q, and the outer surface must have +q to balance it out. Because the total charge is zero, the inner is -q, outer is +q, so total conductor charge is zero.

But wait, the conductor was uncharged, so yes, that makes sense. So the inner surface of the conductor (the part facing the cavity) has -q, and the outer surface has +q.

Now, the electric field outside the conductor would be due to the charges on the outer surface. Because, inside the conductor, the electric field is zero, and any charge inside the conductor resides on the surfaces. So, for points outside, the field is as if all the outer charges are concentrated at the center.

Wait, but in this case, the outer charge is +q. So the electric field at P should be the same as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor. Because, in electrostatics, the electric field outside a spherical conductor is the same as that produced by a point charge at the center.

So, the point P is located outside the conductor. The conductor's radius is R, and P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. So the field at P depends on the charge of the outer surface, which is +q, and the distance L.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the charge +q is inside the cavity, not at the center of the conductor. The cavity's center is offset by s from the conductor's center. So the induced charges on the inner surface of the conductor would not be uniformly distributed because the cavity is off-center. But wait, no—wait, the inner surface's charge distribution is such that the field inside the conductor is zero. So for a cavity with charge +q, regardless of where it is placed inside, the inner surface must have an induced charge of -q. But if the cavity isn't at the center, does the inner surface still have a uniform charge distribution? No, because the charge inside the cavity is not at the center, the inner surface's charge distribution would be non-uniform—like it would be more concentrated in the direction away from the +q charge.

But wait, I'm trying to find the field outside the conductor. For that, the outer surface's distribution is what matters. Even if the inner charges are non-uniform, the outer charges would arrange themselves uniformly because the conductor is neutral except for the induced charges. Wait, no—wait, the conductor's outer surface has a net charge of +q, right? Because the inner surface is -q, and the conductor was initially neutral, so the outer surface must have +q. Because the conductor's total charge is zero, so inner is -q, outer is +q.

But how is the outer charge distributed? For a conductor, the charges on the outer surface will arrange to be uniform, because the conductor is a sphere. Oh wait, the conductor itself is a spherical conductor, so even if the cavity is off-center, the outer surface remains symmetric. So the outer surface's charge distribution is spherically symmetric. Because the conductor is a sphere, any external points would see the field as if the charge is at the center.

Wait, but that's only when the outer surface is spherically symmetric. So in this case, the outer surface has a charge of +q, and it's distributed uniformly. So the electric field outside the conductor would be the same as that of a point charge +q at the center of the sphere.

So the electric field at point P, outside the conductor, would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to P.

Looking at the options:

Option B is (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²). That seems right.

Wait, but let me think again. The point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, and the angle between l and s is theta. Does this affect the calculation?

Wait, no. Because the field outside the conductor is due to the outer surface's charge, which is uniformly distributed on the conductor's surface. Therefore, the field at P depends only on the distance from the conductor's center to P, which is L. The position of the cavity's charge relative to the conductor's center doesn't matter because the outer surface's field is uniform and spherically symmetric.

So, the correct expression should be option B: E = (1/4πε₀) * q/(L²).

Alternatively, could the field be calculated as if the charge is at the center? Because the conductor's outer surface's charge is +q, the field outside would be as if it's a point charge at the center, regardless of the internal configuration.

So I think the correct answer is option B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the system as follows:

1. **System Description**: The setup consists of an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ inside. The center of the cavity is offset by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity.

2. **Induced Charges**: Since the conductor is initially uncharged, the total charge on it is zero. The presence of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor (to cancel the electric field within the conductor). To maintain charge neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$.

3. **Outer Surface Charge**: The outer surface of the conductor has a net charge of $+q$, and due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor, this charge distributes uniformly on the outer surface. The electric field outside the conductor is therefore determined by the charge on the outer surface, as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

4. **Electric Field at Point $P$**: Point $P$ is located outside the conductor at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The electric field at $P$ is given by the field produced by a point charge $+q$ at the center of the conductor, which is:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

5. **Irrelevance of Internal Configuration**: The position of the cavity's center relative to the conductor's center (i.e., the offset $s$ and the angle $\theta$) does not affect the electric field outside the conductor. This is because the outer surface charge distribution is uniform and spherically symmetric, making the field outside the conductor depend only on the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$ from the conductor's center.

6. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. This expression does not account for the uniform distribution of the outer surface charge and introduces unnecessary dependence on $l$, $s$, and $\theta$.
   - **Option B**: Correct. This matches the electric field produced by a point charge $+q$ at the center of the conductor, consistent with the uniform distribution of the outer surface charge.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. Similar to Option A, this introduces an incorrect dependence on $l$, $s$, and $\theta$.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While this resembles the field of a point charge, it incorrectly uses $l$ (the distance from the cavity's center) instead of $L$ (the distance from the conductor's center).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
