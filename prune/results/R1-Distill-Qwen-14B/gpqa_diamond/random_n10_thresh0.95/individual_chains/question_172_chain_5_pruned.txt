Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let me think. The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. They’re asking about the effective temperatures using LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). 

I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. Oh right, the Boltzmann factor. The population ratio between two energy levels is given by (n_i/n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). 

Wait, the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So maybe n1 is twice n2 for a specific energy level. I think n1 = 2 n2. Oh wait, but the question says the energy difference is E. So, E = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J. 

So let's model it. Let’s say for star_1, the ratio is n1_upper / n1_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -E/(k T1) ). Similarly for star_2, n2_upper / n2_lower = same g term * exp( -E/(k T2) ). 

But wait, the problem says that the number of excited atoms is twice. Oh wait, maybe the ratio in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower). 

So substituting the Boltzmann expressions: 

(g_u/g_l) * exp(-E/(k T1)) = 2 * [ (g_u/g_l) * exp(-E/(k T2)) ) ]

Oh, the (g_u/g_l) terms cancel out since they're the same for both stars. So we get:

exp( -E/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -E/(k T2) )

Let me take the natural logarithm on both sides. 

ln(exp( -E/(k T1) )) = ln(2) + ln(exp( -E/(k T2) )).

Simplify each side. The left becomes -E/(k T1), the right becomes ln(2) - E/(k T2). 

So:

-E/(k T1) = ln(2) - E/(k T2).

Let me rearrange this. Bring the E/(k T2) to the left and the other terms to the right.

-E/(k T1) + E/(k T2) = ln(2).

Factor out E/(k):

E/(k) [ -1/T1 + 1/T2 ] = ln(2).

Wait, that's E/(k) ( (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2) ) ), because -1/T1 +1/T2 = (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2).

So:

E/(k) * (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Hmm, but let's solve for the temperatures. Let me factor this differently. Let's write:

E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2).

Wait, because (T2 - T1) negative. So it's E/(k) ( (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

Wait, but the problem is that the options are in terms of T1 and T2 without any E or k. So perhaps we can express this relation in terms of T1 and T2.

Alternatively, let's look for the equation in terms of T1 and T2. Let me rearrange the equation:

E/(k) ( (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2).

Which can be rewritten as:

E/(k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

So,

ln(2) = (E/(k)) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2).

Wait, but the options don't have E or k, so perhaps the equation is written in terms of the temperatures. Let me think about the relation between T1 and T2.

Wait, but the question is about the correct equation for T1 and T2. Let me think again.

Wait, from the earlier equation after taking logs:

- E/(k T1) = ln(2) - E/(k T2)

Let me bring all terms to one side:

E/(k T2) - E/(k T1) = ln(2).

Factor out E/(k):

E/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2).

Which can be written as:

E/(k) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2).

Hmm, so rearranging:

ln(2) = [ E/(k) (T1 - T2) ] / ( T1 T2 )

But wait, the options don't have E or k. Maybe the energy difference E is given, but perhaps the problem expects us to eliminate E somehow or realize that the equation can be expressed in terms of temperatures.

Wait, but the question is about the equation that relates T1 and T2 correctly. So the equation we've got is:

ln(2) = (E/(k T1 T2)) (T1 - T2).

Is that possible? Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

But in our equation, it's ln(2) = [ E/(k) (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2 ). So if E/(k) is a constant, perhaps the given equation in the options includes that.

Wait, but the question only gives E = 1.38e-23 J. Let me see what E/(k) is.

Wait, k is the Boltzmann constant, approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So E is given as 1.38e-23 J. So E is equal to k times what? E = k * T. Let's see:

E = k * T → T = E/(k). But E is 1.38e-23 J, same as k. So E/k = (1.38e-23 J)/(1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K. So E/(k) is 1 K.

Oh! So E/(k) = 1 K. So substituting back into our equation:

ln(2) = (1 K) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, that's option D.

Wait, let me check the options again:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Yes, that's exactly what we have.
