The key points considered were the effects of PFA and DSG on crosslinking, DNA shearing, and antibody binding. The analysis concluded that the peaks were most likely located at active promoters and enhancers, where transcription factors like IKAROS bind. These regions are sensitive to crosslinking changes, leading to the disappearance of peaks when DSG is added.\n\n**Answer: D**"
