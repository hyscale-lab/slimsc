Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is about their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, each giving a different relative speed and energy.

First, I remember that when dealing with velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them normally because of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Newtonian mechanics would say the relative speed is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c, but I think that's not correct in relativity. Wait, no, actually, in relativity, if both objects are moving in the same direction, the relative velocity isn't simply the difference. Oh right, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Let me recall that correctly.

So here, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from astronaut 1's frame, what's the speed of astronaut 2? Or maybe it's vice versa. Wait, but the problem asks for the relative speed. I think the relative speed is the speed that one would measure the other to be moving at. So let's say, from astronaut 1's perspective, what's astronaut 2's speed?

Using the formula, u is 0.6c, and v is 0.5c. Wait, no, wait: the formula is for when you have two frames S and S', where S' is moving at speed v relative to S. So if I'm in the frame of astronaut 1 (u is 0.6c), and I'm trying to find the speed of astronaut 2 in that frame. So the velocity u' of astronaut 2 in S' is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). So u is the original speed (0.5c?), wait no, wait: I'm a bit confused. Let me get this straight.

Wait, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c in the lab frame, and astronaut 2 is moving
