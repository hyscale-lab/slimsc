Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound.

First, I'll start by analyzing the spectroscopic data provided. Let's look at the IR data first.

IR peaks: 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1.

The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 cm-1 usually indicates an O-H stretch. So that suggests the compound has a hydroxyl group. Wait, but wait, red phosphorus and HI are being used. Oh, right, that's typically a reaction for the hydrolysis of esters or maybe something involving an elimination, but I'll get back to that.

The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong indication of a carbonyl group. That could be either a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have O-H stretches which are usually broader and around 2500-3300 cm-1. But the IR here shows a peak from 3400-2500, which is a broad region—maybe that's the O-H of a carboxylic acid. So if there's a carbonyl and an O-H, maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

But wait, another possibility: maybe it's an ester. Esters have carbonyl around 1720, but their O-H (if any) would be from an alcohol, but that's not present if it's an ester. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a ketone and an alcohol. But let me think again.

Wait, the 1720 cm-1 could be an ester. Alternatively, a ketone would be around 1700-1750, but perhaps the exact position depends on other factors. Wait, but carboxylic acids have their carbonyl around 1700 cm-1.
