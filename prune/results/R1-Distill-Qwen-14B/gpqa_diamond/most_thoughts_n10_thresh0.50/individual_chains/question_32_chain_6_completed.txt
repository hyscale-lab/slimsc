Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is X, which is lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, lithium normally has 3 protons, right? So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would make it lithium-6, I think. Because lithium usually has 3 protons and 3 neutrons for the isotope Li-6.

So, the first thing I need to figure out is the rest mass of the lithium nucleus. I remember that the mass of a nucleus isn't just the sum of the individual protons and neutrons because of binding energy and mass defect. But wait, maybe for this problem, I can approximate the mass using the sum of the masses of the individual nucleons. Or perhaps I should look up the exact mass of lithium-6.

Wait, I think I remember that the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c² and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So, for lithium-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass would be (3 * 938) + (3 * 939) MeV/c². Let me calculate that: 3*938 is 2814, 3*939 is 2817. Adding them together gives 2814 + 2817 = 5631 MeV, which is 5.631 GeV. But wait, that's the sum of all the nucleons. The actual mass should be slightly less due to the mass defect, but I'm not sure if I should consider that here. The problem might be assuming I can use the sum of the individual masses, so I'll proceed with that for now. But I hope that's correct.

Next, the problem is about relativistic energy. The formula for the total energy of a relativistic particle is E = gamma * m₀ c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the speed v is given as 0.96c, I can compute gamma.

Let me compute the Lorentz factor step by step. So v = 0.96c. Then v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.96 squared is indeed 0.9216. 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that exactly: 1 divided by 0.28. Let's see, 0.28 is the same as 28/100 =7/25. So 1/(7/25)=25/7≈3.57142857. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

So the total energy E would be gamma multiplied by m₀ c². But wait, m₀ is the rest mass, which I calculated as 5.631 GeV/c². So E = 3.5714 * 5.631 GeV. Let me compute that.

First, 5.631 multiplied by 3.5714. Let me break this down:

5 * 3.5714 = 17.857
0.631 * 3.5714 ≈ Let's see, 0.6 *3.5714 is about 2.1428, and 0.031 *3.5714 is approximately 0.1107. So adding those gives 2.1428 + 0.1107 = 2.2535. So total would be 17.857 + 2.2535 ≈ 20.1105 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute it more accurately. 5.631 * 3.5714.

Let me do it step by step:

3.5714 * 5.631 = ?

Breaking it down:

3.5714 * 5 = 17.857

3.5714 * 0.6 = 2.14284

3.5714 * 0.03 = 0.107142

3.5714 * 0.001 = 0.0035714

Adding them all up:

17.857 + 2.14284 = 20.0

20.0 + 0.107142 = 20.107142

20.107142 + 0.0035714 = 20.1107134 GeV.

So approximately 20.1107 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. But wait, perhaps I missed some precision in calculating gamma or the mass.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with gamma. Let me recalculate gamma with more exactness.

v = 0.96 c.

So v² = (0.96)^2 c².

So 1 - (v²/c²) = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28, right? So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857 approximately.

But perhaps I should be more precise. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately. Wait, 0.28^2 is 0.0784 exactly, so sqrt is exactly 0.28. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Another possibility is that I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me think again. Lithium-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and each neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c².

So the exact rest mass would be:

3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV
3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV
Total: 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV = 5.633511 GeV.

So perhaps I should use m₀ = 5.6335 GeV/c². That would change the energy calculation.

So E = gamma * m₀ c² = 3.57142857 * 5.6335 GeV.

Let me compute that with more precise numbers.

First, 3.57142857 * 5.6335.

Let me compute 5.6335 * 3.57142857:

I can think of 3.57142857 as 25/7, which is approximately 3.57142857.

So 5.6335 * 25/7 = (5.6335 *25) /7.

5.6335 *25: 5 *25=125, 0.6335 *25=15.8375. So total is 125 +15.8375=140.8375.

Divide by 7: 140.8375 /7 ≈20.119642857 GeV.

So approximately 20.1196 GeV.

Looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close but a bit higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the exact value.

Alternatively, maybe the mass of lithium-6 is different. Let me check. The actual mass of a Li-6 nucleus can be looked up, but since I'm trying to think this through without external resources, I'll proceed.

Wait, another thought: when you have a nucleus, the mass isn't exactly the sum of the individual nucleons because of the binding energy. For example, the mass of a nucleus is less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons because energy is released when the nucleus forms (mass defect). So perhaps the mass I should use is the actual mass of Li-6.

Wait, I can recall that the actual mass of Li-6 is about 5.639552 GeV/c². Wait, is that correct? I'm not entirely sure, but let's proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is given as the atomic mass. Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0105 atomic mass units (u). Since 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c², so 6.0105 u is 6.0105 * 931.5 MeV.

Compute that: 6 *931.5 = 5589, 0.0105 *931.5 ≈9.78075. So total is 5589 +9.78075 =5598.78075 MeV, which is approximately 5.59878 GeV.

Wait, that's different from what I calculated earlier. Hmm, so which one is correct? Oh! Because the mass I calculated earlier (5.6335 GeV) was based on the sum of protons and neutrons, but the actual mass of the lithium-6 nucleus is less than that, because of the binding energy. So perhaps I should use the actual mass based on the atomic mass.

Wait, but wait: the atomic mass includes electrons as well. So if I'm considering the nucleus (only protons and neutrons), the mass would be the atomic mass minus the electrons. Let me think.

A lithium-6 atom has 3 electrons. Each electron has a mass of about 0.511 MeV/c². So 3 electrons would be 1.533 MeV.

So the nuclear mass (M) would be the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass.

Atomic mass of Li-6: 6.0105 u → 6.0105 * 931.5 MeV = let me compute that. 6 *931.5 is 5589, 0.0105 *931.5 is approx 9.78075. So total is 5589 +9.78075 =5598.78075 MeV.

Electrons' mass: 3 * 0.511 = 1.533 MeV.

So nuclear mass M = 5598.78075 MeV -1.533 MeV = 5597.24775 MeV = 5.59724775 GeV.

So around 5.5972 GeV.

Wait, that's quite different from the earlier sum of 5.6335 GeV.

So perhaps I should use this 5.5972 GeV as the rest mass.

So going back, gamma is 3.57142857, and m₀ is 5.5972 GeV/c².

E = gamma * m₀ c² = 3.57142857 *5.5972 GeV.

Let me compute that:

3.57142857 *5.5972 = ?

I can compute 3.5714 *5.5972.

Let me compute 3 *5.5972 =16.7916
0.5714 *5.5972 ≈ 3.192 (since 0.5 *5.5972=2.7986, and 0.0714*5.5972≈0.4000. So 2.7986 +0.4=3.1986, but let me be precise.)

Wait, 0.5714 *5.5972:

First, 5.5972 * 0.5 =2.7986
5.5972 * 0.07=0.391804
5.5972 *0.0014=0.00783608
Adding them up: 2.7986 +0.391804=3.190404 +0.00783608=3.19824008.

So 3.5714 *5.5972 =16.7916 + 3.19824008=20. (16.7916 +3.19824 ≈19.9898?) Wait, 16 +3 is 19, 0.7916 +0.19824 =0.98984. So approximately 19.9898 GeV.

Wait, but that gives around 19.9898 GeV, which is about 20.0 GeV. But looking at the options, the closest is option C (20.132 GeV) and option D (21.419 GeV). Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should not use the atomic mass but the mass number.

Wait, the mass of the nucleus is approximately the mass number times the average mass of a nucleon. The mass number A for Li-6 is 6. The average mass per nucleon is about 938.5 MeV/c². So 6 *938.5 MeV = 5631 MeV =5.631 GeV. But earlier, using the actual atomic mass, I got about 5.597 GeV.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem expects me to use the mass number times the average nucleon mass without worrying about binding energy. So perhaps I should go back to the initial approach with m₀=5.631 GeV.

So using gamma=3.5714, m₀=5.631 GeV:

E =3.5714 *5.631 = Let me compute this precisely.

Compute 3.5714 *5.631:

I'll multiply 5.631 by 3.5714.

Let me break it down:

5 *3.5714 =17.857
0.631 *3.5714 = ?

0.6 *3.5714 =2.14284
0.03 *3.5714=0.107142
0.001 *3.5714=0.0035714
Adding these: 2.14284 +0.107142=2.25, plus 0.0035714 → approx 2.2535.

So total E =17.857 +2.2535 =20.1105 GeV.

So about 20.1105 GeV, which rounds to approximately 20.111 GeV.

Looking at the options again: option C is 20.132 GeV, and option D is 21.419 GeV. So 20.111 is closest to option C.

But wait, why is option D so much higher? Maybe I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me check gamma again.

Wait, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) → 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) → 1 / sqrt(0.0784) →1/0.28=3.5714. That's correct.

Hmm, but perhaps the speed is 0.96c, so beta (β) is 0.96. So gamma is 1/sqrt(1-β²) = 3.571428.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise numbers.

Wait, 0.96 squared is exactly 0.9216. So 1-0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857...

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. Wait, no, the question asks for the energy of the collider, which is the total energy of the nucleus.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nucleus is moving in a collider, so the energy is the total energy. So I'm correct in using E = gamma m c².

But looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close to my calculation of 20.1105 GeV. But perhaps I should be more precise in the m₀ calculation.

Earlier, when I used the atomic mass, I got m₀=5.5972 GeV, leading to E≈19.99 GeV, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps the problem expects me to use the sum of the nucleon masses, leading to m₀=5.631 GeV.

So with m₀=5.631 GeV, E =3.5714 *5.631 =20.11 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

But wait, perhaps I can compute it more accurately. Let's do 3.57142857 *5.631.

3.57142857 *5.631.

Let me compute this step by step:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285
3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142
3.57142857 *0.03 =0.1071428571
3.57142857 *0.001=0.00357142857

Adding these together:

17.85714285
+2.142857142 =20. (exactly 20.0)
Then +0.1071428571 =20.1071428571
+0.00357142857 =20.1107142857 GeV.

So approximately 20.1107 GeV.

The options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

So option C is 20.132, which is very close to my calculated 20.1107 GeV.

Wait, why the discrepancy? Perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me check the mass of Li-6 again.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0105 atomic mass units (u). 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.0105 u is 6.0105 *931.5 MeV.

Compute that:

6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.0105 *931.5 = 9.78075 MeV.

Total: 5589 +9.78075 =5598.78075 MeV.

That's 5.59878 GeV.

But wait, that's the mass of the entire Li-6 atom. Since the nucleus is Li-6 minus 3 electrons, I need to subtract the mass of the electrons. Each electron is about 0.511 MeV, so 3 *0.511 =1.533 MeV.

So nuclear mass is 5598.78075 MeV -1.533 MeV =5597.24775 MeV =5.59724775 GeV.

So using m₀ =5.5972 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.5972 GeV.

Compute that:

3.57142857 *5.5972.

Let me compute 5.5972 *3.57142857.

I can compute this as:

3 *5.5972=16.7916

0.57142857 *5.5972 ≈ Let me compute 0.5 *5.5972=2.7986, 0.07142857 *5.5972≈0.4000 (exact calculation: 0.07142857 *5.5972 = approx 5.5972 *0.07 =0.391804, plus 5.5972 *0.00142857 ≈0.008000, so total approx 0.3998.)

So 0.57142857 *5.5972 ≈2.7986 +0.3998 ≈3.1984.

So total E≈16.7916 +3.1984=20. (exactly 19.99 or 20.0 roughly.)

Wait, so E≈20.0 GeV.

But none of the options exactly match that. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV. But why is there a discrepancy?

Alternatively, perhaps I should not subtract the electrons' mass because the problem considers the nucleus as a collection of nucleons without the electrons. Wait, but the problem says the nucleus X, so it includes the protons and neutrons, but not the electrons. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute based on the sum of protons and neutrons, giving m₀=5.631 GeV.

So with m₀=5.631 GeV, E=3.5714 *5.631=20.1107 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV, which is about 20.11 GeV.

But wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma more precisely, using more decimal places.

Alternatively, perhaps the actual calculation requires the use of total energy formula and considering relativistic effects more accurately.

Wait, another approach: the energy can be calculated using the formula E = gamma * m₀ c², and gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), where beta is v/c.

So beta =0.96, so beta squared is 0.9216. 1 - beta^2 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28, so gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So E=3.57142857 * m₀ c².

If m₀ is 5.631 GeV/c², then E=3.57142857 *5.631.

Let me compute that more accurately.

5.631 *3.57142857:

5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285

0.631 *3.57142857:

0.6 *3.57142857 =2.142857142

0.03 *3.57142857=0.1071428571

0.001 *3.57142857=0.00357142857

Adding these: 2.142857142 +0.1071428571=2.25, plus 0.00357142857=2.253571429.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.253571429=20.11071428 GeV.

So approximately 20.1107 GeV, which is 20.1107 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. The slight discrepancy might be due to using more precise values for the mass or more precise calculations.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem uses the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus as 5.639 GeV/c². Let me recalculate with m₀=5.639 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.639 ≈?

3 *5.639=16.917

0.57142857 *5.639= Let me compute:

0.5 *5.639=2.8195

0.07142857 *5.639 ≈ 0.4044 (since 5.639 *0.07=0.39473, and 5.639*0.00142857≈0.00806. So adding gives 0.39473+0.00806=0.40279.

So 0.57142857 *5.639 ≈2.8195 +0.40279 =3.2223.

So total E=16.917 +3.2223=20.1393 GeV.

That would bring E to approximately 20.14 GeV, which is closer to option C (20.132 GeV) but not exactly matching. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the exact mass of Li-6 is slightly different. Let me think; perhaps I can look up the exact mass. But since I can't look it up right now, I'll proceed with the calculation that gives me around 20.11 GeV, which is very close to option C.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the rest mass energy in MeV and then converting to GeV. Let me check.

Wait, no, the calculation seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. But the question clearly states the energy of the collider, which is the total energy, including rest mass energy.

So, considering all that, the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) for a lithium-6 nucleus (Li-6) moving at 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} \), \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} \), and \( m_0 \) is the rest mass of the nucleus.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( \beta = 0.96 \), we compute:

\[
\beta^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
\]
\[
1 - \beta^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]
\[
\sqrt{1 - \beta^2} = \sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28
\]
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass \( m_0 \)
The lithium-6 nucleus (Li-6) consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using approximate masses:
- Proton: \( 938.272 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)
- Neutron: \( 939.565 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)

The total rest mass is:

\[
m_0 = (3 \times 938.272) + (3 \times 939.565) = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 = 5.6335 \, \text{GeV}/c^2
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
Using \( E = \gamma m_0 c^2 \):

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.6335 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking the multiplication:
\[
3.5714 \times 5 = 17.857
\]
\[
3.5714 \times 0.6335 \approx 2.2536
\]
\[
E \approx 17.857 + 2.2536 = 20.1106 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.1106 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:
- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too high.

Thus, the closest match is **C) 20.132 GeV**.

### Final Answer:
The energy of the RHIC for the lithium-6 nucleus moving at 0.96c is approximately \( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \).

**Answer: C**
