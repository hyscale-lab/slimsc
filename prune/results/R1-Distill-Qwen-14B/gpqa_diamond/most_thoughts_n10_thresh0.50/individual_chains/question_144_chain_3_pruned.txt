Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. I remember that mesons are particles made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are like unstable particles that decay quickly. The mean decay distance would depend on how long the particle lives on average before decaying, right?

The given data is production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. I think decay distance has to do with the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the mean decay distance (L) is the product of the lifetime (τ) and the velocity (v) of the particle, so L = v * τ.

Wait, how do I find the lifetime? I remember that the width Γ is related to the lifetime. There's this Heisenberg uncertainty principle thing, where ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. For particles, the width Γ is like the uncertainty in energy, so Γ ≈ ħ / τ. That makes τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, since Γ is the decay width, the mean lifetime τ is actually ħ divided by Γ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

So once I have τ, I need to find v. To find v, I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The particle is produced with energy E, which should be the total energy. The rest mass is m, so the kinetic energy is E - m*c². But wait, E is given in GeV, and m is in GeV/c². Oh right, but units might get complicated, so maybe I can use natural units where c=1. But I might have to convert units later.

E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c.

Wait, but E is in GeV, m in GeV/c²... Hmm, perhaps I can write p in terms of E and m without getting into the unit confusion right now. Let me think in terms of units where c=1. Then E has units of GeV, m is in GeV/c² but when c=1, m is in GeV. So E² = p² c^2 + m² c^4. But if c=1, E² = p² + m².

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to write the expressions more carefully.

E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

Solving for p:

p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 )

p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) ) / c.

But since E and m are given in GeV and GeV/c² respectively, let me make sure about the units. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the velocity using beta factors.

Beta (β) is v/c. And in terms of energy and mass, β = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)} ) * c.

Wait, no, let me think again. Gamma factor is γ = E/(m c²). Wait, E is the total energy, so yes.

So γ = E / (m c² )

But since E and m are in GeV, let me convert them into compatible units. Wait, actually, perhaps it's easier to compute β using the relation:

β = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

Wait, that's correct because E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. Dividing both sides by c^4:

(E/c^2)^2 = (p/(c))² + (m)^2.

So (E/c²)^2 = p^2 c^0 + m^2.

But perhaps I should compute beta as β = p c / E.

Ah, yes, because relativistic momentum p =
