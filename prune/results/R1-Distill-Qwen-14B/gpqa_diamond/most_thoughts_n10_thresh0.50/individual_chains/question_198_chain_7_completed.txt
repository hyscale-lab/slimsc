Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants are involved when dealing with complex ions. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. There are four stability constants given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. And the question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, blue dithiocyanato... I think that refers to the Co(SCN)_2 complex. Wait, no, wait. I remember that the different complexes of Co(II) with thiocyanate have different colors. Like, [Co(SCN)]^+ is pink, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is blue, and [Co(SCN)_3]^3- is maybe another color? But the question specifically asks about the blue ones, which would be the dithiocyanato complex, so that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex, right? So we're looking for the fraction of Co in that complex.

The stability constants, β, tell us how stable each complex is. Each β corresponds to the formation of a complex with n SCN- ions. So β1 is for the monomeric complex [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^3-, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^3-? Or wait, maybe I'm getting the order wrong. Let me think: the stability constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^(something) is βn. So each βn is the formation constant for the nth complex.

Wait, what's the general formula for the formation of these complexes? I think the formation reactions are:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n), and the stability constant βn = [ [Co(SCN)_n] ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

So for each n, the βn is given. So the complexes are:

n=1: [Co(SCN)]^+ → β1=9
n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → β2=40
n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^3− → β3=63
n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^4− → β4=16?

Wait, wait, but wait, the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, so that's the order. So for each n, the βn is for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n). So n=1 is β1=9, n=2 is β2=40, n=3 is β3=63, n=4 is β4=16.

Wait, but β4=16 is smaller than β3=63. That's a bit confusing because higher β would mean more stable. So the third complex is the most stable, then the second, then first, and the fourth is the least. Or wait, no, because β for n=4 is 16 which is lower than β2=40. So the more thiocyanate added, the higher the n might not necessarily have higher β.

But in any case, the question is about the percentage of the blue complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So we need to find the fraction of Co in the form of [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

To find the fraction, I think we can model the distribution of Co species using the stability constants and the given concentrations.

The approach would be to calculate the fraction of each complex relative to the total Co. The total Co is the sum of all the species: Co^2+, [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^3−, [Co(SCN)_4]^4−.

But considering the log K's, and the concentrations, perhaps we can model this using the formation of each species.

Let me think about the distribution. The general approach is to consider that each complex forms by adding SCN- to the previous one. So the fraction of each complex depends on the β and the concentration of SCN-.

But wait, the problem is that the formation of each complex depends on the concentration of free SCN- and Co^2+.

Alternatively, the fraction of each complex can be found using the following formula for each species:

The fraction f_n of [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) is given by (β1β2...βn) * [SCN^-]^{n} / (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β1β2[SCN^-]^2 + ... + β1β2...βn [SCN^-]^n )

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write each fraction in terms of the stepwise formation constants.

Wait, another approach: the overall formation constant up to n SCN- is the product of the stepwise β's up to n. So for the second complex, the overall β would be β1 * β2.

Wait, no. Let me think: each βn is the equilibrium constant for adding one SCN- to the (n-1)th complex. So for the first complex, it's [CoSCN+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]) = β1 =9.

For the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]/([CoSCN+][SCN^-]) )= β2=40.

So the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_2] is β1 * β2 =9*40=360.

Similarly, for [Co(SCN)_3]^3−, the overall β would be β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=22680.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Because each βn is the equilibrium for adding the nth SCN- to the (n-1)th complex. So the overall K for forming [Co(SCN)_n] is the product of β1 to βn.

Wait, but no, the overall K for [Co(SCN)_n] would be the product of β1 through βn, yes. Because each β is the stepwise addition.

So the fraction of each complex can be found by considering all possible complexes and their respective K values.

But the problem is that with high [SCN^-], the higher n complexes will be favored. But in this case, [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which may not be very high. Let's see.

But perhaps a better way is to calculate the fraction of each complex by considering their formation constants relative to each other and the concentration of thiocyanate.

The formula for the fraction of each species is:

f_n = ( β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n ) / ( sum_{k=0}^4 (β1 β2 ... βk [SCN^-]^k) )

Wait, but wait, when n=0, that corresponds to free Co^2+.

Wait, no, n=0 would be Co^2+ itself. So for each n, the term is [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) with formation constant K_n = product of β1 to βn.

So the total concentration of Co is the sum of all species:

[Co_total] = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4]

But given that Co_total is 1e-2 M, and all the species are in solution.

But considering that the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the [Co^2+] (1e-2 M), the solution is in a regime where the ligand is in excess, so the complexes are formed up to a certain n.

But let me proceed step by step.

First, compute the formation constants for each complex:

- For n=1: K1 = β1 =9.
- For n=2: K2=β1*β2=9*40=360.
- For n=3: K3=β1 β2 β3= 9*40*63= 22680.
- For n=4: K4=β1 β2 β3 β4=22680 *16= 362880.

Wait, but the problem is that K4 is a big number, but β4 is 16, which is less than β3. So perhaps the fourth complex is less favored than the third, but the overall K4 is still large because the product is up to n=4.

Wait, but let's think about the fractions. Each species's concentration can be written as:

[Co(SCN)_n] = K_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n / (product up to n).

Wait, no, perhaps I should model the distribution using the relative contributions of each complex.

Let me define the term for each species n as (K_n) [SCN^-]^n. But since the [Co^2+] is the same for each term, it will factor out. So the sum of all the terms (including the free ion, which is n=0, K0=1, [SCN^-]^0=1) will give the denominator.

So the fraction f_n for each species is (K_n [SCN^-]^n) / (sum_{k=0}^4 K_k [SCN^-]^k )

Wait, but for n=0, the species is Co^2+, so K0=1, [SCN^-]^0=1, so term is 1.

For n=1, term is K1 [SCN^-]^1 =9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

For n=2, term is K2 [SCN^-]^2=360*(0.1)^2=360*0.01=3.6.

n=3: K3*(0.1)^3 =22680 * 0.001=22.68.

n=4: K4*(0.1)^4= 362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

Wait, adding up all these terms:

n=0: 1

n=1: 0.9 → total so far 1.9

n=2: 3.6 → total 5.5

n=3: 22.68 → total 28.18

n=4: 36.288 → total 64.468

So the denominator is 64.468.

The fraction for n=2 (the blue complex) is 3.6 / 64.468 ≈ 0.05556, which is about 5.56%. But wait, that's not matching any of the answer options. Hmm, that can't be right because the options are much higher. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the K_n's. Because each K_n is the overall formation constant for the complex up to n SCN-. So K1=β1=9, K2=β1*β2=360, K3=K2*β3=360*63=22680, K4=K3*β4=22680*16=362880.

Wait, but that's correct. So the terms are as I calculated.

Wait, but when I compute the denominator sum, I get 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 +36.288 = let's compute that: 1+0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468. So the denominator is 64.468.

The term for the blue complex (n=2) is 3.6.

So 3.6 / 64.468 ≈ 0.05556, which is ~5.556%. But the options are all much higher.

Hmm, that's a problem. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I calculated K_n incorrectly. Let me think again. Each β is the stepwise formation constant. So K1 is β1=9. K2 is β1*β2=9*40=360. K3 is K2 *β3=360*63=22680. K4 is K3 * β4=22680*16=362880.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that the formation constants for each complex are the cumulative products. So yes, that's correct.

But then why is the fraction so low? Maybe because the [SCN^-] is only 0.1 M, which isn't very high, so higher n complexes may not be as dominant. Wait, but according to the terms, n=4 has a term of 36.288, which is the largest, followed by n=3 (22.68), then n=2 (3.6), then n=1 (0.9), and n=0 (1). So the dominant term is n=4, but the third is next.

Wait, but wait, the denominator is 64.468. So the largest fraction would be n=4: 36.288/64.468 ≈ 56%? But the question is about the blue complex which is n=2, which is 3.6/64.468 ≈ 5.56%, but that's not among the options. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternative approach: Maybe the initial assumption about which complex is blue is incorrect. Perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^3−, which would be n=3. Let me check that.

Wait, I thought [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is blue. Let me make sure. From what I remember, the colors of Co thiocyanate complexes are:

- [Co(SCN)]^+ → pink
- [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → blue
- [Co(SCN)_3]^3− → green or another color.

So the blue is n=2, so the calculation should be correct. But that gives a low percentage, which isn't in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach to compute the fractions is incorrect. Maybe I should consider that each βn is for the nth complex, and the fraction is computed by considering the ratio between the βs and the [SCN^-] and the previous terms.

Wait another approach: The fractions can be calculated using the stepwise formation constants. So for each n, the fraction is (βn [SCN^-])/(1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + ... etc.)

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, perhaps the fraction of [Co(SCN)_n] is (βn [SCN^-])/ (1 + sum of β terms up to n).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for a formula or model.

Another way to think is that each complex is formed by stepwise addition of SCN^-.

So for each n, the fraction f_n is (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n) / (sum from k=0 to 4 of (β1 ... βk [SCN^-]^k )) )

Wait, but that's the same as what I did before.

So according to that, the fraction for n=2 is 3.6 /64.468 ≈5.55%.

But the options are much higher. The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

So 5.5% is not in the options. Thus, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong [SCN^-] value. The [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, correct?

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the stability constants are given for the overall complex, not the stepwise. So if β1 is the overall for [Co(SCN)], β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2], etc. But that can't be, because the question says the stability constants of the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, etc. So βn is for the nth complex.

Wait, if that's the case, then my initial approach is wrong because I assumed that βn is the stepwise constant, but perhaps βn is the overall K for the nth complex.

Wait, if βn is the overall K for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n), then:

K1=9 → [Co(SCN)]^+ = K1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]

K2=40 → [Co(SCN)_2]^0 = K2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2

K3=63 → [Co(SCN)_3]^3− = K3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3

K4=16 → [Co(SCN)_4]^4− = K4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4

But then the fraction f_n would be (K_n [SCN^-]^n ) / (sum_{k=0}^4 K_k [SCN^-]^k )

Wait, but in this scenario, K0 is 1 for the free Co^2+.

So let's compute each term:

n=0: 1 * (0.1)^0 =1 → term=1

n=1:9*(0.1)^1=0.9 → term=0.9

n=2:40*(0.1)^2=40 * 0.01=0.4 → term=0.4

n=3:63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063 → term=0.063

n=4:16*(0.1)^4=16 * 0.0001=0.0016 → term=0.0016

Summing all these terms: 1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

The denominator is 2.3646.

The fraction for n=2 (blue) is 0.4 /2.3646 ≈ 0.169, which is about 16.9%. Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. So that would be the answer.

Wait, that makes sense now. Because in this approach, each K is the overall formation constant. So each term is K_n [SCN^-]^n, and the sum is the denominator.

So the fractions are:

n=0:1/2.3646 ≈42.3% → which is option A.

n=1:0.9/2.3646 ≈38.1% → option C.

n=2:0.4/2.3646≈16.9% → option D.

n=3:0.063/2.3646≈2.66%

n=4:0.0016/2.3646≈0.0676%

So the percentage for blue (n=2) is 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but why did I get a different result when considering K_n as the overall formation constants versus the stepwise constants? Because the initial approach where I considered K_n as the product of β's gave a very low fraction, but that must have been wrong because the problem states that βn are the stability constants of the complexes, implying they are the overall K's, not the stepwise.

So the correct approach is to treat each βn as the overall formation constant for the nth complex. Therefore, the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2] is 0.4/2.3646≈16.9%, which matches option D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the given stability constants (β) and the concentrations of Co(II) and SCN⁻. The stability constants provided are β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16, and the concentrations are [Co(II)] = 10⁻² M and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.

The fraction of each cobalt complex is calculated using the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\sum_{k=0}^4 \beta_k [\text{SCN}^-]^k}
\]

Here, \( \beta_n \) is the stability constant for the nth complex, and \( [\text{SCN}^-]^n \) accounts for the contribution of SCN⁻ to the formation of the complex. The denominator sums the contributions of all possible cobalt species, including the free Co²⁺ ion (n=0).

### Calculations:
1. **Terms for each complex:**
   - \( n = 0 \): \( \beta_0 = 1 \), \( [\text{SCN}^-]^0 = 1 \), term = \( 1 \).
   - \( n = 1 \): \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 0.1 \), term = \( 9 \times 0.1 = 0.9 \).
   - \( n = 2 \): \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 0.1^2 = 0.01 \), term = \( 40 \times 0.01 = 0.4 \).
   - \( n = 3 \): \( \beta_3 = 63 \), \( [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 0.1^3 = 0.001 \), term = \( 63 \times 0.001 = 0.063 \).
   - \( n = 4 \): \( \beta_4 = 16 \), \( [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 0.1^4 = 0.0001 \), term = \( 16 \times 0.0001 = 0.0016 \).

2. **Sum of all terms:**
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

3. **Fraction of the blue complex ([Co(SCN)_2]^0):**
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
   \]

4. **Percentage of the blue complex:**
   \[
   f_2 \times 100 \approx 16.9\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution is **16.9%**.

Answer: D
