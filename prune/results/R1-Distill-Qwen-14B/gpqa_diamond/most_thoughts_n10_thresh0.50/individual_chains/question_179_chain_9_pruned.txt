Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit nervous because matrices can be a bit tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question gives me four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. And I have to choose the correct statement from the options A to D. Let's see what each option is saying.

First, I need to recall some quantum mechanics concepts. Matrices are fundamental in quantum mechanics, especially for operators and states. So, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. The evolution operator is unitary, and quantum states are represented by vectors with unit norm.

Looking at the options:

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Hmm. The exponential of a matrix. If I multiply a vector by e^X, does the norm change? Wait, for the norm to stay the same, e^X must be unitary. Because unitary matrices preserve the inner product, so the norm remains unchanged. So if e^X is not unitary, then the norm can change. But when is e^X unitary? 

I remember that for a matrix U to be unitary, U† U = I. Also, if X is Hermitian, then e^X is not necessarily unitary. Wait, no, if X is anti-Hermitian (iX is Hermitian), then e^X is unitary. Because if X† = -X, then (e^X)† = e^{-X} = e^{X†} = e^{-X}, so e^X is unitary.

So first, let me check if X is anti-Hermitian. To do that, I need to compute X† and see if it equals -X.

X is:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

Compute X† (the conjugate transpose):

Row 1 becomes the first column with conjugates. So:

First row of X†: i*, 1*, (2i)* → which is (-i), 1, (-2i)
Wait, no, X is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write
