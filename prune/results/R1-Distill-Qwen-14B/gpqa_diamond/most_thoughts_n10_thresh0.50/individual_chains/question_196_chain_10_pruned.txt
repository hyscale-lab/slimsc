Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. In the classical case, I remember that the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is the relativistic case, so things are different.

Relativistically, the energy considerations change. The total energy isn't just kinetic anymore because we have to account for the rest mass energy. Also, as the speed approaches the speed of light c, the relativistic effects become significant.

In special relativity, the total energy E is given by gamma times mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The kinetic energy is E - mc², which is (gamma - 1)mc². But in this case, the oscillator's potential energy and kinetic energy would have to be considered together with the total relativistic energy.

Wait, but the problem states that the oscillator obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. So it's a harmonic oscillator, but relativistically. I'm not sure about the exact setup here. In classical mechanics, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the maximum is at x = A, so the maximum potential is (1/2)kA². But in relativity, perhaps we need to consider relativistic expressions for energy.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the relativistic harmonic oscillator model, where the potential energy might be modified. Or perhaps it's a simple harmonic oscillator with relativistic corrections to the energy.

Wait, another approach: think about the conservation of energy. The total energy of the oscillator should be the sum of the rest mass energy and the maximum potential energy. At the point of maximum amplitude, the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. At maximum velocity, the potential energy is zero, and all energy is kinetic (plus rest mass).

Wait, that doesn't sound right. Wait, no. The maximum velocity occurs when the potential energy
