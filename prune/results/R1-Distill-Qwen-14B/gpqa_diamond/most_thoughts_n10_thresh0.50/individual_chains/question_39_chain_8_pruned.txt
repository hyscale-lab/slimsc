Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

We have ten thousand identical systems. Each has a particle moving along a tube, which is along the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) â€“ 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. When they measured the position, none were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So, all the particles are confined between x=1 and x=3. The question is asking for the numerical value of 'a'.

Hmm, okay, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's modulus squared gives the probability density. So the probability of finding the particle in a region is the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function over that region.

Since all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3, that means the probability of finding them outside this region is zero. So the wave function must be zero beyond these points? Wait, no, wait. Because the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that seems like it's a complex function. 

Wait, but the wave function needs to be normalizable. That means the integral of the probability density from -infinity to infinity should be 1. But in our case, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function should be zero outside of this region. But wait, the given wave function doesn't look like it's zero beyond x=1 or x=3. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, the question says the wave function is valid in a part of space where the particle can exist. Oh, so perhaps the wave function is zero outside this region. But wait, the function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. If x is less than 1, sqrt(1+x) would be real, but wait, if x is less than -1, sqrt(1+x) becomes imaginary, but in our case the particles are only found where x is between 1 and 3, so maybe for x <1, the function is zero? Or perhaps the function is non-zero only in that interval.

Wait, the wave function is only non-zero from x=1
