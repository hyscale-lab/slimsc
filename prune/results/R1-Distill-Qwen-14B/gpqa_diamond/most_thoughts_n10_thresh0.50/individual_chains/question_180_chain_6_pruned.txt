Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it again.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their masses are negligible, which probably means we don't have to consider kinetic energy or gravitational effects. Wait, but the problem is about potential energy, I think.

So, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, right, when dealing with electric potential energy, the formula I remember is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. But wait, when there are multiple charges, each pair contributes to the total potential energy. Oh right, for a system of multiple point charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

But wait, since the system is isolated, we can't do any work on it, so the configuration with the charges at 2 meters must be the one where the potential energy is either the highest or the lowest. But the question is asking for the minimum energy, so I'm guessing it's the most stable configuration, maybe when the charges are as close as possible? Or perhaps it's about the potential energy when you bring them to that point from infinity.

Wait, no, in this problem, 12 charges are already at 2m
