Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. I remember that ketones reacting with nitriles usually involve some kind of nucleophilic addition. Wait, but wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions, right? So this sounds like a nucleophilic addition to the ketone.

Wait, but wait, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, what happens? Oh right, there's the cyanohydrin formation. So the general reaction is ketone + CN- â†’ cyanohydrin. But under what conditions does that happen? I think the cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon. But then, how is the proton added? Because in the product, there's a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on the same carbon.

So, the mechanism probably involves the attack of the cyanide on the ketone, forming an intermediate which then picks up a proton. Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the conditions. I think the reaction usually uses an acid catalyst, like H3O+ (which is option A or B), or maybe something else. Oh wait, sometimes H2SO3 (sulfuric acid) is used as a catalyst because it helps generate the cyanide ion in situ and also provides the
