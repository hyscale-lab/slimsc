Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and photons. Hmm, diatomic molecules are made of two atoms, right, like X and Y in this case. The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. I remember that in this model, the molecule can change both its rotational and vibrational states when it absorbs or emits a photon.

The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. The question is asking what momentum a photon should have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state. So I need to find the photon's momentum, p.

The given data are:
- Mass of X (Mx) = 20 amu
- Mass of Y (My) = 2 amu
- Bond length (R) = 2 angstroms
- Angular frequency (ω) = 4e14 rad/s

Wait, amu is atomic mass units. I remember that 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. Oh wait, no, wait, 1 amu is about 1.6605e-27 kg. So I'll need to calculate the reduced mass of the molecule, I think.

So first, let's compute the reduced mass μ. The formula for reduced mass is μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Let me plug in the numbers.

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. Wait, but amu isn't SI units, so I need to convert this to kg. So 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = approximately (let me calculate) 1.818 * 1.66 = about 3, but wait, let me do it more accurately. 1.818 * 1.6605 is: 1*1.6605 is 1.6605, 0.8*1.6605 = ~1.3284, 0.018 *1.6605= ~0.02989. Adding them up: 1.6605 + 1.3284 = 2.9889 +0.02989= ~3.0188. So 3.0188e-27 kg? Wait, no, because it's 1.818 * 1.6605e-27. Wait, 1.818 * 1.6605 is 1.818 *1.6605.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 1.818 * 1.6605:

1.8 * 1.6605 = let's see, 1.6605 * 1.8: 1.6605 *2 is 3.321, so 3.321 - 0.16605 = 3.15495. Hmm, but 1.818 is 1 + 0.8 + 0.018. So maybe another approach: 1.818 * 1.6605 = (1 + 0.8 + 0.018) * 1.6605.

Wait, perhaps better to just accept that the exact number isn't critical, but the calculation is for the reduced mass. But maybe I don't even need the reduced mass for this problem. Hmm. Wait the problem is about the energy transition when the molecule absorbs a photon. So perhaps I need to find the energy difference between the initial and final states, then find the photon's momentum based on that energy.

Wait, but wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational state. The question is about moving to the next state with the lowest energy. So perhaps this is a vibrational transition, not rotational. Or maybe both?

Wait, the model is the rotation-vibration model, which combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels. So the energy levels are a combination of both. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (I think for rotation, the lowest state is J=0, but I might be wrong). Wait, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For a diatomic, the lowest rotational state is J=0, but perhaps the fundamental state here includes both rotational and vibrational contributions.

But the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which I'm taking as the lowest possible state (v=0, J=0). Then, the next lowest state would be either v=1 or J=1. Which is lower in energy?

Wait, the vibrational energy levels have spacing of ħω, and the rotational levels have spacing of 2B, perhaps. So I need to find which transition gives the smallest energy difference.

Wait, but the problem says 'switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy', which I think means the next state that has the least energy above the current state. So it would be the transition with the lowest possible energy difference.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simplifying it to just a vibrational transition. Because diatomic molecules can have both rotational and vibrational transitions, but the problem might be focusing on the vibrational part.

Wait, the question says "switch to the next state", perhaps the next state is the first excited state. So the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0?), and the next state (lowest energy) would be either J=1 or v=1.

Wait, the energy of the rotational state is E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. B is given by ħ²/(2I R^2), where I is the moment of inertia. The vibrational energy is E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħ ω, with v being the vibrational quantum number.

So for the fundamental state, v=0 and J=0. The next possible states are either J=1 (same v=0) or v=1 (same J=0). Which one has a lower energy difference?

Compute the energy difference for both transitions.

First, compute B (rotational constant): B = ħ²/(2 I R^2). Wait, I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, the moment of inertia I for a diatomic molecule is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

So I = μ R².

So B = ħ²/(2 μ R²) * (1/(R²)) )? Wait, no. Let me get the formula right.

No, the rotational constant B is given by B = ħ²/(2 I R²), but I think that's incorrect. Wait, I think that B is actually ħ²/(2 I c), where c is the speed of light in some contexts, but no, I think the formula for rotational energy levels in a rigid rotor is E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = (ħ²)/(2 I).

Wait, no, the rotational constant in terms of energy is B = (ħ²)/(2 I). So B is energy per J(J+1) unit. So E_rot = B J (J+1).

But wait, other sources say the rotational constant B is (h/(8π² c I)), but that's for the spectroscopic rotational constant, which relates to the frequency in microwave spectra. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps B is given as (h²)/(8π² I c²), but I might be mixing up different rotational constants.

Wait, let's step back. The energy levels of a rigid rotor are given by E_J = (ħ² J (J+1))/(2 I), where I is the moment of inertia. So E_J = B J (J+1), where B = ħ²/(2 I). Yes, that's right.

So B = (ħ²) / (2 I) = (ħ²) / (2 μ R²), since I = μ R².

We can compute B using this formula.

But to compute B, I need μ in kg, R in meters.

Given that R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So R = 2e-10 m.

The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) in kg.

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

So I = μ R² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.207e-46 kg m².

Then B = ħ² / (2 I) = ( (1.0545718e-34 J s)^2 ) / (2 * 1.207e-46 kg m² )

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ (1.112e-68) (since 1.05^2≈1.1025, so 1.11e-68).

Denominator: 2 * 1.207e-46 = 2.414e-46.

So B ≈ 1.112e-68 / 2.414e-46 ≈ Let me compute 1.112 / 2.414 ≈ 0.4606, so 0.4606e-22 => 4.606e-23 J.

Wait, that's B for each J state.

Now, the energy difference for the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is E_rot = B [1*(1+1)] - B [0*(0+1)] = B*(2) - 0 = 2B.

So delta E_rot = 2B = 2 * 4.606e-23 J = 9.212e-23 J.

Now, looking at the vibrational energy difference. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (v + ½) ħ ω.

So the transition from v=0 to v=1 is delta E_vib = E_vib(1) - E_vib(0) = (3/2 ħ ω) - (1/2 ħ ω) ) = ħ ω.

Given ω = 4e14 rad/s.

So delta E_vib = ħ * 4e14.

Compute ħ: approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So delta E_vib = 1.05457e-34 * 4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

Compare that to delta E_rot = 9.212e-23 J.

So the vibrational transition has a larger energy difference (4.2e-20 J) compared to the rotational transition (9.2e-23 J), which is about 46 times smaller.

So the smallest possible energy transition is the rotational one because 9e-23 J is less than 4e-20 J.

Wait, no, wait. Wait 9e-23 is less than 4e-20? Wait, no, 9e-23 is 0.9e-22, and 4e-20 is 4e-20. So 4e-20 is larger than 9e-23.

Wait, no, 4e-20 is 40,000 times larger than 9e-23. Because 4e-20 / 9e-23 ≈ 444.44.

So the rotational transition has a smaller energy difference than the vibrational transition. So the next lowest state is the first rotational state (J=1), not the first vibrational state (v=1).

But wait, the question is phrased as "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the one with the smallest energy increase. So the rotational transition requires less energy, so that's the next state.

So the photon should have energy equal to delta E_rot = 2B = 9.212e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, another possibility is that the molecule could have a transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited state which is a combination of both. But that's probably more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the first excited state as the next in terms of energy, regardless of being rotational or vibrational.

But in any case, the problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. The next possible state is either the next vibrational level or the next rotational level.

So the energy needed for the vibrational transition is much higher than rotational, so the photon's energy should be about 9.212e-23 J.

But wait, the photon's energy is related to its momentum. Because the photon's energy is E = p c, where c is the speed of light. So p = E/(c).

Wait, no, E = pc for a photon because its rest mass is zero. So p = E / c.

Wait, so E_photon = delta E, which is 9.212e-23 J.

Then p = E / (3e8 m/s) = 9.212e-23 / 3e8 = approx 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the smallest given option is A) 1.9e-28 Ns. Since 1 Ns is kg m/s, so 3.07e-31 kg m/s is 3.07e-31 Ns. But none of the options are that small. So perhaps I made a mistake in reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the photon's momentum based on the vibrational transition instead. Because the rotational transition requires much less energy, but perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition, thinking that the molecule is modeled as a harmonic oscillator, and the next state is the first vibrational excited state.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state to the next energy state, which could be a combination of both vibrational and rotational, but that's probably more advanced.

Wait, maybe I should reevaluate. The problem says 'switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy', which would be the next higher state with the least energy. So which is lower in energy: the first rotational state (J=1) or the first vibrational state (v=1).

As computed earlier, delta E_rot = 9.2e-23 J, and delta E_vib = 4.2e-20 J.

So clearly, delta E_rot is much smaller. So the photon's energy should be 9.2e-23 J, which would correspond to a momentum of E/c = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is 3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D)1.4e-28 Ns

None of these are near 3e-31 Ns. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition not to a higher rotational state but a higher vibrational state, but that would require a much higher energy. Alternatively, perhaps I got the model wrong. The question says it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which combines both rotational and vibrational states. So perhaps the energy levels are quantized and involve both rotational and vibrational energies.

Wait, but the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state with the lowest energy would be the next in the sequence. But in diatomic molecules, the energy levels are a combination of both. So the energy could be a combination of the rotational and vibrational energies.

Alternatively, perhaps the next state is the first vibrational state, which would require a photon with energy equal to the vibrational transition.

Wait, but the vibrational transition is much higher in energy, which would require a higher momentum. Let me compute the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition.

E_photon_vib = ħ ω = 1.05457e-34 J s * 4e14 s^-1 = 4.218e-20 J.

Then, p_photon_vib = E_photon / c = 4.218e-20 J / (3e8 m/s) = 1.406e-28 kg m/s = 1.406e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns. That's very close to what I just calculated.

Wait, but earlier when I thought that the rotational transition had a lower energy, the photon's momentum would be much lower, but none of the options match that.

So why the discrepancy? Perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition, not the rotational.

Wait, perhaps the model being referred to is the rotation-vibration model, which allows for transitions that change both rotational and vibrational states, but the question is about the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which is (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1), whichever has lower energy.

But earlier I found that (v=0, J=1) has lower energy than (v=1, J=0). So the photon's energy should be 2B, so E = 2B = 9.2e-23 J, leading to p_photon = 3e-31 Ns. But this is way smaller than the smallest option, which is 1.4e-28.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Let me recompute B.

Compute μ again: Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = let's compute.

1.81818 *1.6605 = let's calculate 1.8 *1.6605= 3. (Wait, 1.6605 *1.8 = 3.0009 (since 1.6605 * 1 = 1.6605, 1.6605 * 0.8=1.3284; sum is 2.9889). So 1.81818 is approximately 1.818 *1.6605= 3.0178e-27 kg? Wait, no.

Wait, 1.81818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 = (approx) 3.0178e-27 kg.

Wait, I'm a bit confused because 1.81818 * 1.6605 is about 3.0178.

So I is μ R² = 3.0178e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0178e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2071e-46 kg m².

Then, B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 *1.2071e-46).

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = approximately 1.112e-68 J² s².

Denominator: 2 * 1.2071e-46 = 2.4142e-46 kg m².

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.4142e-46 = (1.112 / 2.4142) * 1e-22 = approx 0.46 * 1e-22 = 4.6e-23 J.

So delta E_rot = 2B = 9.2e-23 J.

So photon energy E = 9.2e-23 J, and p = E/c = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 Ns.

But that's way smaller than any of the options. So perhaps the initial approach is wrong.

Alternative approach: maybe the question is about the vibrational transition, not rotational.

So E = ħ ω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

p = E/c = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = 1.406e-28 Ns. Which is option D (1.4e-28 Ns).

But earlier, the rotational transition needed a much lower energy, so why is the option based on vibrational included?

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the fundamental state as the lowest state, and the next state is the first excited state, which could be a vibrational transition. Because sometimes in spectroscopy, the fundamental transition is the first vibrational (v=0 → v=1), but in the quantum rotor-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of both.

Wait, but in the quantum rotor-vibration model, the energy levels are given by:

E = E_vib + E_rot = [ (v + ½ ) ħ ω ] + [ B J (J+1) ]

So the ground state is v=0, J=0. The next possible states are v=1, J=0; v=0, J=1; or even v=1, J=1.

But the energy of the first excited state would be the minimum of these possible next states. So compute the energies:

State 1: v=1, J=0. E = (1 +1/2) ħ ω + B *0 = (3/2) ħ ω = 1.5 *4.218e-20 ≈ 6.327e-20 J.

State 2: v=0, J=1. E = (0 +1/2) ħ ω + B (1)(2) = 0.5*4.218e-20 + 9.2e-23 ≈ 2.109e-20 + 9.2e-23 = approx 2.109e-20 J (since 9.2e-23 is much smaller).

State 3: v=1, J=1. E would be higher than State 1 and 2.

So the next lowest energy state after the ground state is State 2: v=0, J=1 with E = about 2.109e-20 J.

Wait, so that’s higher than the vibrational transition of 6.3e-20 J.

Wait, no, State 2 is 2.1e-20 J, which is lower than State1's 6.3e-20 J. So the photon should have energy of 2.1e-20 J.

Wait, but wait, the ground state is E=0.5 ħ ω (v=0, J=0: E = 0.5 * ħ ω + 0 = 0.5 * 4.218e-20 = 2.109e-20 J.

Wait no, wait the ground state is v=0, J=0: E = 0.5 ħ ω + 0 = 2.109e-20 J.

Wait no, no, because E_vib for v=0 is (0 + ½) ħ ω. So ½ * ħ ω = 0.5 *4.218e-20 =2.109e-20 J.

Wait, but earlier I thought the rotational energy for J=0 is zero. So the ground state's total energy is E_ground = 2.109e-20 J.

Wait, that can't be right because the rotational energy is zero for J=0. So the total energy in the ground state is (v=0, J=0) = 2.109e-20 J.

Then, the next state (v=0, J=1): E = 2.109e-20 + 9.2e-23 ≈ 2.109e-20 + 0.092e-20 = 2.19e-20 J.

So the energy difference is 2.19e-20 - 2.109e-20 = 8.1e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, that's the delta E from ground state to (v=0, J=1). Alternatively, the delta E is 8.1e-23 J.

But earlier, the vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1 gives a delta E of 4.218e-20 J.

So in this case, the next state after the ground state (v=0, J=0) is (v=0, J=1), with a much smaller energy difference.

So the photon energy needed is 8.1e-23 J, leading to p_photon = (8.1e-23 J)/(3e8 m/s) = 2.7e-31 kg m/s = 2.7e-31 Ns.

But that's even smaller, and still none of the options match.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering only the vibrational transition, which would require a photon with energy ħ ω, leading to p =1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But why is the rotational transition not considered?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the model. The problem states it's the non-rigid rotor model, which I think is another term for the rotation-vibration coupling model where the bond length can vary, hence the model includes both rotational and vibrational aspects.

Wait, non-rigid rotor model versus rigid rotor model. The rigid rotor model assumes fixed bond length, while the non-rigid allows for bond length changes, hence the vibration comes into play. So perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational energy is modified.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply considering the vibrational energy transition, given that the fundamental state is the ground vibrational state, and the next state is the first vibrational state.

But if that's the case, then the photon's energy is ħ ω, and momentum is 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But earlier, the energy difference for the rotational transition is much smaller. So why is the question expecting the vibrational transition? Maybe because the model combines both, but the question is about the fundamental state, which is the ground vibrational state, and the molecule is in the state with the lowest possible rotational state as well. Therefore, the next state would be the next vibrational state, which is v=1, J=0.

Wait, but in that case, the energy difference is 4.218e-20 J, leading to a photon momentum of 1.4e-28 Ns.

So perhaps the problem expects the student to consider the vibrational transition. Maybe the question is simplifying the energy transition to the vibrational part, despite the rotational being lower.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering the energy levels. Let me think again: the ground state is v=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would be the one that's closest in energy to the ground state. So between (v=0, J=1) and (v=1, J=0), which is lower?

Compute the energies:

E(v=0, J=0) = 0.5 ħ ω + 0 = 2.109e-20 J.

E(v=0, J=1) = 0.5 ħ ω + 2B =2.109e-20 + 9.21e-23 =2.190e-20 J.

E(v=1, J=0) = (1.5 ħ ω) + 0 = 6.327e-20 J.

So the next lowest state after E=2.109e-20 is E=2.19e-20, which is delta E=8.1e-23 J.

So the photon's energy would be 8.1e-23 J, which gives a momentum p=8.1e-23 /3e8 = 2.7e-31 kg m/s =2.7e-31 Ns.

But this isn't among the options. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule absorbs a photon and moves to the next higher energy state, regardless of whether it's rotation or vibration. But the options don't have anything that small, so perhaps the question is only considering the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the selection rules. For a diatomic molecule, the vibrational transition (change in v) is Δv = ±1, and rotational transitions ΔJ= ±1, but perhaps the question is considering the transition from v=0 to v=1, requiring delta E= ħ ω.

So then, the photon's momentum is (ħ ω)/c = (1.05e-34 *4e14)/3e8 = (4.2e-20)/3e8 = 1.4e-28 kg m/s, which is 1.4e-28 Ns, matching option D.

So perhaps that's the intended approach, to consider only the vibrational transition, despite the rotational transition being a lower energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in B's calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is asking for the transition from the ground state to the next state, which could involve both rotational and vibrational transitions, but that's more complicated.

But given that the options are all on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28, and my vibrational transition gives 1.4e-28, which is option D, I think that's the expected answer.


To determine the momentum of the photon required for the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences between the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) and the next possible states. The molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels.

### Key Data:
- **Mass of X (Mx)** = 20 amu  
- **Mass of Y (My)** = 2 amu  
- **Bond length (R)** = 2 Å = \(2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\)  
- **Angular frequency (ω)** = \(4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\)  

### Step 1: Reduced Mass and Rotational Constant
The reduced mass (\(\mu\)) is calculated as:
\[
\mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
\]
Converting to kilograms:
\[
\mu = 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
\]

The moment of inertia (\(I\)) is:
\[
I = \mu R^2 = (3.018 \times 10^{-27}) \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
\]

The rotational constant (\(B\)) is:
\[
B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \times 1.207 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.606 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Energy Differences
1. **Rotational Transition (J=0 → J=1):**
   The energy difference is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \times 4.606 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} = 9.212 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Vibrational Transition (v=0 → v=1):**
   The energy difference is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) \times (4 \times 10^{14}) \, \text{J} = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
   \]

### Step 3: Photon Momentum
The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by:
\[
p = \frac{E}{c},
\]
where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\).

1. **For the rotational transition:**
   \[
   p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{9.212 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}.
   \]
   This value is much smaller than any of the given options.

2. **For the vibrational transition:**
   \[
   p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
   \]
   This matches closely with option **D** (\(1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}\)).

### Step 4: Conclusion
The question likely considers the vibrational transition as the primary mechanism for transitioning to the next state with the lowest possible energy, despite the rotational transition requiring less energy. This is consistent with the given options.
