Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a meson resonance. Hmm, the question is about finding the mean decay distance given some parameters. Let me break it down.

First, I remember that the mean decay length depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. The formula I think is something like L = gamma * beta * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is the velocity divided by the speed of light, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

Wait, and tau can be calculated using the uncertainty principle or the relation involving the width. Oh right, the mean lifetime tau is related to the width Gamma by tau = hbar / Gamma. But wait, Gamma is given in MeV, and I think I need to convert that to energy units compatible with the others.

The production energy is 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. Oh, so the meson is produced with some energy, but I think the main point is that the decay width is given as 320 MeV. Let's convert that to GeV for consistency. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So Gamma = 0.32 GeV. Now, to find tau, I need to compute tau = hbar / Gamma. But hbar is in units of GeV·s, right? Let me recall the value. Planck constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. hbar is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But wait, when using natural units where c=1 and ħ=197.33 MeV·fm, so I think it's easier to convert GeV to MeV.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute everything in natural units and then convert into meters. Because using c=1 and ħ=197.33 MeV·fm might make the calculations easier.

Wait, here's another approach. The width Gamma is the total decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime. The formula is Gamma = ħ / tau. So tau = ħ / Gamma.

But wait, I'm getting confused with the units. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the lifetime tau is given by tau = ħ / Gamma. But I need to make sure the units are compatible. Gamma is in GeV, and
