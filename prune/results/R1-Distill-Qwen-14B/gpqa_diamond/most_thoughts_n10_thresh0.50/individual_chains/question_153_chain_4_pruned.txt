Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question has three parts, labeled A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the major products for each and match them with the options given.

Let me start with the first reaction (A):

Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). 

I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is usually enolate, which is a strong base. So, in this case, the nucleophile is the enolate of dimethyl malonate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH. It's a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate that's a strong nucleophile. The other compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with the substituent p-tolyl (a methyl group attached to a benzene ring) on the beta carbon.

Wait, no, the structure would be CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-CO-OCH3? Or is it CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3 with the p-tolyl group on the acrylate? Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is probably CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, with the p-tolyl group on the acrylate. Wait, no, I think I'm getting mixed up here. The formula is probably CH2=C-(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3, but wait, the numbering might be different. Let me think more clearly.

The correct structure for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? No, wait, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substitu
