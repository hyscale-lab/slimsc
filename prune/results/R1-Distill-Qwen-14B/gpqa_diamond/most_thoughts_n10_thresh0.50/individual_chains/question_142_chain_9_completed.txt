Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubit space. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to recall what I learned.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that the density matrix can represent a quantum state, especially when it's a mixed state. But wait, this looks like a classical mixture of |0> and |1> states. Because each term is |0><0| and |1><1|, which are projectors, and their coefficients here are both 1/2. So this should be a completely mixed state, right?

I think in the Bloch sphere representation, the state of a qubit is usually represented by a vector (r) where r = (x, y, z). For pure states, the state |ψ> can be written as (α|0> + β|1>), and the Bloch vector is (2 Re(β α*), 2 Im(β α*), |β|² - |α|²). But wait, what about mixed states?

Oh, right! For a completely mixed state, like when you have equal probability in both |0> and |1>, the density matrix is ρ = I/2, where I is the identity matrix. Because |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]], so adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity. So 1/2 times that is [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]].

In the Bloch sphere, pure states are on the surface, and mixed states inside. The completely mixed state would be at the origin, right? Because it's the maximally mixed state. So the Bloch vector r would be (0,0,0). Let me think about that again. For a maximally mixed state, the density matrix is diagonal with entries 1/2 each. So its representation in Bloch coordinates would indeed be the origin.

Looking at the options:

A) (1,1,0) — That's not the origin. Maybe a pure state on the equator?

B) (0,0,1) — No, that's the |1> state, which is a pure state at the north pole.

C) (0,0,0) — That's the origin, which would be the completely mixed state.

D) (1,1,1) — That's outside the Bloch sphere since Bloch vectors are constrained to length <=1.

So the correct answer should be option C, (0,0,0).


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state, as it is an equal mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), with no coherence between them. In the Bloch sphere representation, the state of a qubit is represented by a vector \((x, y, z)\), where \(z\) corresponds to the diagonal elements of the density matrix. For a maximally mixed state, the density matrix is proportional to the identity matrix, and its Bloch vector is at the origin, \((0, 0, 0)\).

Analyzing the options:

- **A) \((1,1,0)\):** This is not the origin and corresponds to a pure state, not a mixed state.
- **B) \((0,0,1):** This corresponds to the pure state \(|1\rangle\), located at the north pole of the Bloch sphere.
- **C) \((0,0,0):** This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is the origin in the Bloch sphere.
- **D) \((1,1,1):** This is outside the Bloch sphere and is not physically valid.

The correct geometrical position of the given density matrix in qubit space is \((0,0,0)\). 

Answer: C
