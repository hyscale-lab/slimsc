Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X. Let me read through it again to make sure I get all the details.

Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Oh wait, I remember that 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius because water freezes at 273 K (0Â°C), so 277 would be a bit higher. Hmm, maybe something like ice, but I'm not sure.

Also, there's a part about a keto acid reacting with Substance X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. And Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. The question is asking about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes.

Alright, let's start by identifying each component.

First, gas W. Its molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule of W has equal neutrons and protons. Let's think about common gases. Hydrogen gas is H2, which has 1 proton and 1 neutron in each molecule? Wait no, hydrogen can be H2, but each H atom has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (if it's H-1) or 1 neutron (H-2 or H-3). So H2 would have 2 protons and 0 or 2 neutrons. Wait, but if it's H2, each molecule would have 2 atoms, so each has 1 proton. So the molecule would have 2 protons. If the number of neutrons equals protons, then number of neutrons is 2. But H doesn't have neutrons in its common isotopes. Wait, maybe I'm thinking about the wrong gas.

Another possibility: CO2? No, wait, let's calculate. Wait, another way: maybe it's carbon monoxide, CO. Let's see. CO has one C and one O. C has 6 protons; O has 8. So the molecule would have 6 + 8 = 14 protons. If W is
