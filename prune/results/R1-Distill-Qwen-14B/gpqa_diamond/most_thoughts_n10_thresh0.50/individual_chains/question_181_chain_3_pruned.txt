Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, and the pp chain is a big one. Let me think.

So the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh right, that's the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if the pp-III branch stops, the change in neutrino flux would take that time to be felt here on Earth. But the question is about the ratio of flux in two specific energy bands right now, considering that change.

The bands are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). We need to find the ratio flux1/flux2.

First, I should recall what the pp-III branch does. The pp chain is the proton-proton chain, and I think there are different branches. The main one is pp-I, but there's also a pp-II and pp-III. Oh wait, waitâ€”I think the pp-III branch is one of the steps in the chain. More specifically, I remember that the pp-III branch involves reactions that produce high-energy neutrinos, especially the 7 Be and 8 B stages.

Wait, the neutrinos produced in the pp-III branch are the ones that contribute to the high-energy solar neutrinos, like the ones detected in experiments. Oh right, the 8B neutrinos are the ones from the pp-III branch. These are the ones that contribute to the high-energy part of the solar neutrino spectrum.

So if the pp-III branch stops, the production of those neutrinos would stop. Wait, but the question says all other reactions remained as they were. So the other branches (like pp-I and pp-II) are still active.

Wait, but the main pp process is the pp-I branch. So the pp-I branch produces the bulk of the Sun's energy, and the pp-II and pp-III are minor branches. So if pp-III stops, what does that mean for the neutrino flux?

The neutrinos from the pp-III branch are higher energy. So the 8B neutrinos are around several MeV, but the other neutrinos are from lower energy processes.

Wait, but the bands given
