Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand.

The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two stars, each with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits.

The RV method detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravity. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula I think relates the velocity semi-amplitude (K) to other orbital parameters. The formula is K = (v) = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) )^(1/3) * (1/(1 + M_planet/M_star))^(1/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) )

Wait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, I think the formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity is given by:

K = [ (G * P) / (2π c) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) )

But wait, since the planets are similar to Neptune, their masses are much less than their stars (which are solar mass), so M_planet << M_star. So the denominator simplifies to M_star^(2/3), ignoring the planet's mass.

But perhaps even a simpler approach. Since the stars are the same mass and the planets are same mass, but the RV shifts are different, that must relate to their orbital periods and the velocity amplitude.

Wait, the RV method measures the velocity of the star, which is related to the planet's orbit. The formula I recall is that K (the semi-amplitude) is proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * ( (G * (M_star + M_planet) ) / (a^3 * (1 - e²)) ) )^(1/3) ) / (2π )

Wait, maybe another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v sin i) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) / ( (1 yr)^(1/3) * (1 AU)^(-1/3) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to relate the velocities and periods. Another approach is that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * (1 -
