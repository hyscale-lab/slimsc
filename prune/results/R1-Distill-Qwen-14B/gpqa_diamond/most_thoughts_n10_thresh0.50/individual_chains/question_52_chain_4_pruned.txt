Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. When the star doesn't have any dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. This ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. Oh, and the transition between these levels is about 1448 Ã….

Hmm. Okay, I remember from my studies that in stellar atmospheres, under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the number of atoms in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. The formula is something like (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of the level, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when there are spots, the overall Teff is lower. Let's think about what that means for the population ratio.

Wait, but let me clarify: the photospheric effective temperature. Oh, right, when spots are present, the overall photospheric Teff becomes lower. So the effective temperature of the star as a whole is 5500 K in that case. But wait, how does that affect the photosphere? The spots themselves are cooler regions, so when the spots are present, part of the surface is at a lower temperature, and the rest is at the original 6000 K. But the overall effective temperature is an average, but when the entire photosphere is considered, I think the question is considering the effective temperature as 5500 K when spots are present. Hmm, but wait, the problem states
