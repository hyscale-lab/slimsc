Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Alright, the problem has two reactions, and I need to pick the right reagents from the options given.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's typically a nucleophilic addition. So, the ketone is attacked by the cyanide ion. But wait, in what conditions does that happen?

Wait, I think when NaCN is used, it's a good nucleophile. But ketones usually undergo addition under certain conditions. Oh right, in the presence of an acid catalyst, the carbonyl becomes more electrophilic. So, maybe reagent A is an acidic condition. H3O+ is a common acid catalyst, like in the acid-catalyzed addition of CN- to a ketone. So that would make sense for the first reaction. So A is probably H3O+.

Looking at the options, option A and B have A as H3O+. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3. Wait, what's NaHSO3? Sodium bisulfite, right? That's used in the reduction of ketones, like in the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols using something like NaHSO3 and heat, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, wait, another thought: maybe it's a different reaction. Wait, but in the first reaction, the product is a nitrile and a hydroxyl group. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN with an acid catalyst would lead to the formation of a cyanohydrin. The cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the proton from the acid goes on the oxygen, and then the H2O is released. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That matches the product given. So yes, the first step uses H3O+ as a catalyst, so A is H3O+.

So options A and B are possibilities for A because they have A as H3O+. Now, moving to the second reaction, the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid from the nitrile compound when treated with reagent B and H2O.

Wait, so the starting material is a cyanohydrin (from the first reaction) which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, but perhaps with a benzyl group attached. Hmm. Wait, the starting material in the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the structure is something like a benzyl attached to a phenyl ring, connected to a 2-hydroxybutanenitrile part.

So the reaction is turning a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How do you do that? I think nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. Let me recall. One common method is hydrolysis
