Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, parallax... right, parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The parallax angle (usually denoted as 'plx') is inversely proportional to the distance to the star. So a smaller parallax means the star is farther away, and a larger parallax means it's closer.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what sense? Oh, probably in space—so the number density of stars is the same everywhere. So, the number of stars doesn't depend on where you are in the galaxy, just on how far you look.

Now, I need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (like, per parsec of parallax) changes with plx. So, like, if I make a slice of the sky at a certain parallax, how does the number of stars in that slice change as I go to different plx values.

I remember that the distance (d) is related to parallax by d = 1 / plx (in parsecs if plx is in arcseconds). So, if plx increases, distance decreases because the star is closer.

Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (n) is constant. So, the number of stars in a volume would be n multiplied by the volume.

But wait, when considering a shell at a certain distance, the volume element would matter. Let's think in terms of a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr. The volume of the shell is 4π d² dr. So, the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4π d² dr.

But since d = 1/plx, let's substitute that in. So, number of stars in shell is n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * dr. But we're interested in the number per unit range of plx.

So, let's express dr in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, then dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but for our purposes, the magnitude is what matters.

So, replacing dr with (1/plx²) dplx, the number of stars in the shell becomes n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.

Wait, the shell's volume is 4π d² dr. So substituting d = 1/plx, d² is 1/plx². So the volume is 4π (1/plx²) dr. But dr is in terms of distance. How does dr relate to dplx?

We can take the derivative of d with respect to plx. Since d = 1/plx, then dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. So, dr is proportional to dplx over plx squared
