Okay, so I've got this question about solving higher dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. The question is about the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, specifically mentioning the matrix exponential function and fractional approximation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the problem says that higher order finite difference approximations are used along with parallel splitting. So, parallel splitting... I remember that when you split the problem into parts that can be computed simultaneously, you're probably looking at some form of domain decomposition or operator splitting. Oh wait, operator splitting is a technique where you split the equation into different operators that can be handled separately, maybe even in parallel.

Matrix exponential functions are involved in solving systems that can be represented as linear differential equations. The matrix exponential e^A is a common solution approach for such systems, especially in methods like exponential time differencing. But when you approximate this matrix exponential using fractional approximation methods, how does that tie into parallelism?

Wait, the key factor is about converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one. So, what's the main thing that allows splitting the problem for parallel computation? Stability analysis (option A) is important for ensuring the numerical method doesn't blow up, but I don't think it's the key here for parallelism.

Option B is existence of nonlocal boundary conditions. Nonlocal conditions can complicate things, but I'm not sure how directly that relates to making the algorithm parallel. Maybe if the boundary conditions are nonlocal, you need more communication between processes, but I'm not certain.

Option C is complex roots of fractional approximation. Fractional approximations, like in Padé approximants, are used to approximate functions (like e^A) with rational functions. Padé approximants can be more efficient and accurate for certain purposes. Complex roots would affect the stability and the form of the approximation, but how does that tie into parallelism? Maybe if the approximation has certain properties, it's easier to split into parts.

Option D is linear partial fraction of fractional approximation. Linear partial fraction decomposition is a technique used to break down a rational function into simpler fractions, which can then be computed more easily. If the approximation can be split into partial fractions, each part could potentially be handled in parallel. Oh, because each partial fraction might correspond to a simpler matrix operation that can be done concurrently.

Wait, I remember something about splitting the exponential function into sums of exponentials with different exponents. For example, if you can write e^A as a sum of terms like e^{c_i A}, where each c_i is a coefficient, then each term can be computed independently, allowing for parallel computation. But how does that relate to the options given?

If the fractional approximation is decomposed into partial fractions, each of which is easier to compute, then each partial fraction could be handled in parallel. So the ability to perform partial fraction decomposition would be the key factor allowing the algorithm to be parallelized.

So looking at the options, option D is linear partial fraction of fractional approximation. That sounds right because if you can split the approximation into linear parts, you can compute each part in parallel, converting the sequential method into a parallel one.
