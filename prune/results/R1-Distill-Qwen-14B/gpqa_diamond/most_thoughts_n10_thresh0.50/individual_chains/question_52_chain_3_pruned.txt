Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still learning this stuff, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem talks about a star with certain characteristics. So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Then, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, okay. So, the key here is understanding how the temperature affects the population of different energy levels in the star's photosphere. I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms between energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor tells us the ratio of populations between two energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels (n1 and n2) is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of each level, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, so the ratio (n1/n2) depends on the temperature. If T changes, this ratio changes. But in the problem, when there are spots, the overall Teff decreases. However, I think the spots themselves are cooler regionsâ€”so maybe the average temperature of the photosphere is lower, but the spots are even cooler. But wait, the problem says when the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the entire photosphere's temperature is lower on average. Or does that mean the effective temperature is lower because a part is cooler?

Wait, the star's surface isn't uniformly at 60
