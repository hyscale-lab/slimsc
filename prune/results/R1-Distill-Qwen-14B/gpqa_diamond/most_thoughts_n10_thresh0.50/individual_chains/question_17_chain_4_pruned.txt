Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also give me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The options are A to D, so I'll need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like Ca²+ to form a complex. The stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex probably means that each EDTA molecule binds one Ca²+ ion. So the complex would be something like CaY²-.

Wait, the formation constant, Kf, is given. I think the formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where the metal ion and EDTA combine to form the complex. The formula might be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-, and Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, I should double-check. The formation constant is indeed Kf = [ML^n]/([M][L]^n), where ML^n is the complex. So in this case, n would be 1 because each EDTA binds one Ca²+.

The solution has 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me think about the dissociation of this complex. The complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions.

The reaction would be: CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant Kf is 5e10, so the dissociation constant Kd (the reverse reaction) would be 1/Kf. Because Kf is for the formation, Kd is for the dissociation. So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, Kd = 1/Kf. Right. So Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-].
