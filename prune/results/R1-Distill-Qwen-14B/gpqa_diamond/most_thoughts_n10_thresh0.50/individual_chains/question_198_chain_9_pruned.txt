Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. 

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, what's a stability constant again? Oh right, it's a measure of the stability of a complex. A higher β means the complex is more stable. The formula for the stability constant βn is [Co(SCN)n]/([Co][SCN]^n). 

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the blue one is [Co(SCN)2]^2+ because sometimes different complexes have different colors. So we're looking for the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ relative to all possible cobalt species.

So, the possible complexes are [Co], [Co(SCN)], [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, [Co(SCN)_3]^3+, and [Co(SCN)_4]^4+? Wait, the stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β corresponds to the complex with n=1,2,3,4 SCN ligands.

To find the percentage, I think I need to calculate the mole fractions of each complex. The total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all these species. 

Let me denote the species as Co, CoSCN, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3, and Co(SCN)_4. The total [Co] is the sum of all these.

The formation of each complex is stepwise. So the concentration of each species can be expressed using the stability constants.

Wait, maybe I should use the formation in terms of the stepwise stability constants. The concentration of each complex can be expressed as [Co(SCN)_n] = βn * [Co] * [SC
