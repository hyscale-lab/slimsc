Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, let's understand the question. Both observatories have spectrographs with different brightness limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, and HIRES can observe brighter than 16 V mag. So, a star must be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO (since that's the brighter limit) and brighter than 16 for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Wait: the question says, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 can be observed with ESPRESSO. So that means ESPRESSO can see stars down to 17 mag. HIRES can see brighter than 16, so down to 16. So, if a star's apparent V magnitude is less than or equal to 16, both can see it. But for ESPRESSO, it's up to 17. So a star with 17 or brighter (which is fainter) would only be seen by ESPRESSO, but not HIRES. Wait no, wait: The magnitude scale is a bit inverted because lower numbers are brighter. So a star with V magnitude 16 is brighter than 17. So if a star's apparent magnitude is <=16, then HIRES can see it, and also ESPRESSO can, since 16 is less than 17. If a star is between 16 and 17, only ESPRESSO can see it. If it's fainter than 17, both can't see it.

Wait, let me clarify the brightness. The lower the V magnitude, the brighter the star. So, for example, if a star has apparent magnitude 16, it's brighter than 17. So for a star to be detected by ESPRESSO, it must have apparent V <= 17. For HIRES, it must have apparent V <=16. So, which stars satisfy both? The stars with apparent V <=16. Because they can be seen by both. Because 16 is less than or equal to 17, so ESPRESSO
