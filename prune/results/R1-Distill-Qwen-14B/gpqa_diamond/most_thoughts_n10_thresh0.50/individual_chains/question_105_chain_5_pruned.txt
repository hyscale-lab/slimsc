Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, let's read through it again.

So, the setup is that there's a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. When only one hemisphere is spotted, photometric observations (which measure brightness over time) will show periodic brightness changes because the star rotates, modulating the light we receive. The interesting part is that this situation can look like an exoplanet transiting the star, causing a dip in brightness.

The question is, if the star weren't spotted, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet needed to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve? So we're comparing the brightness variation caused by the spots to that of a planet transit.

Alright, I think the key here is to model the brightness variation from the spots and then set that equal to the variation caused by a planet and solve for the planet's radius.

First, let's think about the brightness variation caused by the spots. When a star has spots, the observed brightness changes as the spots rotate into and out of view. The spots are cooler, so when they're on the visible side, they make the star appear slightly dimmer.

The star's total brightness, or luminosity, depends on its temperature and radius. The formula for luminosity is L = 4πR²σT^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But since we're dealing with relative changes, maybe we can work with the fractional change in brightness.

The star's normal brightness (without spots) would be L = 4πR²σTeff^4. But with spots, when a spot is facing us, it contributes less. The spots have a temperature of (6000K - 1000K) = 5000K. The filling factor is 20%, so 0.2 of the hemisphere is covered by spots.

Wait, but it's only one hemisphere that's spotty. So when the star rotates so that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots contribute to the brightness. Hmm, but wait, how does the rotation affect which part we see? Oh right, because it's a hemisphere, when the star rotates, the spotted side comes into view and the unspotted goes to the back. So the maximum effect is when the spotted area is entirely facing us.

Wait, no. The star's rotation would cause the spots to come into view as the star spins. But since the spots are on one hemisphere, when the star rotates, the brightness change would depend on how much of the spotted area is in our line of sight.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to model the maximum change in brightness. When the spotted hemisphere is fully visible, the maximum dip occurs. Wait, no, because the star is a sphere, so when the spotted hemisphere is in view, the spots would cover a certain fraction of the star's disk as seen from Earth.

Wait, perhaps I should model the brightness when the spots are on the side facing us versus when they're not. Wait, but the star is rotating,
