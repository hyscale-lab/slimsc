Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Then, it goes through several steps to produce various products, and finally asks about the coupling pattern in the NMR of product 3. I need to figure out what's happening in each step and then determine the correct answer from the options given.

First, let's break down each reaction step.

Step 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. The product is a light yellow solid, and the 1H NMR shows specific peaks. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which suggests an ester or maybe a ketone or aldehyde. But considering the reaction conditions, since KOH is a strong base, it's likely an elimination or substitution reaction.

1,3-dibromoadamantane is a dihalide. When treated with a strong base like KOH, it typically undergoes dehydrohalogenation, which is an elimination reaction. The two bromine atoms are on adjacent carbons (since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, the 1 and 3 positions are probably on adjacent vertices). So heating with KOH would likely lead to the formation of an alkene via an E2 mechanism.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromines on 1 and 3 positions of adamantane. Since adamantane is a polycyclic structure, the positions might actually be such that elimination leads to the formation of a bridgehead double bond. Wait, but bridgehead alkenes are generally not possible because of Bredt's Rule, which states that double bonds are not allowed at bridgehead positions in bicyclic systems with rings of 5 or fewer members. Hmm, that seems contradictory. Unless the compound isn't a bridgehead situation.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons, but in such a way that elimination could lead to a cyclopropane? No, that's probably not right.

Wait, another possibility. When KOH is used on a vicinal dihalide (two halogens on adjacent carbons), it can lead to the formation of an epoxide. Wait, no
