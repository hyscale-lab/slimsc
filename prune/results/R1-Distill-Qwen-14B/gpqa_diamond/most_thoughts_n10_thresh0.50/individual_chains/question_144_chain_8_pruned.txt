Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says X is a meson resonance. I need to find the mean decay distance. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV.

Wait, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! The width Γ is the energy uncertainty, which relates to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ is ħ divided by Γ.

But wait, decay distance isn't just about time. It also depends on how fast the particle is moving. Because the mean decay distance L would be the particle's velocity multiplied by its lifetime. Oh yeah, L = v * τ.

So putting that together, L = v * (ħ / Γ). But I need to calculate v. How do I find the velocity of the meson?

Hmm, the meson is produced with energy E_X. The mass is m_X, so I can find the kinetic energy and then the velocity. Alternatively, since for high-energy particles, the velocity is close to the speed of light, maybe I can approximate v as c. But wait, let me think.

The energy E of a relativistic particle is given by E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. The kinetic energy K is E - m c². But maybe
