Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to think it through step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see what I can figure out.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. Then, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it has a heavier isotope in one of its elements.

Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, I'll think about the reaction between X and Y. Gas W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. What gases have that? Well, if a molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons, let's think about isotopes. For example, H2O doesn't fit because the numbers are different. Maybe something like NH3? Wait, no, ammonia has 14 (N) and 3 H, but the molecule is NH3, so each molecule would have 7 protons (N has 7) and 8 neutrons (since N-14 has 7 protons and 7 neutrons). So each molecule would have 7 protons and 8 (from N) plus 3*0 (H) = 8? Wait, no, that's not equal. Alternatively, maybe CO2? No, that's 22 protons and 22 neutrons? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the molecule's protons and neutrons are the same. Let's think of a molecule where for each atom in the molecule, the number of protons and neutrons are the same. Or perhaps the total across all atoms in the molecule. Wait, the problem says the gas W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So for each molecule, sum of protons equals sum of neutrons.

Wait, let's think of H2O. H has 1 proton each, O has 8. So total protons = 2*1 + 8 = 10. Neutrons: H has 0, O-16 has 8. So total neutrons = 8. 10 !=8.
