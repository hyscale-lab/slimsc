Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving glass. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully. The setup is that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are A to D, each with different formulas.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with light in different media, the speed depends on the medium's refractive index. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium is c divided by n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So normally, when the medium isn't moving, the speed is v = c/n. But here, the glass is moving, so does that affect the observed speed?

I think this has to do with the relativity of motion. Wait, but the speed of light in a vacuum is always c according to special relativity, but here the glass is a medium, so maybe the motion of the medium affects the light's speed as observed. Or wait, noâ€”light's speed in a medium is determined by the medium's properties, not the observer's frame. But if the medium itself is moving, perhaps we have to consider how it affects the light's speed from the lab frame.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the glass is moving. So the light is moving through the glass which is itself moving. How does that affect the observed speed?

I remember that when the medium is moving, the speed of light in that medium might change from the perspective of a stationary observer. Or wait, maybe it's more about the frame of reference. Let me think: the speed of light in the glass, as measured in the lab frame, is not just v = c/n because the glass's motion might add to it.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because we're dealing with velocities that might be significant fractions of c, right? Wait, but the problem says v is the velocity of the glass, and the glass isn't a vacuum, so c is much larger. Wait, but the velocity v is likely much smaller than c, so maybe the non-relativistic approach is sufficient.

Wait, no, the problem doesn't specify the magnitude of v relative to c. So perhaps I should consider using the relativistic approach. Hmm. Let's think.

In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is c/n in the direction of propagation. But from
