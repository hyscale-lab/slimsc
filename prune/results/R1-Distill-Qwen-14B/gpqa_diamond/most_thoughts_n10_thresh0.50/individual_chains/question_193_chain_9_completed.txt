Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the number of stars (N) is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance somehow. Oh wait, right! Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula I think is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So if the distance increases, the parallax decreases.

So, if N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N would be proportional to (d)^5. Because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. Wait, let me double-check that. If plx = 1/d, then plx^5 is (1/d)^5 = 1/d^5. So 1/(plx^5) is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So, the number of stars as a function of distance is N(r) = k * r^5, where k is some constant. But wait, the question is about how N changes as r changes, so maybe we're looking at the differential, like the derivative dN/dr.

If N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to 5 r^4. So the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance is proportional to r^4. So the number of stars increases with r^4 as r increases.

But wait, let me think again. The question says the number varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is inversely proportional to r (distance), plx = 1/r. So 1/(plx)^5 becomes r^5. So N = C * r^5, where C is a constant.

So the number of stars is proportional to r^5. But the question asks how the number changes with distance per unit range. So if you consider a small change in r (like from r to r + dr), the change in N would be the derivative of N with respect to r. That is, dN/dr = 5 C r^4. So the rate is proportional to r^4.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question could be asking about the number per unit distance, which would be the derivative. So the answer would be proportional to r^4, which is option C.

Wait, looking at the options again: 

A) ~ r^3
B) ~ r^5
C) ~ r^4
D) ~ r^2

So if the answer is r^4, then option C.

Wait, let me double-check the math. 

Given N ∝ (1/plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d (where d is distance), substitute plx = 1/d. So N ∝ (d)^5.

So N = k d^5. 

The change in N per unit distance would be dN/dd = 5 k d^4. So the rate of change is proportional to d^4, so the number increases as r^4 with distance. So the correct option is C, r^4.


The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), such that \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \) into the given relationship, we find:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5.
\]

Thus, \( N \propto r^5 \). The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, which corresponds to the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Taking the derivative of \( N = Cr^5 \) (where \( C \) is a constant), we get:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} = 5Cr^4.
\]

This shows that the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance is proportional to \( r^4 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
