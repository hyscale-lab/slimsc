Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem talks about a star with certain characteristics—1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main point of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. They've observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, so I remember that the ratio of atoms in two energy levels can be determined using the Boltzmann equation. The equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights, ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, and T is the temperature. Since the problem says the photosphere is in LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium), this should apply.

The transition wavelength is about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet range. I think that's where Ti lines are often measured because neutral titanium (Ti I) has lines there.

So, when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature is lower. But wait, what's the effect on each spot and the surrounding area? Spots are cooler regions, right? So when 40% is covered, the average Teff is 5500 K. But wait, I'm not sure if the entire photosphere cools to 5500 K or if parts are cooler and others are hotter. Oh, wait, the question says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases, so I think it's an average.

Wait, but how does this affect the line ratios? The line ratios are observed in the photosphere. So I'm assuming the temperature of the photosphere where Ti is present changes. Wait, but when there are spots, the spots are cooler, but the rest of the surface is the same? Or does the entire photosphere's
