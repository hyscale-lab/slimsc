Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question is about a star and how dark spots on its surface affect the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that stars have something called the photosphere where light is emitted, and when there are dark spots, it changes the star's overall brightness and temperature.

The star in question has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, wait, no. The problem says that when 40% is covered, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. Hmm, but I thought that the spots are cooler regions. So the star's overall emission would be lower when spots are present, which makes sense because the spots are darker and presumably at a lower temperature.

But the main point of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). The ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

The transition in question corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Ã…. Oh, that's in the near-ultraviolet or maybe far-ultraviolet. But more importantly, this is a transition that's probably used in spectroscopy to determine the ionization state or the excitation temperature of the star.

Wait, the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, the excitation of the atoms can be described by the Boltzmann equation.

The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2 - E1)/(k T)).

But wait, the problem is about the ratio when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. So,
