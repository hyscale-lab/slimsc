Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

So, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group attached. Ethynyl is like a triple bond to a CH2 group, right? So it's CH2-Câ‰¡CH attached to cyclohexane.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring connected to a hydroxymethyl group, which is attached to another cyclohexane ring. Wait, so it's cyclohexyl-(hydroxy)methyl connected to another cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Wait, the structure is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main chain is a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO). Attached to that cyclohexane is a methyl group that's substituted with a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group. So, the structure is something like cyclohexane-CHO with a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, actually, maybe I should draw this out mentally
