Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully and understanding what's being asked.

Alright, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So the presence of these spots affects the star's overall temperature.

Then the question shifts to the photosphere of the star. When looking at the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2), the ratio decreases when the star has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots versus when it does. And we're told to assume LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium) is valid in the photosphere.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. I think this involves the Boltzmann equation because it's about the distribution of atoms in different energy levels. The Boltzmann equation relates the ratio of the populations of two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann factor is given by (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) )

Where:
- n_i and n_j are the number densities of the two levels
- g_i and g_j are the statistical weights (or degeneracies) of the levels
- E_i and E_j are the energies of the levels
- k is Boltzmann's constant
- T is the temperature

In this problem, when the spots are present, the overall Teff decreases from 6000 K to 5500 K. So the ratio n1/n2 (assuming level 1 is lower in energy than level 2) would depend exponentially on 1/T.

Wait, the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the Teff is lower, and the ratio of Ti atoms in levels 1 and 2 is lower. That implies that the ratio n1/n2 is decreasing when T decreases. Since the temperature is lower, the exponent becomes a larger positive number because (E2 - E1)/(k T) would be larger when T is smaller.

Wait, wait. Let me think. Let me clarify the energy levels. Suppose level 1 is the lower energy level and level 2 is higher. So E2 > E1. Then the ratio n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). So if T decreases, the exponent becomes larger in the negative, so exp(-x) where x increases. So exp(-x) decreases as x increases. So n1/n2 decreases as T decreases. Which matches the observation in the problem: when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases.

So the original ratio (no spots) is at T1 = 6000 K, and the ratio when spots are present is at T2 = 5500 K. We need to find the factor by which the ratio changes. So factor = (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Let me write that as:

Factor = [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

The g1/g2 terms cancel out because they're same in numerator and denominator. So we're left with:

Factor = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) )

Which can be rewritten as:

Factor = exp( ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ] )

Wait, ΔE is E2 - E1, which is positive. So the exponent becomes positive because (1/T2) is larger than (1/T1). So the exponent is positive, and thus the Factor is greater than 1. So the ratio when no spots is higher than when there are spots, which matches the problem statement.

But wait, the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So (n1/n2)_no_spots > (n1/n2)_with_spots. That means the factor is the ratio (no spots)/(with spots) = a number greater than 1.

Now, I need to calculate this factor. But I don't have the value of ΔE. Oh wait, but I do have the wavelength of the transition between the two levels. The transition corresponds to a wavelength λ of 1448 Å. That would be in the near-ultraviolet or visible range.

The energy difference between the two levels can be found using the relation E = hc / λ. Because the transition emits a photon of energy E when an electron drops from level 2 to level 1. So,

ΔE = hc / λ.

Let me compute ΔE. First, h is Planck's constant, which is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. c is the speed of light, about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. λ is given as 1448 Ångströms. Since 1 Å is 1e-10 meters, λ is 1448e-10 m.

So,

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3.0e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) = ?

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by denominator 1448e-10 m:

1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = approx 1.372e-18 J.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. Let me compute 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 (since 1448e-10 = 1.448e-7 m).

Wait no: 1448e-10 = 1.448 x10^-7 meters. So,

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 6.626 *3 =19.878, times 1e-26 (since 1e-34 *1e8=1e-26). So 19.878e-26 J·m.

Wait, wait, no: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = (6.626 *3) * 1e-34 +8 = 19.878 *1e-26 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Then, 1.9878e-25 J·m divided by 1.448e-7 m is (1.9878e-25)/(1.448e-7) = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18 ≈ 1.373 *1e-18 J.

So ΔE ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

But wait, maybe I should express this in terms of eV, because Boltzmann's constant is often expressed in eV/K. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the exponent in terms of temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the exponent as (ΔE)/(k T) = (hc)/(λ k T) = (hc)/(λ k T).

But let me compute the numerical value. Let me compute the exponent in the factor:

(ΔE)/(k) = (hc)/(λ k) = (hc)/(λ k) = (h/(k)) * c/(λ).

But h/(k) is approximately (6.626e-34 J·s) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ 4.796e-11 K·m²/s². Hmm, perhaps not the easiest approach.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the exponent as (ΔE)/(k T) for each temperature. But since we're taking the difference in the exponentials, perhaps we can compute (ΔE)/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) as follows.

Wait, the factor is exp( (ΔE)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, no. Let me recheck:

The factor is exp( [ΔE/(k T1) - ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-express the factor:

Factor = exp( [ (ΔE)/(k T2) - (ΔE)/(k T1) ] )

Because when I subtract the exponents: [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, let me double-check:

Factor = exp( [ (ΔE/(k T2)) - (ΔE/(k T1)) ] )

Yes, because:

(ΔE/(k T2) ) - (ΔE/(k T1)) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

So, Factor = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Now, substituting the values.

First, compute (1/T2) - (1/T1) = (1/5500) - (1/6000) K^-1.

Compute 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4 K^-1.

1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4 K^-1.

Difference: 1.818e-4 - 1.6667e-4 = 0.1513e-4 = 1.513e-5 K^-1.

Now, compute (ΔE / k) * (1.513e-5 )

We have ΔE = hc/(λ) = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) = let me compute that again.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.373e-18 J.

So ΔE ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

k is Boltzmann's constant, approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE / k = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ (1.373 / 1.38) * 1e5 K.

1.373 / 1.38 ≈ 0.995, so approximately 9.95e4 K.

Wait, 1.373e-18 /1.38e-23 = (1.373 /1.38) *1e5 → approximately 0.995 * 1e5 = 9.95e4 ≈1e5 K.

So (ΔE)/(k) ≈ 1e5 K.

Multiply by (1.513e-5 K^-1):

(1e5 K) * (1.513e-5 K^-1) ) = 1e5 * 1.513e-5 → 1e5 * 1.513e-5 = 1.513.

So the exponent is approximately 1.513.

So the factor is exp(1.513) ≈ e^1.513.

We know that e^1≈2.718, e^1.5≈4.4817, e^1.6≈4.953, e^1.513 is about 4.52 perhaps?

Wait, let me compute e^1.513 more accurately.

We know that ln(4) is about 1.386, ln(5)=1.609. So 1.513 is between them.

e^1.513 → Let me compute it.

We can approximate it using Taylor series or known values.

I know that e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

Now, 1.513 -1.5=0.013.

So e^1.513 = e^(1.5 +0.013) = e^1.5 * e^0.013.

e^0.013 ≈ 1 + 0.013 + (0.013)^2/2 ≈ 1.013 + (0.000169)/2 ≈ 1.0130845.

So e^1.513 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.0130845 ≈ let's compute that.

4.4817 *1.013 = approx 4.4817 + 4.4817*0.013.

4.4817 *0.013 = 0.05826.

So total is 4.4817 + 0.05826 ≈4.54.

But wait, let me check precise value.

Alternatively, let's calculate e^1.513 using a calculator approximation.

But since I don't have a calculator, perhaps I can recall that ln(4.5)= about 1.504. Let me check:

ln(4.5)=?

We know that ln(e)=1, e≈2.718, so ln(4.5)= ln(2.718 * 1.65) = 1 + ln(1.65). ln(1.65)=approx 0.5075. So ln(4.5)=approx 1.5075.

Which is very close to 1.513. So e^1.513≈4.53 or something.

Wait, let me see: if ln(4.5)=1.5075, then 1.513 is 0.0055 higher. So e^1.513 = e^(1.5075 +0.0055) = e^1.5075 * e^0.0055.

e^1.5075 is 4.5, e^0.0055≈1 +0.0055 + (0.0055^2)/2≈1.0055 + 0.000015≈1.005515.

So 4.5 * 1.005515≈4.5248.

So approximately 4.525.

So the factor is roughly 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, the exponent is (ΔE/(k)) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, earlier I had:

Factor = exp( (ΔE/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

But let me recheck.

Wait, the factor is [n1/n2]_no_spots / [n1/n2_with_spots]

Which is:

[ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( [ (-ΔE/(k T1)) - (-ΔE/(k T2)) ] )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, wait, no. Let me redo.

The exponent is [ (-ΔE/(k T1)) - ( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Which is:

[ (-ΔE/(k T1)) + ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

= ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ]

Yes, correct.

So (1/T2 -1/T1) is positive because T2 < T1. So the exponent is positive, so factor is e^positive.

So the factor is e^(approx 1.513)≈4.5.

So the ratio is about 4.5 times when the star isn't spotted compared to when it is. So the answer should be C) ~4.5.


To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels under the influence of temperature changes caused by the presence of stellar spots. The Boltzmann equation governs the population ratio of two energy levels:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) are the populations of levels 1 and 2, \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are their degeneracies, \(\Delta E = E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

The problem states that the star's effective temperature decreases from \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (no spots) to \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (40% surface covered by spots). The ratio of the populations decreases when the star has spots, meaning the ratio \(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\) is higher at \(T_1\) than at \(T_2\). We are tasked with finding the factor by which this ratio changes.

The factor is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{with spots}}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann equation into the factor expression, we get:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Compute \(\Delta E\)
The energy difference \(\Delta E\) corresponds to the transition wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\). Using the relation \(\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.0 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} = 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the temperature term
The temperature difference term \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\) is:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = 1.818 \times 10^{-4} - 1.667 \times 10^{-4} = 1.513 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the factor
Substitute \(\Delta E = 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}\), \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), and the temperature term into the factor expression:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

First, compute \(\frac{\Delta E}{k}\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} = 9.95 \times 10^4 \, \text{K}.
\]

Now, multiply by the temperature term:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = (9.95 \times 10^4)(1.513 \times 10^{-5}) = 1.513.
\]

Finally, compute the exponential:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.513) \approx 4.5.
\]

### Conclusion
The ratio of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately **4.5** when the star has spots compared to when it does not.
