Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question says that we dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, then titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D with different values. 

Wait, okay, let's break this down. First, I think I need to figure out the concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution. Because when you mix two volumes, the concentration changes based on dilution. 

So the initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluting it with 20 cm³ of water means the total volume is 40 cm³. So the new concentration (C1) can be found using the dilution formula: C1V1 = C2V2. 

Wait, wait, no. Wait, initial volume is 20 cm³ and initial concentration is 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ of water, volume is 40 cm³. So the new concentration is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me calculate that. 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. Oh, so the concentration becomes 0.025 M acetic acid after dilution.

But wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, so when we add water, it dissociates more. But since we're going to titrate it, maybe it doesn't matter for the equivalence point calculation. 

Next, the titration is with 0.1 M NaOH. So I need to find out how much NaOH is needed to reach the equivalence point. 

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid initially. Let's see: the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution. Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the initial solution before adding water was 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. So moles of acetic acid = 0.
