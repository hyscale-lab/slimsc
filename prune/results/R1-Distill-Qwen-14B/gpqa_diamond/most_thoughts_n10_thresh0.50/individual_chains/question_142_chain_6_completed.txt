Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out where the given density matrix is located in the qubit space. Hmm, let me think about what I know.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. For a qubit, it's a 2x2 matrix, right?

I think the Bloch sphere is involved here. The Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states geometrically. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. But how does the density matrix translate into the Bloch sphere coordinates?

A general density matrix for a qubit can be written as:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

where I is the identity matrix, σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (r_x, r_y, r_z) that points to a point on the Bloch sphere. The length of r can't be more than 1 because it's a unit sphere.

So let me expand the given ρ. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let's compute each term.

|0><0| is a matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is 1 in the bottom-right corner. Adding them together gives:

|0><0| + |1><1| = [[1, 0], [0, 1]] because each of the diagonal elements becomes 1 when added. So that's the identity matrix I. Therefore, ρ = (I)/2.

Wait, but the general form is (I + r·σ)/2. In this case, our ρ is just I/2. So that would imply that r·σ must be zero because I/2 is equal to (I + 0)/2.

So r·σ = 0. Since σ includes σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, the sum of each component multiplied by r_x, r_y, r_z respectively equals zero. The only way that happens is if all the components of r are zero. So r is (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, choice C is r=(0,0,0). That makes sense because the state is completely mixed. On the Bloch sphere, the origin represents the maximally mixed state, which is what this ρ is. So the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the \(2 \times 2\) identity matrix. For a general qubit density matrix, it can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is a vector that determines the position of the state on the Bloch sphere, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we see that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). This implies that \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), meaning the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

The origin of the Bloch sphere corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which matches the given \(\rho\). Therefore, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
