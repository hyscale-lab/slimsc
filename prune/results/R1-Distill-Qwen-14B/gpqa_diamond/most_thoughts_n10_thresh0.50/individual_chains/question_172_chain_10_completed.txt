Okay, let's try to work through this problem. Hmm, so the question is about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. I remember that when dealing with atoms in stars, the concept of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is important. So the photospheres are in LTE, which means the atoms' energy levels are determined by the thermal conditions of the surrounding plasma.

The problem says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, I think that refers to the excitation ratio. So the number of atoms in an excited state compared to the ground state, maybe. Oh right, in LTE, the ratio is given by the Boltzmann equation.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is equal to the Boltzmann factor. So the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE / (k*T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the problem says that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So let's denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and star_2 as R2. So R1 = 2 * R2.

But wait, the excitation is about the same energy level. So maybe the energy levels are the same for both stars, as they're talking about the same specific level. So ΔE is the same for both stars.

Assuming that the statistical weights g_upper and g_lower are the same for both stars (since they're the same element, same transition), then the ratios R would be proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) for each star.

Let me write that down. Let R1 = n1_upper / n1_lower = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1))
Similarly, R2 = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

But the problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So R1 = 2 R2.

So substituting the expressions:

(g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

I can cancel (g1/g2) from both sides since they're the same in both stars. So:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify this. So:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Hmm, let me rearrange this equation. Let's bring the terms involving T to one side.

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] = ln(2)

Or,

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, let's compute 1/T2 - 1/T1. That's (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So the equation becomes:

(ΔE / k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2)

But the problem gives us ΔE as approximately 1.38e-23 J. Wait, I remember that k (Boltzmann constant) is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, that's convenient because 1.38e-23 J is exactly k * 1 K.

So ΔE = k * (1 K) * something? Let me see. Wait, if k is 1.38e-23 J/K, then ΔE = 1.38e-23 J is equal to k * 1 K. Because 1.38e-23 J/K * 1 K = 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE = k * 1 K.

Wait, but the given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly equal to k. So ΔE = k.

So substituting ΔE = k into the equation:

k * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But since ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is k, so ΔE = k * (1 K), but wait, no. Wait, k is 1.38e-23 J/(K), so when you multiply by T in Kelvin, you get J.

So if ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, that would be exactly k * 1 K. So ΔE = k * 1 K.

So substituting into our equation:

(k) (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

We can factor out k:

(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

But wait, in the equation we derived earlier, it's (ΔE / k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2). Wait no, wait, let me double-check.

Wait earlier, after taking logs:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Then, moving terms:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Which is the same as:

(ΔE / k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

But since ΔE = k, so (k /k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So that becomes:

[ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Which can be rewritten as:

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Or,

(T1 - T2) = T1 T2 ln(2)

Hmm, but looking at the options, let's see.

The options are in terms of ln(2) equals something. So let me rearrange the equation.

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Looking at the options, option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which matches.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1*T2)

Yes, that's exactly what we have. So the correct equation is option D.

Wait, but wait, let's make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me go through the steps again.

So the ratio R1/R2 is 2, where R is the excitation ratio.

We applied the Boltzmann equation, took the ratio, and took natural logs. Then, with ΔE = k, which makes the equation simplify because (ΔE/k) is 1.

So the equation becomes [ (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2), which is option D.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer is D.


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The excitation ratio of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2, and the energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J. Using the Boltzmann equation and assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of populations of two energy levels is proportional to the Boltzmann factor:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_{\text{upper}} \) and \( g_{\text{lower}} \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratios are:

\[
R_1 = \frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
R_2 = \frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Given that \( R_1 = 2 R_2 \), substituting the expressions for \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) gives:

\[
\frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Canceling \( \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \) from both sides:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Given that \( \Delta E = k \) (since \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches option D, which states:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

**Answer: D**
