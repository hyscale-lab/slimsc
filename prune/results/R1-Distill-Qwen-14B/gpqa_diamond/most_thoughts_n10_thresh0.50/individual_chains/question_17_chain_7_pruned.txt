Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mention that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions, and the stability of the complex is given by the formation constant, Kf. In this case, K_Ca-EDTA is 5e10, which is a pretty large number, indicating a very stable complex. So I think the complex doesn't dissociate much, meaning the concentration of free Ca²+ ions should be really low.

Wait, the formula for the formation constant is Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Oh right, so if the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, that's the concentration of the complex. Let me denote [CaEDTA^2-] as 0.02 M. 

But wait, do I need to consider the dissociation of the EDTA? EDTA is a polydentate ligand, and in solution, it exists in different protonated forms. But the question says the pH is ideal. I think that means the pH is such that EDTA is in its correct form, maybe the deprotonated one that can bind to Ca²+. So perhaps I don't need to worry about the different forms of EDTA here, as the pH is optimal for complex formation.

So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me set up the equation. The Kf is given as 5e10. The reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-

So, Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

But wait, in solution, the EDTA's concentration comes from
