Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how their flux changes if a certain reaction in the Sun's core suddenly stops. Hmm. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The question is about the pp-III branch stopping. Wait, I remember the pp chain is one of the main reactions in the Sun's core for producing energy. There are different branches: pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Oh wait, the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton cycle, right? I think the pp-III branch is responsible for producing boron-8, which then goes on to produce carbon-12 in the CNO cycle or something like that. But I might be getting the details wrong.

The scenario is that the pp-III branch has stopped, but all other reactions are as they were. So, the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two specific energy bands. The bands are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). We need to find the ratio of the flux in band 1 to band 2.

Wait, neutrinos come from various reactions in the Sun. The main ones are the proton-proton chain and the CNO cycle. Oh right, the proton-proton chain produces neutrinos via the beta decay of boron-8. But wait, isn't pp-III the part where three protons fuse into boron-8? Because I remember that in the pp
