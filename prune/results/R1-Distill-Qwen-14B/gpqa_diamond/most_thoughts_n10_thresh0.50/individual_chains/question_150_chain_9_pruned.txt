Okay, I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. So the question involves a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that molecular formula looks a bit tricky. Let me think about possible structures.

The NMR data is given, so that should help. The 1H-NMR shows several peaks. Let me list them:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

I should try to interpret these peaks. The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet. That region is usually aldehydic protons, but wait, sometimes it can also be an acidic proton like from a phenol, but in phenol, the protons are usually broader and maybe around 5 ppm. Hmm. Or maybe it's an aldehyde. Wait, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm and appear as singlets or triplets. The triplet suggests coupling with two adjacent protons. Wait, no, wait. Aldehyde protons are usually at high ppm and are deshielded. So that 9.72 is probably an aldehyde (RCHO) giving a triplet. But wait, in an aldehyde, the proton is usually a singlet because it's adjacent only to the carbonyl, which doesn't have any protons. Hmm, so maybe it's not an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with something else. Oh wait, another possibility is an aromatic ring with an adjacent substituent that causes some coupling. Or maybe it's an enal, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde. Or perhaps an aromatic proton with some coupling.

Wait, let's think about the other peaks. The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm are doublets each integrating for 2H. Those might be from a para-substituted aromatic ring. For example, if there's a para-substituted benzene, the protons ortho to the substituent would be as doublets. So like, if the substituent is at position para, the ortho protons would each have a
