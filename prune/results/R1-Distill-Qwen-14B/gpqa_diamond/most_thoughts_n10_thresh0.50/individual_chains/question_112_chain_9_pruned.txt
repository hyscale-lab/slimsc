Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The state of the electron is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because the question says it's proportional, not necessarily normalized. So I'll have to make sure the state is a unit vector. 

The |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I know are the standard basis states. So let me write that out. Let me denote the state as |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a = (1+i) and b = (2 - i). 

Wait, but wait, the state is proportional, so it's (1+i)|up> + (2âˆ’i)|down>, but we need to normalize it. To find the normalization factor, I should compute the inner product <alpha|alpha> and take the square root to get the norm. 

The inner product is (1-i)*2 (since <up|a is the conjugate of a when a is |up> component) plus (2 + i)*1 (since <down|b is the conjugate of b). Wait no, actually, more accurately, the inner product is (a*) * (a) + (b*) * (b) because |up> and |down> are orthonormal. So |a|^2 + |b|^2 is the norm squared. Let's compute that.

a = (1 + i), so |a|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2. Because (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1=2.

b = (2 - i), so |b|^2 is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5. So the total norm squared is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, but the problem says |alpha> is proportional, so maybe in the problem, when you calculate
