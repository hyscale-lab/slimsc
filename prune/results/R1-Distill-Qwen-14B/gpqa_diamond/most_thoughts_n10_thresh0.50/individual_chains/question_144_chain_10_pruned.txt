Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson called X. The given data are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different values in meters.

Wait, I remember that the decay distance of a particle is related to its lifetime and velocity. Oh right, the mean path length is given by the product of the particle's velocity (v) and its lifetime (τ). So the formula is cτ, where c is the speed of light, but wait, no, actually, it's v multiplied by τ. Since v is a fraction of c, maybe I should consider beta times gamma times c times tau, or something like that.

Wait, no, for particles moving at relativistic speeds, the lifetime is dilated. The proper lifetime is τ0, and the observed lifetime is gamma * tau0, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. So the mean decay distance L is v * gamma * tau0. Or is it beta gamma c tau0 multiplied by something else? Hmm.

Alternatively, another approach comes to mind. The width Γ is related to the lifetime of the particle. The uncertainty principle says that Γ (the total decay width) is inversely proportional to the lifetime: Γ = ħ / τ. So the lifetime tau is ħ / Γ.

Wait, more accurately, the lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ. Because the width Γ is related to the inverse of the lifetime. So that's a key point.

So first, I can find the lifetime τ. Then, I need to calculate the speed of the meson because the decay distance depends on how fast it's moving.

But wait, the meson is produced with a certain energy, E_X =8 GeV. So I can use energy conservation to find its velocity. The rest mass is m_X =1.2 GeV. So the kinetic energy plus rest energy equals the total energy.

The relativistic energy equation is E = gamma * m c². So gamma is E / (m c²). Wait, but E is given as 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = E/(m c²) / c
