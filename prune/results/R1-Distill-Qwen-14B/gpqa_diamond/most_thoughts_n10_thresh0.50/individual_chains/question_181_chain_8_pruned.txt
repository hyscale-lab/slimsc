Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos and the Sun. Hmm, I remember that the Sun produces neutrinos through various nuclear reactions in its core. The question is about what happens when the pp-III branch stops suddenly, and how that affects the flux of neutrinos in two different energy bands.

Wait, let me think. The pp chain is the proton-proton chain, right? And the pp-III branch is a specific part of that. The pp chain is the main source of energy in the Sun, producing helium-4 from two protons. But there are branches depending on the temperature and conditions in the core.

Oh, right, the pp-I branch is when a boron-8 nucleus captures two protons, but wait, no, maybe I'm mixing that up. Let me recall: the pp chain has two main branches. The pp-I branch involves the production of beryllium-7, which then captures a proton to form boron-8. The pp-II branch might involve higher excited states or something else. Wait, I'm a bit confused, maybe I should think about the neutrinos.

Oh wait, in the pp chain, the main neutrinos come from the decay of beryllium-7 into lithium-7 plus a positron and a neutrino. That's the main contribution, called the pep (proton-electron-proton) branch. But the pp-III branchâ€”is that a different part? Maybe I should look up what the pp-III branch is. Wait, but I don't have that luxury right now;
