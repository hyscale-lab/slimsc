Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let me read it again. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, which is 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. Hmm, I need to find the relationship between the number of stars and distance.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. So, plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Oh right, because parallax is measured in arcseconds, and the formula is 1 parsec equals 1 AU over parallax. So, distance in parsecs is approximately 1 divided by parallax.

So if the number of stars N varies with parallax as N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is some constant. Wait no, wait. Wait, the question says the number varies with 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5.

But since plx is 1/d, let's substitute that in. So 1/plx is d. So N is proportional to (d)^5. Wait, because 1/( (1/d) )^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Hmm, but wait the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So maybe I should think about how the number of stars increases as you go further, but the question is
