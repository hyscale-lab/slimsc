Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says both planets have the same mass but different orbital periods. Planet_1 has a shorter periodâ€”three times shorter than Planet_2. Oh wait, so Planet_1 orbits its star more quickly. Also, their host stars have the same radius but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's.

I think the probability of a transit depends on a couple of factors. One is the alignment, which is more about the orbital inclination, and another is the size of the planet relative to the star. But wait, since both planets are Earth-like, their sizes are similar. But maybe the radius of the star affects the probability because a smaller star makes the planet's transit more noticeable.

Wait, actually, the probability of a transit is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / (2R_s)), where R_p is planet radius, R_s is star radius, and a is the semi-major axis. Or maybe I'm mixing that up. Alternatively, the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 divided by (a / R_s), but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the ratio.

Wait, another approach: The probability of
