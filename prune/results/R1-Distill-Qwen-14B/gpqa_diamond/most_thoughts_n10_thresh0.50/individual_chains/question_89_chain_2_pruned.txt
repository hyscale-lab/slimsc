Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and NMR spectroscopy. Let's take it step by step.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a cage-like molecule with multiple bridgehead carbons. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two bridgehead carbons that are three positions apart.

The first reaction is heating with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination reaction might happen here. Wait, but since both bromines are on bridgehead positions, elimination might not be straightforward. Oh wait, bridgehead elimination? I recall that bridgehead alkanes can undergo elimination, especially if the structure allows for it. So maybe each Br could leave, but since there are two Brs, perhaps a double elimination occurs.

Wait, what's the product when a dibromo compound reacts with KOH? Oh right, it's likely an E2 elimination, but in this case, since both leaving groups are on bridgehead positions, maybe each elimination leads to the formation of an alkene. But since it's 1,3-dibromo, the elimination would form a double bond between the two bridgehead carbons? But wait, double bonds in bridgehead positions are possible in norbornene systems, but adamantane is more rigid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydro
