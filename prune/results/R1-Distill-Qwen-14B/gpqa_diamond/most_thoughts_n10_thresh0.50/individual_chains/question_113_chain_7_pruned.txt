Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy. Let's try to break it down.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spec data. The options are all different chemical formulas, so I'll have to figure out which one fits all the given clues.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The absorption peaks are at 3000 cm^-1 (very broad), 1700, and 1650. Hmm, I remember that a broad peak around 3000 is usually from O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but a very broad peak might suggest something else. Oh right, O-H in carboxylic acids is usually broader and maybe around that region. Or maybe it's an alcohol, but the other peaks might help.

The 1700 peak is strong. That's a carbonyl group. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower than 1700. I think that might be an aromatic ring, like C=C stretching, or maybe conjugated carbonyl groups. Oh wait, another possibility is an amide, but I don't think that's one of the options.

Now the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means they're attached to a double bond. So the compound probably has a double bond, maybe an alkene or something like that.

The Mass Spec shows a fragment at m/z 45. I need to think about what fragments give 45. Common ones: maybe a ketone fragment like (CH3)2CO (which is acetone, m/z 58?), or perhaps a smaller fragment. Wait, 45 is the molecular ion for something like C3H7O maybe? Or perhaps it's a cleavage product. Alternatively, maybe a CH2 group with some oxygen? Let me think: 45 could be (CH2O) or something else. Wait, wait, 45 is the molecular weight for C3H7O? Let me calculate: C=12, H=1, O=
