Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is. 

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium relative to an observer in the laboratory. The setup is that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. Hmm, wait, same direction as the beam but moving towards the observer? Or is the glass moving in the same direction as the beam as observed from the lab? I need to clarify that. The wording says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, that's a bit conflicting. Oh, maybe the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass? Or perhaps the glass is moving in the direction the beam is going, and towards the observer. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of reference frames.

Wait, the key is that the glass is moving with velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. So the light beam is moving through the glass, which itself is moving in the same direction. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving with velocity v, and the light is inside the glass. 

Wait, but the speed of light in the glass is not c; it's c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n reduces the speed. So in the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is c
