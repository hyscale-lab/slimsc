Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The problem says that the operator is P, and it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each given by specific 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, right? So the general form of P along a direction n is P · n, where n is a unit vector. Since n is in the x-z plane, it can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), I think. Because in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane corresponds to θ being the angle from the z-axis and φ=0 (since it's in the x-z plane so no y-component).

So the operator P would be P · n = (P_x * sinθ) + (P_z * cosθ). Because the y-component of n is zero, so P_y doesn't contribute here.

Each component P_x, P_y, P_z is (ħ/2) multiplied by their respective matrices. Let me write those down:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So when we compute P · n, it's (ħ/2)(sinθ * P_x + cosθ * P_z).

Putting it all together, the matrix form of P · n would be:

Let me compute each part. Let's factor out (ħ/2):

P · n = (ħ/2) * [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Adding the matrices:

First row: [ (sinθ * 0 + cosθ * 1), (sinθ * 1 + cosθ * 0) ] → [cosθ, sinθ]
Second row: [ (sinθ * 1 + cosθ * 0), (sinθ * 0 + cosθ * (-1)) ] → [sinθ, -cosθ]

So the matrix becomes:

[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Wait, no wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the second row. Let me recalculate that. The first part is sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]], so the second row is [1,0] multiplied by sinθ. The second part is cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]], which in the second row is [0, -1] multiplied by cosθ. So adding sinθ*(1,0) and cosθ*(0,-1). So for the second row:

The first element is sinθ *1 + cosθ *0 = sinθ
The second element is sinθ * 0 + cosθ * (-1) = - cosθ
So the matrix is:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

So the operator P · n is (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix. Now, we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is (P · n) |ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>.

Let me denote the matrix as M. So M is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]], and the operator is (ħ/2) M. So the equation becomes:

(ħ/2) M |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

We can divide both sides by (ħ/2) to get M |v> = |v>.

So the matrix equation is:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

So the equations are:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a  →  (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
sinθ * a + (-cosθ) b = b → sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

We can write this as a system of two equations:

1. (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
2. sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Let me try to solve this system. Let's take equation 1:

(cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

Wait, but cosθ -1 is negative when cosθ is less than 1, which it is except when θ=0. Alternatively, maybe it's better to eliminate variables. Let me write both equations:

Equation 1: (cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Equation 2: sinθ a = (1 + cosθ) b → a = [ (1 + cosθ ) / sinθ ] b

Wait, because from equation 2:

sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b = 0 → sinθ a = (cosθ +1) b → a = [ (cosθ +1)/ sinθ ] b

So from equation 1, a is [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b. Let me write this as [ sinθ / ( (1 - cosθ) ) ] b.

Wait, I can rationalize sinθ/(1 - cosθ). Let me think, 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So sinθ/(1 - cosθ) = [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] / [2 sin²(θ/2)] ) = cos(θ/2)/ sin(θ/2) )= cot(θ/2).

Similarly, (cosθ +1) = 2 cos²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), so (cosθ +1)/ sinθ = [2 cos²(θ/2)] / [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) ] = [cos(θ/2)] / [ sin(θ/2) ) ] = cot(θ/2).

So both equations are consistent; they give a = cot(θ/2) b.

So a = [ cot(θ/2) ] b.

So the eigenvector can be written as [a, b]^T = [ cot(θ/2) b, b ]^T.

Let me factor out b: b [ cot(θ/2), 1 ]^T.

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [ cot(θ/2), 1 ]^T. But I probably should write in terms of sin and cos. Alternatively, to express it as a normalized vector.

Wait, but let's compute the normalization condition. The vector [a, b] must satisfy |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

Since a = cot(θ/2) b, let's let b = k, so a = cot(θ/2) k.

Then |a|^2 + |b|^2 = |k|^2 [ cot²(θ/2) + 1 ] = |k|^2 [ csc²(θ/2) ) ] = 1.

So |k| = sin(θ/2). Because csc(x) = 1/sin(x), so cot^2 +1 = csc^2.

So |k|^2 * csc^2(θ/2) = 1 → |k|^2 = sin^2(θ/2) → |k|= sin(θ/2).

So the vector becomes [ cot(θ/2) * sin(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, cot(θ/2) = cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2), so when multiplied by sin(θ/2), it's cos(θ/2).

So the vector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, that's interesting. So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T. Because:

a = cos(θ/2)
b = sin(θ/2)

So that the vector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but wait, why is that? Because when you have [ cot(theta/2), 1 ] and scale by sin(theta/2), you get [ (cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)) * sin(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Yes, that makes sense.

Now looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but let me check the options.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but the question says it's the normalized eigenvector, so the elements are just these.

Wait, but in the options, some have factors of sqrt(2/3) hbar, etc. Hmm, but wait, in the problem statement, the components of the eigenvectors are just the components of the vector, without any ħ factors, because the eigenvectors are dimensionless. Because the operator is in terms of ħ, but the eigenvectors are abstract vectors, so their components are just numbers.

So the correct answer would have components (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

Looking at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2))?

Wait, no, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). But wait, in my calculation, the vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but let me think about the phase. The eigenvectors are determined up to a phase, but since the problem asks for the normalized eigenvector, any global phase is arbitrary. So in the options, the presence of e^{i phi} could complicate things, but in our case, since the operator is Hermitian (as it's an observable), the eigenvectors are real in this case? Or are they?

Wait, no, because P is a spin operator, and in the direction n, the eigenvectors will have real components because the operator is Hermitian. Because P is Hermitian as it's an observable (spin component along a direction), so its eigenvectors are real for eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Wait, but wait—no, the eigenvectors can have complex phases, but for spin-1/2 systems, the eigenstates are typically expressed with complex components when the direction isn't aligned with the axes. Hmm, but in this case, the eigenvector we found is real, which makes sense because the matrix was real and symmetric, so its eigenvectors are real.

Wait, but the matrix M is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]. Is that symmetric?

Wait, yes, because the (1,2) and (2,1) elements are both sinθ. So yes, M is symmetric, hence Hermitian. So the eigenvectors are real.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But looking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches. Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors multiplied by hbar, but wait, the eigenvectors are dimensionless, so the options with hbar are probably incorrect.

Wait, but the options A and D have hbar multiplied into the components, which doesn't make sense because eigenvectors are dimensionless. So options A and D are likely incorrect.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which seems to be spherical coordinates, perhaps for a three-component vector, but our problem is two-dimensional, so that's not matching.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed as $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$, where $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$,
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$,
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$.

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the $P_y$ component does not contribute, and the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ simplifies to:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \, P_x + \cos\theta \, P_z \right).
\]

Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, we compute:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \right) \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, we solve the matrix equation:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

1. $(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0$,
2. $\sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0$.

From these, we find that $a = \cot(\theta/2) b$. Substituting into the normalization condition $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$, we find:

\[
|b|^2 \left( \cot^2(\theta/2) + 1 \right) = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad |b| = \sin(\theta/2).
\]

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes $\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect since eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: Represents spherical coordinates but is not applicable to the two-dimensional problem.
- **Option C**: Matches the derived eigenvector $\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$.
- **Option D**: Includes incorrect normalization factors and $\hbar$, which is inconsistent with the problem.

The correct answer is **Option C**.

Answer: C
