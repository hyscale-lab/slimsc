Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativistic mechanics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) needed to accelerate a nucleus X to 0.96 times the speed of light (c). The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li-6 maybe, because Li usually has 3 protons and if it has 3 neutrons, that's a mass number of 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

I remember that the energy required to accelerate a particle in a collider is related to its relativistic energy. The formula for the total energy of a particle is gamma times the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m0 c². But wait, the question asks for the energy of the collider, which I think refers to the kinetic energy provided to the nucleus. Or does it include the rest mass? I'm a bit confused about that. Oh wait, in particle accelerators, the kinetic energy is a significant part of the total energy, especially at high speeds.

Wait no, wait. When dealing with high speeds, the total energy is gamma times the rest energy. But the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) times the rest energy. So maybe the question is asking for the total energy, or just the kinetic. Let me read the question again: "What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider..." I think RHIC accelerators usually provide the kinetic energy to the particles. So perhaps I should compute the kinetic energy.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the units. The options are in GeV. So the rest mass of the nucleus will be important here. I need to calculate the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus and then find the total energy or kinetic energy based on the speed given.

First, I'll find the rest mass of the Li nucleus. Li-6 has 3 protons, 3 neutrons. Each proton is approximately 938 MeV/c², as I remember the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². Neutrons are slightly heavier, about 939.565 MeV/c². Wait, but maybe for simplicity, since the number of protons and neutrons are the same (3 each), perhaps we can use the average or just take the mass of a nucleon as approximately 938 MeV/c² each. Or maybe I should calculate each separately.

Wait, let's get precise. The mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li-6, that's 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So total rest mass energy (m0 c²) is (3 * 938.272 + 3 * 939.565) MeV.

Let me calculate that. 3*(938.272 + 939.565) = 3*(1877.837) = 5633.511 MeV. Oh wait, that's 5.633511 GeV.

Wait, but wait a minute. Because when you have a nucleus, the mass is slightly less than the sum of individual nucleons due to binding energy. Oh, wait, no, the rest mass of the nucleus is the sum minus the mass defect (which is converted to binding energy). So the actual mass is less than the sum. But for this problem, I think we're supposed to approximate it using the sum of the individual protons and neutrons. Because otherwise, we'd need to know the exact binding energy, which isn't provided here. So perhaps the problem expects me to use the sum of the nucleon masses, ignoring the mass defect.

So, proceeding with that, m0 c² is approximately 5.6335 GeV.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 3 protons and 3 neutrons add up to 6
