Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these two reactions. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is taking 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and using reagent B (with H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So that's acetone. And NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, acetone is a ketone, so it can undergo a similar reaction to aldehydes but maybe less reactive. But in this case, the product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. So maybe it's a cyanohydrin formation?

Cyanohydrin formation occurs when a ketone reacts with CN- in a basic solution. The mechanism is that the cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon, and then the oxygen becomes an -O- group, which can then get protonated. But wait, the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's write that structure: it's (CH3)C(OH)(CN)CH2CH3? Or wait, the formula is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think: butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding a cyanide would add CN to the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen would get a proton. So the product would have a hydroxyl group and a cyanide group on the same carbon as the original carbonyl.

So for the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. The reagent A would be providing the conditions for the cyanide to attack. I think in this case, the reaction is done under acidic conditions. Because I remember that the cyanohydrin formation typically uses an acid catalyst. So maybe A is H3O+? Because NaCN is a good source of CN- in a solution. So when you add H3O+ (acid), it would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, facilitating the attack by CN-.

So for the first part, A is probably H3O+.

Now the second reaction: the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. That's a bit of a mouthful. So the structure would have a nitrile group (CN) attached to a carbon that also has a hydroxyl group (OH) and some benzyl groups. So the starting material is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached. The product is a carboxylic acid: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group has been converted into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, how does that happen? So nitrile to carboxylic acid. I think that typically involves hydrolysis. The nitrile group (RCN) can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions to a carboxylic acid (RCOOH). But what conditions are needed?

Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be done under acidic or basic conditions. If it's done under acidic conditions, like with H2SO4 and heat, maybe. Or sometimes in HCl with water. Alternatively, in basic conditions, like with NaOH and then acid workup.

Looking at the reaction, reagent B is used with H2O. So it's probably a hydrolysis reaction. So for the second step, reagent B is likely an acid catalyst, like HCl. Because the product is a carboxylic acid. Or maybe another acid like CH3COOH.

Wait, the second reaction is between the nitrile and H2O, and reagent B. So the reaction is hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. Let me think about the conditions. One common method is to treat nitriles with H2O in the presence of an acid catalyst. For example, using H2SO4 as a catalyst. Alternatively, another acid like HCl can be used.

Looking at the options, for the second part, B is either HCl, CH3COOH, etc. So in the options, after the nitrile is hydrolyzed, you get the acid. So the reagent B must be something that provides the acidic conditions for the hydrolysis.

But wait, in the first reaction, we used H3O+ as A. So if A is H3O+, which is probably the same as HCl (since H3O+ is generated from HCl), then for the second reaction, the reagent B would be something else.

Wait, but the options are A and B as separate reagents. Let me look at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+; B = HCl

Option B: A = H3O+; B = CH3COOH

Option C: A = NaHSO3; B = HCl

Option D: A = NaHSO3; B = CH3COOH.

Wait, but in the first reaction, the reagent A is probably H3O+ to create the acidic conditions for the cyanide attack. So options A and B have that. Now for the second reaction, the reagent B is either HCl or acetic acid.

When you hydrolyze a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, you can do it under acidic conditions. So say using HCl in water. Or maybe using another acid, like acetic acid as a catalyst. But I think HCl is a stronger acid and would work better here. Also, if the nitrile is part of a more complex molecule, perhaps a stronger acid is needed to protonate the nitrile group and facilitate the hydrolysis.

Wait, but wait—another approach. The nitrile could also be converted via an intermediate. For example, nitrile hydrolysis can go through an amide or a ketone. Wait, no. Let me think again: Nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic conditions to carboxylic acids. For that, HCl is often used. Alternatively, another acid could be used, but HCl is more likely.

So for the second step, B would be HCl. So looking at the options, option A has B as HCl, and option C has B as HCl but A is NaHSO3. But wait, earlier I thought A is H3O+, which is option A or B. So the first reaction uses H3O+ (A is H3O+), second reaction uses HCl (B=HCl). So that would be option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but let me double-check. The first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin, which requires acid catalysis. So A is H3O+ (so either option A or B). The second reaction is hydrolysis of nitrile to acid, which can be done with HCl as a catalyst. So B would be HCl, which is option A.

But wait, looking at the product of the second reaction, it's 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid, which has a hydroxyl group and a carboxylic acid on the same carbon. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait: butanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2COOH, but the structure here is 2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the OH and COOH are on adjacent carbons? Or the same carbon? No, but the product is 2-hydroxybutanoic acid, meaning that the COOH is on carbon 1, and the OH is on carbon 2. Wait, but the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, which is (CH2)3CN with an OH on the same carbon as the CN. Wait, no, the starting material for the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the structure would be:

Ph-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CN ?

Wait, maybe I should draw it. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The key is that the nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid. So the reaction's conditions must involve hydrolysis.

So reagent B is likely an acid. So if the options are HCl or acetic acid as B, which is more likely for nitrile hydrolysis?

In the lab, nitriles are hydrolyzed using concentrated HCl under reflux. So B would be HCl. So the correct option would be A: A=H3O+ (from HCl perhaps), B=HCl.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, in the first reaction, the reagent is NaCN and A. If A is H3O+, that's HCl providing H3O+? Or is A another acid? Or perhaps A is a different reagent. Wait, NaCN is a soluble salt. If A is H3O+, that could be generated by adding HCl. Alternatively, perhaps other acids like H2SO4 can also be used, but the options only give H3O+ or NaHSO3 as A.

Wait, but NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. What is that used for? I think bisulfite is used for the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols. Wait, but that's more in the context of pinacol or other reductions. Or perhaps in the case of conjugated carbonyl groups.

Wait, but in the first reaction, the product is a cyanohydrin. So the conditions are acid-catalyzed. So A must be an acid, like H3O+.

So option A is A=H3O+ and B=HCl.

But wait, looking at the options, option A says B=HCl. So that seems to fit the second reaction.

But wait, the second reaction is with H2O and reagent B. So is B HCl? So in the presence of HCl, the nitrile would hydrolyze to the acid. Yeah, that makes sense.

So putting it all together: for the first reaction, A is H3O+ (so option A or B). Second reaction, B is HCl (so option A or C).

Looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. So that seems correct.

Wait, but let me think about the other options. Option D has B as CH3COOH. Could that work? I think it's possible, but I'm not sure if acetic acid is strong enough. Nitrile hydrolysis usually requires a strong acid, like HCl, to proceed efficiently. So HCl as B is more likely.

So going back, the correct answer should be option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one (acetone) and NaCN. This reaction requires acidic conditions to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic and facilitating the nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (acid) is the appropriate reagent for this step, as it provides the necessary acidic environment.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid typically requires acidic conditions, and HCl is a strong acid commonly used for this purpose. While acetic acid (CH₃COOH) can also act as an acid catalyst, HCl is more effective for this reaction due to its stronger acidity.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH is less suitable for the second reaction compared to HCl.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction, as it is typically used for reductions or other specific reactions, not cyanohydrin formation.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Both reagents are incorrect for their respective reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.
