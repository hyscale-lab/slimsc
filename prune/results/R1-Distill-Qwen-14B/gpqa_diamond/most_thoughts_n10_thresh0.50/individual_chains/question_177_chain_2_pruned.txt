Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the solution. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars. Star 1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star 2, and the same goes for their masses. From spectroscopy, the wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, and their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star 1 and 2 respectively. We're supposed to find the factor by which Star 1's luminosity is greater than Star 2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. So, I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So, L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

Wait, the problem says they appear brightest at the same wavelength. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 = T2.

So if both stars have the same temperature, then when we calculate the luminosity ratio, the T terms will cancel out. Because L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) = (R1² / R2²) * (T1/T2)^4. But since T1 = T2, the ratio becomes (R1 / R2)^2.

Wait, R1 is 1.5 times R2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1/R2 is 1.5. Squaring that gives (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1/L2 would be 2.25, right?

But wait, the options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23. So A is 2.25. So why are there
