Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm just starting to learn about titrations and pH calculations. But I'll take it step by step.

The question says: We have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I need to figure out what's happening at each of these points. Let's break it down.

Wait, so the initial solution is made by diluting 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH3COOH) with 20 cm³ of water. That makes the total volume 40 cm³, right? So the concentration changes because we're adding more volume without adding more solute.

So, the concentration after dilution: I remember the formula M1V1 = M2V2. M is molarity, V is volume.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. M2 is what we're looking for, and V2 is 40 cm³. So, 0.05 * 20 = M2 * 40. Let me calculate that: 0.05 * 20 is 1, so M2 = 1 /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when we titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At 25% titration, that means we've added 25% of the NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point. So I need to find the volume of NaOH at 25% and then find the pH based on that.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of moles. Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. Volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters. Molarity is 0.025 M, so moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol.

At equivalence point, the moles of NaOH needed would be the same as moles of acetic acid. Because each mole of acetic acid reacts with one mole of NaOH. So moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 mol. Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M, so Volume = moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 liters, which is 10 cm³.

But the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So, moles of NaOH added = 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Wait, wait. Wait, 2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 liters. So 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol of NaOH. Oh wait, no—wait, 0.1 M is moles per liter. So 0.1 * (2.5 /1000) liters is 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mol.

So the moles of NaOH added are 0.00025 mol. Since the reaction is 1:1, that's 0.00025 mol of acetic acid neutralized, producing 0.00025 mol of acetate ion (CH3COO^-).

So in the solution, the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol. After adding 0.00025 mol of NaOH, the moles of acetic acid become 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And the moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) would be 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total volume now is the diluted acid solution (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added (2.5 cm³). So total volume is 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations would be:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ let's calculate that. 0.00075 / 0.0425. Hmm, 0.00075 is 7.5e-4, 0.0425 is 4.25e-2. 7.5e-4 / 4.25e-2 = (7.5 /42.5) * 0.01. 7.5/42.5 is approximately 0.17647. So 0.17647 * 0.01 = 0.0017647 M.

And [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0
