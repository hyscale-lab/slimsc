Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let's see what it's asking. The question gives me a Lagrangian for the interaction between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf f-bar ψf (y) (υ + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, I'm not too sure about the notation, but I think λ is the coupling constant, and ψf represents fermions of different types.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different possible decay channels.

I remember that for a particle to decay into another particle pair, the total energy must be sufficient. So the mass of X must be greater than or equal to twice the mass of each of the decay products. Also, the decay must conserve charge, baryon number, lepton number, etc.

Looking at the Lagrangian, the interaction term seems to be λff X ψf ψf. Wait, the interaction is X ψf ψf, so X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs. That means X can decay into any fermion and antifermion pair that it can couple to, provided the mass allows it.

Now, which fermions are available? The fermions are probably quarks and leptons. Let me think about their masses.

The fermions and their approximate masses (in GeV/c²):

- electrons (e): ~0.0005
- muons (μ): ~0.105
- taus (τ): ~1.777
- up quarks (u): around 2.2 MeV (so negligible, since 2.2e-3 GeV)
- down quarks (d): around 4.7 MeV (~0.0047 GeV)
- strange quarks (s): ~95 MeV (~0.095 GeV)
- charm quarks (c): ~1.27 GeV
- bottom quarks (b): ~4.5 GeV
- top quarks (t): ~173 GeV
- neutrinos (ν): ~0.0000002 GeV, so they're basically massless.

Wait, but the problem says it's X → fermion-antifermion. So let's see which fermions are light enough such that 2m_fermion ≤ 6 GeV.

Looking at each option:

Option A: X→ b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+, tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, wait. Let's compute 2m for each:

- b: mass ~4.5 GeV, so 2*4.5 =9 GeV. X is 6 GeV, which is less than 9. So decay into b b-bar is not allowed. So option A includes b b-bar which is impossible. So A can't be correct.

Option B: X→ c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Check 2m for each:

c: ~1.27 GeV, 2*c is ~2.54 GeV. 6 GeV > 2.54, so allowed.

s: 0.095 GeV each, 2*0.095=0.19 GeV. So allowed.

u: negligible, 2u is ~0.0044 GeV, allowed.

d: 0.0094 GeV each, so 2*0.0094≈0.0188 GeV. Allowed.

tau: 1.777 GeV, 2*1.777=3.554 GeV. 6 > 3.554, allowed.

mu: ~0.105 GeV each, 2*0.105=0.21 GeV. Allowed.

e: negligible, allowed.

So all these decay products are possible. So option B looks possible.

Option C: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, t t-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, top quark is 173 GeV. 2*m_t would be 346 GeV. X's mass is 6 GeV, so 6 < 346. So decay into t t-bar is impossible. So option C can't be correct.

Option D: X→ b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Again, 2*m_b is 9 GeV, which is more than X's mass. So D is incorrect.

So looking back, only option B has decay channels that are allowed.

Wait, but wait a second. What about the coupling in the Lagrangian? The interaction term is X ψf ψf. So which fermions can X decay into?

The problem states that the interaction is given by the Lagrangian, so X couples to any fermion ψf. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that the Lagrangian allows, as long as the energy is there.

But are the fermions in the Lag
