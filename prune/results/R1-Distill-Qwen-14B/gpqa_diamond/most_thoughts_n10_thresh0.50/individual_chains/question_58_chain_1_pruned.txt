Okay, so I've got this question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, right? Divergences are those infinities that pop up in calculations, which are unphysical, so you need a way to handle them.

The question is asking which theory doesn't require regularization when dealing with high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Let me think about each option. 

Starting with D) Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, that's the non-quantum version. Classical theories don't deal with the same kinds of infinities as quantum theories. Because in classical electromagnetism, even though you get things like infinite charge densities at point charges, those are handled differently. But wait, do they require regularization? I'm not sure. I think regularization is a quantum field theory concept, so maybe classical theories don't need it. But I'm not certain.

Option C) QED. I remember that QED is a quantum theory that's renormalizable. It does have divergences, so it requires regularization and renormalization. But wait, is it always necessary? I think yes because of the loop diagrams and the infinities that come up. So QED does need regularization.

Option B) QCD. That's the theory of the strong interaction. QCD is also a quantum field theory and has issues with things like Landau poles, right? Wait, no, actually, QCD
