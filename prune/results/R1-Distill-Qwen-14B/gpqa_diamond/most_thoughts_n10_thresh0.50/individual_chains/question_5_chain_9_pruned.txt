Okay, let me try to work through this problem. Hmm, so the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are used to represent the components of spin operators. The operator P here seems to be a spin operator because it's given in terms of Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. So, the components P_x, P_y, and P_z are each proportional to the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z respectively.

The direction n is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane, which means the direction can be described using polar coordinates where θ is the angle from the z-axis and φ is the angle in the x-y plane. But since it's in x-z, I think φ is either 0 or π, so maybe that's why phi is involved in the options.

Wait, the eigenvector is along an arbitrary direction, so we probably need to express it in terms of spherical coordinates. Oh, but wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so we're dealing with the up state along that direction.

The operator P is given for each component. The spin operator in an arbitrary direction is a combination of these components. So the operator along n would be P · n, which is the sum of each P component multiplied by the corresponding component of n. 

Let me denote the direction vector n as (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since n is in the x-z plane, φ must be 0 or π, right? Because the x-z plane implies that the y-component is zero. So, φ is 0, so n is along the x-z plane, so the direction can be written as n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Wait, no, wait. Wait, when φ=0, the direction is along the x-axis. But if n is in x-z, φ could be 0 or 90, but wait, no, in x-z plane, the angle φ is 0 or 180 degrees, because the y-component is zero. So, n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Hmm, but wait, actually, the spherical coordinates have θ from the z-axis, so for the x-z plane, the direction is (sinθ * cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But if the direction is in x-z, then sinθ sinφ must be zero because the y-component is zero. So, either sinθ=0 (which would be the z-axis) or sinφ=0, which means φ=0 or π. So, for the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π. So, n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) when φ=0, or (-sinθ, 0, cosθ) when φ=π? Or maybe it's (sinθ cosφ, 0, cosθ), but wait, no. Wait, maybe I got the spherical coordinates wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the direction in the x-z plane can be simply parameterized using θ, the angle from the z-axis, and considering that the x-component is proportional to sinθ, and the z-component is cosθ, with no y-component. So, n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Yes, that makes sense.

The spin operator along n is then P · n = P_x (n_x) + P_z (n_z) because n_y is zero. Since P_x is (ħ/2) σ_x, and P_z is (ħ/2) σ_z. So,

P · n = (ħ/2) (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

Substituting n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ,

P · n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ]

Now, the eigenvalue equation is (P · n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ> because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

So, the equation becomes [ sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ] |ψ> = |ψ> .

Wait, wait, no. Because (P · n) is (ħ/2) times [ ... ], so to set up the equation:

(ħ/2) [ sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ> 

So I can divide both sides by ħ/2:

[ sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ] |ψ> = |ψ> 

So, the operator is [ sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ].

We can write this operator as a matrix. σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_z is [[1,0
