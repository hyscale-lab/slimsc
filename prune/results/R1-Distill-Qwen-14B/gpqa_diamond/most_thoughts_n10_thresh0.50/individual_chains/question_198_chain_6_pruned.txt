Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 10^-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I need to understand what these stability constants mean. Stability constants, or formation constants, measure how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

The complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n^2−n, where n is the number of SCN- ligands attached. The stability constants given are for the complexes with n=1,2,3,4. Wait, but the β values are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, β4 is lower than β3. That's interesting. Maybe the most stable is the [Co(SCN)_3]^- complex, since β3 is the highest.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2-} I think.

Wait, but wait. The complexes are Co(SCN)_n^(2−n). For n=1, it would be Co(SCN)^(+), since 2-1=1+. For n=2, it's Co(SCN)_2^(0), neutral. n=3: Co(SCN)_3^-1. n=4: Co(SCN)_4^2−.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the charges here. Let me think.

The Co^2+ ion has a +2 charge. Each SCN- is -1. So for n ligands, the charge would be 2+ + n*(-1) = 2 -n. So the complex would have a charge
