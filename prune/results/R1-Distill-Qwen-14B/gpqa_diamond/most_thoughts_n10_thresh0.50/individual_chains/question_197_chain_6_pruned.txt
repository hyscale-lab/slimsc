Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the final product after Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Let's start by going through the given data step by step.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But since there's no amine in the options, it's probably an O-H group. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound probably has a benzene ring.

Next, the 1H NMR data. Starting with the downfield regions: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H). That's a singlet, broad, which is typical for an aldehyde proton. Wait, but wait, no, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but a broad peak could also be from an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. But if it's an aldehyde, then another peak. Let me think. No, wait, another possibility is an enol proton, but that's less likely. Alternatively, maybe it's a phenolic OH, but those are usually broader and sometimes split into exchange peaks, but maybe the 10.5 is an aldehyde.

Looking at the next peak: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). In aromatic regions, a doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. Similarly, 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) is another doublet, which might be the para-substituted aromatic protons. So this suggests a para-substituted benzene, maybe with two substituents. Wait, but wait, maybe it's a single substituent as a para group. Wait, the two doublets could be from substitution patterns. For example, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents in para positions, but that seems unusual. Alternatively, a single substituent that's in the para position, causing the doublets. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a substituent that has ortho, meta, para positions? Wait, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Let's think. For example, if there's a substituent at the para position that leads to two doublets. Or maybe it's a substituent with two protons that are each coupled. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ethyl group or something else.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a methylene adjacent to an oxygen or maybe a branching point. 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be a methylene next to a carbonyl group or part of a chain. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)—a triplet of three protons, which could be a methyl group attached to a carbon adjacent to another group, like in an isopropyl group. 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, probably part of an ethyl chain.

Putting this together: We have a benzene ring, possibly para-substituted, with some substituent. The substituent could be connected to a carbonyl group, as indicated by the IR peak at 1720. So maybe it's a ketone or an ester.

Wait, but the IR also has the 3400-2500, which could be an O-H stretch, but if the compound is reacting with red phosphorus and HI, that's a typical reaction for the hydrolysis of an ester or maybe a nitrile. Wait, red phosphorus and HI is often used to hydrolyze nitriles, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's used in the hydrolysis of esters, but
