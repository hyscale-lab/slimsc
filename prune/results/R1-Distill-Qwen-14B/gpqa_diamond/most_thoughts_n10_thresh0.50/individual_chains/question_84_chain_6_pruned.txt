Okay, so I have this question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. The question is about the key factor that allows converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, specifically when using a matrix exponential function approximated by a fractional approximation.

Hmm, let me think. I remember that solving partial differential equations numerically often involves discretizing the equations, leading to large systems of linear equations. For heat equations, which are parabolic PDEs, finite difference methods are common. Higher order approximations would mean using more accurate difference schemes, which might involve larger stencils or higher derivatives.

Now, the mention of matrix exponential function suggests that the solution involves something like the exponential of a matrix. Because for linear systems, especially those that can be written in the form du/dt = Au, where A is a matrix, the solution is u(t) = e^(At)u0. Matrix exponentials are a way to solve such systems.

Parallel splitting, I think, refers to decomposing the problem into smaller parts that can be computed simultaneously. So if we can split the matrix A into parts that can be exponentiated separately, we can compute them in parallel and then combine the results. This would convert a sequential algorithm into a parallel one.

But the question says the matrix exponential is approximated by a fractional approximation. Fractional approximation methods, like Padé approximants, are used to approximate functions (here, the matrix exponential) with rational functions. These approximations can sometimes be split into components that are easier to handle in parallel.

Stability analysis (Option A) is important in ensuring that the numerical method doesn't produce unbounded or oscillating solutions, but I'm not sure if it's directly related to the conversion to a parallel algorithm. Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions (Option B) might affect the setup of the problem but again, not necessarily the parallelism aspect.

Options C and D involve properties of the fractional approximation. Complex roots (C) might relate to the invertibility or the structure of the matrix, but how does that tie into parallelism? Linear partial fraction (D) sounds like it could be about decomposing the approximation into simpler fractions that can be processed in parallel.

Wait, when you have a fractional approximation like a Padé approximant, it can sometimes be written as a sum of simpler fractions. If each term can be evaluated independently, then each could be computed on a different processor. That would make the algorithm parallel.

So, if the fractional approximation can be split into partial fractions, each part can be handled in a parallel way. That would make the key factor the linear partial fraction of the fractional approximation. So option D?

Alternatively, complex roots might complicate things, perhaps leading to more involved computations, but I'm not sure how that would directly enable parallelism.

Another angle: the idea behind parallel splitting in the context of solving linear systems is often related to domain decomposition or operator splitting. For operator splitting, you split the matrix A into two or more parts, say A = A1 + A2, and then approximate e^A as e^{A1}e^{A2} or some product of exponentials of the individual parts. This way, each exponential can be computed in parallel.

But how does this relate to the fractional approximation? Well, the matrix exponential e^A is being approximated by a fractional function, which might involve multiple terms that can be split. If the approximation allows for such a splitting, then you can compute each part in parallel.

Wait, the question says the key factor is converting sequential into parallel. So it's about how the approximation method allows for this conversion.

If the approximation is a linear combination (partial fractions), each term can be computed in parallel. So perhaps option D, linear partial fraction, is the key.

Alternatively, maybe the method involves a splitting of the matrix into components that can be exponentiated separately, which could relate to the structure of the approximation.

But I'm a bit shaky. Another approach: stability analysis (A) is important for the method's correctness but not directly about parallelism. Nonlocal boundary conditions
