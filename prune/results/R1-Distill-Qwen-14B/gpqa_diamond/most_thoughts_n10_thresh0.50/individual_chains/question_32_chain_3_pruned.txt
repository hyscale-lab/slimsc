Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and figuring out the energy required to make a nucleus move at 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle depends on its gamma factor, which is the Lorentz factor. Let me think step by step.

First, the nucleus in question is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons. So if it's Li-6, because 3 protons and 3 neutrons make 6 nucleons. Or wait, maybe I should double-check the mass number. Oh right, Li normally is Li-7, but if it's 3 neutrons, then maybe it's Li-6? Because Li has 3 protons, adding 3 neutrons gives mass number 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

Next, the speed is given as 0.96c. I need to find the total energy of the nucleus. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c². So I need to calculate gamma for v = 0.96c.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Let me compute that. So v is 0.96c, so v² is (0.96)^2 c², which is 0.9216 c². Then, 1 - that is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate that. Oh, wait, 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 which is approximately 3.571428... So about 3.5714.

So gamma is roughly 3.5714.

Now, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass number A is 6. Wait, but wait, Li-6 has 3 protons, 3 neutrons, so A=6. The mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is approximately 938 MeV/c². So the rest mass of the nucleus is 6 * 938 MeV = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, the mass of the nucleus isn't exactly 6 times the mass of a nucleon because of binding energy. Oh but in particle physics, when we're dealing with high-energy scenarios, sometimes they approximate the mass as the sum of the individual nucleons. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. Alternatively, the exact mass might be needed, but I don't have that information. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects us to use the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the individual nucleons. So each nucleon is about 938 MeV/c². So 6 nucleons would be 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

So m0 c² is 5.628 GeV.

So the total energy E is gamma multiplied by m0 c². So gamma is approximately 3.5714, so 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 * 5.628 ≈ ?

Let me compute 3.5714 * 5.628:

Compute 3 *5.628 =16.884

0.5714 *5.628 ≈ let's see, 0.5 *5.628=2.814, 0.0714 *5.628 ≈ ~0.4032. So total is about 2.814 + 0.4032=3.2172.

So total E ≈16.884 +3.2172=20.1012 GeV.

Wait, but let me be more precise. Because 3.5714 is approximately 3 + 0.5714.

Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to compute 3.5714 *5.628.

Let me compute 3.5714 *5.628:

3.5714 *5
