Okay, so I've got this question about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in stars, the photosphere is the layer we see, and it's where most of the light is emitted. The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming LTE, which is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So that means I can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in different energy states to temperature. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). Here, n_i is the number of atoms in the excited state, n_j is the ground state. Since the energy difference is given, E_i - E_j is positive, let's call it delta E.

In this case, the problem states that the excited state in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. Let me think: wait, actually, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe it's the ratio of the excited atoms to the ground state? Or perhaps it's the ratio of the populations. Wait, the way it's phrased: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited". Maybe that refers to the ratio of
