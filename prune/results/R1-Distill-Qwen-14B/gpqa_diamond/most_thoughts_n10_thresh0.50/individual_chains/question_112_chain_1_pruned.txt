Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves an electron state and some operator. I need to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator and also calculate the average value of that operator.

Alright, let's start by breaking down the problem. The state vector is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, S_z. So, |up> corresponds to spin up, and |down> to spin down.

But wait, the operator in question isn't S_z. The operator has a matrix Aij where Aij is ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Oh, that's interesting. So, A is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write that out.

So, the operator's matrix is:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0  ]

Because when i≠j, the elements are ħ/2, and the diagonal elements are 0. So this is a Pauli matrix scaled by ħ/2, right? The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A would be (ħ/2) times the Pauli X.

Wait, but what's the operator representing? Oh, I think it's the spin-x operator. Because the spin matrices are usually proportional to the Pauli matrices. So, for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operators are S_x = ħ/2 σ_x, S_y = ħ/2 σ_y, and S_z = ħ/2 σ_z. So, in this case, the operator is probably S_x, since its matrix has off-diagonal elements.

So, the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of S_x. Those are the |+x> and |-x> states. The eigenvalues would be ± ħ/2, I believe.

So, the problem is asking for the probability that a measurement of this operator (probably S_x) gives each eigenvalue, and the average value.

But wait, the state is given in the z-basis. So, first I need to express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of the operator. Because when you express the state in the eigenbasis of an operator, the coefficients give the probabilities directly.

Alternatively, I can compute the eigenstates of the operator and then project |alpha> onto each eigenstate.

So, let's outline the steps:

1. Normalize the given state |alpha>, because it's given as proportional. So find the normalization factor.

2. Find the eigenstates of the operator A (which is S_x, I think). Let's call them |+x> and |-x>.

3. Express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

4. The coefficients in this expansion will give the amplitudes, whose squared magnitudes are the probabilities.

5. Then, the average value is the expectation value of the operator A, which can be calculated as <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is expressed in the eigenbasis of A, the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

Wait, so let me proceed step by step.

First, normalize |alpha>. The given state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The norm is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

Compute the norm:

|(1+i)|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|(2 - i)|² = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.

So the norm squared is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalized state is (1+i)/√7 |up> + (2 -i)/√7 |down>.

So now, the state |alpha> is (1+i)/√7 |up> + (2 -i)/√7 |down>.

Next, find the eigenstates of the operator A. The matrix of A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. The eigenvalues of this matrix can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λ I)=0.

The matrix A is 2x2, so the eigenvalues are:

det( [ -λ   ħ/2 ]
     [ ħ/2  -λ ] ) = 0

The determinant is λ² - (ħ/2)^2 = 0. So λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, as expected.

Now, the eigenstates. For λ = ħ/2:

(A - (ħ/2) I ) |v> = 0.

The matrix becomes:

[ -ħ/2   ħ/2  ]
[ ħ/2  -ħ/2 ]

Which simplifies to: rows are [ -1 1 ] and [1 -1], if we factor out ħ/2.

So the equations are: (-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → -v1 + v2 =0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenstate is any vector where v1 = v2. So, for example, (1,1) or (1,1)/sqrt(2) as a unit vector.

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2, the matrix becomes:

[ ħ/2   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  ħ/2 ]

Which gives (ħ/2)(v1 + v2)=0 → v1 = -v2.

So, the corresponding eigenstate is (1, -1) or (1, -1)/sqrt(2) as a unit vector.

So the eigenstates of A are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/√2 and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/√2.

Wait, wait, no. Let me double-check. Because when I have A as (ħ/2) σ_x, the eigenstates are indeed |+x> and |-x>.

Alternatively, I can write them in terms of |up> and |down>.

So, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. Because the standard |+x> is (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) for qubits. So in the spin-
