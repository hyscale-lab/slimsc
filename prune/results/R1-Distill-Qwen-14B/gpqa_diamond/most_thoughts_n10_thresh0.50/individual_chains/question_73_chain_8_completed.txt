Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem states: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, first things first, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting in classical mechanics. Oh right, because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, we can't just use v_rel = v1 - v2. I remember there's a formula for relativistic velocity addition.

The formula for relative velocity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me get that right. So in this case, since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So (0.1c)/0.7 is approximately 0.1428c. So about 0.14c. Looking at the options, I see options C and D have 0.14c as their relative speed. So the relative speed part is probably one of those two.

Now, the energy part. The total energy of the system would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - (v²/c²))).

So for the first astronaut with mass 2m and speed 0.6c. Let's calculate gamma for him. v = 0.6c, so v²/c² = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Next, the second astronaut has mass 3m and speed 0.5c. v²/c² is 0.25, so 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660, so gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. E2 = 1.1547 * 3m * c². Let me compute that: 1.1547 * 3 is approximately 3.464. So E2 ≈ 3.464 mc².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 = about 5.964 mc². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option B has E=4.96 mc², which is lower. So the correct energy is about 5.96, which matches option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the energy calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in the gamma values.

First astronaut: 2m, 0.6c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc². Correct.

Second astronaut: 3m, 0.5c.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 *3 m c² = approx 3.464 mc². Adding to E1: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc², which rounds to 5.96. So option C has that: 5.96 mc² and 0.14c.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and the total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relativistic formula for relative velocity is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### Energy of the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\) and the total energy is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96mc^2\)**.
