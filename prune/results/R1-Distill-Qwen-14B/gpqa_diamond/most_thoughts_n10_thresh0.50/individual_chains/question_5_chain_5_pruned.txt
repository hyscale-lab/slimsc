Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see... The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Hmm, first, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like spin are represented by Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Each component (X, Y, Z) has its own matrix. The operator P here is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So n is a vector in the x-z plane, meaning its direction can be described using an angle θ from the z-axis, right?

Wait, the direction is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. So I think I can parameterize the direction using an angle θ. Because being in the x-z plane, the angle would be measured from the z-axis towards the x-axis. So the unit vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) in Cartesian coordinates. Or wait, no, maybe (sinθ, 0, cosθ)? Because in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So yeah, n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

Now, the operator P is given as the vector operator, so it's P = P_x X + P_y Y + P_z Z, right? Wait, no, the components are given. Wait, the problem gives me each component of the operator P: Px, Py, Pz. Each is ħ/2 times a matrix.

Let me list out what I have:

Px = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, so each of these is a 2x2 matrix for their respective components.

The operator we're interested in is the projection of P along n. Because the operator P in the direction n would be P·n, which is P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z.

But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P·n = n
