Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully to make sure I understand everything.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two stars, both with the same mass as each other, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The stars themselves have masses similar to our Sun, so I can probably treat them as solar-type stars.

The planets are in circular orbits. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom periodic shift in the spectral line of its host star. Planet #2's star shows a shift of 7 milliangstrom. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. The options are A to D, with numerical values.

Hmm, right. I remember that the radial velocity method detects the Doppler shift caused by the star's movement due to the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves in a small orbit around the system's center of mass, and this movement shifts the spectral lines. The size of the shift tells us about the planet's mass and orbit.

I think the key here is the formula relating the RV semi-amplitude (K) to the orbital period and other factors. The formula I vaguely recall is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / (c * (M_* + M_p)^(1/3)) ) * ( (1) / (a (1 - e²)^(1/2)) )) ) but wait, since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that term goes away. And since M_p is much smaller than M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so that simplifies the denominator.

Wait, maybe I should look for a more precise formula. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * P )^(-1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3)) ) ] * ( ( (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) ) )

But wait, M_p is much less than M_*, so 1 + M_p/M_* ≈ 1, so that term is about 1. So K simplifies to:

K ≈ [ (G / (P c) )^(1/3) ) ] * ( (M_p sin i) ) / (M_*^(2/3) ) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe another approach: I remember that the RV semi-amplitude depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit. But since both planets are detected, their inclinations are such that sin i is close to 1, so we can probably ignore any differences in inclination for this problem.

Given that both stars have the same mass (M1 = M2 = M_sun), and the planets have similar masses (so M_p1 ≈ M_p2 ≈ M_Neptune), but wait, wait! The problem states that both planets have masses similar to Neptune. So M_p1 ≈ M_p2. So that factor is the same for both.

So the only differences are the semi-amplitude shifts (K1 and K2) of 5 and 7 milliangstroms, respectively. Since K is inversely proportional to the orbital period, or some function of it.

Wait, the formula for K is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) c )

Wait, perhaps a better approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (27 * pi * G ) / (4 * c^3) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Alternatively, another version of the formula I've come across is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M
