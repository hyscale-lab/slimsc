Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question carefully.

So, Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. The question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the reaction between X and Y. Violent reaction often makes me think of things like metals reacting with acids, producing hydrogen gas. For example, metals like magnesium or zinc reacting with hydrochloric acid. But wait, the gas W has same number of protons and neutrons. Let me think: the simplest such gas would be H2O? No, wait, water is a liquid. Oh wait, maybe it's H2, but H2 has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So that's not equal. Or O2? O has 8 protons, and O2 would have 16. Wait, but that's the same as the number of protons and neutrons? Wait, O has atomic number 8, so protons=8. If it's O
