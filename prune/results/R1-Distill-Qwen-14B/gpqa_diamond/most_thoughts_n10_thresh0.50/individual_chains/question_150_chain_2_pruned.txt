Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then, it's reacted through three steps with specific reagents, and I need to find the final product from the options given.

First, let's look at the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Breaking that down, I can think about the possible functional groups. The N could be in an amine, amide, nitro group, etc. The O is likely part of a carbonyl or maybe an alcohol or ether. Hmm.

The NMR data is provided:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

I need to interpret this. Let me think about each peak.

The 9.72 ppm triplet (t, 1H) is probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, but wait, aldehydes have only one proton. So maybe it's a triplet from coupling with two adjacent protons. Hmm, like maybe adjacent to a CH2 group. For example, in a substituted acetaldehyde, where the aldehyde is connected to a CH2 group, which is next to another group.

Then, the aromatic regions: 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). This looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublets with 2H each suggest that two pairs of protons are present, each split into a doublet. So maybe two benzene rings, each with two protons as doublets. Or maybe one ring with four protons, but that doesn't fit as well.

Wait, maybe it's a substituted benzene with two substituents. Let's think about coupling. If a benzene ring has two substituents in the para positions, the protons on adjacent carbons would be coupled. But the 6.98 and 6.51 could be two rings, each with two protons as doublets. Alternatively, perhaps each ring is substituted in a way that gives these doublets.

The 6.27 ppm peak is a broad singlet (bs, 2H). Broad suggests possible exchange, maybe an -OH group, but the integration is 2H. Wait, or maybe it's an aromatic ring with two protons in a symmetrical position, maybe as part of a di-substituted ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl group adjacent to something else. Hmm.

The 3.66 ppm, a doublet integrating for 2H. That's around where CH2 groups adjacent to oxygen might appear. Like an OCH2 group. The doublet suggests coupling with another set of protons, maybe adjacent to a CH2 connected to something else. Or perhaps a CH2 next to a carbonyl
