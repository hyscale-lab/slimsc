Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that the brightness of a star as seen from Earth is crucial here. Both ESPRESSO and HIRES have different limits for how bright a star needs to be for them to observe it. From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, which means it can see stars up to 17th magnitude and brighter. HIRES, on the other hand, can only go down to 16 mag. So, any star that appears brighter than 16 mag can be seen by both? Or wait, no, because the ESPRESSO limit is higher (17 mag) than HIRES (16), so the overlapping region would be stars brighter than 16, because that's the stricter condition. Because if a star is brighter than 16, both can see it. But if a star is between 16 and 17, HIRES can't see it because it's fainter than 16, but ESPRESSO can. Wait, no, the question is about stars that can be detected by both. So the star must be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 mag for HIRES. So the more restrictive is 16 mag. So stars with apparent magnitude <= 16 can be detected by both.

Wait, but I need to make sure about the exact wording. The question says: 'stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed.' So for a star to be detected by both, it must be brighter than 17? No wait, no. Because if a star is brighter than 17, it's definitely brighter than 16. Because 17 is higher magnitude (dimmer) than 16. So stars with apparent V mag <=16 can be observed by both, because they're brighter than 16 (HIRES) and 17 (ESPRESSO). So if a star's apparent V mag is 16.0 or lower (brighter), both can detect it.

But wait, the question might be about apparent magnitude being less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. So for both, the star must be brighter than 17? No, no. Because ESPRESSO can see up to 17, but HIRES can only go up to 16. So any star brighter than 16 can be seen by both. Stars between 16 and 17 can be seen by ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

So the key is that the star's apparent V magnitude must be less than or equal to 16 (so that both can see it). Because anything brighter (i.e., lower magnitude) than 17 and 16 can be observed by both.

Now, let
