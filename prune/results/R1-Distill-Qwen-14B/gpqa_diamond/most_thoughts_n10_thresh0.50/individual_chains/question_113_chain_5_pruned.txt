Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully again.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

First, I'll break down each technique's data and see what they tell me about the structure.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The peaks are at 3000 (very broad), 1700, and 1650. Hmm. Broad peak around 3000 usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, a very broad peak could also be N-H, but the options don't have nitrogen, so probably O-H. 

The peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, likely a carbonyl group (C=O). Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl like in an aromatic ring. The 1650 peak is a bit lower than 1700. That might be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an aromatic ester or a conjugated ketone. Alternatively, maybe an amide, but again, the options don't have N. So maybe it's a carbonyl with conjugation, like an ester or ketone with adjacent double bonds.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like CH2=CH- groups. So the compound must have at least one double bond. But wait, the FTIR also has a 1700 cm^-1, which is a carbonyl. So perhaps an ester with a double bond nearby? Or maybe a ketone with a double bond in the structure. Also, the broad peak in IR suggests maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broader and around 2500-3300, but the FTIR here shows a peak at 3000. Hmm, is that possible?

Wait, let me think. A carboxylic acid has a very broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300, but maybe an alcohol's O-H is around 3300-3500. A very broad peak might suggest an alcohol, but sometimes it's a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether or something else, but I don't think so because the peak is broad, which is typical for O-H.

So, putting that aside for a moment, the Mass Spec shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. What's that? 45 is a common fragment. Let me think. The most common fragment at m/z 45 is the CH3CO+ ion, which comes from an acetyl group. But wait, wait. Let me calculate:
