Okay, so I have this physics question here, and I need to figure out the answer step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think. Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, right? Divergences are those situations where the calculations give infinite results, which obviously aren't physical, so we need ways to handle them.

So the question is about which theory doesn't need regularization when the energy scales are high. Wait, but I thought that most quantum field theories require some form of regularization. Maybe the difference is about which theories are already finite, meaning they don't have these divergences, so they don't need regularization.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I remember that string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, combining quantum mechanics with general relativity. Strings are one-dimensional objects, and they vibrate at different frequencies. String theory incorporates supersymmetry, which pairs bosons and fermions. Now, I think that in string theory, the perturbative expansion (like Feynman diagrams) can still have divergences, but I'm not sure if they require regularization. Wait, but I also heard that string theory doesn't have the same kind of divergences as in other quantum field theories because the underlying degrees of freedom are different. Or maybe it's because it's a background-dependent theory? Hmm, I'm not too certain about this. I'll have to think more.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I know that in QCD, at high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), the coupling constant becomes weaker, which is asymptotic freedom. But when you calculate loop diagrams (like in perturbation theory), you get divergent integrals. So to handle these, you need to regularize them, perhaps using methods like dimensional regularization or cutoff regularization. So QCD does require regularization. So option B is a theory that does require regularization, so it's not the answer.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, dealing with electrons and photons. I remember that QED is a renormalizable theory. But does that mean it doesn't require regularization? Wait, no. Renormalization is a process that deals with the divergences. But regularization is a step before renormalization. All quantum field theories that have divergences would need regularization. So QED calculations do result in divergent integrals, so regularization is needed. So option C is out.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh wait, this is different. Classical theories don't involve quantum mechanics. In classical electrodynamics, like Maxwell's equations, we don't have the same divergences that quantum theories have. Because in the classical case, you don't have issues with virtual particles or the vacuum fluctuations that cause these divergences. So when you calculate things in classical E&M, even at high energies, you don't get
