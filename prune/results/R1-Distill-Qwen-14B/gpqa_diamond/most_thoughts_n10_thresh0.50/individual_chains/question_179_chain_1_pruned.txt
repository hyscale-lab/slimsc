Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about quantum mechanics and matrices. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, matrices often represent operators, and certain properties are important like being Hermitian or unitary.

The question gives four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. And there are four options, A to D. I need to figure out which statement is correct.

Let me think about each option.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Wait, what do I know about the matrix exponential e^X? Well, for the norm to change when multiplied by e^X, that would mean that e^X is not unitary. Because unitary matrices preserve the norm of vectors. So if e^X is not unitary, then the norm would change for some vectors.

So when is e^X unitary? I think that if X is Hermitian, then e^X is unitary. Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think. If X is Hermitian, then X = X†, and e^X is unitary because (e^X)† = e^{X†} = e^X, so e^X is unitary. So if X is Hermitian, then e^X is unitary, which would mean that multiplying by it doesn't change the norm of any vector. So the statement in A would be false in that case.

But is X Hermitian? Let's check. X's elements: the matrix is given as:

X =
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

To check if X is Hermitian, we need to see if X equals its conjugate transpose, X†.

So let's find X†. The conjugate transpose is the transpose of the matrix with each element's complex conjugate.

Original X:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

Conjugate each element:
Row 1: -i, -1, -2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: -2i, -1, i

Transpose the matrix, which swaps rows and columns.

So transpose of X is:

Column 1 becomes Row 1: i, 1, 2i → becomes -i, 1, -2i (wait, no, transpose first, then conjugate?)

Wait, no. X† is the conjugate transpose. So first transpose, then take the conjugate.

Wait, let me write X as a matrix:

X =
Column 1: [i, 1, 2i]
Column 2: [-1, 0, -1]
Column 3: [2i, 1, -i]

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the matrix is:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2:
