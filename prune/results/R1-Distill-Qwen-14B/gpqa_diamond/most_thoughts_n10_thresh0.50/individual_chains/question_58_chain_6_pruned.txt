Okay, so I have this question about physical theories and regularization. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, which are like these infinities that pop up in calculations. So the question is asking which of these theories never needs regularization at high energies.

The options are A to D. Let me think about each one. 

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a type of quantum theory, right? It's supposed to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity. But wait, I'm not too sure about this. Do they need regularization? I remember that in string theory, especially the older ones like the bosonic string, there are issues with divergences, or maybe not. Or wait, maybe string theories don't require the same kind of regularization as other QFTs because they work with strings instead of point particles. Or perhaps they require less because they have a different approach. But I'm not certain.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD has something called asymptotic freedom, where at high energies (or equivalently, short distances), the coupling constant becomes small. So perturbative methods work well there. But I also remember that QCD calculations can still lead to divergences, so they probably use regularization methods like dimensional regularization or lattice methods. So QCD needs regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established quantum field theory. I think QED does have divergences, especially in loop diagrams. So they must use regularization techniques like the cutoff method or dimensional regularization. So QED requires regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh wait, this is the classical version, not quantum. Classical theories don't have the same issues as quantum ones because they don't deal with the same infinities. Like, in classical electromagnetism, you can have infinite charge densities or fields at points, but that's more about the mathematical model and not something that requires regularization. Since regularization is a quantum field theory tool to handle divergences, classical theories wouldn't need it. So D is probably the correct answer.

Wait, but wait. The question is about which theory never requires regularization. So all the QFTs would require it, but the classical one doesn't. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about string theory. I thought
