Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about identifying a compound based on its molecular formula and NMR data, and then determining the product after a series of reactions. Hmm, let's start by analyzing the given information.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. That's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. Wait, the degree of unsaturation might help here. Degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1 (but O doesn't count in this formula). So plugging in:

(2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1 ) /2 = (18-9)/2=9/2=4.5. Wait, that's not possible. Oh wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake. The formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2 where X is halogens, but here there are none. So:

(2*8 + 2 -9 +1)/2. Wait, wait, N is considered as +1? Wait, some sources say that each N adds 1, so yeah. So 18-9=9, plus 1 is 10, divided by 2 is 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That's either a ring plus multiple double bonds, or several rings and double bonds.

Now, looking at the NMR data. Let's list the peaks:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet around 9.7, which is a carbonyl proton, probably an aldehyde. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, maybe adjacent to a CH2 group? Because aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm.

Then, 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H): Those look like aromatic protons. The doublets each integrating for 2H could indicate a para-substituted benzene ring. Like two protons each as a doublet, typical of para-substituted rings. So maybe two phenyl groups attached somewhere.

Next, 6.27 (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, integrating for two hydrogens. That could be an enol proton, or maybe two adjacent protons on a double bond. But broad signals often suggest exchange, like an acidic proton, maybe an -OH group. Wait, but if it's a singlet, perhaps it's part of a conjugated system. Alternatively, maybe a vinyl proton not near any other protons, but I'm not sure.

Then, 3.66 (d, 2H): A doublet around 3.66 ppm. That could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group. Or perhaps a methylene near a carbonyl. The downfield shift suggests some deshielding, like next to an oxygen.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has an aldehyde group (from the 9.72 peak), two para
