Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about finding an eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking. So, the operator is denoted as P, and it's a vector operator, which probably means it has components in X, Y, and Z directions. The question is about finding the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 when P is measured along an arbitrary direction n that lies in the x-z plane.

Wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane. So that means it's of the form (something, 0, something), right? Because in the x-z plane, y is zero. So the direction vector n can be written as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), maybe? Or something like that. Oh wait, yeah, because any direction in x-z plane can be parameterized by an angle θ from the x-axis, with sinθ in z.

But the operator we're dealing with is along this arbitrary direction n. So the operator we need is P·n, I think. Because when you have an operator along a direction, you take the component of the vector operator in that direction. So the operator is P·n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z.

Since n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero, so the operator simplifies to P_x n_x + P_z n_z. Because n_y=0, so P_y term drops out.

Wait, but wait.
