Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics question, and I'm a bit new to the concepts, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergencesâ€”like when calculations give infinite results. So, the idea is that you 'regularize' the theory by introducing some temporary modification to make the infinities manageable, then remove the modification later.

Wait, but the question is which theory doesn't need regularization. So, maybe it's a theory that doesn't have such divergences in the first place. Or perhaps it's a theory that's already finite, meaning it doesn't produce these problematic infinities.

Let me think about each option:

A) Superstring Theory: I think string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity, right? And I've heard that in string theory, the perturbative expansions are finite. Or wait, no, maybe not. Because string theory still involves loops and might have divergences, but perhaps it doesn't require the same kind of regularization as other quantum field theories. Or maybe it's because string theory has a cutoff at the string scale, so it doesn't have the same issues with high energies.

B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD): QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD has something called asymptotic freedom, which is when quarks behave more like free particles at high energies. But wait, does that mean that QCD calculations at high energies don't diverge? No, I think QCD does require renormalization and regularization. Because when you calculate loop diagrams, they can lead to divergences. So regularization is needed here.

C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED): QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I've definitely heard that QED requires regularization. The famous example is the calculation of the electron's magnetic moment, which has loop corrections leading to divergences. But in QED, these divergences can be handled by renormalization. So regularization is used as part of that process.

D) Classical Electrodynamics: This is the non-quantum version. In classical theories, like Maxwell's equations, you don't have the same issues with infinities that come up in quantum theories. For example, in classical E&M, point charges are handled with distributions, but perhaps in certain calculations you get things like infinite self-energy or radiation reactions. But wait, does regularization even apply to classical theories? I think regularization is a quantum field theory technique. So classical theories wouldn't require regularization because they don't have the same divergent integrals that come from quantum fluctuations.

So putting it together: which theory doesn't require regularization? The question is about never requiring it. So, the classical theories wouldn't need regularization because they aren't formulated with the same divergent integrals as quantum theories. Or wait, but the question is about high energies. Do any of the quantum theories not require regularization at high energies?

Wait, another angle. Some theories are "nonrenormalizable" and thus require a cutoff, meaning they need regularization or some other method. But theories like
