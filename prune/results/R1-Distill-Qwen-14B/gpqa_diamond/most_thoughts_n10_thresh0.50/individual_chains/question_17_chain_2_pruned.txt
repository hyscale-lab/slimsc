Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution with EDTA. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, meaning it binds to metal ions like calcium. The question gives me the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex and the formation constant, and I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions.

Wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, a stoichiometric solution would mean that all the calcium is bound by EDTA, right? Or wait, no. Or maybe it's just that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But I think in a 1:1 complex, the concentration of the metal ion and EDTA would be equal in the complex.

So the formation constant, K, is given as 5x10^10. Formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The formula for that is Kf = [Ca-EDTA]/([CaÂ²+][EDTA^4-]). 

But wait, in solution, the EDTA is usually in different forms because it's a polydentate ligand and can have multiple protonations. However, the problem states that the pH is ideal, so maybe we don't have to worry about the different protonated forms. So we can assume EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form, which is EDTA^4-.

Wait, but if the pH is ideal, it's adjusted so that the EDTA is in the right form to
