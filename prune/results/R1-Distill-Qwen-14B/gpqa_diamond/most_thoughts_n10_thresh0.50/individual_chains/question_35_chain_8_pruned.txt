Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let's see. The question is a bit dense, but I'll try to break it down.

The problem states that Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator, and it's given by c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S has a specific form. The first row of S is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). So I think S looks like:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Then, Ay = c * S. So substituting c, Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

The task is to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. The question then gives four options, and I need to determine which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, so I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Let me think about how to do that. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0.

So first, let's write out Ay explicitly. Each element of S multiplied by h/(4π). So:

Ay = [ [0 * c, (-i) * c],
       [i * c, 0 * c ] ]
= [ [0, -i c],
    [i c, 0 ] ]

Substituting c = h/(4π), so:

Ay = [ [0, -i (h/(4π))],
       [i (h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues λ, we compute the determinant of (Ay - λ I) = 0.

So the matrix Ay - λ I is:

[ [ -λ, (-i h/(4π)) ],
  [ (i h/(4π)), -λ ] ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ]

Calculating each part: (-λ)^2 = λ². The other term is (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)).

Multiply them together: (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So it's (1) * (h/(4π))². So the determinant equation becomes:

λ² - [ (h/(4π))² * (1) ] = 0
λ² = (h/(4π))²
λ = ± h/(4π)

Wait, that's the eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which doesn't make sense because our eigenvalues are real, right? Because the determinant calculation gave us real roots. So the eigenvalues are purely real, right?

Wait, did I make a mistake? Let's think again. The matrix Ay is 2x2 with real entries? No, wait no. The matrix has elements with imaginary units. Oh wait, no, when you compute the determinant, the product
