Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll think it through.

The question gives a Lagrangian interaction term: L(y) = -λf f(y)(ῡ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I'm misreading that. Oh right, probably it's L(y) = -λ f f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse it again. The term looks like it's involving a fermion field ψ_f and maybe a Yukawa coupling. But I'm not entirely sure, but maybe it's not directly relevant for solving this.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. We need to find the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, the possible decay products would depend on the mass of X and the masses of the fermions it can decay into.

Wait, kinematically allowed means that the energy must be enough to produce the particles. So the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion being produced because each fermion will have some rest mass. So for example, if a fermion has a mass m, then X must have a mass ≥ 2m for that fermion pair to be a possible decay product.

So let's list all the possible fermions that the X boson
