Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The bigger the wobble, the more massive the planet, right? Or wait, actually, the wobble's speed depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period or distance. 

The question says there are two stars with the same mass, each hosting a planet similar to Neptune. So similar masses for the planets, I guess. The RV method measures the periodic shift in the spectral lines. Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and planet #2's star shifts 7 milliangstroms. 

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relationship here. The RV method measures the velocity of the star towards or away from us. The formula I think is that the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is proportional to ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ) ), but I'm not sure. Or maybe there's a simpler way to think about it.

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period, but since both stars are the same mass, maybe that's a factor. Oh wait, the formula I remember is K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/
