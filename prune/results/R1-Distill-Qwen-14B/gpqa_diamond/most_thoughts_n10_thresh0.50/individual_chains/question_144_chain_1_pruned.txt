Okay, so I have this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters, so I need to compute which one is correct.

Wait, I remember that the decay length depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Right, the mean decay distance L is approximately equal to the velocity v multiplied by the lifetime τ. So, L = v * τ. But how do I find τ?

I think the lifetime is related to the particle's width via the uncertainty principle. The width Γ is the total decay width, and the lifetime τ is inversely proportional to Γ. The formula I recall is τ = ħ / Γ, but wait, I should check the units here.

Wait, no, Γ has units of energy. The general relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I should be careful with the units. Oh right, Γ is the energy width, so when you have Γ in GeV, you need to convert it into proper units to get τ in seconds.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ
