Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because relativistic mechanics can get tricky, but let's take it step by step. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li usually has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, because 3 protons +3 neutrons =6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6.

The problem is asking for the energy, so I think we're looking for the total energy of the nucleus, which would be gamma times the rest mass energy. But wait, in colliders, particles are accelerated to a certain energy, which is usually given as the kinetic energy, but sometimes as the total energy. Oh wait, I need to be careful here.

Wait, wait. The question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." RHIC accelerates ions, so the energy provided by the collider is the kinetic energy, but sometimes in these problems, especially in high-energy physics, the energy given is the total energy. Hmm, this is a point where I might get confused. Let me think.

The formula for the total energy is gamma * m0 c². The kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m0 c². So if the problem is asking for the energy provided by the collider, it's usually the kinetic energy. However, the options don't have a minus one, so perhaps they're referring to the total energy. Hmm.

Wait, the question says, "the energy of the RHIC." RHIC accelerates ions to a certain energy. I'm a bit hazy on this, but in collider experiments, the beam energy is typically the kinetic energy. But wait, some sources say that in the context of colliders, when they mention the energy, it's the kinetic energy. Or sometimes, they might refer to the total energy. So this is something I need to figure out.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants the total energy, which is gamma m0 c². Let me proceed with that assumption, but I should keep that in mind.

So first, I need to find gamma. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Given that v is 0.96
