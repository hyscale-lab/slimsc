Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let's see. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Right, I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices.

Wait, rhombohedral means that all the edges are equal, right? So a, b, c are all the same length. Oh, wait, but in a rhombohedral system, the angles between the edges are all equal too. So alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees here. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. But wait, interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms, which in a simple cubic structure would be the lattice parameter a. But wait, rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal crystal? Or is it part of the cubic system? I think rhombohedral is a subclass of cubic, but the angles aren't 90 degrees. So alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each.

So, the interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) is given by the formula 1/d^2 = (h^2)/(a^2) + (k^2)/(b^2) + (l^2)/(c^2) - 2(hk)/(a b cos gamma) - 2(h l)/(a c cos beta) - 2(k l)/(b c cos alpha). Wait, does that sound
