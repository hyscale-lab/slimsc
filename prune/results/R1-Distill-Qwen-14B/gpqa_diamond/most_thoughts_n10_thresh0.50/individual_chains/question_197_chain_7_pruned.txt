Okay, I've got this problem to solve. Let me think through it step by step. So, the question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then figuring out the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in some kind of substitution reaction, maybe something like a haloform reaction or perhaps a dehydration? Wait, no, maybe it's the hydrolysis of a nitrile? Or perhaps it's more about alkyne reactions. Oh right, red phosphorus is often used with HI for the hydrolysis of alkynes to carboxylic acids. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction where the phosphorus acts as a Lewis acid catalyst. Oh wait, another possibility: red phosphorus and HI is used to cleave C-Cl bonds, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where an alkyne is converted. Let me think again.

First, I should probably figure out what the structure of Compound X is. Let's look at the spectral data.

The IR shows strong absorption between 3400-2500 cm⁻¹. That's a broad region, likely due to O-H or N-H stretches. The peaks at 1720 cm⁻¹ and 1610 cm⁻¹ suggest carbonyl groups. Wait, 1720 is typical for a ketone or an aldehyde or maybe an ester. The 1610 might be an aromatic ring (C=C). The 1450 could be another aromatic ring vibration or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, probably an -OH proton, like from a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde proton, but that's usually around 9-10 ppm and might be a singlet. Wait, but 10.5 is a bit high for an aldehyde. Carboxylic acid protons are typically broad and around 10-12 ppm. So maybe there's a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but looking at the other peaks: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d,
