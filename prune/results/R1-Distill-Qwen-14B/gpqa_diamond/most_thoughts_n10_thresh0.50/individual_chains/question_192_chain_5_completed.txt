Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The conductor has a radius R, and the cavity has a radius r, with r being smaller than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. Inside this cavity, there's a small positive charge +q placed somewhere. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the conductor's center, and the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options given are four possible expressions for E. I need to determine which one is correct.

Hmm, okay. I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. When a conductor is neutral, any enclosed charge within a cavity affects the charges on the inner surface of the conductor, but the outer surface remains neutral. So, if the conductor is uncharged, the inner surface must have an induced charge of -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, the outer surface must remain neutral because the total charge is zero.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. Oh right! For a conductor, the charges reside on the surface. So, if we have a charge inside a cavity (like in a Faraday cage), the inner surface of the conductor would have an induced charge equal and opposite to the enclosed charge. That way, the electric field within the conductor material itself is zero. The outer surface, however, remains uncharged if the conductor is neutral overall. So in this case, the conductor is uncharged, so the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has no net charge.

So, when considering the electric field outside the conductor (since P is outside, at L > R), the field should behave as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the outer surface has no net charge, so the field outside should be due to the charge on the inner surface plus any other charges. But the conductor itself is uncharged, so the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q? No, wait, wait. Wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. When we place +q inside the cavity, that would induce -q on the inner surface. But since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must have +q to balance, because the inner surface is -q. Or wait, no. The conductor's total charge is zero, so inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must be +q. Because -q (inner) + outer = 0 → outer = +q. Hmm, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let me think. The conductor is neutral. When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the one facing the cavity) must have an induced charge of -q. Because the cavity's charge would create an electric field that the conductor's charges rearrange to cancel. So the conductor's inner surface has -q. Since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q, because the inner is -q. So the total conductor charge is zero: -q (inner) + (+q) (outer) = 0.

So when considering the electric field outside the conductor (point P is outside), the field is due to all the charges enclosed within the Gaussian surface, which includes the outer surface charge. But wait, the outer surface has +q. So the total charge enclosed by a Gaussian surface outside the conductor is +q. So the field outside would be as if a point charge +q is at the center of the conductor. Wait, but where exactly are these charges located?

Wait, for a spherical conductor, any induced charges on the outer surface would distribute uniformly because of symmetry. So the outer surface's +q would appear as though it were a point charge at the center of the conductor. So the electric field at any point outside the conductor would be due to that +q charge. So the formula would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², right? Because the field outside a charged sphere is radial and depends only on the total charge and distance.

But wait, the point P is outside the conductor, so the conductor's entire charge (including any induced charges) contributes to E at P. But since the conductor is neutral, the charges on the inner and outer surfaces would have to add up to zero. Wait, no. Wait, the conductor is neutral, so the total charge is zero. But the inner surface has -q, so the outer must have +q. Wait, but the conductor can't have a net charge, so yes: inner is -q, outer is +q, so overall charge is zero.

Wait, but when calculating the field outside the conductor, the Gaussian surface encloses both the conductor and the charge inside. So the total charge inside the Gaussian surface would be +q (the outer surface's charge). So the field at P would be the same as if a point charge +q were at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but wait. The original charge is placed inside the cavity, which is offset from the conductor's center by a distance s. So the setup isn't symmetric. The charge +q is not at the center of the conductor. How does that affect the induced charges?

Ah, but wait. The conductor's inner surface must have an induced charge of -q, but because the cavity is not at the center, the distribution of this charge on the inner surface would be non-uniform. However, the outer surface, which is a sphere centered at the conductor's center, must still have a uniform distribution because of the conductor's symmetry. So the outer surface's charge would be uniformly distributed, making the field outside the conductor as if the charge were at the center.

Wait, let me think again. The inner surface is a non-spherical surface because the cavity is offset. But the conductor's outer surface is spherical. So when the field outside the conductor is considered, the charges on the outer surface would produce a field as if all the charge were at the center. So regardless of the position of the +q inside the cavity, the outer surface's charge distribution would be symmetric, leading to the same external field as a point charge at the center.

So the electric field outside the conductor (at point P) would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Looking at the options:

Option B is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Wait, but the problem states that the point P's distance from the cavity's center is l, and the angle between l and s is theta. So perhaps I'm missing something about the position of P relative to both centers.

Wait, the conductor's center is separated by s from the cavity's center. The point P is a distance L from the conductor's center and l from the cavity's center. The angle between l and s is theta.

But wait, if the conductor's radius is R, and P is outside, so L > R. The cavity's radius is r, but r < R, so the cavity is entirely inside the conductor. The point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, which is also the same as the center of the conductor. So, the position of P is determined relative to both the conductor's center and the cavity's center.

Wait, but when I'm considering the field outside the conductor, the charges on the conductor (the outer surface) are what contribute. Since the outer surface is a sphere of radius R, any point outside (L > R) would see the field as if all the charge is at the center. So regardless of where the cavity's charge is placed, the external field depends on the net charge outside the Gaussian surface, which is the outer conductor's charge.

Wait, but the conductor's total charge is zero, right? So the outer surface has +q and the inner surface has -q, but the conductor's net charge is zero. So when considering a point outside, the Gaussian surface encloses the conductor, which has a net charge of zero plus the inner charge of -q? Wait no. Wait a second, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. When we place +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity side) must have -q, so that the field inside the conductor is zero. Because any charge inside a conductor causes the charges to redistribute so that the field inside is zero. So the inner surface has -q, and since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q. Because the conductor's total charge is zero, so outer surface = +q.

So, the total charge inside the Gaussian surface (outside the conductor) is the sum of the charge inside the cavity (q), the inner conductor's charge (-q), and the outer conductor's charge (+q). Wait, no. The Gaussian surface is outside the conductor, so it encloses all the conductor's charges. The conductor's inner surface is -q, the outer is +q, so total is zero. So the Gaussian surface would enclose zero net charge. But wait that can't be right, because the charge inside the cavity is q. So perhaps confusion arises here.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor is neutral. The charge inside the cavity is +q, which is inside the conductor. So for a Gaussian surface outside the conductor, any charge inside the cavity is enclosed. But wait, the conductor's material itself isn't charged overall. So the Gaussian surface outside, which is just outside the conductor, encloses the conductor and the charge inside the cavity.

Wait, but the conductor's inner surface has -q, and the outer has +q. So the total charge inside the Gaussian surface (outside the conductor) would be the conductor's charges (inner and outer) plus the cavity's charge. Hmm, but the conductor's net charge is zero. So the total charge inside the Gaussian surface would be the +q inside the cavity plus the conductor's charges (which sum to zero). So the net charge inside the Gaussian surface is +q. Therefore, the field at P is due to +q as though it's at the center of the conductor.

So E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So the correct option would be B.

But wait, the problem says that the point P is such that its distance from the cavity's center is l, and the angle between l and s is theta. So is there a way that the position of P relative to the cavity's center would affect the field?

Wait, perhaps the field inside the conductor is zero, but the field outside is due to the charge on the outer surface. Since the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform, it's as if the charge is a point at the center. So regardless of where P is outside, the field depends only on L, the distance from the conductor's center.

So in that case, the correct option is B.

But wait, let me look at the other options. Option A is (l - s cosθ)^2 in the denominator. That would imply that the effective distance from P to the charge is being adjusted based on the positions of the centers and the angle. But if the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed, the field at P would depend only on the distance from the conductor's center, regardless of the position of the cavity's charge. So the field should be the same as if the charge were at the center.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming that the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed. If the inner surface isn't uniform because the cavity isn't centered, would that affect the outer surface's distribution? Let me think. The conductor's outer surface must be a sphere, right? Because the conductor is a sphere. So even if the inner surface is non-uniform due to the cavity's position, the outer surface remains a uniform sphere. So the charge distribution on the outer surface is uniform, leading to the same field as a point charge at the center.

So the answer must be option B: E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L².

Wait, but I'm looking back at the problem, and the point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. So yeah, the field at P would be as per the distance L.

But why are the other options present? Let me think: option D is (l²) in the denominator. l is the distance from P to the cavity's center. If the charge were inside the cavity and you're outside the conductor, would you use l or L? No, because the field outside the conductor is due to the outer surface's charge, which is at the conductor's center. So it's L that matters, not l.

Option C uses l + s cos(theta), which seems to be a vector addition, maybe to get the distance between P and the cavity's center, but that's not relevant for the field outside the conductor. Because the field outside depends on the conductor as a whole, not the position of the cavity's charge.

So, I think the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ (where $r < R$) inside. The center of the cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and a distance $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Induced Charges on the Conductor**:  
   Since the conductor is initially uncharged, the inner surface of the conductor (adjacent to the cavity) will induce a charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor. The outer surface of the conductor, being a sphere, will have a uniform distribution of charge $+q$ to maintain the conductor's neutrality.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   For a point outside the conductor (where $L > R$), the electric field is determined by the total charge enclosed within a Gaussian surface that includes the conductor and the cavity. The net charge enclosed by such a surface is $+q$ (from the outer surface of the conductor). The field outside the conductor behaves as if the charge $+q$ is concentrated at the center of the conductor, due to the symmetry of the outer surface charge distribution.

3. **Relevance of Distances $l$ and $s$**:  
   The distances $l$ and $s$, as well as the angle $\theta$, do not affect the electric field outside the conductor. This is because the field outside depends only on the total charge of the conductor (which is $+q$) and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor to the point $P$. The position of the cavity or the charge inside it does not influence the external field due to the shielding effect of the conductor.

4. **Correct Expression for the Electric Field**:  
   The electric field at point $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
   \]
   This corresponds to option **B**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$ in the denominator, which is incorrect because the field outside the conductor depends only on $L$, not on $l$ or $\theta$.
- **Option B**: Matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor, which depends solely on $L$.
- **Option C**: Involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$ in the denominator, which is irrelevant for the external field.
- **Option D**: Uses $l^2$ in the denominator, which is incorrect because the field outside the conductor depends on $L$, not $l$.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **B**, as the electric field outside the conductor is determined by the total charge on the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.
