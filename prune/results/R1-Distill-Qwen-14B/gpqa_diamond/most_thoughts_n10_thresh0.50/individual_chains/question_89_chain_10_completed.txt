Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH to form product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, let's break this down reaction by reaction.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably forming an alkene. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate HBr from each Br, forming a double bond. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, elimination would form an alkene between carbons 1 and 3, creating 1,3-adamantadiene? Wait, no, because elimination would occur between each Br, but wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the two Brs are on adjacent carbons? Oh wait, adamantane has a structure where each carbon is bonded to three others. Wait, perhaps the structure is more like a diamondoid, with each bridgehead carbon having two Brs. Wait, no, wait: 1,3-dibromoadamantane—each of the two bridgehead carbons (like positions 1 and 3) has a Br? Or are the Brs on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about it as, when you have vicinal dihalides, like 1,2-dibromoethane, KOH would eliminate to form ethylene. Similarly, for 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps elimination occurs to form an alkene. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid, and the 1H NMR shows specific peaks.

Looking at product 1's NMR. The 1H NMR has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl group, perhaps an ester or ketone.

Wait, but if product 1 is formed by elimination, that would make an alkene, but an IR peak at 1720 is more like a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Let's think again. KOH is a strong base, but when reacting with vicinal dihalides, maybe it's an E2 elimination to form an alkene. But wait, the IR peak is at 1720, which is more indicative of a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester. So maybe elimination didn't happen. Another possibility is substitution.

Wait, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps it's an SN2 reaction on each Br. But wait, adamantane is a very rigid structure, and the bridgehead positions are typically not very reactive because of the high strain for SN2 (since the leaving group would need to have a good backside attack, which is hindered in bridgehead positions). So perhaps elimination is more likely, but then why is there a carbonyl peak?

Wait, maybe the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, elimination, forming a double bond. But then, the IR shouldn't have a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't an alkene but something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe the KOH isn't for elimination but for saponification or something else. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a dihalide, and KOH is a base. Oh wait, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that usually applies to amines. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double substitution, but with two Brs, maybe forming a diol? But the IR spectrum doesn't show an -OH stretch. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an epoxide formation, but that's when you have a dihalide with two adjacent Brs. Wait, no, epoxide formation typically involves two adjacent leaving groups, but I'm not sure about how that would work with KOH.

Wait, maybe the product is an ether? If each Br is replaced by an -O- group, but that would require an alcohol, but KOH is a base and a strong nucleophile. Alternatively, maybe it's a diether, but that doesn't explain the IR peak at 1720.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, creating a carbonyl. Wait, no, elimination usually forms alkenes, not carbonyls. Unless it's a dehydrohalogenation with two adjacent Brs leading to a conjugated diene, but that still doesn't account for the carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: looking at the NMR of product 1. The peak at 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) is probably a set of CH2 groups, maybe in a bridge structure. The 1.94 (2H) could be another methylene group. So perhaps the product is an epoxide? Because epoxides have adjacent oxygen atoms, and the protons on the epoxide would typically be around 3-4 ppm. But in this case, the 4.79 ppm is for 2H, which could be an epoxide. Wait, but the IR peak at 1720 is more like a carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketone or an ester.

Wait, if the product is an epoxide, then the IR would show a peak around 1200-1300 cm-1 for the C-O-C stretch, but 1720 is a carbonyl. So maybe the product isn't an epoxide.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction is a double elimination with KOH, leading to an allene (cumulative diene) or perhaps a ketone. Or maybe it's a Claisen condensation, but that's more for esters. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is converted into a diketone via oxidation, but KOH as a base might not do that.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The IR peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl. Maybe it's an ester or ketone. So if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane and the product has carbonyl groups, perhaps each Br was replaced by an oxygen-containing group.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dihydroxylation. No, that would require something like OsO4 for dihydroxylation of a double bond, but that's not what's happening here.

Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is treated with KOH in such a way that it forms a di-alkoxide, but that doesn't directly explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the product. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, maybe each Br is replaced by an -OH group. So the product would be 1,3-diol. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is treated with KOH to form a cyclopropane via a double elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is likely a -OCH2O- group, as in an epoxide. Because epoxide protons are typically around 3.5-4.5 ppm. But in this case, the 4.79 is for 2H—so perhaps a bridgehead CH2 in an epoxide structure. But then, that would lead to an IR peak for the epoxide, not a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. So each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group. How? Well, perhaps each Br is oxidized to a ketone. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Unless the reaction is more about elimination followed by some rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double E2 elimination, forming a conjugated diene, but that doesn't produce a carbonyl.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's move to the second reaction and see if that helps. Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 is a carbonyl compound, perhaps a diketone or something with an oxygen. If product 1 is a diketone, then when treated with Al isopropoxide, maybe it undergoes some kind of aldol condensation or other carbonyl reactions. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, and Al isopropoxide is used in transesterification or some other ester reaction.

Wait, another thought: If product 1 is an epoxide, then heating with Al isopropoxide could lead to ring-opening. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a carbonyl, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or something similar. Alternatively, maybe product 2 is a dienone or a conjugated diene.

Wait, but perhaps the first reaction is a double elimination to form a conjugated diene. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Br on carbons 1 and 3. So upon elimination, each Br would lose HBr, forming a double bond between 1 and 2, and another between 2 and 3? No, because the initial structure is 1,3-dibromo, so the adjacent carbons are 1 and 3, but if they are adjacent, elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 3. Wait, but that's not possible because in adamantane, each bridgehead is connected to three carbons. Hmm, perhaps the double bond forms between two bridgeheads, making an allene or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclopropane via double elimination, but I'm not sure.

But let's try to think about the NMR. Product 1's NMR shows 4.79 (2H), which is upfield for a CH2. That might be a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, like in an epoxide. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be the bridgehead CH2 groups, and 1.94 (2H) another set of CH2.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Considering the IR, if it's an epoxide, but then why the 1720 cm-1 peak? Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a carbonyl group. Maybe product 1 is a ketone.

Wait, another approach: if product 1 is treated with KOH and forms a carbonyl, perhaps via elimination followed by keto-enol tautomerism. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a cyclopropane with ketone groups. Wait, but that's a stretch.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diepoxide. But then, perhaps the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl, unless it's a different kind of structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide reacts with KOH to form a gem-diol, but that's more for geminal dihalides, not vicinal.

Wait, if I'm stuck here, maybe I should think about the second reaction. Product 1 is heated with excess Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is used in Friedel-Crafts reactions, which require aromatic rings. So product 1 must have an aromatic ring or be able to form one. Alternatively, if product 1 is a carbonyl compound, perhaps the Al isopropoxide is used to form an enol ether or to facilitate some kind of condensation.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is a diketone, then heating with Al isopropoxide (a Lewis acid) could lead to a conjugated enone via aldol condensation. So product 2 would be an enone—a conjugated dienone or something similar.

Then, product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, breaking them into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 is an enone (a conjugated dienone), ozonolysis would break the double bonds. But wait, ozonolysis typically cleaves each double bond into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a conjugated diene, ozonolysis might break it into two carbonyls.

Wait, but the problem says ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide. I think that's a standard ozonolysis workup, which typically leads to cleavage of double bonds into carbonyl groups. But if product 2 is an enone (like a cyclohexenone), ozonolysis might cleave the double bond.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me try to outline the steps again.

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 via KOH. Product 1 has IR at 1720 (carbonyl) and NMR peaks as described.

2. Product 1 → product 2 via Al isopropoxide (which is a Lewis acid).

3. Product 2 → product 3 via ozonolysis.

Now, the NMR of product 3 is the focus.

So perhaps product 1 is a di-ketone or an ester. Let me think: If product 1 is a di-ketone, then heating with Al isopropoxide could cause the ketones to undergo some kind of elimination or rearrangement.

Wait, but Al isopropoxide is often used in Friedel-Crafts acylation, which requires aromatic rings. So maybe product 1 is a dienol ether or something that can form an aromatic ring upon treatment with Al isopropoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a gem-diketone, which upon treatment with Al isopropoxide forms a conjugated diene.

Wait, if product 1 is a diketone, like 1,3-diketone in adamantane structure, then product 2 could be formed by elimination to form a conjugated diene. So product 2 would be a diene. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the diene into two carbonyl groups.

But then, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were. So in the NMR, we'd be looking for protons adjacent to carbonyls.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. Deshielded protons are typically in environments with less electron density, such as near electronegative groups or in a strained environment. So in product 3, these might be the protons next to carbonyls.

Wait, perhaps product 3 has a diketone structure, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think again about product 1's structure. The IR carbonyl peak suggests a carbonyl group. The NMR shows 4.79 (2H), which could be a -CH2-O- group, but if it's a ketone, that would be a carbonyl group, not an oxygenated CH2. Alternatively, perhaps it's a geminal diol, but that's less likely.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone. For example, if the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, elimination could form a double bond, but then with KOH, perhaps it's an E2 elimination to form an alkene, but then where is the carbonyl?

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of another approach.

The first reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid). NMR shows a peak at 4.79 (2H), which is in the range for an -OCH2O- group, as in an epoxide. But the IR shows a carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is an epoxide with some other functional group. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol.

Wait, but I'm not seeing it. Let's move to the second reaction.

Assuming that product 1 is an epoxide, heating with Al isopropoxide (Lewis acid) can cause ring-opening. For example, in epoxide ring-opening under acidic conditions, the ring opens to form a carbocation, which could then react further. But I'm not sure what the product would be in this case, especially considering the Al isopropoxide.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a carbonyl, perhaps the Al isopropoxide acts as a catalyst for some kind of cyclization or elimination.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diepoxide, and product 2 is a diol. But that doesn't seem to fit with the IR data.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a geminal diol, but that's less likely.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis of a diene would cleave each double bond into carbonyl groups. Product 3 would then have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

So for product 3, the most deshielded protons would be those adjacent to carbonyls. These protons typically show up as triplets if they're next to a CH2 group with two protons. Or maybe a doublet if they're next to a CH group.

Wait, but the question is about the coupling pattern. Let's think about an example. For a carbonyl group (like a ketone), the adjacent CH2 group would have protons that are split by neighboring groups. Suppose the structure is CH2-CO. The CH2 protons would be adjacent to the carbonyl, and perhaps also next to another group.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the structure is such that a proton is adjacent to two CH2 groups, it could lead to a triplet of triplets or a pentet.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded proton is on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's say the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R. The middle CH2 groups would have adjacent CH2 groups, leading to coupling with each other. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, considering the structure after ozonolysis, maybe the product has a structure like (CH2)nCO, where the CH2 is next to a carbonyl. The coupling would depend on the neighboring protons.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group next to two other CH2 groups. So each of these protons would couple with two sets of neighboring protons, leading to a triplet of triplets or a pentet.

Wait, another approach: when a CH2 group is adjacent to another CH2 group, each proton on the first CH2 will couple with the two protons on the neighboring CH2. That would give each proton a triplet. But if the CH2 is between two other CH2 groups (like CH2-CH2-CH2), each proton would be next to two CH2 groups, leading to more splitting.

Alternatively, if the structure is CH2-CH2-CO, then the middle CH2 protons would couple with the adjacent CH2 and the other adjacent CH2, leading to more splitting.

Wait, perhaps it's a di-substituted alkene that after ozonolysis becomes two carbonyl groups, with the adjacent CH2 groups. So the NMR would show the CH2 next to the carbonyl, which would have protons that are split by neighboring groups.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure. Let me try to recap.

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with carbonyl, likely a diketone or similar).

2. Product 1 → product 2 (with Al isopropoxide, possibly a diene).

3. Product 2 → product 3 (after ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds to carbonyls).

Thus, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were in product 2.

So if product 2 is a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyls. So product 3 would have two carbonyl groups.

Now, what would the NMR look like? Let's say after ozonolysis, the molecule has two carbonyl groups, each adjacent to CH2 groups.

The most deshielded proton would be on a CH2 next to a carbonyl. Let's say each CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, like CH2(CO)-CH2-CO. Then, the CH2 protons would be adjacent to two carbonyls.

But wait, no, ozonolysis of a diene (like 1,3-diene) would form two carbonyl groups. For example, if the diene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2, ozonolysis would break it into two aldehydes or ketones, depending on substitution.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a cyclohexene derivative, such that ozonolysis would open it into a diketone.

Alternatively, maybe product 2 is a substituted cyclopropane, but that's less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a bridge structure with a double bond. Ozonolysis would cleave each double bond into carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis leads to a diketone with adjacent CH2 groups.

So the NMR of product 3 would show a CH2 group adjacent to two carbonyls. Each proton on that CH2 would be split by the neighboring CH2 groups.

Wait, but if the structure is something like (CO)R-CH2-CH2-(CO)R', then each CH2 in the middle would have two neighboring CH2 groups. Each proton on the middle CH2 would be split by the neighboring CH2 groups, leading to a triplet of triplets or a pentet.

Wait, let's consider a simple example. Suppose the structure after ozonolysis is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O. No, perhaps more likely, it's something like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO.

In this case, the central CH2 would have two neighboring CH2 groups (one on each side). Each proton on the central CH2 would be split by the two adjacent CH2 groups. Each adjacent CH2 has two protons, so each of the central protons would have 2 + 2 = 4 neighboring protons, leading to a quintet (pentet) due to coupling with two neighboring sets of protons.

Wait, but wait: each CH2 group has two protons. So the central CH2 would have two neighboring CH2 groups (left and right). Each of those has two protons, but the coupling is determined by the number of neighboring protons on adjacent carbons.

In the case of a -CH2-CH2-CH2- chain, the middle CH2 would be adjacent to two CH2 groups on either side. Each of those has two protons. So each proton on the middle CH2 would couple with two protons from each adjacent CH2. So the splitting would be (n+1), where n is the number of neighboring protons. So each adjacent CH2 has two protons, so for each side, the coupling would be 2+1=3. So the overall splitting would be 3 on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets, which is option B or C.

Wait, but in reality, the splitting is more complex. For a central CH2 group next to two CH2 groups on either side, each proton on the central CH2 would be split by the two neighboring CH2 groups. Each neighboring CH2 has two protons, so each coupling would be a doublet. So the splitting would be doublet of doublets, but perhaps with additional splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is with both adjacent groups, leading to a triplet of triplets. So each proton on the central CH2 is split by each adjacent CH2 group. Each adjacent CH2 has two protons, leading to a triplet for each coupling, and the combination would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, let me think: each proton on the central CH2 is coupled with two protons on the left CH2 and two on the right CH2. So the splitting from the left would be a triplet, and the splitting from the right would also be a triplet. So the overall pattern would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, if the central CH2 is only coupled to one CH2 group, it would be a triplet. But if it's coupled to two separate CH2 groups on either side, each with two protons, then each coupling would split the peak into triplets, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl group, and coupled to two adjacent CH2 groups, each with two protons. Thus, its coupling pattern would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.


The problem involves analyzing a multi-step reaction sequence and determining the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the final product's ¹H NMR spectrum. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH**  
   - The reaction likely involves elimination of HBr from the vicinal dihalide, forming a conjugated diene. The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which suggests the presence of a carbonyl group. This indicates that the reaction may also involve further oxidation or rearrangement, forming a diketone or a related carbonyl-containing compound.  
   - The ¹H NMR spectrum of product 1 includes peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41–2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H), consistent with a structure containing carbonyl groups and adjacent CH₂ groups.

2. **Reaction 2: Product 1 + Al isopropoxide**  
   - Aluminum isopropoxide, a strong Lewis acid, likely facilitates a reaction involving the carbonyl groups in product 1. This could lead to the formation of a conjugated diene (product 2), as Al isopropoxide is often used in reactions like Friedel-Crafts acylation or aldol condensation.  
   - Product 2 is likely a diene, as this sets up the next reaction involving ozonolysis.

3. **Reaction 3: Product 2 + Ozonolysis**  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds in alkenes, converting them into carbonyl groups. If product 2 is a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would break the double bonds, forming a diketone or two aldehydes depending on the substitution pattern.  
   - Product 3 would thus contain carbonyl groups, with adjacent CH₂ groups that are deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the carbonyls.

4. **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group. This CH₂ group is likely flanked by two other CH₂ groups, leading to coupling with protons on both sides.  
   - Each proton on the central CH₂ group would couple with the two protons on one adjacent CH₂ group (a triplet) and the two protons on the other adjacent CH₂ group (another triplet). The combined splitting results in a triplet of triplets.

Based on this analysis, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet of triplets**.

**Answer: B**
