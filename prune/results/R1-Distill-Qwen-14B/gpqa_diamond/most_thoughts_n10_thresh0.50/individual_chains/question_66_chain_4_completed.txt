Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these, and I have to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with certain symmetries. So the operators must respect the symmetries of the Standard Model, but I need to think about which symmetries are included.

Wait, Lorentz symmetry is definitely one. Because in the Standard Model, all interactions respect Lorentz symmetry. So any operator in SMEFT must transform correctly under Lorentz transformations. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is a must.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz plus translations. Oh right, Lorentz and translation symmetries together make up Poincare. So any theory with Lorentz symmetry that's also a local theory (like in the Standard Model) would have Poincare symmetry. So operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare as well. So options 1 and 2 are in.

Now, CP symmetry. I'm a bit unsure here. The Standard Model is CP symmetric, but not all of its operators preserve CP. Wait, no, the SM actually has some CP violation, like in the CKM matrix. So does that mean that the operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP? Because if the SM already doesn't, then adding operators shouldn't require them to preserve CP. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP. So CP symmetry (option 3) isn't necessarily a symmetry that must be respected. So option 3 isn't a must.

What about CPT symmetry? CPT is a big one. I remember that in quantum field theory, any Lorentz-invariant theory must respect CPT symmetry. Because it's a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. So if a theory is Lorentz symmetric, it has to respect CPT. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry (option 4). 

Putting it all together: operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the correct options are 1,2,4 which corresponds to option C. Wait, let me check the options again. Option C is 1,2,4. Option A is 1 and 2. Option C includes all three.

Wait, wait, can operators violate Poincare symmetry? No, because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory, so it must respect Poincare. So yes, 1 and 2 are required, and 4 is required. So the correct answer is option C.


The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). SMEFT is a framework where operators are constructed to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model, but not necessarily all possible symmetries.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is a fundamental symmetry of the Standard Model and must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Any operator that does not transform correctly under Lorentz transformations is not part of SMEFT.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: This symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry with translation symmetry. Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, it must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model already contains CP-violating phenomena (e.g., in the CKM matrix). Therefore, operators in SMEFT are not required to preserve CP symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: In quantum field theory, any Lorentz-invariant theory must respect CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, it must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is **C**.

Answer: C
