Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with some spots on one hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler because they have a temperature difference of 1000 K. So, the spots are at 5000 K. The problem says that when we look at the star's brightness over time, it varies because the star is rotating and the spots come into and out of view. This effect is similar to what we'd see if there were an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. The task is to find out what the radius of such an exoplanet would need to be to produce the same change in brightness (amplitude) as the spotted star does.

Hmm, I remember that the change in brightness when a planet transits a star is given by the formula (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet's radius and Rstar is the star's radius. But wait, in this case, the star has spots, so the observed brightness variation isn't just due to a planet but due to the spots changing the total luminosity as they rotate.

First, I need to calculate the change in brightness caused by the spots. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, so Rstar = R_sun. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, a hemisphere is half the star, so 20% of that is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1, or 10% of the star's surface. So the filling factor is 0.2, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar^2 / 2). Or wait, maybe the filling factor is 20% of the entire star? No, the question says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So the spots take up 20% of that hemisphere. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2) = 0.1 π Rstar².

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the area of spots compared to the whole
