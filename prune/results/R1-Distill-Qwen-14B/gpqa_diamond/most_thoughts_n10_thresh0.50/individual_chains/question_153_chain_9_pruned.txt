Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon, forming an enolate. 

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and giving a product. I need to figure out what each product is based on the reactions given. Let me take it step by step.

First, let's look at the first reaction (A). The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. 

So, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile. Its structure is CH2(CO2Me)2. Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has a structure where the acrylate part is CH2=CH-CO2Me, but the substituents on the double bond are arranged so that the E configuration has the p-tolyl group opposite the CO2Me group. 

In a Michael addition, the nucleophile (the enolate) will attack the β-position of the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl. In this case, the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl is the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the β-carbon (the CH2 part) of the acrylate. 

So, the attack would form a new bond between the malonate's carbon and the β-carbon of the acrylate. The product would then have a new carbon-carbon bond, and since the malonate is a diester, the product will be a tricarboxylate. 

Wait, let me draw this. The acrylate is CH2=CHCO2Me, but wait, actually the structure is CH2=CH-p-tolyl acrylate? Wait, no, the structure is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the acrylate is CH2=CHCO2Me, but the substituents on the double bond are CH2COPh (where Ph is p-tolyl) on one end and methyl on the other. Wait, no, wait, the structure is (E)-methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)CO2Me, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. 

Actually, the correct structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-CO2Me with a p-tolyl group on the double bond. Wait, no, the acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-COOR, but in this case, the substituent on the double bond is the p-tolyl group. So the correct structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO2Me, but in
