Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, given the information about their masses, orbital periods, and their host stars. Hmm, I remember that the transit method depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The probability of a transit happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the inclination of the orbit.

Wait, wait. Oh right, the transit probability is given by the formula P = (R_p / a) / (1 + R_p / a) ), but wait, I might be mixing up the formula. Alternatively, I think the probability is proportional to (R_p / a) divided by something else. Oh wait, I remember that the transit probability is R_p / (a * (1 + sqrt(1 - (b^2)) )) but I might be getting that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps a simpler approach is to consider the formula for the probability of a transit, which is (R_p / R_s) / (sqrt(1 - (R_p^2 / R_s^2))) or something like that. Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s) / (1 + (R_p / R_s)). I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another thought: The probability of a transit depends on the size of the star and the planet, and the distance of the planet from the star (orbital semi-major axis). The formula I remember is that the probability P is approximately (R_p / R_s) / (1 + (R_p / R
