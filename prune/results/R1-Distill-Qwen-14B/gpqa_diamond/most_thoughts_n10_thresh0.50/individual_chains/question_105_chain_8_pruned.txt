Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The problem says that because of these spots, the star's brightness variation when observed over time would look similar to an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. We need to find the radius of such a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve, assuming the star wasn't spotted.

Hmm. So the key here is to compare the brightness variation caused by the star's spots to that caused by an exoplanet. I remember that when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2. But in this case, the spots are causing a periodic dimming as the star rotates, not a transit. Wait, but the question says that the brightness variation due to spots can resemble an exoplanet. So maybe we're to model the effect of the spots as if they were causing a dip similar to a planet.

Wait, but the star's own spots would cause a variation in brightness as they rotate into and out of view. Since the star is only spotted on one hemisphere, when it rotates, the spots come into the field of view (like a transit) and dim the light. So the question is, what's the equivalent effect on the light curve compared to a planet blocking part of the star.

So, the approach is to calculate the flux variation caused by the spots, and then find the planet radius that would cause the same flux variation.

But wait, how does the spot affect the flux? Spots are cooler than the rest of the star, so when they are facing us, the total flux is less than when they're not. The spot's area is 20% of the hemisphere it's on, but the entire star is being observed. Wait, no, the star's radius is the same as the Sun, and the hemisphere is half the star's surface. So the spots cover 20% of a hemisphere, which is 0.2 * 0.5 = 10% of the star's total
