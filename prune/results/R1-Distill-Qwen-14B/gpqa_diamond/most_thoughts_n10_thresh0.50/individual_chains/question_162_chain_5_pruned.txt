Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric because I only see dx and dy terms. So it's a 2D spacetime, probably a model of hyperbolic space or something similar.

I remember that in general relativity, the area of a sphere (or the volume in higher dimensions) can be calculated using the metric. But here we're dealing with a pseudosphere, which is a bit confusing. Wait, pseudosphere usually refers to a surface with constant negative curvature, right? Like the tractricoid. Oh, but in this context, maybe it's a 2D surface embedded in some spacetime.

Wait, the question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So, what's the formula for the area of a sphere in a space with curvature? I think in flat space, the area is 4πr², but for curved spaces, it's different. Oh right, in a space with constant curvature, the area of a sphere (called a geodesic sphere) is 4π r² (1 + (r²/(4R²)) (something)), but I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the metric's form. The given metric is conformally flat, meaning
