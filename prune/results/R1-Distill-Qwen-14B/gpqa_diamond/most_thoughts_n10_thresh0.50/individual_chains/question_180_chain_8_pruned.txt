Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrostatics. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. The mass is negligible, so I don't think I'll need to worry about kinetic energy or anything related to motion. 

12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. Hmm, point P is where the 13th charge is. So, the 13 charges are at point P and 12 others are 2 meters away from P. Wait, but the 13th is fixed there, so maybe the other 12 are all at 2 meters away from P. So, each of those 12 is 2 meters from point P, and the 13th is at P. 

The question is about the minimum energy of the system. So, I'm thinking about potential energy here, because when you bring charges together, their potential energy changes. Since potential energy is related to the configuration of the system, the minimum energy would probably be when the system is as stable as possible, perhaps when the charges are placed in a way that the potential energy is minimized. Wait, but wait, because in this setup, all the 12 charges are fixed at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So maybe the only energy we're considering is between the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges.

Wait, let me think again. The system is isolated, so no work is done externally, perhaps. But in any case, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P, which has the 13th charge. So each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from the 13th, which is fixed. So, the potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies between each of the 12 charges and the 13th charge at P.

Wait, but each of the 12 charges is 2 meters from P. So each contributes to the potential energy. So the total potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each
