Okay, let me try to figure this problem out. So, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, given that the number varies with parallax as 1/(parallax)^5. Hmm, parallax and distance are related, right?

Wait, I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Like, if something is further away, its parallax is smaller. So the formula is plx = 1/distance. Or wait, no, I think it's plx = distance in parsecs or something. Oh wait, actually, parallax in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So distance is inversely proportional to parallax.

So the problem says the number of stars N varies with 1/plx^5. Wait, no, the number varies as 1/(plx)^5. So N = k * (1/(plx))^5, where k is some constant. Oh wait, wait, the question says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is the same as N ∝ (plx)^-5.

But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, we can write N proportional to (1/d)^-5, which is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, but per unit range of distance. Hmm, so maybe they're
