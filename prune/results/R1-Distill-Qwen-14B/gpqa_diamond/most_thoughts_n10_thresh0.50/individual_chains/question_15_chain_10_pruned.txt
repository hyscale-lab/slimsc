Okay, I've got this astronomy question to tackle. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about which planet is more likely to transit, so the researchers should observe the one with higher probability. Both planets are Earth-like and detected via the RV method. The key factors are their orbital periods, the masses of their host stars, and the stars' radii.

Hmm, so both planets have the same minimum mass. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So P1 is closer to its star because shorter orbital period implies a smaller orbit (Kepler's third law). Also, both have circular orbits.

The host stars: The star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radii. Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but same radius—so they're main-sequence stars with similar radii but different masses.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit. The formula for transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by something else, wait no. Wait, no, the probability is actually the ratio of the area of the planet's orbit (as seen from Earth) relative to the star's size. More precisely, the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a)^2, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

Wait, no, I think the probability is (R_* + R_p)^2 / (a)^2, but since R_p is much smaller than R_*, it's approximately (R_*)^2 / a^2. So P = (R_*)² / a². Wait, no, I think I got it wrong. Let me think again.

The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view. The probability is proportional to (R_* + R_p)^2 / a², where R_p is the planet's radius. For Earth-like planets, R_p is much smaller than R_*, so it's approximately (R_*)² / a². Wait, but wait, actually, I think the formula is (R_*)² / a² multiplied by something else. Oh wait, no, another way: the probability is actually (R_*)² /
