Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to walk through my thoughts.

Alright, the problem is about a star with some dark spots on one hemisphere, and how that affects the brightness variations observed. The question is asking what the radius of an exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation amplitude as these spots.

Hmm, let me read the question again carefully. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. So Rstar is the same as R_sun. Oh wait, but in the question, it says, "if the star was not covered by spots!" So when calculating the exoplanet's radius, we're comparing the effect of a planet transiting the star to the effect of these spots.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, I assume, because they're dark. The temperature difference is 1000 K, but I'm not sure if the spots are 5000 K or 6000 + 1000 = 7000 K. But wait, dark spots are usually cooler than the surrounding. So probably the spots are at 5000 K. But actually, the exact temperature might not matter for this calculation because we're dealing with flux differences.

The filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So the total area covered by spots on that hemisphere is 20% of the hemisphere's area. Wait, but the star
