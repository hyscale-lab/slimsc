Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a star with some spots and how that affects the brightness variations observed. They're comparing this to the effect of an exoplanet. The goal is to find the radius of an exoplanet that would cause the same brightness change, given the star's spot coverage.

Alright, let me start by understanding the problem. The star has a radius equal to the Sun, so Rstar is probably 1 solar radius. The star has dark spots covering one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. Filling factor, I think, means the fraction of the hemisphere's area covered by spots. So if it's 20%, then the area covered by spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler. The temperature difference is 1000 K, so the spots must be at 5000 K, I suppose. Because 6000 minus 1000 is 5000, but wait, does it matter if it's cooler or hotter? Oh, spots are dark, so I think they're cooler. So spots are 5000 K.

The problem says that because of these spots, when the star rotates, the brightness changes as spots come into and out of view. This can mimic the effect of a planet transiting in front of the star. So the variations in brightness would look similar to those caused by a planet.

Now, the question is: what exoplanet radius relative to the star's radius would produce the same signal amplitude? So the amplitude of the brightness dip when the planet transits should be the same as the dip caused by the spots.

I remember that the brightness change (or the signal) when a planet transits a star is given by the formula: delta F = (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio, and since flux is proportional to area, that's the dip.

But wait, the star's spots complicate this. So the star isn't uniformly bright; part of its surface is dimmer. When the star rotates, different parts of the surface come into view, and the observed brightness changes.

So the total brightness without spots would be uniform, but with spots, it's modulated. The amplitude of this modulation depends on the spots' coverage and their temperature relative to the star.

The star's brightness without spots would be determined by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4. But when spots are present, the total emitted flux changes as the spots rotate into and out of view.

But wait, the star is observed from Earth, so the apparent brightness depends on the area of the star visible and the flux from each part. When a spot is facing us, it contributes less flux than the surrounding area. So as the star rotates, the spot moves in and out of view, causing the observed flux to vary.

The key here is to calculate the maximum variation in brightness caused by the spots and equate that to the variation caused by a planet transit.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Calculate the change in brightness (delta F) caused by the spots as the star rotates.
2. Calculate the change in brightness (delta F) caused by a planet transiting the star.
3. Set the two delta F values equal and solve for R_planet / R_star.

Wait, but the star's spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, we see varying amounts of the spotted hemisphere. Since the star is a sphere, the observed area of the hemisphere depends on the viewing angle. But the problem says that one hemisphere is spotty, so when the star is viewed edge-on, perhaps, the spots rotate into and out of view as the star spins.

Wait, but for photometric observations, the brightness variation arises from the changing amount of spotted area visible. The maximum variation occurs when the spots are fully visible (e.g., when the spot side is facing us) and when the spots are on the far side (not visible). But wait, since it's a hemisphere, when the star rotates 180 degrees, the spot hemisphere is on the opposite side, so the spots are hidden. So the brightness variation is a function of how much of the spotted area is visible as the star rotates.

Let me think about the geometry. The star is a sphere, so each point on the surface can be described by an angle. The spots are on one hemisphere, which is a spherical cap. The area of a spherical cap is 2πR²(1 - cosθ), where θ is the angular radius of the cap. Wait, but perhaps we can model this as a fraction of the total surface area.

Wait, but the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So each hemisphere has a surface area of 2πR², and the spots cover 0.2 of that. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR²? No, wait, wait. The total surface area of the sphere is 4πR². Each hemisphere is 2πR². So 20% of the hemisphere's area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the spots' area is 0.4πR².

But wait, when the star rotates, the amount of spotted area visible from Earth changes. For example, when the center of the spotted hemisphere is directly facing us, the entire 0.4πR² area is visible. But when the star rotates so that the spot is on the limb (edge), only a fraction of it is visible.

Wait, but the problem states that "only one hemisphere is spotty." So perhaps the spots are on the front hemisphere, and when the star rotates, this hemisphere comes into and out of view as seen from Earth. Wait, no, actually, the star's rotation would cause different parts of the surface to face us. If the star is observed from Earth, and the spots are on, say, the front hemisphere, then as the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view.

But perhaps a better approach is to model the brightness variation as the star rotates. The observed flux from the star will vary based on how much of the spotted area is in the observer's line of sight.

The approach I think is to model the brightness change when a fraction f of the star's surface is covered by spots, each at a lower temperature. But wait, in this case, it's not a uniform covering; only one hemisphere is spotty, and the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to model the situation where the entire hemisphere is covered by spots, but that's not the case here. So maybe the effective area is 0.2 * (hemisphere area).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified, considering the spots as a certain area fraction on the star's surface, and the brightness variation when that area is visible.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be treated as a two-state situation: when the spot is on the visible hemisphere and when it's not. But no, because the spots are on a hemisphere, which is either entirely visible or not. Wait, no, that's not correct. For example, when the star is viewed edge-on, the spots on the front hemisphere would be visible only when the star's rotation brings that part into view. But perhaps the star's rotation period is such that as the star spins, the spots come in and out of view, causing a periodic dip in brightness.

But maybe it's more straightforward to model the maximum and minimum brightness. The maximum brightness occurs when none of the spots are visible (the unspotted side is facing us), and the minimum when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible.

Wait, but wait, the star's brightness is a combination of the normal (unspotted) areas and the spotted areas. So the total flux when the star is viewed with the spotted hemisphere would be less than when it's viewed with the unspotted hemisphere.

Wait, but actually, when the star is seen face-on (so the entire front hemisphere is visible), and the front hemisphere is the spotted one, then the flux would be lower than when the star is seen with the unspotted hemisphere facing us.

So the maximum flux occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, and the minimum when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

Wait, but in reality, the star's surface is a sphere. So when we observe the star, the amount of spotted area visible depends on the star's rotation. So the brightness variation is between the maximum and minimum flux, which depends on the fraction of the star's surface that is spotted and the temperature difference between the spots and the rest.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about it again. The star's total flux without any spots would be F0 = 4πR² σ Teff^4. But with spots, the flux is F = F0 - (fraction_spotted) * (Teff^4 - Tspot^4) * (area of spots) / (area of star).

Wait, no. The flux from the spots is lower. So each spot's flux is σ T_spot^4, and the unspotted areas are σ Teff^4. So the total flux when a certain area A is spotted would be F = F_unspotted - (A) * σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / (Rstar²) )

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the star's flux as a combination of unspotted and spotted areas. The star's total flux is the sum of flux from each region.

So the star's total surface area is 4πR². The spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R², as the filling factor is 20% in one hemisphere (2πR² is the hemisphere area). So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R².

Each small area element on the star's surface emits a certain amount of flux. The flux per unit area is sigma * T^4. So when the star is viewed, the flux observed is the sum of the flux from all the visible areas.

Wait, but when the star is rotating, the amount of spotted area visible changes. So the maximum flux occurs when no spots are visible, and the minimum when the maximum amount of spots are visible. But since the star is a sphere, the amount of spotted area visible depends on the viewing angle.

Alternatively, perhaps the average flux variation can be considered. Let me think differently. The problem states that the star's brightness varies periodically because of rotation, and this variation resembles that of a planet. We need to find the exoplanet's radius that produces the same amplitude in the light curve.

The amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the planet is (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the planet blocks a part of the star's light, and the blocked flux is proportional to the area, which is (R_planet/R_star)^2 times the star's total area.

But the star's brightness variation due to spots is more complicated. The star's brightness change when the spots rotate in and out of view depends on the temperature difference between the spots and the rest of the star and the area of the spots.

So let's model the maximum and minimum flux from the star.

Wait, but maybe the key is to compute the relative change in flux when the spots are in view. The problem is that the star isn't uniformly bright, so when a spot is facing us, it contributes less flux than the surrounding area. The change in brightness is the difference between the maximum and minimum fluxes.

Wait, but perhaps the star's spots don't cause a dip in brightness but a variation. So, when the spots are fully on the visible side (i.e., when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible), the flux is lower than when the unspotted hemisphere is visible. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between these maximum and minimum fluxes.

Alternatively, perhaps the variation is due to the changing area of the spotted region visible as the star rotates. Since the spots are on a hemisphere, the amount of spotted area visible depends on the angle of rotation. For example, when the center of the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire 0.4π R² area is visible. As the star rotates, the visible area of the spots decreases, leading to a change in brightness.

Wait, but perhaps the problem simplifies this by considering the maximum change in flux. So the maximum change in flux occurs when the entire spotted area is either entering or leaving the field of view.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the maximum possible change in flux. Let's model it that way.

The maximum flux occurs when no spots are visible (unspotted hemisphere). The minimum occurs when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible.

So the maximum flux: F_max = (unspotted area fraction) * flux per unit area + (spotted area fraction) * flux per unit area at spot temperature.

Wait, no. When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, all the flux is from the unspotted regions. When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is from both the unspotted and spotted regions, but the spotted regions have lower flux.

Wait, no. The star's surface is a sphere. When you look at the star, you're seeing parts of both hemispheres. Wait, perhaps it's better to model the star's brightness as the sum of the flux from the entire surface, but considering which parts are visible at any given time.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the star's brightness when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible. The spotted hemisphere contributes less flux because the spots are cooler. The unspotted hemisphere contributes more.

But when the star is rotating, perhaps the spots are on the far side, so their contribution is zero. So the maximum brightness is when the unspotted hemisphere is fully visible, and the minimum when the spotted hemisphere is fully visible.

Wait, no, because the star's surface is a sphere. The front hemisphere is what you see. If the spots are on the front hemisphere, then when the star rotates, the spots come in and out of view, but the unspotted parts of the front hemisphere are always visible.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach. Let's calculate the change in flux when the spots are present.

The star's total flux without spots is F0 = 4πR² σ Teff^4.

When spots are present, the flux is F = F0 - (area of spots) * (Teff^4 - Tspot^4) / R² * (some factor depending on visibility).

Wait, the area of the spots is 0.4π R². So the change in flux when the spots are visible is delta F = 0.4π R² * (Teff^4 - Tspot^4) * sigma.

Wait, but the spots are on a hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots' contribution to the flux varies. So the maximum change in flux would be when the entire spotted area is visible, which is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us. Then, the flux would be F = F0 - (area of spots) * (Teff^4 - Tspot^4) * sigma.

So the maximum dip in flux is delta F = (area of spots / area of star) * (Teff^4 - Tspot^4) / Teff^4.

Wait, no, more accurately, the flux from the spots is (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) times the flux they would have contributed if they were at Teff. So the change in flux when the spots are visible is the difference between Teff^4 and T_spot^4 multiplied by the area of the spots, all times sigma.

But perhaps it's better to model the relative change in flux when the spots are present compared to when they aren't.

Wait, when the entire spotted area is visible, the flux is F_spot = F0 * (1 - (area of spots / area of star) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)) )

So the change in flux is delta F = F0 * (area of spots / area of star) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)).

The relative change would be delta F / F0 = (area of spots / area of star) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)).

But the area of the star is 4πR², and the area of the spots is 0.4π R².

So the fraction is (0.4π R²) / (4π R²) ) = 0.4 / 4 = 0.1. So 10% of the star's surface is spotted.

Wait, wait, the star's surface area is 4π R². The spotted area is on one hemisphere, which is 2π R², and 20% of that is 0.4π R². So the fraction of the entire star's surface that is spotted is 0.4π R² /4π R² = 0.1, or 10%.

So the relative change in flux when the entire spotted area is visible is:

delta F_rel = 0.1 * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)).

But wait, this is the maximum change in flux when the entire spotted area is visible. Because when the star rotates, the amount of spotted area visible varies. So the maximum dip is when the entire 10% of the star's surface (the spotted area) is visible.

But perhaps the problem is considering the maximum dip as the amplitude of the brightness variation, which would be when the entire spotted area is blocking the maximum possible light. Alternatively, for the planet transit, the dip is when the planet is directly in front of the star, blocking a fraction (R_planet / R_star)^2 of the star's light.

Wait, but the problem states that the observed brightness variation due to the spots is the same as the variation caused by a planet transit. So the amplitude of the brightness change (delta F) caused by the spots must be equal to that caused by the planet.

So setting delta F_spot = delta F_planet.

So, the delta F_spot is the maximum dip when the entire spotted area is visible, which is 0.1 * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)).

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake here. The total flux from the star is F0 = sigma Teff^4 * (4π Rstar^2). The spotted area contributes less flux: F_spot = sigma T_spot^4 * (0.4π Rstar^2). So the total flux when the spots are visible is F = F0 - (F0 - F_spot), but no, that's not the right way to model it.

Wait, let me think again. The unspotted part of the star is F_unspotted = sigma Teff^4 * (4π Rstar^2 - 0.4π Rstar^2) = sigma Teff^4 * (3.6π Rstar^2).

The spotted part contributes F_spots = sigma T_spot^4 * 0.4π Rstar^2.

So the total flux when the spots are visible is F = F_unspotted + F_spots = sigma Teff^4 * 3.6π Rstar^2 + sigma T_spot^4 * 0.4π Rstar^2.

The total flux without spots would be F0 = sigma Teff^4 *4π Rstar^2.

So the change in flux when the spots are visible is delta F = F0 - F = sigma Teff^4 *4π Rstar^2 - [sigma Teff^4 *3.6π Rstar^2 + sigma T_spot^4 *0.4π Rstar^2 ].

Simplify this:

delta F = sigma Teff^4 * (4π Rstar^2 - 3.6π Rstar^2) - sigma T_spot^4 *0.4π Rstar^2

= sigma Teff^4 * 0.4 π Rstar^2 - sigma T_spot^4 *0.4 π Rstar^2

= 0.4 π Rstar^2 sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

The relative change is delta F / F0 = [0.4 π Rstar^2 sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / [4 π Rstar^2 sigma Teff^4 ]

Simplify:

0.4 /4 * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4

= 0.1 * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4))

So the relative change is 0.1 * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)).

Now, the delta F_rel is this value. But this is the maximum dip when all the spots are visible. That's the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots.

When the star rotates, the brightness varies between F0 and F0 - delta F. So the amplitude is delta F_rel.

Now, the planet transit amplitude is (R_planet / R_star)^2. So we set:

(R_planet / R_star)^2 = 0.1 * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4))

We can compute the right-hand side.

Given Teff = 6000 K, T_spot = 5000 K.

Compute (T_spot / Teff) = 5000 /6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

Compute (T_spot / Teff)^4 = (5/6)^4.

Compute that:

5^4 = 625, 6^4=1296 → 625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 ≈ 0.517747.

Now, multiply by 0.1:

0.1 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.0517747.

So the planet's radius ratio squared is approximately 0.05177.

Take square root: sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275, or ~0.23.

Wait, but wait a second. The options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, 0.23 isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the math:

(T_spot / Teff) = 5000 /6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(5/6)^4 = (5^4)/(6^4) = 625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

0.1 * 0.517747 = 0.0517747.

sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275, which is approximately 0.23.

But the options don't have 0.23. The closest option is C) ~0.11 and D) ~0.32. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing flux changes. Let me think again. The star's brightness variation due to the spots isn't just a dip in flux when the spots are visible. Because the spots are cooler, their presence reduces the total flux. But when the star rotates, the spots come into view, so the flux decreases. When the spots are on the far side, the flux is higher because they're not blocking any light.

Wait, no. The star's flux when the spots are on the near side is lower than when they are on the far side. So when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F = F0 * (1 - 0.1 * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4))).

Wait, but the amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between F_max and F_min.

Wait, F_max is when no spots are visible (the unspotted hemisphere is fully visible), so F_max = F0.

F_min is when all the spots are visible, F_min = F0 - delta_F.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the spotted area is on the front hemisphere, when the star is viewed from Earth, the entire surface is a mix of spotted and unspotted regions. Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it too much.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to model the brightness variation as the star's disk changing due to the spots.

Wait, another approach: the brightness variation caused by the spots would be similar to a planet transit, where the planet blocks some of the star's light. So the amplitude of the variation is the same when the planet's area is R_p^2, and the star's area is R_s^2.

But wait, the problem is that the spots' effect isn't just a uniform reduction; it's a modulation as the spots rotate. So the maximum dip is when the maximum amount of spotted area is in front of us.

Wait, perhaps the effective area of the spots as seen from Earth is a circle with radius equal to the radius of the hemisphere, but that's not quite right.

Wait, maybe I should think of the star as having a brightness that varies sinusoidally as the spots rotate into and out of view. The amplitude of this sine wave would be the maximum dip in brightness.

Wait, but in reality, the light curve might have a more complex shape, but perhaps for the purposes of this problem, it's approximated as a sine wave with amplitude equal to the maximum dip.

So the maximum dip is when the entire spotted area is in front of us. The dip in flux is (area_spotted * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)) / (4π R² * Teff^4).

Wait, that's similar to what I calculated earlier. So the dip is (0.1) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)).

Wait, but earlier I found that this was approximately 0.05177, which is about 5% dip. So the amplitude is 5%.

The planet's transit amplitude is (R_p/R_s)^2. So if (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.05177, then R_p/R_s = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275 or ~0.23.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate (5/6)^4.

5^4 is 625, 6^4 is 1296. 625/1296 is approximately 0.48225. So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

0.1 * 0.51775 = 0.051775.

Hmm, same result.

So the planet's radius ratio is sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275.

Looking at the options, the closest is D) ~0.32, but that's larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation. The area of the spots is 20% of the hemisphere. So 20% of 2πR² is 0.4π R². So the total area of the star is 4π R².

So the fraction is 0.4π R² /4π R² = 0.1.

So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the calculation should be considering the brightness change when the spots are transiting (so, the star's brightness goes down by delta F), while the planet's transit also causes a dip of the same delta F.

So our calculation gives the planet radius as ~0.2275 Rstar. But none of the options are close to that.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let's think differently.

Alternative approach: the brightness variation caused by the spots is due to the spots' temperature being lower. So when spots are visible, the star's overall brightness is lower. The amplitude of the variation is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the variation in brightness due to the rotation, which is a sinusoidal function. The amplitude of this function would be the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness divided by two. Because the maximum is when the spots are on the far side (so F = F0), and the minimum when the spots are on the near side (F = F_min).

So the half-amplitude is (F0 - F_min)/2.

Alternatively, perhaps the variation is symmetric around F0, so the amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/2.

Wait, but when the star is viewed edge-on, the spots would be fully visible on one side and not on the other. So perhaps the maximum brightness is when the unspotted side is facing us, and the minimum when the spotted side is facing us.

So F_max = F0 * (1 - f) + f * (F_unspotted per unit area) ?

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated, and I should look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be modeled using the concept of the "brightness variation" caused by the spots as if it were a planet. So the amplitude of the brightness variation would be the same as a planet of radius R_p causing a dip of (R_p/R_s)^2.

So we set (R_p/R_s)^2 = delta F_spot.

Wait, but earlier calculation gives delta F_spot as 0.05177, which would make R_p/R_s ≈0.2275, which is ~0.23. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the equation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the spots produce a larger dip than the planet's. Let me compute the planet's R_p.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fractional change in flux for both the spot and the planet.

Wait, the fractional change in flux due to the planet is (R_p/R_s)^2.

Fractional flux change due to spots is when a certain area is blocked, but the spots are cooler, so they contribute less flux. So the flux change is (area fraction) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4.

So, delta F_spot = (0.1) * (1 - (5000/6000)^4) ≈ 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4) ≈ 0.1 * (1 - 625/1296) ≈ 0.1 * (671/1296) ≈ 0.1 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.05177.

So the planet's R_p/R_s is sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers that the entire hemisphere is not just 10% of the star's surface but that the spots are on one hemisphere, so when viewed from Earth, the maximum area of the spots that can be viewed is half the star's surface.

Wait, no. The star's entire surface is 4π R². One hemisphere is 2π R². So the maximum area of the spotted region that can be visible is 2π R² * 0.2 = 0.4π R². So the maximum area is 0.4π R², which is 10% of the star's total area.

So I think my earlier calculation is correct.

But if the answer isn't among the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the star's brightness variation as the same as the planet's, but the planet's effect is to block the flux, while the spots' effect is to lower the flux when the spots are in view. So the amplitude for the spot effect is the maximum dip, which is (area_spots / area_star) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)), which is 0.1*(1 - (5/6)^4) ≈ 0.05177.

The planet's amplitude is (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.05177 → R_p/R_s ≈ 0.2275.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the spots as bright regions, but that's unlikely because they're called dark spots.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the spots as hotter regions, but the problem says they are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K. So spots are 5000 K.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation due to the spots as a modulation, not a dip. So the amplitude is the difference between when the spots are at the limb and when they are at the center.

Wait, when a spot is at the center (maximum visible area), the flux is F0 - (0.4π R²) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) * sigma.

When the spot is at the limb, only a small part is visible. So perhaps the change in flux is the difference between these two.

But this complicates the calculation, and perhaps the problem simplifies it by considering the maximum dip.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the star's brightness variation as a combination of the spots' coverage and their temperature.

Wait, perhaps the approach should be to compute the change in flux when a spot is transiting, similar to a planet. But perhaps the star's spots aren't causing a dip in flux but a change in the star's overall flux as seen from Earth due to their rotation.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Hmm, 0.32 is option D, which is about 0.32. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the (5/6)^4 calculation. Let me compute it more accurately.

5/6 is approximately 0.833333.

0.833333^4:

0.8333^2 = 0.694444.

0.694444^2 = (approx 0.6944 *0.6944) = let's compute:

0.6 *0.6 = 0.36

0.6 * 0.0944= 0.05664

0.0944 *0.6= 0.05664

0.0944 *0.0944 ≈0.00891

Adding up: 0.36 +0.05664 +0.05664 +0.00891 ≈ 0.48219.

So (5/6)^4 = 625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

0.1 * 0.517747 = 0.0517747.

So the planet's R_p/R_s is sqrt(0.05177) = approximately 0.2275.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are not uniformly distributed but are on one hemisphere, so the variation in brightness is a function of the spot's visibility as the star rotates. So the amplitude of the brightness variation would be the difference between when the maximum and minimum amounts of the spotted area are visible.

Wait, perhaps the maximum dip isn't 0.1*(1 - (5/6)^4) but something else. Maybe the area visible when the spot is at the center is different than when it's at the edge.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should be done using the relative brightness when the spot is at the center vs. when it's at the edge, leading to a different amplitude.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the effective area of the spots as seen from Earth is a circle with radius R.

Wait, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should think about the options and see which one makes sense.

The options are much smaller than 0.23. The closest is C) ~0.11 and D) ~0.32.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should be (area fraction) * (1 - (T_spot / Teff))^2, not to the fourth power. But that doesn't make sense because flux is proportional to T^4.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering that the star's brightness change is the same as the planet's. So the amplitude is the same, but the method to calculate it is different.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the brightness variation amplitude is (R_p/R_s)^2 = (fraction of the star's surface covered by spots) * (1 - (T_spot/Teff))^2.

No, that doesn't align with the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which uses T^4.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the variation in brightness as the product of the area of the spots and the temperature difference, but that seems incorrect.

Wait, maybe I should compute the ratio of the exoplanet's radius to the star's radius. Let me think about the options.

If the correct answer is option C) ~0.11, then (0.11)^2 is approximately 0.0121. That's much smaller than the 0.0517 we calculated earlier.

Option D) 0.32: (0.32)^2 = 0.1024. That's about twice the 0.0517 we calculated. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, possibly in the area or the temperature ratio.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the initial setup.

The area of the star's surface is 4π R². The area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is 0.4π R² /4π R² = 0.1, or 10%.

The flux from each spot is (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) times the flux from the surrounding area.

So the change in flux when the spots are visible is the area of the spots multiplied by (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)).

So the fractional change is (0.1) * (1 - (5/6)^4) ≈ 0.1 * (1 - 0.48225) = 0.051775.

So the planet's radius ratio squared must be 0.051775.

Taking the square root gives 0.2275, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are not on the front hemisphere but on the entire star's surface. But no, the problem states that only one hemisphere is spotty.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for a calculation error.

Wait, wait, perhaps the effective area of the spots is 20% of the entire star's surface, not 20% of a hemisphere. But the problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the entire star's surface area is 4π R². One hemisphere is 2π R², and 20% of that is 0.4π R². So the total area is 0.4π R², which is 10% of the total surface area.

So that's correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the hemisphere's area is 2π R², and the filling factor is 20% of that, so 0.4π R². Then, when the star rotates, the visible area of the spots varies from 0 to 0.4π R².

But perhaps the brightness variation is calculated based on the maximum change in flux, which would be when the entire 0.4π R² is visible. So the amplitude would be (0.4π R²) / (4π R²) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)) = 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4) ≈0.05177.

So the planet's R_p/R_s would be sqrt(0.05177) ≈0.2275.

But again, the options don't include this. So perhaps the correct approach is to find which option, when squared, gives approximately 0.05177.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 0.11 → 0.0121.

Option D: 0.32 → 0.1024.

Hmm, 0.32^2 is 0.1024, which is about double 0.05177.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's entire surface is being modulated, not just the hemisphere. But that's not what the question states.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the variation in brightness when the star is viewed edge-on, so that the entire hemisphere's spots come into view as the star rotates. In that case, the amplitude would be the difference between when the spots are fully visible and when they're not.

Wait, but I'm not making progress here. Perhaps I should look for which option, when squared, gives approximately 5% of the star's light.

Wait, 0.05 is 5% of the star's light. So (0.2275)^2 is about 5%.

Looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but the closest is option C) ~0.11, which is 1.21% when squared, or option D) 0.32, which is 10.24%.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the fraction. Let me recheck.

The area of the star's surface: 4π R².

Area of the spots: 20% of one hemisphere's area → 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

So the fraction is 0.4π R² /4π R² = 0.1 → 10% of the star's surface.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's brightness variation is due to the spots being in a particular position. So the maximum dip is when the spots are fully visible, which is 10% of the star's surface with a temperature ratio of (5/6)^4.

So perhaps I should proceed with the calculation I have, which suggests that the planet's radius is approximately 0.2275 Rstar, but since this isn't an option, perhaps the correct approach is to reevaluate.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is not considering the fourth power of the temperature ratio. Maybe it's taking the square, but that would be incorrect. Let me try it.

If I take (T_spot / Teff)^2 instead of to the fourth power:

(5/6)^2 = 25/36 ≈ 0.6944.

So 1 - 0.6944 = 0.3056.

0.1 * 0.3056 = 0.03056.

sqrt(0.03056) ≈ 0.1748.

Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are not on the hemisphere but on a circle with radius equal to the hemisphere's radius, but that complicates things.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should proceed with the initial calculation, which suggests the answer isn't among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation as the sum of the area and temperature effects, but perhaps the amplitude is (fraction of area) * (Teff - T_spot) / Teff.

But that would be linear in temperature, which isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spots' contribution to the flux as a simple fraction of the total flux, without considering the fourth power. But that would be incorrect, but perhaps that's what's intended.

If I ignore the T^4 dependence, then the change in flux is 0.1 * (1 - (5000/6000)) = 0.1 * (1 - 0.8333) = 0.1 * 0.1667 ≈ 0.01667.

So the planet's radius ratio would be sqrt(0.01667) ≈ 0.129, which is approximately 0.13, close to option C) 0.11.

But that would be a flawed approach because the Stefan-Boltzmann law says flux is proportional to T^4, not T.

But perhaps the problem expects this approach. Then the answer would be option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the inverse approach, where the amplitude of the brightness variation is (R_p/R_s)^2 = (fraction of area) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)).

So, 0.05177 as the planet's (R_p/R_s)^2. So R_p/R_s ≈ 0.2275.

But the options don't have this, so perhaps the intended answer is option C) 0.11, assuming a miscalculation or a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the area of the spots is 20% of the star's surface, not 10%.

Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So each hemisphere is 2π R², and 20% of that is 0.4π R². So the total area is 0.4π R², which is 10% of the star's surface.

If by mistake, someone assumes that the area is 20% of the star's surface, then the fraction would be 0.2. Then, delta F_spot = 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4) ≈ 0.2 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.1035.

Then, R_p/R_s = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217, which is approximately option D) 0.32.

So perhaps the intended correct answer is D) ~0.32, assuming that the area fraction is 20% of the entire star's surface.

But according to the problem statement, it's 20% of one hemisphere, making it 10% of the entire star's surface.

Hmm. I'm not sure, but given the options, perhaps the intended answer is D) ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's spotted hemisphere, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Equal to the Sun, \( R_{\text{star}} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Temperature of spots: \( T_{\text{spot}} = T_{\text{eff}} - 1000 = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's brightness variation is caused by the rotational modulation of the spotted hemisphere.
   - The amplitude of this variation depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference relative to the rest of the star.

3. **Exoplanet Brightness Variation**:
   - The amplitude of brightness variation caused by an exoplanet is proportional to \( \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 \).

### Analysis:
1. **Area of Spots**:
   - The total surface area of the star is \( 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - One hemisphere has an area of \( 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \), and 20% of this hemisphere is covered in spots:
     \[
     \text{Area of spots} = 0.2 \times 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2.
     \]
   - The fraction of the star's total surface area covered by spots is:
     \[
     f = \frac{0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2}{4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2} = 0.1 \, (10\%).
     \]

2. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:
   - The flux from the star is proportional to the Stefan-Boltzmann law: \( F \propto T^4 \).
   - The fractional change in flux when the spots are visible is:
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{spot}} = f \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right).
     \]
   - Substituting \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \):
     \[
     \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 = \frac{625}{1296} \approx 0.48225.
     \]
   - Thus:
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{spot}} = 0.1 \cdot \left( 1 - 0.48225 \right) = 0.1 \cdot 0.51775 \approx 0.051775.
     \]

3. **Exoplanet Radius**:
   - The brightness variation caused by the exoplanet is proportional to \( \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 \).
   - Setting \( \Delta F_{\text{spot}} = \Delta F_{\text{planet}} \), we solve:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.051775.
     \]
   - Taking the square root:
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx \sqrt{0.051775} \approx 0.2275.
     \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated value of \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx 0.2275 \) does not match any of the provided options exactly.
   - Among the options, the closest match is **D) ~0.32**, which corresponds to a slightly higher planet-to-star radius ratio than calculated. This discrepancy may arise from approximations or assumptions in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
Given the options, the best match to the calculated value is **D) ~0.32**.
