Okay, so I have this question about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I need to figure out which equation correctly relates the temperatures T1 and T2. Let me think through this carefully.

The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in LTE, which is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, meaning I can probably use the Boltzmann equation here.

Right, the Boltzmann distribution equation. I remember it relates the number of particles in different energy states to the temperature. The formula is something like N2/N1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Since E2 is higher than E1, the exponent will be negative, so N2 is less than N1.

Wait, in this case, the excitation level is twice as excited in star_1. So for star_1, N1 (excited) is twice that of star_2. Let me clarify: The ratio N1/N2 is 2, where N1 is star_1 and N2 is star_2. Or wait, no, maybe I should think of it as the ratio of the populations. Let me get this right. The problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited", so maybe N1 (excited) / N1 (ground) is twice N2 (excited) / N2 (ground). Not sure, perhaps it's just that the ratio between the two stars is 2:1.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is saying that (number in excited state in star_1) is twice that in star_2's excited state. But I'm not entirely certain. Maybe the given statement can be interpreted as the excitation ratio being 2:1 between the two stars for the same energy level. Wait, maybe it's the ratio of the excited state to the ground state in each star.

Wait, let's think again. The question states: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So perhaps (N1_excited / N1_ground) = 2 * (N2_excited / N2
