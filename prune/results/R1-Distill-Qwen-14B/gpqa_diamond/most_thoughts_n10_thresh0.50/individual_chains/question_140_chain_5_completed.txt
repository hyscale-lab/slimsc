Okay, I need to solve this chemistry problem. Let's start by breaking down the question step by step. So, the question is about a reaction involving substance X and liquid Y. Let me jot down the given information.

First, substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which is near room temperature. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Additionally, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it has an analog that's very close.

I think I need to figure out what X, Y, W, G, and B are. Let me start by identifying these substances.

The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. That means the molecule is either H2O (but that's two atoms, not a molecule with same n and p for each atom). Wait, wait, the molecule itself has same number of neutrons and protons. Let me think: common gases that are products of such reactions. Maybe CO2? No, because C has 6 protons. O has 8, so each CO2 molecule would have (6+8*2) protons. But wait, the molecule as a whole's total neutrons and protons? Or each atom? The question says the molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. Oh, wait, that's the same as saying the molecule is made of atoms where each has equal protons and neutrons. Or maybe the molecule as a whole has equal number of protons and neutrons.

Wait, the molecule of gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let me think of possible gases. Maybe H2? No, because each H is 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Not equal. Or O2: each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if it's the common isotope). So O2 has 2*8=16 protons and 2*8=16 neutrons. So 16 each. So total protons and neutrons would be 32 each. So same, so that's possible. So W might be O2. Alternatively, maybe CO2? Let me check: each C has 6 protons, O has 8. CO2 would have 6 + 2*8 = 22 protons. If each C has 6 neutrons (if it's 12C) and each O has 8 neutrons, then total neutrons would be 6 + 2*8= 22. So same as protons. So CO2 would have 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So that fits. So W could be CO2 or O2.

Hmm. Another possibility: H2O. Wait, H2O has H (1p, 0n) and O (8p, 8n). So total protons: 2+8=10. Neutrons: 0 +8=8. Not same. So not H2O.

Wait, another thought. Maybe CH4? No, that's a gas but less likely in this reaction. Let me think of the reaction.

The reaction is violent between X and Y. That makes me think of reactions like metals reacting with acid (violent, like HCl), or maybe something like a Grignard reaction? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal reacting with water or acid.

Wait, precipitate G forms. When heated, it releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K, which is around 4°C. Hmm, 277K is 4 degrees Celsius, which is the melting point of something. What solid has a melting point near there? Maybe water ice? But no, because ice melts at 273 K (0°C). Wait, 277 is about 4°C. Hmm, could it be something else? Maybe it's a different substance.

Wait, another angle: the product of a keto acid and X has 2 oxygen atoms. Keto acid suggests something like acetic acid, which is CH3COOH. The reaction with X (perhaps Na metal) would produce something. Wait, if X is a metal like sodium, then acetic acid would react to produce sodium acetate, which is CH3COONa. That has 2 oxygen atoms per molecule. So that fits. So if X is sodium, perhaps.

Wait, but let's think again. The problem says that a certain keto acid reacts with X to give a product with 2 O atoms. So the product would have 2 O atoms per molecule. If X is Na, then in the reaction with acetic acid (CH3COOH), we get Na+ and CH3COO^- (sodium acetate). Each sodium acetate has 2 O in the acetate ion. So that's correct.

So if X is sodium, then when it reacts with water (if Y is water), it would produce NaOH, H2, and heat. Wait, no, sodium reacts with water to produce NaOH, H2 gas, and heat. The gas would be H2. But earlier, I thought W might be O2 or CO2. So that's a contradiction.

Wait, but if Y is not water but another liquid. Let me think again. What if Y is an acid, say HCl. Then X is a metal, which reacts violently with HCl to produce H2 gas. So W is H2. But earlier, H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons, so protons 2, neutrons 0. That doesn't fit the condition of the same number. So if W is H2, then it wouldn't fit.

Hmm. Let me think of another possible W. Maybe CO2? But how would that form?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between a carbonate and an acid. But then, perhaps X is sodium carbonate, but that doesn't fit the initial condition of X having a heavier isotope.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and a solution of a salt, like a double displacement. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe X is sodium, Y is ethanol. Then, sodium reacts with ethanol to produce NaOEt (sodium ethoxide), H2 gas. But again, H2 gas doesn't fit the W condition.

Wait, but let's think about the precipitate G. When X reacts with Y, a precipitate forms. What could that be? If X is sodium and Y is a solution of a salt, maybe like copper sulfate, which would give Cu(OH)2 precipitate, but that's more of a basic solution.

Alternatively, perhaps X is sodium and Y is a nitrate solution. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate solution. If X is sodium hydroxide, but that may not fit.

Wait, maybe X is an alkali metal, say sodium, and Y is an acid, like sulfuric acid. Then the reaction would produce Na2SO4, water, and H2 gas. But H2 doesn't fit.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach. The melting point of B is near 277 K (4°C). What solid has a melting point near there? Maybe water ice, but that's 273 K. Hmm. Maybe another substance, like ammonium chloride? No, that's higher. Let me think of a different solid. Perhaps a salt that crystallizes as a hydrate. Alternatively, maybe it's a different solid.

Wait, another thought: when G is heated, it releases B. So G is a compound that upon heating decomposes into B and something else. What if G is a carbonate? For example, sodium carbonate decomposes upon heating to produce sodium oxide and CO2. But then B would be CO2, which is a gas, not a solid. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps G is a hydroxide, which upon heating loses water. For example, sodium hydroxide doesn't decompose easily, but maybe another hydroxide. Or perhaps G is a sulfate, but that's not likely to release a solid on heating.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G when heated releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. So B is a solid at that temperature. What solid is that? Maybe B is sodium oxide? No, sodium oxide is Na2O, which is a solid but I'm not sure about its melting point. Alternatively, it could be something like NaOH, but that's a liquid around 1400°C, so that's too high.

Wait, perhaps B is sodium chloride. No, NaCl's melting point is around 800°C. Hmm. Alternatively, B could be a different compound. Maybe B is a metal? No, because the question says it's a product upon heating G. Wait, perhaps G is a carbonate, and B is CO2 plus a metal oxide. But then, the metal oxide would be a solid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the product of the reaction between X and a keto acid has 2 O atoms. Let's say the keto acid is something like acetic acid (CH3COOH). When it reacts with X (maybe a base or a metal), the product, perhaps sodium acetate (CH3COONa), which has 2 O per molecule. So if X is sodium, then that fits.

So if X is sodium, what is Y? Let's say Y is a solution of something. Sodium reacts with water violently to produce NaOH, H2 gas, and heat. So W would be H2. Does H2 fit the condition that the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons? Let's see: H2 has 2 H atoms. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So total protons: 2. Total neutrons: 0. So 2 != 0. So that doesn't fit. Therefore, W can't be H2. So if X is sodium, Y can't be water because the gas produced is H2, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate solution. Let me think: sodium reacting with carbonate? Not sure. Or maybe Y is an alcohol, but that's not likely to produce a precipitate.

Hmm, perhaps X isn't sodium. Let me think of another possibility. What if X is something like potassium? Or maybe a heavier element.

Wait, another thought: the gas W must have the same number of protons and neutrons in the molecule. So, for example, a molecule of 18O (but that's just one atom). Wait, no, W is a gas, so it's likely to be a diatomic or triatomic molecule.

Wait, another possibility: W could be O2. Let's see: O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (assuming 16O). So O2 has 16 protons (8*2) and 16 neutrons (8*2). So protons and neutrons are both 16. So that fits. So W could be O2. So reaction between X and Y produces O2 gas.

Which reactions produce O2? Decomposition of peroxides, or perhaps reactions involving chlorates. Like when a metal reacts with chlorate. For example, potassium chlorate decomposes on heating to produce KCl and O2. But in the problem, the reaction is between X and Y. So perhaps X is a chlorate, and Y is a catalyst, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, maybe X is hydrogen peroxide, which when reacted with a metal (like MnO2 as catalyst) produces O2. But then, X would be H2O2. But the question says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one element. H2O2 has H and O. Heavier isotope would be O-18 perhaps. But I don't know if that's relevant.

Wait, but the precipitate G forms. So what if the reaction is between X (like a metal) and Y (like a solution of a salt), producing a precipitate and O2 gas.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction where peroxide is present. For example, sodium peroxide (Na2O2) reacting with water to produce O2. Let me think: Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + O2↑. So in this case, X would be Na2O2, Y is water. Then W is O2. Then the precipitate G would be NaOH, which is soluble. Wait, no, NaOH is soluble. So that can't form a precipitate.

Hmm. Maybe another reaction. Let me think of metals reacting with certain solutions to form precipitates and O2. Wait, perhaps a metal like magnesium reacting with a nitrate solution. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate, and Y is a strong acid, producing CO2 gas. So W is CO2. For CO2, each molecule has 1 C and 2 O. C has 6 protons, O has 8. So protons: 6 + 2*8 =22. Neutrons: if C is 12C (6 neutrons), and O is 16O (8 neutrons), then total neutrons are 6 + 2*8=22. So same as protons. So CO2 fits. So W is CO2.

So if W is CO2, then the reaction between X and Y produces CO2 gas. That would happen in a reaction between a carbonate and an acid. So X could be a carbonate, and Y is an acid. But the question states that X incorporates a heavier isotope. So maybe X is sodium carbonate, and Y is hydrochloric acid. Reaction: Na2CO3 + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + CO2↑ + H2O. So the precipitate G would be NaCl, which is soluble. Hmm, that doesn't form a precipitate. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate of a metal that forms an insoluble chloride. For example, calcium carbonate reacts with HCl to produce CO2, water, and CaCl2. CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Y isn't an acid but another solution. For instance, if X is a carbonate and Y is a solution of a metal hydroxide. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a salt that reacts with X to form a precipitate and release CO2. Let's think of a reaction where a carbonate reacts with a salt to produce another carbonate and release CO2. Wait, like displacement reaction. For example, if Y is a solution of a lead nitrate and X is sodium carbonate, the reaction would produce lead carbonate precipitate and sodium nitrate, but no CO2. So that's not it.

Hmm. Maybe another approach. The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. B's melting point is ~277 K, which is about 4°C. So B is a solid at that temperature. Wait, 277 K is 4°C, which is just above the melting point of ice (0°C). So B could be something that's solid near that temperature. Maybe a salt like ammonium chloride? No, that's more volatile. Alternatively, maybe B is sodium chloride, but that melts at 800°C.

Wait, perhaps B is a different compound. Let me think about the decomposition of the precipitate. For example, if G is a carbonate, heating it might produce B as CO2 and a metal oxide. But we need B to be a solid. Alternatively, if G is a sulfate, heating might not do much. Or perhaps G is a hydroxide that loses water upon heating.

Wait, let me think of a common decomposition reaction. For example, CaCO3 decomposes into CaO and CO2 upon heating. CaO is a solid, and its melting point is much higher than 277 K. So that's not it.

Another possibility: maybe G is a carbonate that, upon heating, releases CO2 and a metal oxide. But the metal oxide would remain as a solid. So B would be CO2, but CO2 is a gas, not a solid. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound. Wait, another thought: maybe B is a hydrate. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3·10H2O) would have a lower melting point. But I'm not sure about its melting point.

Alternatively, maybe B is a different type of compound, like a protein, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps B is a polymer, but that's unclear. Alternatively, maybe B is a salt that is solid at 277 K. For example, ammonium chloride has a melting point around 337 K, which is higher than 277. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is a different element, like sulfur. Sulfur has a melting point around 318 K, which is higher than 277. Hmm.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about the substance X. The question says that X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. That makes me think of sodium metal, which is used in various reactions, like in the Birch reduction. Alternatively, perhaps it's another metal like lithium or potassium.

Wait, another thought: if X is a metal, the reaction with Y (an acid) produces a salt, H2 gas, and a precipitate. Wait, but earlier I thought H2 doesn't fit the W condition. So perhaps Y isn't an acid but another liquid.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution that when reacts with X produces a precipitate and releases CO2. For example, if X is sodium carbonate and Y is a solution of a metal nitrate with lower activity. But then, the precipitate would be a carbonate, which is more soluble than the nitrate. So maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate is a sulfide. For example, if X is a metal sulfide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to the product of the reaction with a keto acid. If X is sodium, then reacting with a keto acid like acetic acid would give sodium acetate, which has 2 oxygen atoms per molecule. So that fits. So X is probably sodium.

But then, if X is sodium, the reaction with Y must produce W as a gas where W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Earlier, when sodium reacts with water, W is H2, which doesn't fit. So perhaps Y is something else.

Wait, maybe Y is a peroxide. Sodium peroxide (Na2O2) reacts with water to produce O2. Let's see: 2 Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaOH + O2↑. So in this case, W is O2, which as I thought earlier, fits the condition (protons and neutrons equal in the molecule). So X would be Na2O2.

But wait, the question says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Sodium peroxide is Na2O2. Oxygen usually has a common isotope O-16 (8 protons, 8 neutrons) and O-18. So if X is Na2O2, and it incorporates a heavier isotope, perhaps one of the O atoms is O-18. So that fits.

So Y is water. Then, X is Na2O2. The reaction produces NaOH, O2 gas, and H2O. So W is O2. Then, the precipitate G is NaOH, but NaOH is soluble, so that doesn't fit. So that can't be right. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps another reaction. If X is Na2O2 and Y is something else. Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a nitrate, and the reaction produces a precipitate. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is ethanol. Sodium peroxide reacts with ethanol to produce NaOEt, O2, and H2O. But again, no precipitate.

Wait, maybe the precipitate comes from another part of the reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between Na2O2 and another compound, like a metal chloride, to produce a precipitate and O2. For example, if Y is a solution of BaCl2, then Na2O2 might react to form BaO2 (which is a precipitate) and NaCl, and release O2. But I'm not sure about the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe X is something else entirely.

Wait, another approach: the product of X and a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. If X is a base, like NaOH, then reacting with a keto acid (like acetic acid) would produce sodium acetate (which has 2 O) and water. So that fits. But then, in the reaction between X and Y, if X is NaOH and Y is something else, perhaps a carbonate, then the reaction would produce CO2 and a precipitate.

Wait, but NaOH is a strong base and would react with Y, which could be a carbonate. For example, NaOH + Na2CO3 → 2 Na2CO3? No, that's not a reaction. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a nitrate solution, but no precipitate would form.

Hmm. Let me summarize what I have so far.

- X is possibly a metal or a peroxide, as it reacts with Y to produce a gas W which is O2 or CO2.

- The product of X and a keto acid has 2 O atoms, suggesting X is a base like NaOH, which reacts with acetic acid to form sodium acetate.

- X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, which fits with sodium metal or sodium hydroxide.

- Y is a liquid: perhaps water or an acid.

If I can't figure out all the compounds, perhaps I should proceed to the part about the atomic masses.

The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within X, considering all isotopes.

So X is a compound, so let's think of its elements.

If X is Na2O2, then the elements are Na and O.

Sodium has atomic mass around 23, oxygen is 16.

But wait, if X is Na2O2, then the lightest element is Na (23), the heaviest is O (16). Wait, no, O is lighter than Na. So the lightest element is O, the heaviest is Na. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, Na is about 23, O is 16. So the lightest element is O, the heaviest is Na.

Wait, but no, the question says the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So the lightest element would be the one with the lowest atomic number, which is O (8) vs Na (11). So O is lighter. So their atomic masses are 16 and 23. So total is 16 +23=39. But the options don't have 39. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, another possibility: if X is sodium (Na), which is an element, not a compound. Then the elements present are just Na. But the question says 'elements present within X', which would be just Na. So the lightest and heaviest elements would be the same, so sum would be 23. But 23 isn't an option (options are 35,25,31,29).

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. Let's think again.

Wait, another approach: the product of X and a keto acid has 2 O atoms. If X is NaOH, then reacting with acetic acid (CH3COOH) gives sodium acetate (CH3COONa) and water. Sodium acetate has 2 O in the acetate ion. So that fits. So X is NaOH. Then, when NaOH reacts with Y, what could Y be?

If Y is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, but then Y would be solid, not a liquid. Alternatively, Y could be a hydrochloric acid solution. Then, the reaction would be: NaOH + HCl → NaCl + H2O. No gas produced, so W wouldn't be anything. That doesn't fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a nitrate. But then, what's the reaction?

Wait, perhaps Y is a carbonate solution. Let me think: if X is NaOH and Y is a carbonate, like K2CO3, then the reaction would be: 2 NaOH + K2CO3 → 2 Na2CO3 + K2O. No gas is produced, so W wouldn't form. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a sulfate. But I don't think that would produce a gas.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a chloride. Then, X is NaOH, which wouldn't react much with chloride solutions. Unless it's a double displacement, but that would require the other product to be a precipitate. For example, NaOH + CuSO4 → Cu(OH)2 (precipitate) + Na2SO4. So W would be nothing—no gas. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a hydroxide solution. But that's not likely to produce a gas.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck on this part, but perhaps I should move forward to the part where I have to calculate the atomic masses.

Wait, the question says that X 'incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements'. So if X is Na2O2, then one of the O atoms is a heavier isotope, like O-18. So the oxygen would have a higher mass. But for the purpose of the question, when calculating the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes, I need to sum the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses.

Wait, the elements in X are Na and O. The lightest element (in terms of atomic number) is O, which has an atomic mass of about 16. The heaviest is Na, which is about 23. So 16 +23=39. But none of the options are 39. So perhaps X is a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a different substance. Let me think again.

If X is a chloride, like KCl, but I don't see how that would fit.

Wait, another thought: the precipitate G forms when X and Y react. G is heated to produce B. If B's melting point is near 277 K, perhaps it's a hydrate. For example, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) has a melting point around 270 K. Let me check: actually, sodium bicarbonate decomposes at about 270 K (around -3°C) into sodium carbonate, CO2, and water. So if G is sodium carbonate, but that's a solid. Hmm.

Wait, if G is NaHCO3, and upon heating it decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. Then B could be Na2CO3, which has a melting point around 850°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound. For example, if G is a hydroxide that when heated loses water, producing a metal oxide. But the metal oxide would have a higher melting point.

Wait, maybe B is something like glucose, but that doesn't fit.

I'm going in circles. Let me try to think of another approach.

Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's similar to its analog. Sodium metal is a reagent, used in Birch reductions and other reactions. So X is likely sodium.

So, if X is sodium, Y is a solution, perhaps water. The reaction is 2 Na + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + H2↑. W is H2, which doesn't fit the condition. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a peroxide solution, but that's not a liquid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Y is alcohol. Sodium reacts with ethanol to produce sodium ethoxide and H2. W is H2 again, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate solution. Sodium reacts with carbonate? No, sodium is a metal and would displace other metals, but that's not likely to produce a precipitate.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the problem differently. Let's approach the calculation part.

The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So for example, if X has elements A and B, where A is lighter and B is heavier, sum their atomic masses.

Looking at the options: 35,25,31,29.

Looking for pairs of elements. Let's think:

- Lightest element: H (1), heaviest: Cl (35.5). Sum ≈36.5 → not matching any option.

- Lightest: C (12), heaviest: Cl (35). Sum ≈47. Not matching.

- Li (7) and Ca (40). Sum 47. No.

Wait, what about O (16) and F (19)? Sum 35. That's option A)35.

But would X have O and F? Maybe if X is NaF, but that's a salt. But the reaction with Y would produce what?

Alternatively, perhaps X contains O and Na. Sum 16 +23=39. Not an option.

Another option: C (12) and O (16). Sum 28. Not an option.

Wait, another possibility: the lightest element is H (1), heaviest is Cl (35.5). Sum is about 36.5 → but option A is 35.

Alternatively, perhaps the elements are F (19) and Cl (35.5). Sum is about 54.5, which isn't an option.

Wait, another approach: think of the elements in X as O and Cl. O (16) and Cl (35.5). Sum ≈51.5. No.

Alternatively, maybe X contains Na (23) and Cl (35). Sum 58. No.

Wait, perhaps the elements are H and Cl. Sum is 1 +35.5=36.5, but option A is 35. Close, but not exact.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the elements are C (12) and F (19). Sum 31. That's option C)31.

If X is something that contains C and F, like carbon tetrafluoride, but that's a gas. Not sure about the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound containing C and F, but I'm not sure how that would fit the reaction scenario.

Wait, perhaps X is something like CH3Cl, but that's a different story.

Alternatively, perhaps the elements are O (16) and F (19). Sum 35. That's option A.

If X contains O and F, like O-F bonds, which is not a common compound, but perhaps in some perfluorinated compounds.

Alternatively, maybe X is a compound with O and Cl. 16 +35=51. Not an option.

Wait, another angle. The product of the reaction of X with a keto acid has 2 O atoms. If X is carbon tetrafluoride (CF4), which has F and C. But reacting with a keto acid... I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is something with two O atoms, like an ester. For example, if X is a base like NaOH, reacting with acetic acid produces sodium acetate, which has 2 O. So X is NaOH, which contains Na and O and H. So the lightest element is H (1) and heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24. Which is not an option.

Wait, but the options don't have 24. The options are 35,25,31,29.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the elements are B (5) and something else. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the elements are N and O. N is 14, O is 16. Sum 30. Not an option.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me think of the options given: 35,25,31,29. Let's see which pairs of elements sum to these.

Option A)35: possibilities are 19 (F) +16 (O)=35. So elements F and O.

Option B)25: Maybe 12 (C) +13 (Al)=25. Or 16 (O) +9 (F)=25. Or 14 (N) +11 (Na)=25.

Option C)31: 16 (O) +15 (P)=31. Or 12 (C) +19 (F)=31.

Option D)29: 14 (N) +15 (P)=29. Or 13 (Al) +16 (O)=29.

So, which pair makes sense in the context of X's properties.

X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. If X contains F and O, perhaps it's something like a perfluorinated compound, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if X is something like NaF (sodium fluoride), which is used as a reagent. Then, the elements are Na (23) and F (19). Sum is 23+19=42, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, if X is a compound containing O and F, but I can't think of a common one.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like CO (carbon monoxide), which is used in certain reactions. CO contains C (12) and O (16). Sum 28. Not an option.

Wait, another thought: the product of X and a keto acid has 2 O atoms. If X is a ketone, but that doesn't fit because X is a reagent.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

From earlier, if X is Na2O2, the elements are Na (23) and O (16). Sum would be 23 +16=39. Not an option.

If X is something else, like K2O2 (potassium peroxide), then sum would be K (39) + O (16)=55. Not an option.

Wait, but another possibility: X is sodium oxide (Na2O). Then, the elements are Na (23) and O (16). Sum 39. Still not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is not a peroxide but something else. Maybe X is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Then, elements are Na (23) and C (12) and O (16). The lightest is C (12), heaviest is Na (23). Sum 35. Oh! That's option A)35.

So, if X is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), which contains Na, C, and O. The lightest element (in terms of atomic mass) is C (12), the heaviest is Na (23). 12 +23=35. So option A is 35.

Does this fit the rest of the problem?

Let me check.

Na2CO3 reacts with Y, which is likely an acid. For example, HCl. Reaction: Na2CO3 + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + CO2↑ + H2O. So W is CO2, which fits the condition (each molecule has 22 p and 22 n, so same).

The precipitate G would be NaCl, but NaCl is soluble. So that's a problem. Therefore, perhaps Y is a different solution.

Wait, another reaction: Na2CO3 reacts with a solution of a metal nitrate with lower activity. For example, if Y is a solution of lead nitrate, then Na2CO3 + Pb(NO3)2 → PbCO3↓ + 2 NaNO3. So precipitate G is PbCO3. Then, when heated, PbCO3 decomposes into PbO and CO2. So B would be PbO, which is a solid. The melting point of PbO is about 898°C, which is way higher than 277 K. That doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a different compound. Let me think: perhaps Y is a solution of a metal hydroxide. For example, Na2CO3 + Cu(OH)2 → CuCO3 + 2 NaOH. CuCO3 is a precipitate. When heated, CuCO3 decomposes into CuO and CO2. So B would be CuO. CuO has a melting point around 2200°C, which is way higher than 277 K.

Hmm. Doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps Y is a carbonate of a metal that when reacted with Na2CO3 forms a precipitate and releases CO2. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a chloride. For example, if Y is a solution of AgNO3, Na2CO3 would react to form Ag2CO3, which is a precipitate. Then, upon heating, Ag2CO3 decomposes into Ag2O and CO2. B would be Ag2O. What's the melting point of Ag2O? It's around 1447°C, still way higher than 277 K.

Hmm. So this approach isn't working.

But considering that the atomic masses sum to 35, which is option A, perhaps that's the intended answer. So I'll go with option A)35.


The problem involves identifying the elements in Substance X and calculating the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X. The key points of analysis are as follows:

1. **Gas W**: The molecule of gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons. This condition is satisfied by CO₂, where each molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. CO₂ is a plausible candidate for W, as it is a common byproduct of reactions involving carbonates and acids.

2. **Substance X**: X is described as a reagent in organic chemistry and incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) fits this description, as it contains sodium (Na), carbon (C), and oxygen (O), and can incorporate a heavier isotope of oxygen (e.g., O-18).

3. **Reaction with Liquid Y**: If X is Na₂CO₃, Y is likely an acid such as HCl. The reaction produces NaCl, CO₂ gas, and water. This aligns with the condition that W is CO₂. However, NaCl is soluble, so the formation of a precipitate G requires further consideration.

4. **Precipitate G and Product B**: When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K (4°C). This suggests B is a solid at this temperature. If G is a carbonate or hydroxide, heating could release CO₂ and leave behind a metal oxide or other solid residue. However, the exact identity of G and B remains unclear.

5. **Atomic Mass Calculation**: The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X are to be calculated. For Na₂CO₃, the lightest element is carbon (C, atomic mass ~12), and the heaviest is sodium (Na, atomic mass ~23). The sum of their atomic masses is 12 + 23 = 35, which matches option A.

Given the analysis, the most plausible answer is that the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X sum to 35.
