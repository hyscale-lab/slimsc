Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and the same goes for their masses—Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured the radial velocities: Star_1 has 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. The question is asking by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So luminosity goes with the square of the radius and the fourth power of the temperature.

Wait, but temperature is related to the peak wavelength via Wien's law. Wien's displacement law states that λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if both stars have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is the same, T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm not so sure. The problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, so their λ_max is the same. So T1 = T2 because λ_max is same. So T1 equals T2.

Wait, but is that correct? Oh, right, Wien's law says λ_max * T = constant, so if λ_max is same, T must be same. So both stars have the same temperature.

But wait, no, it's possible for stars to have different temperatures but same λ_max? No, because λ_max is directly proportional to 1/T. So same λ_max implies same T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the radial velocities part. They measured the radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s. So Star_1 is not
