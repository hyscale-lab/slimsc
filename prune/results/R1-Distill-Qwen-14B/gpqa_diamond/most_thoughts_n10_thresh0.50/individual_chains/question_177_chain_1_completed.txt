Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass is 1.5 times larger, but I'm not sure yet how that plays into it. The important thing is that the peaks of their brightness (the wavelengths at which they appear brightest) are the same according to spectroscopy. Oh wait, that's probably about their blackbody radiation curves. And their radial velocities are given: Star_1 is at 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But I'm not sure how velocity affects this.

The question is asking about the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2. The options are all around ~2.2 to ~2.35, so I need to compute which factor is correct.

First, I remember that the luminosity of a star can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So since both stars are being treated as blackbodies, this should apply.

Wait, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Blackbody radiation peaks at a wavelength given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. Oh, right, because if λ1 = λ2, then T1 = T2. So both stars have the same effective temperature.

Wait, that changes things. So T1 = T2. Because both have the same λ_max. So when calculating their luminosities, since L depends on R² and T⁴, and T is the same for both, the luminosity ratio would be (R1² / R2²) times (T1⁴ / T2⁴), but since T is same, it's just (R1² / R2²).

Star_1's radius is 1.5 times Star_2's, so R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1² = (1.5)^2 R2² = 2.25 R2². So L1/L2 = 2.25. So the luminosity is 2.25 times larger. So why are the options not directly giving 2.25 as an option? Let's check the options.

Options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23. Oh, option A is 2.25. So why is the problem giving all these other options? Did I miss something?

Wait, but the problem also talks about radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. How does that affect anything? Hmm.

Radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. It affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But in this case, the star's own emission (the peak wavelength) is determined by its temperature. Wait, but if a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength is shifted. But the problem says that the stars' own peaks are at the same wavelength. So is that the rest wavelength or the observed wavelength?

Oh, that's an important point. The problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So is this the rest wavelength or the observed wavelength? Because if Star_2 is moving, its observed wavelength would be different.

Wait, so let's think. If Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, its light would be blueshifted. So the observed λ for Star_2 would be shorter than its rest λ. But the problem states that both stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. So in the observed frame, both have the same λ_max. Hmm, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering their rest frames. So the peak wavelengths are the same in their own rest frames. But that would mean their temperatures are the same. But then how does the radial velocity affect anything?

Wait, perhaps the radial velocity affects the observed flux or some other factor, but the problem says the stars' own peak wavelengths are the same. So maybe the radial velocity doesn't come into play for the temperature. Because the peak wavelengths are the same in their own frames, which would imply same T.

But wait, if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed temperature would be higher because of the Doppler shift. Because when a star moves towards us, the emitted light is blueshifted, which would make it appear hotter. So the observed T would be higher. But the problem says the wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ is less, implying a higher T. But the problem says the λ_max is the same, so perhaps the Doppler shift is taken into account.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think more carefully.

The peak wavelengths observed are the same. So, for Star_1, since radial velocity is zero, the observed λ is the same as its rest λ. For Star_2, since it's moving at 700 km/s, the observed λ would be shifted.

Suppose Star_2 is moving towards us. Then using the Doppler shift formula: λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ), where beta is v/c. Since v is 700 km/s, which is much less than c (3e5 km/s), beta is small, but let's compute it.

v = 700e3 m/s. c is 3e8 m/s. So beta = 700e3 / 3e8 ≈ 0.002333.

So the Doppler factor would be sqrt( (1 - 0.002333)/(1 + 0.002333) ) ≈ sqrt( (0.997667)/(1.002333) ) ≈ sqrt(0.99537) ≈ approximately 0.99768.

So λ_observed ≈ 0.99768 * λ_rest. So the observed λ is slightly smaller, meaning that Star_2's light is blueshifted.

Now, the problem states that the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So Star_1's λ_max is equal to Star_2's observed λ_max. So:

λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But λ1_obs is the same as λ1_rest, since Star_1 has no radial velocity (v=0).

λ2_rest is what? Let me denote:

λ1_obs = λ1_rest = λ_rest1,

λ2_obs = λ2_rest * Doppler factor.

And λ1_obs = λ2_obs → λ_rest1 = Doppler * λ_rest2.

So λ_rest2 = λ_rest1 / Doppler.

But since Doppler is approximately 0.99768, then λ_rest2 ≈ λ_rest1 * 1.00233.

So the rest wavelength for Star_2 is longer than that of Star_1 by a factor of about 1.00233. But wait, that would imply that the rest temperature of Star_2 is lower than Star_1's, because T is inversely proportional to λ_rest.

Because T = b / λ_rest.

So T2 = T1 * (λ_rest1 / λ_rest2) = T1 * (1 / 1.00233) ≈ T1 * 0.99768.

So T2 is slightly less than T1.

Wait, but earlier I thought that since both have the same observed λ_max, their rest wavelengths would be different if they have different velocities. So that affects their temperatures.

So the initial assumption that T1=T2 is incorrect, because Star_2's observed λ is same as Star_1's, but because of its velocity, its rest temperature is slightly lower.

So now, when calculating luminosity, both radius and temperature matter.

So let's recompute.

We have:

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴,

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴.

So L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴).

We know R1 = 1.5 R2.

So R1² = (1.5)^2 R2² = 2.25 R2².

So (R1² / R2²) = 2.25.

What about T1 and T2?

From earlier, T2 = T1 * (λ_rest1 / λ_rest2).

Wait, λ_rest2 = λ_rest1 * (1 / Doppler) = λ_rest1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) )

Wait, let me compute the Doppler shift more accurately. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So for Star_2, since it's moving towards us (v positive towards us), λ_obs = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

But λ_obs2 = λ_obs1.

So λ_rest2 = λ_obs1 / [ sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ]

= λ_rest1 / [ sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ]

So T2 = b / λ_rest2 = b / [ λ_rest1 / sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ) ]

= (b / λ_rest1 ) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

But T1 = b / λ_rest1.

So T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Therefore, T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Wait, let me compute this correctly.

Wait, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So T1 / T2 = sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Which is the same as sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So now, beta is 700e3 / (3e5e3) ) = 700/(3e5) = 7e2/(3e5) = 7/(3000) ≈ 0.002333.

So (1 - beta) ≈ 0.997667, (1 + beta) ≈ 1.002333.

So (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ≈ 0.997667 / 1.002333 ≈ approximately 0.99537.

So sqrt(0.99537) ≈ approximately 0.99768.

So T1 / T2 ≈ 0.99768.

Wait, that would mean T1 is slightly less than T2? No, wait. Wait, earlier conclusion was that T2 is lower because Star_2 is moving towards us, which would blueshift its λ, making the observed λ shorter, implying higher temperature. But according to the calculation, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So let's compute that.

(1 + beta)/(1 - beta) = (1.002333)/(0.997667) ≈ 1.00468.

So sqrt(1.00468) ≈ 1.00233.

So T2 = T1 * 1.00233.

So T2 is higher than T1 by 0.233% approximately.

Wait, that makes sense because Star_2 is moving towards us, so its light is blueshifted, so it appears hotter. So T2 is higher than T1.

So, in terms of the luminosity ratio:

L1/L2 = (R1²/R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

We have R1/R2 = 1.5, so R1²/R2² = 2.25.

T1^4 / T2^4 = (T1/T2)^4 = (1 / 1.00233)^4 ≈ (0.99768)^4.

Compute that:

0.99768^2 ≈ (approx 0.99537 as before). Then square that: 0.99537^2 ≈ approx 0.99075.

So (T1^4)/(T2^4) ≈ 0.99075.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99075 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99075 ≈ let's compute that.

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275, and 2.25 * 0.00075 = 0.0016875.

So 2.2275 + 0.0016875 ≈ 2.2291875.

Approximately 2.229. So that's about 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

Wait, but let me calculate more accurately.

Compute (1.00233)^4.

Wait, T2 = T1 * 1.00233, so T1 = T2 * 0.99768.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute (T1 / T2) = 0.99768.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (0.99768)^4.

Compute 0.99768 squared:

0.99768 * 0.99768 = (approx) 0.99768^2.

Let me compute this more accurately.

99768 * 99768.

Wait, alternatively, 0.99768 = 1 - 0.00232.

(1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x + x² when x is small. x=0.00232.

So (0.99768)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.00232) + (0.00232)^2 ≈ 1 -0.00464 + 0.00000538 ≈ 0.99536538.

Then (0.99768)^4 = (0.99768^2)^2 ≈ (0.99536538)^2.

Again, using the approximation (1 - y)^2 ≈ 1 - 2y + y², where y = 0.00463462 (since 1 - 0.99536538 = 0.00463462).

So (0.99536538)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.00463462) + (0.00463462)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00926924 + 0.00002148 ≈ 0.99075224.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.99075224.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99075224 ≈ 2.25 * 0.990752 ≈ let's compute that.

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.000752 ≈ 0.001692.

So adding 2.2275 + 0.001692 ≈ 2.22919.

So approximately 2.229, which is about 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

So the correct answer would be D.


To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \( R \) is the radius, \( T \) is the effective temperature, and \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The problem states that the observed peak wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} \)) of both stars are the same, which implies that their effective temperatures are related through the Doppler effect due to Star_2's radial velocity of 700 km/s.

### Step 1: Relating the observed and rest wavelengths
Using Wien's law, the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

For Star_1, the observed wavelength is the same as its rest wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} \)) because its radial velocity is zero. For Star_2, the observed wavelength is blueshifted due to its motion towards us. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}}
\]

where \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} \) is the ratio of the star's velocity to the speed of light. Substituting \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \), we find:

\[
\beta = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]

Thus:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \approx \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - 0.002333}{1 + 0.002333}} \approx \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \sqrt{0.99537} \approx \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot 0.99768
\]

Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \), we equate the rest wavelengths:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}
\]

Taking the inverse relationship between wavelength and temperature (\( T \propto \frac{1}{\lambda} \)):

\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}
\]

Substituting \( \beta \approx 0.002333 \):

\[
\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta} \approx 1.00468, \quad \sqrt{1.00468} \approx 1.00233
\]

Thus:

\[
T_2 \approx T_1 \cdot 1.00233
\]

### Step 2: Luminosity ratio
The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

We know \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), so:

\[
\frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

For the temperature ratio, since \( T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.00233 \), we have:

\[
\frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4} = \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{1}{1.00233}\right)^4
\]

Approximating \( \frac{1}{1.00233} \approx 0.99768 \):

\[
\left(0.99768\right)^4 \approx 0.99075
\]

Substituting into the luminosity ratio:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.99075 \approx 2.229
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2. Thus, the correct option is:

**Answer: D**
