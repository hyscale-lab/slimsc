Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I need to find the energy, and the options are given. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Oh wait, Li is lithium. The standard notation is that Li-6 has 3 neutrons, right? So the atomic number of Li is 3. So the nucleus is Li-6, which means it has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is ^6Li.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the energy of the collider. Oh right, in particle accelerators, the energy is typically the kinetic energy, but sometimes people refer to the total energy including rest mass. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about that. Wait, in high-energy physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, it's usually the kinetic energy. Or is it the total energy (kinetic plus rest mass energy)? I think for particles moving at relativistic speeds, the energy E is the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy. Because in relativity, E = gamma * m cÂ². So, the energy given in the options would be the total energy, not just kinetic.

Wait, the question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96
