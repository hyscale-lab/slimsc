Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again and think through the steps.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with sodium hydroxide. We're diluting some acetic acid with water and then titrating it with NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Hmm, okay. Let me jot down the given information. We start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³, right? Oh wait, but when you dilute, the concentration changes. I think I should calculate the new concentration first.

The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M × 0.020 L = 0.001 moles. Then, when we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.040 L. So the new concentration is moles/volume = 0.001 / 0.040 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. The problem asks for the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Wait, how does the titration work here? Since it's a weak acid (acetic acid) being titrated with a strong base (NaOH), the reaction should be CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid will be neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate. But I remember that at equivalence, the solution will be a buffer of acetate ions and some H+ from water. Wait, no, because when you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the equivalence point is in the basic range because the conjugate base (acetate) is a weak base.

But let's tackle the two parts separately: 25% titration and equivalence point.

First, 25% titration. That means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So let me calculate how much NaOH is needed for that.

The moles of acetic acid initially are 0.001 mol as calculated earlier. 25% of that is 0.00025 mol. Since NaOH reacts in a 1:1 ratio with acetic acid, the moles of NaOH added are 0.00025 mol as well.

But wait, the volume of NaOH used would be moles divided by concentration. The concentration is 0.1 M, so volume is 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, we've added 2.5
