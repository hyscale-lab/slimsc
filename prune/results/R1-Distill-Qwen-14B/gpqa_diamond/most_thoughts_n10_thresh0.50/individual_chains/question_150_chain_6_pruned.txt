Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the product after a series of reactions. Hmm, let's take it step by step. 

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. That's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. The NMR data is given, so I should probably start by interpreting that to figure out the structure of the starting compound.

Looking at the 1H-NMR:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That seems like an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet might suggest coupling with two adjacent protons, but wait, aldehydes usually have a deshielded, singlet, or maybe a doublet. Hmm, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol form or another group. Or perhaps it's part of a conjugated system.

- 6.98 (d, 2H): This could be a pair of aromatic protons. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. Maybe para-substituted aromatic groups. Like a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions.

- 6.51 (d, 2H): Another aromatic doublet. Maybe another benzene ring or perhaps some conjugated double bonds. The upfield shift compared to 6.98 suggests perhaps a substituent like an electron-donating group, like OCH3, but wait, the molecular formula has an O and N. Maybe phenol groups? Wait, phenol protons are usually around 5-7 ppm, but substituted ones can vary.

- 6.27 (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. Maybe some vinyl protons, or perhaps adjacent to an electronegative group. Or maybe they're part of an enol structure. Alternatively, could be some di-substituted aromatic protons, but they don't seem to fit the doublet pattern. Wait, maybe it's a conjugated diene or something else.

- 3.66 (d, 2H): A doublet for two protons. Maybe a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Like OCH2 or something. The chemical shift around 3.6 suggests maybe an oxygen adjacent, like next to a
