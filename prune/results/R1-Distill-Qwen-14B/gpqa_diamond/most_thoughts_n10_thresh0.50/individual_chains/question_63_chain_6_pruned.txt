Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diatomic molecules and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that the molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so the first excited state would be the next one. I think in this model, the molecule can change either its vibrational or rotational state when it absorbs a photon.

Wait, the problem asks about switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I guess that means the molecule transitions to the next higher energy state, which could be either the next vibrational state or the next rotational state. But which one requires a lower energy change? Because the photon's momentum depends on the energy needed for the transition.

Let me recall the energy levels for rotation and vibration. For rotation, the energy levels are quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For vibration, the energy levels are E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w v, where v is the vibrational quantum number. Oh wait, the fundamental state is v=0 and J=0, maybe? Or is it J=0 for rotation in the ground state?

Wait, the quantum rotation-vibration model probably combines both. So the total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational contributions. So the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next possible state would be either increasing J to J=1 or increasing v to v=1.

I need to find out which of these transitions requires less energy because the photon's momentum depends on the energy change. Since the question is about the lowest possible energy photon, it would correspond to the transition with the smallest energy.

Let me compute the energy required for each possible transition.

First, the rotational transition. When J changes from 0 to 1, the rotational energy change is E_rot = B*(1)(2) - B*(0)(1) = 2B. What's B? I think B is given by h/(8π² I c), but wait I'm a bit confused. Oh, actually, B is the rotational constant, which is (h/(8π² I)) / (2), wait no, I'm getting this wrong. Let me double-check.

The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = (ℏ²)/(2 I), but wait, I might be mixing the formulas. Alternatively, B is sometimes expressed in terms of the moment of inertia I. Yeah, another approach: the moment of inertia I is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length. Then the rotational constant B is h/(8π² I c), but wait, wait, no. I think B is h/(8π² I c) for frequency. Wait, maybe I should get to B correctly.

Alternatively, B is given by (h²)/(8 π² I k), but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is h/(8π² I). Wait, no, because I remember that the rotational constant in terms of energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), and B is (ℏ²)/(2 I) because the rotational energy is (L²)/(2 I), where L is angular momentum. Hmm, maybe that's better.

Wait, let me be precise. The angular momentum L is ℏ J, so L² is ℏ² J². Then E_rot = (L²)/(2 I) = (ℏ² J²)/(2 I) = (ℏ²)/(2 I) * J² = B J², where B is ℏ²/(2 I). But wait, in some references, B is given as h/(8π² I c), but I think that's for the frequency in wavenumbers. Maybe I'm getting confused between different units. Anyway, perhaps I should compute B using the reduced mass and bond length.

Wait, the bond length R is given as 2 angstroms
