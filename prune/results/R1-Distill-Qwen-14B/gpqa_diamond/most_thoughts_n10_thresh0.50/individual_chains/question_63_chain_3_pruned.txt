Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to quantum models, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that, when absorbed, will take it to the next lowest energy state.

Hmm, wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels of a diatomic molecule are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. But the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, the rigid rotor model assumes the bond length doesn't change, but the non-rigid one allows for some vibration, so the bond length can change a bit. But wait, for the purpose of energy transitions, perhaps I should consider both rotational and vibrational energy changes?

The molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which for a diatomic would be the ground vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (probably J=0, but I'm not entirely sure). Wait, no, the rotational states are quantized, with J being an integer starting from 0. So the fundamental state might be the J=0, n=0 state.

Now, the molecule absorbs a photon and switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I need to figure out what's the next possible state. The next state would be the one with the least energy increase. So maybe it's either a transition to a higher vibrational state (n=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). Which of these has a lower energy difference?

Wait, the question says the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, so perhaps the energy transitions involve both rotational and vibrational changes. But I'm a bit confused about how the states are ordered in terms of energy. For example, the ground state is J=0, n=0. The next possible state could either be J=1, n=0 or J=0, n=1. Which one requires less energy?

I think the vibrational energy levels are quantized as n=0,1,2... with energy spacing of ħω. So the first vibrational state (n=1) would have an energy of (3/2)ħω - (1/2)ħω = ħω higher than the n=0
