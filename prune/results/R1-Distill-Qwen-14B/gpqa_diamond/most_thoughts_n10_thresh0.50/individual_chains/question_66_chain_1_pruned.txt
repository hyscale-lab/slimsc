Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are A, B, C, D, each combining some of these.

Wait, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory, which means it's built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian. These operators are organized by their dimension and the fields they involve. But I'm a bit confused about the symmetries here.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I'm pretty sure that any valid physical theory must respect Lorentz symmetry because it's a cornerstone of relativity. So all operators in SMEFT should be Lorentz covariant. That makes sense. So option 1 is correct.

Then there's Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if the theory respects Poincare, it must also respect Lorentz. But I think that in SMEFT, the operators are written in a way that they can have explicit dependence on the background field (like the Higgs), which might make them not invariant under translations. Wait, no, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's supposed to be valid in the IR, and the Poincare symmetry might be considered. Or perhaps the operators are part of a theory that respects Poincare, except that SMEFT might not be translationally invariant because the operators come with coefficients that could break that. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let's think about the structure. SMEFT is built with the Standard Model fields and higher-dimension operators. The Standard Model itself respects Lorentz symmetry, so any operators added should also respect Lorentz. But what about Poincare? Poincare includes Lorentz transformations and spatial translations. So if an operator doesn't change under Lorentz, does it also have to not change under translations?

Wait, but SMEFT includes operators with derivatives. For example, operators like (Dμ ϕ)† D^μ ϕ are part of the SM. But when we add higher-dimension operators, like (Dμ ϕ)† (Dν ϕ) D^μ D^ν ϕ, those
