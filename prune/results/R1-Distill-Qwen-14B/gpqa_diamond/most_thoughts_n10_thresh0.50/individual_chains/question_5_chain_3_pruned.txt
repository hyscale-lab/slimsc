Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still a bit shaky on some concepts. The question is about finding the normalized eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Wait, the operator P is a vector operator, right? So it has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these components is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, and the eigenvector we're looking for is for the operator P along the direction n. Since n is in the x-z plane, it must be a direction that lies somewhere between the x and z axes. So I guess this means that the operator we're interested in is P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But wait, since n is in the x-z plane, the y-component of n must be zero. Because the x-z plane is where y=0. So n would be (n_x, 0, n_z), right?

Wait, but wait—n is a unit vector. So n_x² + n_z² = 1. Oh, and since it's an arbitrary direction, I can't just assume it's along x or z; it's somewhere in between. So the operator P along n would be P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z, since n_y is zero.

Hmm, but wait the problem says the eigenvector is for the operator P along n. So I need to find the eigenvector of the operator P that corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

But how do I construct P along n? Let's think. Each component P_x, P_y, P_z is given. Let me write down each of them.

P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i],[i, 0]], and P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]. 

So, if I have to construct P along n, which is in the x-z plane, then P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because n is arbitrary in x-z plane, n_y is zero.

Wait, but wait, n must be a unit vector. So n_x = cosθ and n_z = sinθ? Or maybe it's the other way around? Because in spherical coordinates, the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis. So if I'm in the x-z plane, θ would be 90 degrees if along x, and 0 along z. Hmm, maybe n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, sometimes it's the other way around. Let me think. No, actually, in the standard spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle, so cosθ would be along z, and sinθ * cosφ along x. But in this case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, φ is
