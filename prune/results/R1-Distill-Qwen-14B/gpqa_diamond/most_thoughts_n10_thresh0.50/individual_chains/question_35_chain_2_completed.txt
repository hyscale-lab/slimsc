Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is given as A_y = c·S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y and pick the correct statement from the options given.

First, I should probably write down the matrix for A_y. Since c is h/(4π), and S is as given, let me compute A_y.

So, S matrix is:
[ 0, -i ]
[ i, 0 ]

Multiply each element by c = h/(4π). So A_y matrix becomes:

[0 * c, (-i) * c ]
[i * c, 0 * c ]

Which is:

[0, (-i h)/(4π)]
[ (i h)/(4π), 0 ]

Hmm. So A_y is a 2x2 matrix with those entries.

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of A_y. The eigenvalues of a matrix satisfy the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

Let me set up the matrix (A_y - a I):

[ -a, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), -a ]

The determinant of this matrix should be zero.

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (i h)/(4π) * (-i h)/(4π) ].

Multiplying (-a)(-a) gives a².

The second term: (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) = (i*(-i)) * (h²)/(16 π²)

i*(-i) is (-i²) = -(-1) = 1, so this term is (1)*(h²)/(16 π²) = h²/(16 π²)

So the determinant is a² - [ (h²)/(16 π²) ) ] = 0

Wait, wait. Wait, the determinant is [ (-a)(-a) ] - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ]

Wait, when you compute the determinant, it's (top left * bottom right) minus (top right * bottom left). So for (A_y - a I), top right is (-i h)/(4π), bottom left is (i h)/(4π).

So the determinant equation is:

a² - [ ( (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ] = 0

Calculating the product of the off-diagonal terms:

(-i)(i) = -(i²) = -(-1) = 1.

Multiply by (h/(4π))²: (h²)/(16 π²)

So the equation becomes a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0.

So a² = h²/(16 π²)

Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4 π)

Wait, that's interesting. So the eigenvalues a are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Wait a minute, but wait the determinant equation says:

det(A_y - a I) = a² - ( (h²)/(16 π²) ) =0.

So a^2 = (h/(4π))^2 → a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation.

Ah, wait, the off-diagonal term calculation: [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ]

Multiply the two: (-i)(i) = -i² = 1. Then 1*(h²)/(16 π²). So yes, that's correct.

So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers, not complex. So any option that mentions imaginary parts for the eigenvalues is wrong.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). But wait, our eigenvalues are real, so the imaginary parts must be zero. So option A is incorrect because it talks about imaginary parts.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real ±1. Hmm, but our eigenvalues are h/(4π), which is a real number. Let's compute h/(4π) numerically. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. Divided by 4π (approx 12.566) → about 5.28e-35 J·s. That's a very small number. So the eigenvalues are real and around that scale. Option B has real parts of 1 or -1, which is way larger than what we have. So I think B is incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. Hmm. Well, A^2 is the square of the angular momentum operator. In quantum mechanics, the eigenfunctions of a component (like Ay) are also eigenfunctions of the square A², because A² commutes with all components (since [A², A_x] =0, etc.). So each eigenstate of Ay should be an eigenstate of A². But what about Az, the z-component? Since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenfunctions are different. So eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So option C seems correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, not sure about this. The basis functions are usually the eigenvectors of the operator. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, it has two eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) which form a basis for the space. So any vector can be expressed as a combination of these. So D's statement seems correct as well.

Wait, but let's think about the options.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps either C or D is correct.

Wait, let me re-examine the options.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. As I thought, since A² commutes with Ay, their eigenfunctions are the same. So any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². That makes statement C correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Since the operator is 2x2, its eigenvectors (eigenfunctions) form a basis for the vector space. So D is correct.

Wait, but both options C and D seem correct? Or perhaps not.

Wait, the question says which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalue and eigenvectors.

Looking at the options again.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, the matrix operator Ay is 2x2, so its eigenvectors are two-dimensional vectors. So any vector can be expressed in terms of these two eigenvectors. So D's statement is correct.

But wait the options are presented as choices, so perhaps only one is correct. Let me see the options.

Wait, looking back:

Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az.

Option D is about the basis functions.

Wait, perhaps both C and D are correct. But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct. Let me see.

Wait, no, because the question is about what you consider correct during the calculation. So which statement is correct?

Wait, perhaps the eigenfunctions are the basis functions (D is correct).

But in quantum mechanics, the angular momentum components don't share eigenfunctions except for the square. So C's statement is correct.

So both C and D could be correct statements, but perhaps the options don't allow that.

Wait, perhaps reviewing the problem again:

The problem is about the Y-component's operator, which is 2x2. So it's a spin-½ particle. The operator Ay has eigenvalues ±h/(4π), since we found that. The eigenvectors are spin-up and spin-down in the y-direction.

But in quantum mechanics, each component of angular momentum (like Sx, Sy, Sz) has eigenvectors that are not shared with the others. However, the square of the angular momentum (S²) commutes with each component, so the eigenfunctions of any component (like Ay) are also eigenfunctions of S².

Wait, in this problem, the operator is Ay = c S_y, where S is given. So A^2 would be (c S_y)^2.

Since S² is the square of the spin operator, which for spin-½ is (S_x² + S_y² + S_z²) = ( (ħ/2)^2 ) * 3, because for spin-½, S² has eigenvalue (s(s+1) ) (ħ²), which when s=½ is (3/4) ħ². But regardless, since Ay commutes with A² (because A² is (c S_y)^2, and Ay is c S_y), so any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So option C's first part is correct.

As for the second part of option C, the eigenfunctions are not eigenfunctions of Az. This is correct because Sy and Sz don't commute; their eigenfunctions are different. So option C is correct.

What about option D? The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space. So any vector can be written as a linear combination of these eigenvectors. So D is correct as well.

Wait, but in the options, only one option can be correct. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option D says: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, the matrix is 2x2, so its eigenvectors are a basis for the space. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement you would consider correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options may not allow that. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps the statement in option D is a bit ambiguous. The matrix operator Ay is given, and its basis functions are its eigenvectors. So D states that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator, which is correct.

But how does that compare to the other options?

Wait, in the problem, the operator is 2x2, so the system is two-dimensional. Therefore, the two eigenvectors of Ay form a basis for the space. So D's statement is correct.

Wait, but is D correct? The eigenvectors are the basis functions, which is correct.

Hmm. So both C and D seem correct, but the options are given as choices, so perhaps one is correct and the other isn't.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial calculation.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

We found that the eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4π).

Now, let's find the eigenvectors.

For a = h/(4π):

We set up (A_y - a I) φ = 0.

Matrix becomes:

[ -a, (-i h)/(4π) ]

[ (i h)/(4π), -a ]

Substituting a = h/(4π):

Top row: [ -h/(4π), (-i h)/(4π) ]

Which can be written as:

[ -h/(4π)   -i h/(4π) ]

[ i h/(4π)   -h/(4π) ]

The system of equations is:

- (h/(4π)) φ1 - (i h/(4π)) φ2 = 0

( i h/(4π) ) φ1 - (h/(4π)) φ2 = 0

Let me divide each equation by h/(4π) to simplify:

First equation: -φ1 - i φ2 = 0 → φ1 = -i φ2

Second equation: i φ1 - φ2 = 0 → i φ1 = φ2

From the first equation, φ1 = -i φ2. Substitute into the second equation:

i (-i φ2) = φ2 → (-i²) φ2 = φ2 → (1) φ2 = φ2 → which holds for any φ2.

So the eigenvector can be written as [ φ1; φ2 ] = [ -i φ2; φ2 ] = φ2 [ -i; 1 ]

We can choose φ2 = 1, so the eigenvector is [ -i, 1 ]^T.

Similarly, for a = -h/(4π):

The matrix becomes:

[ h/(4π), (-i h)/(4π) ]

[ i h/(4π), h/(4π) ]

So the equations are:

(h/(4π)) φ1 - i (h/(4π)) φ2 =0 → φ1 - i φ2 =0 → φ1 = i φ2

And the second equation:

i (h/(4π)) φ1 + (h/(4π)) φ2 =0 → i φ1 + φ2 =0 → φ2 = -i φ1

Substituting φ1 = i φ2 into this equation: φ2 = -i (i φ2) → φ2 = (-i^2) φ2 → φ2 = (1) φ2 → which holds.

So the eigenvector is [ i φ2, φ2 ]^T → φ2 [ i, 1 ]^T. Choosing φ2=1, we get [ i, 1 ]^T.

So the two eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ].

These are the eigenfunctions.

Now, looking back at the options:

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

Since A^2 is (Ay)^2, and since Ay commutes with A^2, their eigenfunctions are the same. So any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A^2. So the first part is correct.

As for Az, since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenfunctions are different. So eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, and the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, this is correct. So D is correct.

So now, both C and D seem correct. But wait, looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the question is phrased: "which statement below will you consider to be correct?" So perhaps more than one could be correct, but in the given options, I need to choose the correct one.

Wait, perhaps I should read the options again.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, the matrix operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix. Its eigenvectors are two in number, and they form an orthogonal basis (assuming they are normalized and orthogonal, which they are for Hermitian operators). Since Ay is Hermitian (because S is Hermitian, as S has i on the off-diagonal terms, but its conjugate transpose is the same as itself? Wait, S's matrix is:

Row 1: [0, -i]

Row 2: [i, 0]

So the conjugate transpose of S would be:

Column 1: [0, i]

Column 2: [ -i,0 ]

Which is the transpose of S, so S is Hermitian. Hence, A_y is c times a Hermitian matrix, so A_y is Hermitian. So its eigenvectors are orthogonal, real eigenvalues, etc.

So the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis for the space. So statement D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. So that's correct.

But how do options C and D compare? Both seem correct.

Wait, looking back at the question statement, the operator is Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is given.

Wait, but what is A^2? A^2 = (c S_y)^2 = c² S_y².

What is S_y squared? Let me compute S².

The matrix S is:

0 -i

i 0

So S squared is S multiplied by S.

Let me compute S^2:

First row: (0*0 + (-i)*i, 0*(-i) + (-i)*0) → ( (0) + (-i)(i)= (-i^2)=1, 0 )

Second row: (i*0 +0*i , i*(-i) + 0*0 ) → (0, -i^2=1 )

So S squared is:

[1, 0]

[0, 1 ]

Which is the identity matrix.

So S^2 = I.

So A^2 = (c S_y)^2 = c² I.

So for any eigenstate of Ay, it's also an eigenstate of A^2 with eigenvalue c². So C's first part is correct.

But what about the second part of C: the eigenfunctions are not eigenfunctions of Az.

That's correct because, in quantum mechanics, the different components of angular momentum (x, y, z) have non-commuting operators. So their eigenfunctions are different.

So C is correct.

So now, both C and D seem correct. But the options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, but the options are four, and only one is correct.

So perhaps I made an error in the calculations.

Wait, looking back, the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real. So any option that mentions imaginary parts for the eigenvalues is incorrect.

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). But our eigenvalues are real. So A is wrong.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. Our eigenvalues are real and have magnitude h/(4π), which is a small number, not 1. So B is wrong.

So options C and D are the only possible correct ones.

But I need to pick which one is correct.

Option C says the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Which is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2D space.

Hmm, perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps the problem expects only one correct statement.

Wait, the question is: which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation?

So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options don't allow for that. Let me think about each option.

Looking at option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Since the matrix is 2x2, the eigenvectors (eigenfunctions) form a basis, so D is correct.

But how about the other statements? For example, statement C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A squared but not of Az.

So which is correct? Both C and D seem correct.

But looking at the options, I need to pick the correct one. So perhaps the right answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible answers.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So during the calculation, when finding the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, which statement is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. That seems correct because the operator is 2x2, so its eigenfunctions form a basis, so D is correct.

But perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about what each option is saying.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, the matrix operator is 2x2, so the basis functions are the eigenvectors. So D is correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is both C and D are correct, but in the options, only one is correct. Let me see what the options are.

In the given options, only one is correct. So perhaps the correct statements are C and D, but in the options, the correct choices are either C or D.

Wait, I'm getting stuck because both C and D seem correct, but maybe only one is.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C because the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az, but they are eigenfunctions of A². So C's statement is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

But the question is, which statement is correct during the calculation, perhaps both C and D are correct, but in the options, perhaps only option C is correct.

Wait, another approach: Let's look at the eigenvalues. Wait, the eigenvalues are real, ±h/(4π). So the only option that talks about real eigenvalues is C and D.

Wait, but the options don't directly talk about that. Wait, the options A and B are about eigenvalues, but C and D are about the properties of the eigenfunctions.

In the problem, the calculation would involve finding real eigenvalues and eigenvectors that form a basis. So perhaps both C and D are correct statements, but the options don't allow for multiple correct answers.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C because it correctly states that the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az, which is correct.

So, after all this thinking, I'll conclude that the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component angular momentum operator \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix with the form:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Matrix Representation of \( A_y \):**
   Substituting \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the matrix \( A_y \) becomes:
   \[
   A_y = \begin{bmatrix} 
   0 & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\ 
   i \frac{h}{4\pi} & 0 
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   The eigenvalues \( a \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \). This yields:
   \[
   a^2 = \left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2 \implies a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
   \]
   Thus, the eigenvalues are real: \( a = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( a = -\frac{h}{4\pi} \).

3. **Eigenvectors of \( A_y \):**
   For \( a = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvector is proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). For \( a = -\frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvector is proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). These eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis for the 2D space.

4. **Analysis of Options:**
   - **Option A:** Claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm 2\pi h \) and real parts \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).
   - **Option B:** Claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and real parts \( \pm 1 \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are not close to 1 or \( \frac{1}{2} \).
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so their eigenfunctions are the same. However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).
   - **Option D:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is correct because the eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2D space.

5. **Final Decision:**
   Both options C and D are correct. However, the question asks for the statement that is correct "during the calculation." Option C directly addresses the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), which is relevant during the eigenvalue and eigenvector calculation. Therefore, **Option C** is the best answer.

### Conclusion:
The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \), making **Option C** correct.

Answer: C
