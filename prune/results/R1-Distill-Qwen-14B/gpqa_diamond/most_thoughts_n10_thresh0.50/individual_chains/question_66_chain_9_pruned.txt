Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model, respecting certain symmetries. But wait, I need to think about which symmetries these operators must preserve.

The question lists four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The options are combinations of these. Let me break it down.

First, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetries? Oh right, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like shifting space or time). So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But wait, the question is about what all SMEFT operators must respect. So if SMEFT operators must respect Poincare, that would include Lorentz. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, SMEFT is typically constructed in a way that preserves the symmetries of the Standard Model. The Standard Model includes Lorentz symmetry and gauge symmetries. But does it include Poincare? Because Poincare includes translations, which are part of the spacetime symmetries. So yes, SMEFT operators would have to respect Poincare symmetry because they are part of the effective field theory, which generally assumes local Poincare invariance at the effective level.

Wait, no, wait. Effective field theories are usually constructed to be Lorentz invariant but not necessarily Poincare. Or is it the other way around? Because Poincare includes both Lorent
