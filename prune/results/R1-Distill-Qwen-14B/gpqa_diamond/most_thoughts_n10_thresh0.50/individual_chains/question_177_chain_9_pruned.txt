Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

Alright, so the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their radii and masses are both 1.5 times larger for Star_1 compared to Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. The radial velocities are given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. They assume the stars are black bodies and compute the luminosity ratio. The options are A to D with various factors.

Hmm, I remember that luminosity for stars is related to their radius and temperature. The formula, I think, is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Oh, and luminosity is proportional to R² T⁴. But wait, how does that tie into the information given?

The problem says the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. Oh, wait, the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So if λ1 = λ2, then T1 = T2. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait a minute. Radial velocity is given. Oh, but radial velocity doesn't directly affect the temperature, does it? Because the peak wavelength depends on the star's temperature, not its velocity. Unless, wait, but the star's velocity might cause a Doppler shift, but I'm not sure. The problem says they found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So, probably, the observed λ_max is the same, but the rest wavelength would depend on their velocities. Hmm, maybe I should think about that.

Wait, let me think. The star emits at λ_max = b / T. But when the star is moving, due to Doppler effect, the observed wavelength could be different. Oh wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is same. But the actual (
