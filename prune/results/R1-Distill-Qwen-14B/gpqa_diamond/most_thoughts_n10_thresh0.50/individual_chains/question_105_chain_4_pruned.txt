Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let's try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about a star with certain characteristics and how its brightness variations compare to those caused by an exoplanet. I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. But wait, in this case, the star has spots, so that complicates things.

The star has a radius equal to the Sun, so R_star = R_sun. The spots cover one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. Oh, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots, right? So 20% of that hemisphere is spots.

The star's Teff is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. So the spots are at 5000K. Wait, does that matter for the calculation? Because when spots are on the visible side, they make the star appear dimmer. But when comparing to a planet transit, the planet would block some of the star's light.

Wait, the problem says that the star's brightness variations due to rotation (with spots) can resemble those of a planet. So they're looking for the planet radius that would cause the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do.

But wait, the question says, "if the star was not covered by spots, what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude." So the observed variations from the spots are what
