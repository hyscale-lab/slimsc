Okay, so I've got this question here about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my IR and NMR, but let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the FTIR data. The question says there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Also, the IR has strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which makes me think of carbonyl groups. That could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 is a bit lower, so maybe an ester or maybe conjugated carbonyl groups. Alternatively, I remember that conjugated double bonds or amide groups can show around 1650, but I don't think that's the case here. Wait, the NMR mentions vinyl hydrogens, so there's probably a double bond. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl and a double bond.

Looking at the 1H NMR, there are peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, so that suggests the compound has a structure like an alkene. So maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl? Like a ketone or ester with a double bond nearby.

The mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass. Let me think about possible fragments. 45 could be a fragment with a methyl group and an oxygen, like (CH3O-), but wait, 45 is the mass. Alternatively, it's a carbonyl group. Wait, 45 is often the mass of a (CH3CO+) fragment. Because CH3CO has a mass of 45 (12+1*3 +12 +16= 45). So maybe the compound has an acetyl group.

Now, putting it all together. The formula options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

Let me think about
