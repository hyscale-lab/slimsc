Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their transit probabilities. Let me try to think through it step by step. I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbit's inclination.

The question says we've got two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, so that part is equal. But Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2 has a period P, Planet_1 has P/3.

They both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies the calculations. The host stars have the same radii, but different masses. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. Oh, but same radius. Interesting.

I think the probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet relative to the star, and the size of the orbit relative to the star's size in some way. Wait, no, more accurately, the transit probability depends on the ratio between the size of the planet's orbit and the star's size. Wait, no, let me think again. Oh wait, the formula for the probability of a transit is roughly (R_p)/(a), where R_p is the planet's radius and a is the semi-major axis (since it's circular, a is the orbital radius). But wait, no, actually, the formula is (R_star + R_planet) / a, but perhaps R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so maybe it's approximated as R_star / a.

Wait, no, another thought: the geometric probability that a planet transits is roughly (R_* / a), where R_* is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital distance. Because for a circular orbit, the chance that the planet's path intersects our line of sight is proportional to the star's radius divided by the orbital distance. That makes sense because a larger orbit would make it less likely to block the star.

So the transit probability P is approximately (R_star / a) times some factor for the orbital inclination, but assuming random orientations, the probability is just R*/a.

Wait, but in reality, the formula I remember is P = (R_star + R
