Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum operator of a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that the Y-component of the angular momentum operator, A_y, is represented by a 2x2 matrix and satisfies the eigenvalue equation A_y φ = a φ. The operator is given as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π). Oh wait, S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). 

So my task is to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y and figure out which statement among the options is correct.

First, I need to write down the matrix for A_y. Since c is h/(4π), and S is given, A_y = (h/(4π)) * S. Let me write that out.

S matrix is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

So multiplying each element by c = h/(4π), A_y becomes:
[ 0*(h/(4π))   (-i)*(h/(4π)) ]
[ (i)*(h/(4π))   0*(h/(4π)) ]

Which simplifies to:
[ 0   -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)   0 ]

Wait, but actually, maybe I should compute it as c multiplied by the matrix. So each element is multiplied by c. So the elements are:

Top right: -i * c
Bottom left: i * c

So A_y is:
[ 0, (-i h/(4π)) ]
[ (i h/(4π)), 0 ]

But wait, angular momentum operators... I'm trying to remember. The eigenvalues for S are in units of ħ, right? Wait, but what's the spin here? A muon is a lepton, similar to an electron, so it's spin-1/2. So the spin matrices should be similar to the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2, maybe?

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. And the spin matrices for a spin-1/2 particle are S_i = (ħ/2) σ_i. So in this case,
