Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves light beams, glass, and relative motion. Oh right, it's about the speed of light in a moving medium. Interesting.

So the setup: A light beam is moving through glass with an index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, toward the observer in the lab. The question is asking what's the speed of light relative to the observer in the lab.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is given by v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's when the medium is stationary. What if the medium is moving? Does that affect the observed speed of light in the medium?

I think I need to consider the frame of reference here. The lab is the observer's frame. The glass is moving with velocity v relative to the lab. So perhaps I should apply a velocity addition formula here, but I'm not exactly sure which one. Oh right, the relativistic velocity addition formula because we're dealing with speeds that might be significant compared to c.

Wait, wait. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, same direction as the light beam. The light is inside the glass, so its speed relative to the glass is c/n. But how does the motion of the glass affect the speed observed in the lab?

I think the key here is to find the speed of the light as seen from the lab. So, the light's speed in the glass is u' = c/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So to get the lab's frame speed u, I need to transform the velocity.

Wait, the velocity addition formula is (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/cÂ²), right? Because in relativity, when you have two velocities, you add them with this formula. But wait, u' is the speed of the light in the glass's frame. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at v, and the light's speed in the glass's frame is u' = c/n.

Wait, but c is 1 in this problem. So u' = 1/n.

So applying the relativistic addition formula: u = (u' + v) / (1 + u' * v).

Let me plug in u' = 1/n. So u becomes (1/n + v) / (1
