Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and its energy states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the non-rigid rotor model is different from the rotation-vibration model. Wait no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh wait, maybe the question means the rotation-vibration coupling model? Or perhaps it's the rigid rotor model but considering both rotation and vibration. Hmm.

Wait, the problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. But wait, in the quantum mechanical models, the fundamental state is the state with the lowest possible energy, which for a molecule might be the ground vibrational state with the lowest rotational state.

Wait, but the question is about absorbing a photon that causes the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, I think that means promoting the molecule to the next higher energy state, which could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But I'm not sure which one has a lower energy transition.

Wait, but the problem says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state should be the one that's just one step above the current state in terms of energy. So, the photon's energy should be such that it's the smallest possible increase to reach the next state.

So, the molecule is in the ground state
