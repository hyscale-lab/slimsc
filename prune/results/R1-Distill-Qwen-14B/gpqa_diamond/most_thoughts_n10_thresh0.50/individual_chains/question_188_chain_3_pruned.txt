Okay, so I have this question about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance relates to the crystal structure and its lattice parameters. Let me think about what I know.

Rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal. Oh wait, in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. But wait, in a rhombohedral system, the angles are usually 60 degrees or some other value, but maybe it varies. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. I'm a bit confused if the interatomic distance refers to the lattice parameter 'a', or if it's the distance between atoms in some other way. I think in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter, but rhombohedral might be more complex.

Wait, rhombohedral is a type of crystal system where all edges are equal (a = b = c) and the angles between them are equal (α = β = γ). So for this problem, a = 10 Angstroms because the interatomic distance is given as that, assuming each atom is at the lattice points.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I recall that the interplanar distance d(hkl) is given by the formula involving the reciprocal of the plane indices and the lattice parameters.

The formula for d is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos γ) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos α) ) ) when the angles are not 90 degrees. Wait, but for a rhombohedral system, since all angles are equal, α = β = γ = 30 degrees in this case.

So the formula might simplify because all the cos terms are the same. Let me write it down.

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos γ - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos α )

But since α = β = γ = 30°, cos 30 is sqrt(3)/2 approximately 0.866.

So substituting, for (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1.

So the denominator
