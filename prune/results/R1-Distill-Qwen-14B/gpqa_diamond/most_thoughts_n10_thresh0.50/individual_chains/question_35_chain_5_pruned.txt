Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. 

First, let me read the problem again. The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by the matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. 

Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are often used in angular momentum operators. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. Let me recall them. The σx matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Wait, so S here looks exactly like σy. Because the first row is [0, -i], the second is [i,0]. Yep, that's σy.

So, Ay = c * S = (h/(4π)) * σy. So Ay is (h/(4π)) multiplied by the Pauli y matrix.

Now, the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector. 

The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, right? So σy is Hermitian. Multiplying by a real constant, Ay is also Hermitian. That means its eigenvalues are real. Wait, wait, but the options talk about the eigenvalues having real and imaginary parts. That can't be right because Hermitian operators have real eigenvalues. So I might have made a mistake here.

Wait, let me double-check. Oh wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the spin matrices. Oh wait, wait. Wait a second, S here is the spin operator matrix, and for spin-1/2 particles, like a muon, the spin matrices are proportional to the Pauli matrices. But perhaps in this case, S is not the same as σ. Let me think. Oh wait, S is the spin operator, which for spin-1/2 particles, S is (ℏ/2) σ. Or maybe S is the entire matrix, including the factor. Hmm, the problem says S is a 2x2 matrix
