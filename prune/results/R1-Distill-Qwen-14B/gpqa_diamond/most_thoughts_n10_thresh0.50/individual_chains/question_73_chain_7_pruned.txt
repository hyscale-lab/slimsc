Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm. Let me try to think through this.

First, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Oh wait, but in relativity, mass might not be the same as rest mass. Wait, no, in relativity, the rest mass is given, and when velocity is involved, we have to use the relativistic mass. Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of energy and momentum.

Wait, the question is about their relative speed and the total energy. So for the relative speed, I think I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because when two objects are moving at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract their velocities normally.

So, the two astronauts are moving in the same direction, right? The first is moving at 0.6c and the second at 0.5c. Wait, but wait, in which frame are we calculating the relative speed? Oh, I think the question is asking for the relative speed as seen from one astronaut's frame. Or wait, maybe it's from the perspective of the other astronaut. Hmm, not sure, but I think the formula for relative velocity is when you have two velocities u and v in the same frame, and you want to find the velocity of one as seen from the other's frame.

The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (u - v) /
