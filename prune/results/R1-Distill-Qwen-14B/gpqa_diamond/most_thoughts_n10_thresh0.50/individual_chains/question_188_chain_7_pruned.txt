Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on my solid-state physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the question says.

Alright, the question is about a rhombohedral crystal. The given parameters are an interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. We need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the interplanar distance d is calculated using the formula derived from the structure factor. Wait, the formula involves the reciprocal of the plane indices and the lattice parameters. Oh right! The formula is d_{hkl} = a/(sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) )) ) but wait, I think I might have the formula wrong. Or maybe that's when the crystal is orthorhombic. No, wait, no, for a general hexagonal or rhombohedral crystal, the formula is more involved.

Wait, more accurately, for a rhombohedral lattice, where a = b = c and all angles are equal (alpha=beta=gamma), the interplanar distance formula simplifies. Let me think. The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d = (a^2 (h² + k² + l²) + ... ) inverse square root? No, wait.

Wait, I think the formula is d = ( (a² (h² + k² + l²) + ... ) )^(-1/2), but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me get this right. Oh right, the formula for interplanar distance in a cubic system is a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²), but since rhombohedral is a skewed version, the formula is more complex.

Wait, another approach. The interplanar distance d_{hkl} can be found using the formula:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/a² + ... something involving the angles. Because in the cubic case, the angles are all 90 degrees, so they don't contribute, but in a rhombohedral structure, the angles are 30 degrees. So maybe the formula includes cos terms.

Wait,
