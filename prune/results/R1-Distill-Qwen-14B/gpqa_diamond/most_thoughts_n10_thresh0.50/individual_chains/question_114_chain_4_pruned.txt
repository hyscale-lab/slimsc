Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these reactions. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So that's a ketone. And NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that in nucleophilic addition reactions, ketones can react with cyanide. Oh wait, isn't that the formation of a cyanohydrin?

Right, when a ketone reacts with CN-, it adds across the carbonyl group to form a secondary alcohol and a nitrile. The mechanism is that the CN- acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon. Then, since the ketone is symmetrical, the product would have the hydroxyl and nitrile groups on the same carbon. So the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That makes sense.

So the reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. Now, for that, the conditions are usually acidic. Because after the attack by CN-, the oxygen needs to pick up a proton to form the alcohol. Or wait, maybe the initial step is deprotonation, but I think the typical condition for forming a cyanohydrin is using a strong acid. So like H3O+ as the acid. Because NaCN in aqueous solution might already have some HCN, but to drive the reaction, acid catalysis is needed.

So reagent A is probably H3O+. Looking at the options, option A and B have H3O+ as A. So that's a start.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile is treated with reagent B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Hmm, let's see. The molecule has a nitrile group and an alcohol group, both on the same carbon. So when it's treated with water and some reagent, it becomes a carboxylic acid.

Wait, what's the process of converting nitriles to carboxylic acids? I think one way is hydrolysis. But nitriles under acidic or basic
