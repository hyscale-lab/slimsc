Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about Michael additions. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. These reactions are important in synthesis because they form new carbon-carbon bonds.

The question has three parts, each a Michael addition reaction, and I need to find the major products for each. The options are A, B, C, or D, each giving different products for A, B, and C. I'll take them one at a time.

Starting with the first reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH → (A).

I think NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, a strong base, so it probably deprotonates something. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because the enolate is stabilized. The structure of dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOEt)2. The enolate would form at the central carbon, so the negative charge is on the alpha position. 

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt. Wait, no. Let me draw it: it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CH2-OEt? No, wait, I think I got that wrong. (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: The acrylate group is CH2=CH-CO-OEt, but the substituent is on the middle carbon. Maybe it's CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-OEt? But wait, no. Acrylate is CH2=CH–COOR. So, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the third position. Hmm, perhaps it's CH2CH2-CO-OEt but with a p-tolyl group on the second carbon? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the structure would be CH2=CH–C(p-tolyl)OEt? No, the acrylate is CH2=CH–CO–OEt. So, if it's 3-(p-tolyl), perhaps the substituent is on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)–CH2–OEt? Or maybe CH2=C–C(p-tolyl)–OEt? I'm getting a bit stuck on that. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=C–CO-OEt, but with a p-tolyl group on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2=C(C6H4-4Me)-CO-OEt. Oh wait, that can't be right because the numbering in acrylate is CH2=CH–COOR. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon? But that doesn't make sense because the acrylate is only three carbons. Oh wait, I think I'm mixing up the positions. Acrylate has three carbons: the double bond is between
