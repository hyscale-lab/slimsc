Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators must respect. I remember from my studies that SMEFT is a framework where we write down all possible interactions that can occur at a high energy scale, beyond the Standard Model, but without introducing new particles. Instead, it's all about higher-dimensional operators. 

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I need to recall what each of these symmetries entails.

Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance of the theory under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. That's crucial because our spacetime is described by special relativity, so any fundamental theory should respect this. So operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry; otherwise, they'd break relativity principles.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So it's the full symmetry of Minkowski spacetime, including things like momentum conservation because of spacetime translations. I think that any renormalizable theory, like the Standard Model, respects Poincare symmetry. But SMEFT is a non-renormalizable theory, but wait, non-renormalizable doesn't mean it doesn't respect Poincare, right? Because even if you have higher-dimension operators, the theory is still supposed to be Lorentz invariant. So Poincare symmetry would require the theory to be invariant under the full set, including translations and Lorentz transformations. But wait, do all operators in SMEFT respect Poincare?

Hmm, I think SMEFT is formulated in a way that it's a Lorentz-invariant theory. But I'm not sure if all operators must respect Poincare symmetry. Because Poincare includes translations, which are related to momentum conservation. Well, in a Lorentz-invariant theory, the generators of the Poincare group (like momentum and angular momentum) should close properly. So, I think that the operators are required to transform covariantly under the Poincare group. Thus, both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries would be required. But wait, is that the case?

Wait, no. Because Poincare symmetry includes translations, which tie into the momentum of the system. But the effective theory is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory. So maybe Poincare symmetry is automatically respected if Lorentz symmetry is. Or perhaps not; maybe Poincare is a more stringent requirement. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Then there's CP symmetry, which stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. CP symmetry is about the symmetry when you swap particles with their antiparticles and reflect space. But I don't think SMEFT necessarily respects CP symmetry. The Standard Model doesn't have a CP symmetry that's exact, and SMEFT includes higher-dimensional operators which can violate CP, like the dimension-6 operators that can cause CP violation in processes like the neutron EDM.

So, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry, but not necessarily CP. So, question 3, CP symmetry, isn't a must. Thus, option 3 is not required.

What about CPT symmetry? CPT is Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, as per the TCP theorem. The theorem states that for any relativistic quantum field theory, the combination of C, P, and T must be a symmetry. So, any operator in the theory must respect CPT symmetry. So question 4 is a must.

So, putting it together: the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), and CPT (4). But what about Poincare? Do they have to respect Poincare symmetry as well?

Wait, Poincare group includes Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations. If the theory is Lorentz-invariant, then all the Lorentz transformations are symmetries. But for Poincare symmetry, you also need that the theory is invariant under spacetime translations, which would imply momentum conservation. But in an effective theory built from integrating out heavy fields, like SMEFT, which is a Lorentz-invariant theory, the Poincare symmetry should still hold because the effective theory is a Lorentz-invariant field theory. So, perhaps the operators in SMEFT must respect both Lorentz and Poincare.

Wait, but Lorentz symmetry is part of Poincare symmetry. So if the theory is Poincare-symmetric, it must also be Lorentz-symmetric. But do all theories that are Lorentz-symmetric also have to be Poincare-symmetric? Because Poincare includes translations, which require the theory to be invariant under shifting the spacetime coordinates. So SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory, but it's also a translation-invariant theory because it's a field theory in Minkowski space.

So, the operators in SMEFT must respect both Lorentz and Poincare. But wait, could there be operators that break Poincare but not Lorentz? Probably not, because to break Poincare, you'd have to break either Lorentz or translation symmetry. So if the operators respect Lorentz symmetry and the theory is a translation-invariant one, they must automatically respect Poincare. But wait, the SMEFT is constructed to be Lorentz invariant, which would imply Poincare, because Poincare includes the translations. So, perhaps the operators don't need an extra condition for Poincare beyond Lorentz symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering whether the operators must respect Poincare symmetry. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. All its operators are constructed to be Lorentz scalars. So, Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must. But does that imply that Poincare symmetry is automatically respected? Because Poincare includes the generators for translations, which would require that the theory is invariant under shifting the coordinates.

In the effective theory, the Lagrangian is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant one, and the terms are built from the Standard Model fields and higher-dimensional operators. Since the SM respects Poincare, and SMEFT is an extension, I think SMEFT also respects Poincare. So all operators in SMEFT must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. So 1 and 2.

Wait, but the options given are:

Option A) 1,2

Option C) 1,2,4

So, if both 1 and 2 are required, but then what about 4?

Wait, the question is, which of the following must be respected by all operators. So, the four options are 1-4, and the choices are combinations.

So, if 1 (Lorentz) and 2 (Poincare) are required, that's options A and C. Wait, because option C includes 1,2,4.

But I thought that CPT must be respected.

So, if all operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4), but not necessarily CP (3), then the correct choice would be option C.

But wait, I thought that Poincare is a larger symmetry group which includes Lorentz and translations. So, if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So, the question is whether the operators must respect Poincare, which is a stronger statement than Lorentz.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to approach this from another angle.

In SMEFT, the operators are constructed as Lorentz scalars, meaning they are invariant under Lorentz transformations. So, operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (1) is correct.

Now, Poincare symmetry is the combination of Lorentz and translations. Since the theory is built in Minkowski space, it's automatically translation-invariant. So, the effective theory is Poincare-invariant because it's a Lorentz-invariant theory in a translation-invariant spacetime.

Thus, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry (2). So both 1 and 2 are correct.

But wait, I'm not entirely certain. Maybe the effective theory doesn't require translation invariance? Or is it that the operators are only required to be Lorentz scalars, and not necessarily invariant under translations? Hmm, but in the SMEFT framework, the theory is still built to respect the symmetries of the SM, including Poincare. Because the SM respects Poincare, and SMEFT is an extension.

So, I think that both 1 and 2 are required. Also, CPT symmetry (4) is required because it's a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. Operators that don't respect CPT would lead to a violation of unitarity, perhaps. So, all operators must respect CPT.

So, the symmetries that must be respected are 1, 2, and 4. That would point to option C.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

So, if 1,2,4 must be respected, that's option C.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about Poincare. Because Lorentz is part of Poincare, but perhaps the question is considering them as separate. Do I need to respect both Lorentz and Poincare?

Wait, no. If a theory respects Poincare symmetry, it automatically respects Lorentz and translations. So, the question is, which of the four do the operators have to respect.

Wait, the question says, "must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT". So, could it be that the operators must respect Lorentz, but not necessarily Poincare? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Poincare symmetry is automatically satisfied if the theory is Lorentz and translation invariant. But since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory, and the operators are Lorentz scalars, perhaps the operators are already Poincare-symmetric.

Wait, but maybe the question is more about whether the operators must have their individual terms respect those symmetries. So for an operator to be part of the theory, it must be a scalar under Lorentz, which is 1, but for Poincare, perhaps the entire theory must be Poincare invariant, but individual operators don't necessarily have to have their own terms respect Poincare beyond being Lorentz scalars?

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about each symmetry:

1. Lorentz symmetry: Operators must be Lorentz scalars. So yes, they must respect Lorentz.

2. Poincare symmetry: This includes translations, which would imply momentum conservation. But in the effective theory, the operators are built in such a way to respect this, because the theory is built in Minkowski space. So yes, operators must respect Poincare.

But then again, perhaps it's redundant because if the operators are Lorentz scalars, and the theory is built in a way that respects translations, then Poincare is automatically satisfied.

But the question is about the symmetries that each operator must respect. So, each operator must be a scalar under Lorentz (so 1 is a must). Each operator must also be invariant under translations, but that's a bit tricky. Wait, no. Because translations are spacetime symmetries that affect the coordinates, not the fields in a particular way. So, the operators would have to be local, but their form doesn't change under translations. So, perhaps the operators themselves don't have to transform in any specific way under translations beyond being part of a Lorentz-invariant theory.

Hmm, maybe Poincare symmetry is a global symmetry of the entire theory, not something each operator individually must respect. So, perhaps the individual terms (operators) only need to be Lorentz scalars.

In that case, operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), but not necessarily Poincare symmetry themselves. Instead, the entire theory's Lagrangian is Poincare-invariant.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the Poincare symmetry is a property of the entire Lagrangian, not individual terms. So, each term in the Lagrangian must be a Lorentz scalar, but the sum of terms doesn't have to be a scalar under Poincare unless... Wait, but the theory is built within a Poincare-invariant framework.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Let's think about Poincare symmetry. The Poincare group includes the Lorentz group and the translation group. The theory's Lagrangian must be a scalar under the Poincare group. So, each term in the Lagrangian must be a scalar under both Lorentz and translation. Which they are, because they are local terms (so invariant under translations as a whole).

So, the operators themselves don't need to transform under Poincare; it's the overall theory that is Poincare-invariant. Therefore, each operator must transform as a Lorentz scalar, but their form doesn't have to change under translations because translations act on the coordinates, not on the fields in a particular way. Thus, for each operator, only Lorentz symmetry matters (1), but Poincare (2) is a global symmetry of the theory.

So, the individual operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, but not necessarily Poincare. So, the correct answer would not include Poincare, meaning 2 is not a must. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the SMEFT operators are only required to respect Lorentz symmetry, but not necessarily Poincare, because the latter is a broader symmetry that includes translations, and perhaps the operators themselves don't have to transform in any specific way under translations as long as the entire Lagrangian is translation-invariant.

Wait, but the Lagrangian is a sum of Lorentz scalars, each of which is also a scalar under translations. So, each operator is a scalar under both.

Wait, but scalar under translations means that the operator doesn't change when you shift the coordinates. Since the operators are local (like field products at a point), they are automatically scalars under translations. So, each operator is a scalar under both Lorentz and translation, hence Poincare. But perhaps the requirement for the operator is that it is a Lorentz scalar, and the rest comes automatically.

So, in the end, the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), and CPT symmetry (4). Do they need to respect Poincare? If the operator is a scalar under both Lorentz and translations, then they automatically respect Poincare. So, maybe 2 is automatically satisfied if 1 is and the theory is built in a translation-invariant way.

But the question is, which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So, perhaps the answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz (1), and CPT (4). But wait, why not Poincare?

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about what each symmetry requires.

Lorentz symmetry (1): Operators must form Lorentz scalars. All operators in SMEFT must satisfy this.

Poincare symmetry (2): The entire theory must be Poincare invariant, which includes Lorentz and translations. Since the theory is formulated in Minkowski space, it's translation-invariant. So, the operators don't need to individually satisfy Poincare, but the theory as a whole does. So, each operator doesn't have to respect Poincare beyond being a Lorentz scalar.

Wait, but the question is about what the operators must respect. So, perhaps the correct answer is that they must respect Lorentz and CPT.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the symmetries that are imposed on the theory, meaning that all operators must individually respect these symmetries.

In that case, each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, so 1 is needed. Do they also need to respect Poincare? Well, if the operator is a scalar under Poincare, yes. But I think that's automatically true because it's a Lorentz scalar and the theory is translation-invariant, so each operator is a Poincare scalar.

But maybe the answer is that the operators must respect Lorentz (1), and CPT (4). So, looking at the options, the correct answer would have 1 and 4. But the options don't have an option with 1 and 4 only. Wait, let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

So, if 1, 2, and 4 are required, that's option C. But I'm not entirely confident about whether all operators must respect Poincare.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is mixing up Poincare and Lorentz. Because Poincare includes Lorentz, so if operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz.

But the question is which symmetries must be respected. So, the correct symmetries are Lorentz (1), because operators must form Lorentz scalars, and CPT (4) because operators must respect CPT symmetry.

Wait, but what about 2, Poincare? If the operator must respect Poincare, that would require it to be a scalar under both Lorentz and translations. But since operators are local terms, they are already scalars under translations, so they automatically satisfy Poincare if they are Lorentz scalars. So, perhaps 2 is automatically satisfied as part of the theory's construction, but each operator doesn't need to 'respect' Poincare beyond being a Lorentz scalar.

But the way the question is phrased, it's about the symmetries that must be respected by all operators. So, for each operator, it must be a Lorentz scalar (so 1 is a must). Also, each operator must respect CPT symmetry (4), because the theory must be CPT-invariant.

So, option C includes 1,2,4. But I'm not sure if 2 is required.

Wait, another approach: in the SMEFT, the operators are classified according to their Lorentz structure. So, definitely, Lorentz symmetry (1) is a must.

CPT symmetry (4) is also required because the theory must be unitary, and without CPT, unitarity can be violated. So, the operators must respect CPT.

What about Poincare? Since the operators are part of a Poincare-invariant theory, but do the operators themselves have to transform in a specific way under Poincare? Because Poincare includes translations, which are global symmetries that don't act on the fields in a particular way—like the fields are local, so their transformation under translations is trivial. Hence, the operators, being local, are automatically scalars under translations. So, each operator is a Poincare scalar because it's a Lorentz scalar and a translation scalar.

Thus, operators must respect both Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2), because each term in the Lagrangian must be a Poincare scalar. So, the operators must respect 1 and 2.

Wait, but that doesn't align with the earlier thought. Now I'm more confused. Perhaps I should look for the correct answer from the options.

The options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

If the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4), then the answer is C. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that operators must respect Lorentz (1), but not necessarily Poincare (2), because Poincare is a global symmetry of the theory, not of the individual operators. Then, plus CPT (4), the answer would be C: 1,2,4.

But I'm not certain.

Another angle: in the Standard Model, all interactions respect Poincare symmetry. SMEFT is an effective theory built from the SM, so it should also respect Poincare. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry.

So, the correct answer would have 1,2,4, which is option C.

But to make sure, I'll think about what each symmetry implies for the operators.

- Lorentz symmetry: Operators must be Lorentz scalars. Definitely a must.

- Poincare symmetry: The entire theory must be invariant under Poincare, which includes the operators being Poincare scalars. Since the operators are local (i.e., at a point), they are automatically scalars under translations. So, each operator is a Poincare scalar if it's a Lorentz scalar. Hence, 2 is automatically satisfied if 1 is. So, perhaps the operators don't need to 'respect' Poincare beyond being Lorentz scalars.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So, perhaps the point is that each operator individually must be invariant under the symmetry transformations. So, for Poincare, each operator must be a scalar under Poincare, which includes being a scalar under translations and Lorentz. So, if an operator is a Lorentz scalar, it's automatically a scalar under translations, hence a Poincare scalar.

So, in that case, each operator must respect both Lorentz and Poincare. Which would mean that 1 and 2 are both correct, so the answer includes them.

But then, all operators must also respect CPT symmetry (4), as the theory must be CPT-invariant. So, the correct option is C: 1,2,4.

I think that's the case. So, the answer is option C.


In the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), operators are constructed to describe interactions beyond the Standard Model without introducing new particles. These operators must respect certain symmetries, and the question asks which of the given symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

### Analysis of the Symmetries:
1. **Lorentz Symmetry (1):**  
   Lorentz symmetry is fundamental in relativistic field theories. Operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz scalars, meaning they must transform covariantly under Lorentz transformations. This is a strict requirement for any operator in SMEFT.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry (2):**  
   Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT is formulated in Minkowski spacetime, it is automatically translation-invariant. Operators in SMEFT are local and do not depend on specific spacetime coordinates, making them scalars under translations. Thus, operators in SMEFT are also Poincaré scalars if they are Lorentz scalars. While Poincaré symmetry is a global property of the theory, individual operators must respect it by being Lorentz scalars.

3. **CP Symmetry (3):**  
   CP symmetry involves charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). SMEFT allows for operators that can violate CP symmetry, as this is consistent with phenomena like CP violation in the Standard Model. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry (4):**  
   CPT symmetry combines charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). This symmetry is fundamental in quantum field theory, as violations of CPT would lead to serious inconsistencies such as non-unitarity. All operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

### Conclusion:
Operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not a requirement for all operators. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
