Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. The question gives me some information about each star, and I need to determine which ones are observable by both instruments.

First, I should understand the constraints given. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitude brighter than 17 mag. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So a star needs to have an apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 16 (since 16 is the cutoff for HIRES) because 17 would be too faint for HIRES. Wait, wait. Let me think again. The description says "brighter than 17" for ESPRESSO and "brighter than 16" for HIRES. So the ESPRESSO can handle up to 17 mag, while HIRES can handle up to 16 mag. So a star must be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO? Wait, no, "brighter than 17 mag" means the magnitude is less than 17, because lower magnitudes are brighter. So, for ESPRESSO, apparent V magnitude must be <=17 (since anything brighter than 17 is allowed). Similarly, for HIRES, apparent V must be <=16.

So the stars that can be detected by both would have apparent V magnitude <=16 because that's the stricter condition. Because both have to be able to detect it. So any star with apparent V <=16 can be seen by both, since HIRES requires <=16 and ESPRESSO can go up to 17.

Now, I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star. Let's go through each star.

Star1: Absolute V is 15.5 mag, distance is 10 pc. The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is in parsecs. So m = 15.5 +5 * log(10/10)= 15.5 +5*0=15.5. So m=15.5. So it's 15.5, which is brighter than 16, so it can be observed by both. Wait, but wait: the question says ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17, meaning m <17? Or is it m <=17? Because 17 is the cutoff. If a star is m=17, it's exactly the threshold. I think the wording means m <17, so for ESPRESSO, m can be up to 17, but not including 17. So Star1: m=15.5, which is less than 16 and 17. So it's observable by both.

Star2: Apparent V is 16.5 mag. So that's above 16. So for HIRES, which can only go up to 16, Star2 is too faint. So it's only observable by ESPRESSO. So this star is out for the combined
