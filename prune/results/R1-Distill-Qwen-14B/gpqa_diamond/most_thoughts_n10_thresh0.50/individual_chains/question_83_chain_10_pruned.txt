Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right approach to solve it. Let's read the problem again carefully.

We're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I think I need to find out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we're adding 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³.

Wait, right. The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 would be (M1V1)/(V1 + V2). Let me calculate that.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 20 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20)/(20 + 20) = (1)/(40) = 0.025 M. Oh wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters, right? So maybe I should convert to liters for M calculations. Wait, no, the units are cm³, but since M is mol/cm³, I can multiply directly. Oh, wait, M is moles per liter, so 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters.

Wait, no, because 1 M is 1 mol per liter. So 0.05 M is 0.05 mol per liter. So the initial number of moles of acetic acid is M * V (in liters). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol.

When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles / volume. 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

So now, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. The first part is to find the pH at 25% titration. Then the equivalence point.

Wait, 25% titration. Hmm, I think that means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH.

Wait, so let's think about the equivalence point first. Because knowing that might help with the second part.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So let's find out how much NaOH is needed for that.

The moles of acetic acid initially is 0.001 mol
