Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me try to think this through. I remember that when dealing with light and moving media, things can get a bit tricky because of relativity and how different frames of reference affect measurements.

So the setup is: there's a light beam moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer.

Wait, right. The index of refraction n tells us how much the light slows down in the medium. Normally, in a stationary medium, the speed of light is c/n. But here, the medium is moving. So I think this involves some sort of velocity addition from special relativity, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, no, maybe not. Because the problem is about the speed of light in the glass, not the speed of the glass. So perhaps I should think about how the movement of the medium affects the observed speed.

Wait, but according to Einstein's theory, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c in any inertial frame. But here, the light isn't in a vacuum; it's in glass. So maybe that doesn't apply directly.

Wait, but the glass is moving. So the observer in the lab sees the light moving through the glass, which is itself moving. How does that affect the measured speed?

Hmm, in the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is c/n. Because in that frame, the
