Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also gave me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The options are A to D.

Hmm. I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant tells us about the stability of that complex. The higher the K, the more stable the complex is. So in this case, the Ca-EDTA complex is pretty stable because 5x10^10 is a large number.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the concentration of free calcium ions. Right, because the problem is about the solution containing the complex, so the free Ca²+ concentration is what's needed.

I think the formation constant (K) for a complex can be represented by the equation. Let me recall the formula. The general reaction for EDTA complexation is something like:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-

And the formation constant K is given by:

K = [CaEDTA^2-] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

Wait, but in this scenario, we're given the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex. The solution has 0.02 M of that complex. So [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M.

But what about the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4-? Because the solution is in equilibrium, we can write the expression using K.

So, let's plug in the values. K is 5e10, and [CaEDTA] is 0.02.

So, 5e10 = (0.02) / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

Hmm, but wait, we have two unknowns here: [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-]. How do I find one from the other?

Wait, I remember that in the solution, the total EDTA comes from both the free EDTA and the complex. But if the solution is at stoichiometric conditions,
