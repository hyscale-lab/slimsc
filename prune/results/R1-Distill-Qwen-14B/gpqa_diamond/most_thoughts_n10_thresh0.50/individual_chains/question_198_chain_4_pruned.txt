Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty on my coordination chemistry, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt-containing species. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when a metal ion is in solution with a ligand, they form complexes with different numbers of ligand molecules attached. The stability of these complexes is given by the stability constants, which are also called formation constants. The stability constant (β) tells us how stable a particular complex is compared to the other possible complexes.

In this case, the cobalt can form complexes with SCN- (thiocyanate) ions. The complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n^2+ where n is the number of thiocyanate ligands attached. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, but what do these β values correspond to? Each β should be for a specific n value. I think β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)_2, β3 for Co(SCN)_3, and β4 for Co(SCN)_4.

Wait, no. Wait, the way stability constants work is each β is the formation constant for the next step. So, the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_n would be the product of the β's up to that n. For example, β1 is for CoSCN^2+, β2 is for Co(SCN)_2^2+, and so on. So the overall β for the third complex would be β1 * β2 * β3, right? Wait, no. Or maybe each β is the cumulative constant up to that n. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. So probably, each β corresponds to the stepwise formation constant for adding another SCN- ion. So for example, β1 is the constant for Co^2+ + SCN^- → CoSCN^2+;
