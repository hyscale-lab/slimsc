Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, I remember from my studies that eigenvectors and eigenvalues are important concepts in quantum mechanics, especially when dealing with operators like momentum or angular momentum. 

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, but the direction n is arbitrary but in the x-z plane, so the angle θ (theta) would be the angle between n and the z-axis. I think the operator P in an arbitrary direction is given by the dot product of the vector operator P and the direction vector n. Oh, right, P · n̂, where n̂ is the unit vector in the direction of n.

So first, I need to write the operator P in the direction of n. Since n is in the x-z plane, it can be expressed as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Or wait, no, wait. Wait, in spherical coordinates, the direction in x-z plane would have the y-component zero. So n would be (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero, so n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). But wait, actually, no, wait. If the direction is in the x-z plane, then the angle θ is measured from the z-axis. So the unit vector would be (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero. So n becomes (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Or wait, wait. Wait, the standard spherical coordinates have θ from the positive z-axis, and φ the angle in the x-y plane. So if the direction is in x-z, then φ is 0 or π? Hmm. Wait, if n is in the x-z plane, then φ is either 0 or π because that's where the projection onto the x-y plane is zero. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) when φ is 0.
