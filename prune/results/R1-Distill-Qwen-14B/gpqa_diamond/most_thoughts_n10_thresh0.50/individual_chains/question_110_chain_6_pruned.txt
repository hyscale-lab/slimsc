Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. The question gives me five stars with various properties, and I need to determine which ones can be observed by both instruments. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I should understand the capabilities of each spectrograph. The question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. That means any star with V magnitude less than 17 is visible to ESPRESSO. On the other hand, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so anything with V magnitude <16 is visible to HIRES.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the wording is tricky. It says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So brightness is inversely related to magnitude. So a lower magnitude means brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag (which is, like, a higher brightness because lower numbers are brighter), then ESPRESSO can observe it. So the condition is that the apparent V magnitude (m_v) must be less than 17 for ESPRESSO to detect it, right? Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So for ESPRESSO, m_v <17. For HIRES, it's m_v <16. So a star needs to be brighter than 16 in V to be seen by HIRES.

So the star has to have m_v less than 16 to be detected by HIRES and less than 17 for ESPRESSO. Wait no, because if m_v is less than 16, that's even brighter, so it's within the ESPRESSO limit as well. So any star that's detected by HIRES would automatically be detected by ESPRESSO, since the magnitude limit is higher.

Wait, no, the other way around. ESPRESSO can go up to 17, HIRES up to 16. So stars with m_v less than 16 would be detected by both. But stars with m_v between 16 and 17 would only be detectable by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

But the question is which stars can be detected
