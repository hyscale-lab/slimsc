Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift tells us about the planet's mass and orbital period.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both have circular orbits. Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, right, the RV method's shift depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period, but how exactly? I think the formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is involved here. The formula is K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) * (2π)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3). Wait, maybe I should recall the simplified version when M_p is much smaller than M_*, which is the case here since Neptune's mass is much less than the Sun's.

So K is proportional to (M_p / (M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3))) ) )^(1/3) No, wait, maybe I'm mixing variables. Let me think again. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = [ (G * P) / (2π) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_*)^(1/3)) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, the (1 + M_p/M_*) term is approx 1. So K simplifies to:

K ≈ [ (G * P ) / (2 π) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p) / M_*^(2/3) )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ ( (G * M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ] / ( (P/ (2π) )^(1/3) )

But again, since M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

K ≈ [ (G * M_p sin i ) / M_* ) ]^(1/3) / ( (P/(2π))^(1/3) )

Which can be rewritten as:

K ≈ [ ( G M_p sin i ) / ( M_* ) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π)^(1/3) / P^(1/3)

But maybe it's easier to think about the relationship between K and P when M_p and M_* are the same for both planets. Since both stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses, sin i is probably the same (assuming edge-on orbits, which is typical assumption for RV method), so sin i ≈ 1.

So for both planets, K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) )^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, but M_p is same for both planets (Neptune-like), and M_* is same too. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K1 is the velocity for planet 1 and K2 for planet 2, then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, let me think again. Because the formula is K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). So if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K2 > K1, which would imply that P2 < P1? Because higher K implies shorter period, since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Wait, wait no. Let me get this straight.

If K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), then P is proportional to (1/K)^(3). So P ∝ (1/K)^3. So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1. So the ratio P2/P1 would be (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, let me confirm. Let me write the proportionality: K ∝ 1/(P)^(1/3). So K = C / P^(1/3), where C is a constant (since M_p and M_* are same for both). So if I rearrange, P = (C/K)^3.

So for Planet 1: P1 = (C/K1)^3.

For Planet 2: P2 = (C/K2)^3.

So the ratio P2/P1 would be [ (C/K2)^3 ] / [ (C/K1)^3 ] = (K1/K2)^3.

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

But wait, no. Because if K2 is larger, then (C/K2) is smaller than (C/K1), so P2 is smaller than P1. So the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1.

But the question is asking how many times longer Planet #2's period is than Planet #1's. So if P2 is smaller, then the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1.

Wait but let me make sure I'm doing this right. Let me take the formula:

K = ( (G * M_p) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3)

So K = [ ( G M_p ) / ( M_* ) * (2π) / P ) ]^(1/3 )

K^3 = (G M_p 2π )/( M_* P ) )

So P = (G M_p 2 π) / ( M_* K^3 )

So P is proportional to 1/K^3.

So P1 = C / K1^3, P2 = C / K2^3.

So the ratio P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, yes. Because P2 = C/K2^3 and P1 = C/K1^3, so P2/P1 is (K1^3)/(K2^3) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

So in this problem, K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3.

What's 5/7? Approximately 0.714.

Cube of 0.714 is about 0.714 * 0.714 = 0.51, then 0.51 * 0.714 ≈ 0.364.

So approximately 0.36. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1 by a factor of ~0.36. Which means planet #2's orbital period is about 36% of planet #1's period. So it's shorter, meaning planet #2's period is not longer, but shorter.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1. So if planet #2's period is shorter, then the ratio is less than 1. So the correct answer would be around 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let me check the options again: option A is ~0.36, option D is ~0.85. So the ratio is (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364, which is close to 0.36. So the answer should be A.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in a star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity, \( K \), is proportional to \( 1/P^{1/3} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet. This relationship arises because \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \), meaning that as the orbital period increases, the semi-amplitude decreases.

For two planets with the same mass and host stars of the same mass, the ratio of their orbital periods can be determined using the formula:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Here, \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity shifts for planets #1 and #2, respectively. From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

First, calculate \( \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714 \). Then, cube this value:

\[
\left(0.714\right)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of planet #1. This means planet #2's orbital period is shorter than planet #1's by a factor of ~0.36. The question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. Since the period of planet #2 is shorter, the ratio \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \) is less than 1, and the closest option is **A) ~0.36**.
