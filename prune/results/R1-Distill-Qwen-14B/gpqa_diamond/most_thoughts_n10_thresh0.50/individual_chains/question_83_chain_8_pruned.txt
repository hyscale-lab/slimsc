Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration calculations. But I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

Alright, the problem says: We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A to D, each with two pH values.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about what each part entails.

First, when you mix two solutions, you have to calculate the new concentration. So, the initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, adding 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³.

Wait, so the initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be Molarity × Volume. Let me compute that. 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters) = 0.001 moles. Because M = moles/L, so 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol.

After dilution with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is moles / volume. 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait a minute—acetic acid is a weak acid, so when we dilute it, it dissociates more, but for calculating initial pH, I think I can still use the dilution formula. But maybe I need to consider that for the pH calculations. Hmm. But for the initial state before titration, which is the diluted solution, we probably need to calculate the pH using the dissociation of acetic acid.

Wait no, the first part is about the pH at 25% titration. Wait, so the titration is
