Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The mass is m, maximum amplitude is A, and it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, so first, I remember that in the classical harmonic oscillator (non-relativistic), the maximum speed is given by v_max = sqrt(kA/m). But this is a relativistic case, so things must be different. Oh right, because when speeds get close to the speed of light, you can't ignore relativistic effects anymore.

In the relativistic scenario, the energy of the oscillator would include both the kinetic and potential energy, but using the relativistic expressions. So the total energy would be the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. But I'm not sure exactly how that works. Let me think.

In the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and kinetic is (1/2)mv². But relativistically, kinetic energy isn't just (gamma - 1)mc², right? So the total energy would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic. Wait, but in the problem statement, it's given that the system obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. So maybe the potential is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

Wait, no, because in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy E would be E = mc² + (gamma - 1)mc² = gamma mc².

But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the same as when the mass is at maximum displacement, where all energy is potential. So at x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. But in relativity, the rest mass energy is mc², and the total energy when the oscillator is at maximum displacement is mc² + (1/2)kA². But when the mass is at the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic, so the kinetic energy should equal the potential energy at maximum displacement.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to structure this.

In the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², because at maximum displacement, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and kinetic is zero. Then, at the equilibrium point, all that energy converts to kinetic energy (1/2)mv_max². So solving gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But this is the non-relativistic case.

But the question is relativistic, so the energy expressions are different. So in the relativistic case, the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and that
