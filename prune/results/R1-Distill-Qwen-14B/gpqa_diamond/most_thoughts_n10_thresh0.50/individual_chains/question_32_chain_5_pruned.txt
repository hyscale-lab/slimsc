Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the energy of the RHIC when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but I'll try to work through it.

First, let me read the question again. The nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Li usually has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6. Wait, no, wait. Wait, Li is element 3. So Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so mass number 6. Yeah, that's right. So X is Li-6.

The question is asking for the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. So energy in relativity terms—oh right, we're probably dealing with relativistic energy here, not just kinetic. Or wait, could it be kinetic? Hmm, the question says "energy of the RHIC", which I think refers to the kinetic energy imparted to the ions for their collisions. Or wait, sometimes accelerators give the kinetic energy, sometimes the total energy. I'm not sure. Wait, let me think. RHIC is a collider, so it collides ions with high energies. The energy they give is typically the kinetic energy. Or wait, sometimes they give the total energy. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I think in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, it usually refers to the kinetic energy each beam has. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, sometimes they might give the total energy, which is the sum of rest mass plus kinetic. Hmm. Well, I'll proceed with the formula and see.

The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c^2. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, if the question is asking for kinetic energy, it's E = (gamma -1) m0 c². So I need to clarify that.

Wait, the question says "the energy of the RHIC"—I think RHIC's energy per beam is usually the kinetic energy. For example, the LHC has proton beams with a certain kinetic energy. So perhaps in this case, the problem is asking for the kinetic energy.

Alternatively, sometimes people
