Okay, so I've got this problem about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with excitation of atoms, it's related to the thermal energy of the environment they're in. Oh right, in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the excitation levels follow the Boltzmann distribution. 

So the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Let me think about how that translates. The Boltzmann factor is probably involved here. The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but in this case, the question is about the same energy level in both stars. Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. No, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. So the energy difference is the same for both stars because it's the same transition. So E is the same for both, but the temperature differs.

So the ratio of the populations (n_upper/n_lower) would be (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2-E1.

But the problem says that in star 1, the excitation is twice that of star 2. I think that means the number of atoms in the excited state is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. Or maybe the ratio of excitation is 2:1.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is n1/n2 = 2, where n1 is the number in star 1's excited state, and n2 is star 2's. Alternatively, maybe it's the ratio of the excited state to the ground state. Let me clarify: the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So perhaps the excitation level is higher, which in terms of population would mean more atoms in the excited state.

But wait, the specific energy level probably refers to a transition between two levels. So the ratio of
