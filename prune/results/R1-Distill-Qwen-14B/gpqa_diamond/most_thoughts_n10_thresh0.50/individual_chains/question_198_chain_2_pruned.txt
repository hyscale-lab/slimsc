Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me read it again.

The problem is about a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that stability constants relate to the formation of complexes. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So the first complex Co(SCN)(H2O)5^2+ would have β1=9, the next one Co(SCN)_2(H2O)_4^2+ with β2=40, then Co(SCN)_3(H2O)_3^2+ with β3=63, and the fourth β4=16. Wait, but I wonder if the complexes are in the order from β1 to β4, or if β4 is another complex beyond the third? Or maybe β4 is for a different complex, like maybe a higher or lower order.

Wait, the problem says "dithiocyanato," which means two SCN- ligands. So dithiocyanato would be the complex with two SCN^- ions, so that's the second complex, Co(SCN)_2(H2O)_4^2+. Its β is 40. But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think the blue ones are probably the ones with four SCN^-? Or maybe the first one is pink and the second is blue, or something like that. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the colors of different Co(II) complexes. I think Co with four SCN- is blue, and with three is maybe a different color. Wait, the blue ones are the ones with more SCN, perhaps. Alternatively, the problem says "dithiocyanato," meaning two SCN ligands, but the actual complex might have more. Hmm, perhaps the question is about the species with two SCN-
