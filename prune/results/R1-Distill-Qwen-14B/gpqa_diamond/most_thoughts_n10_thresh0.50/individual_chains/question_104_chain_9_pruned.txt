Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The bigger the planet and the closer it is to the star, the larger the wobble, right?

So the question says there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The RV method detected these planets, and the spectral line shifts are given as 5 and 7 milliangstroms for planet 1 and 2 respectively.

Wait, the question is about the ratio of their orbital periods. I need to find how many times longer planet #2's period is compared to planet #1's.

I remember that the RV method's measured velocity is related to the star's velocity. The formula I think is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by a function involving the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the orbital period, and the distance. Oh wait, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is K = (v) = (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P/(2π))^(1/3) )) ) ) ) ... Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula. Oh wait, I can't look it up right now. So perhaps I should think about the factors that determine the RV signal.

Alternatively, I remember that the star's velocity semi-amplitude K depends on the planet's mass, the orbital period, and the distance from the star. Since both stars have the same mass and planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), the main variables are the distance (semi-major axis) and the period.

Wait, the orbital period relates to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law. For a star of mass M, P² is proportional to a³/(M), so a³ = (G M P²)/(4 π²), but I think it's easier to think in terms of Kepler's law in the form P² = (4 π² a³)/(G M). So P is proportional to a^(3/2) / sqrt(M). Since M is same for both stars, P ∝ a^(3/2).

But how does the
