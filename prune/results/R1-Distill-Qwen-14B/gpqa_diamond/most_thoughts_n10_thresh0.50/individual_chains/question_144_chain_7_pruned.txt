Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about a meson resonance X. The problem is asking for the mean decay distance. The given data includes the production energy E_X of 8 GeV, the mass m_X of 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X of 320 MeV. The options are A to D with various distances in meters, each in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.

Hmm. I remember that decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle. The mean decay length (L) is basically the speed of the particle (v) multiplied by its lifetime (τ). So L = v * τ.

But wait, how do I find τ? I think the lifetime is connected to the width Γ through the uncertainty principle. I recall that the Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. For a resonance like this, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy ΔE, so Γ * τ ≈ ħ. Therefore, τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but units are a big deal here. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is usually in units involving eV·seconds. Let me get the constants sorted out.

First, let me write down the formula for the decay length step by step.

1. Compute τ, the lifetime.
   τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, what units should I use here? Let me think. ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, but wait, no. Let me check. I think ħc is about 197 MeV·fm, but that's another topic. For ħ, in units of GeV·s, it's 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the exact value. I remember that ħ is approximately 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·seconds. So if Γ is in GeV, I can use this value.

But Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s. Let me calculate that.

Compute 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, yes? Let me see, 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s? Wait, no. Because 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25, which is indeed approximately 20.568
