Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, let's read it again. The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance, given that the number varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Oh wait, the equation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. 

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Wait, no, actually, I think it's plx = 1/(distance in parsecs). So if the distance increases, the parallax decreases. Because closer stars have higher parallax; farther stars have lower. Right.

So the question says the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let's write that as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, then plx = 1/d. So plx^5 would be (1/d)^5 = 1/d^5. So 1/(plx)^5 is d^5. Because 1/(1/d^5) is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. Oh, wait, no, the question is asking about the change in the number of stars as a function of distance. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, let me rephrase
