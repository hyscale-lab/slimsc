Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required to make a nucleus move at 0.96c. Hmm, I remember RHIC collides heavy ions, but I'm not exactly sure about the specifics. Let me try to think this through.

The question says the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So, lithium usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

I need to find the energy of the RHIC such that the speed of this nucleus is 0.96c. So, energy in particle physics often refers to the kinetic energy, but sometimes people use total energy (rest mass plus kinetic). Wait, but in colliders, the energy given is usually the kinetic energy each beam has. Or maybe the total energy? Hmm, I'm a bit confused about that.

Wait, in high-energy physics, when they talk about the energy of a particle in a collider, they usually refer to the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy plus kinetic. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. The total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy (mc²). And gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, since the speed v is 0.96c, let me calculate gamma first. Let's compute v²/c²: (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c². So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.0784 sqrt: Let's see, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right? Oh, because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So yeah, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

So gamma is about 3.5714. Now, the total energy E is gamma * m * c². But wait, the rest mass m is the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. So what's the mass of Li-6?

The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015 atomic mass units (u). But wait, the exact value might be needed for precise calculation. Wait, each nucleon is about 1 u, but for precise calculations, I need to get the exact mass of Li-6. Let's think, the atomic mass is approximately 6.015 u.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0150678137 u. Let me check, because I'm a bit rusty on exact isotope masses. Alternatively
