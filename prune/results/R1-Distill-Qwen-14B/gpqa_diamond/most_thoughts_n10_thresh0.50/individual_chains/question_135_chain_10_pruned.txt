Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The term is written as L(y) = -λf f-bar ψ_f (y) (ν + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. So, the term is -λ times something involving the fields. Hmm, perhaps it's a Yukawa-like interaction, since Yukawa couplings typically involve a scalar (like the X here) interacting with fermions. 

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and the question is about the allowed decay channels of X at the lowest order. So, I need to figure out which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into.

I remember that for a boson to decay into a fermion pair, the energy (or the mass of the boson) must be greater than twice the mass of the fermion. Because in decays, the rest mass of the boson determines the available energy. So each fermion has a mass, and X can only decay into pairs where each fermion in the pair is less than half the mass of X.

Wait, let me clarify. The mass of X is 6 GeV. So each fermion in the decay product must have a mass less than (6 GeV)/2 = 3 GeV. Because the rest mass energy of each particle must be less than the available energy. So any fermion with mass greater than 3 GeV can't be produced because the energy isn't sufficient.

Now, I should list the masses of all the known fermions to see which ones are under 3 GeV.

Let me think:

Leptons:
- Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV (much less than 3 GeV)
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV

Quarks:
Up (u): around 2.2 MeV (so less than 3 GeV)
Down (d): similar to up, but maybe a bit heavier? Like around 4-5 MeV. Also way under 3 GeV.
Strange (s): about 95-100 MeV. Under 3 GeV.
Charm (c): about 1.2-1.5 GeV. Under 3 GeV.
Bottom (b): about 4.1-4.7 GeV. Oh wait, that's over 3 GeV. So bottom quarks can't be produced since 4.1 > 3 GeV.

Wait, let me make sure. So X has mass 6 GeV. So for a fermion-antifermion pair, each must be less than 3 GeV. So any fermion lighter than 3 GeV is allowed.

So which fermions are lighter than 3 GeV? Let's see:

Leptons:
- e (0.0005 GeV) yes
- mu (0.1 GeV) yes
- tau (~1.777 GeV) yes

Quarks:
u: ~2.2 MeV — yes
d: ~5 MeV — yes
s: ~100 MeV — yes
c: ~1.5 GeV — yes
b: ~4.5 GeV — no, too heavy
t: top quark is way heavier (~173 GeV) — no

So the fermions allowed are electrons, muons, taus, and the quarks u, d, s, c.

Wait, but in the decay, the boson X would need to couple to these fermions. The interaction term given is in the Lagrangian. Let me look at the term again: it's -λ f f-bar ψ_f (y
