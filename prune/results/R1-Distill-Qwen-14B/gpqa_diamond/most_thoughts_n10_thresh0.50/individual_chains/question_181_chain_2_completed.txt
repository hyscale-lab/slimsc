Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. 

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8 and a half minutes ago. All other reactions are as usual. They're asking about the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: band 1 is 700-800 keV, and band 2 is 800-900 keV. The options are A to D, with some ratios like 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1.

Wait, first, what's the pp-III branch? I remember the proton-proton chain is the main fusion process in the Sun. The pp-I, II, and III branches are different steps in this chain. PP-III might produce high-energy neutrinos, maybe the ones that are a big part of the solar neutrino flux we detect.

So if the pp-III branch stops, but others continue, how does that affect the neutrino flux? Neutrinos are produced in various steps of the fusion. The main ones are the pep (proton-electron-proton) branch, the pp-I and pp-II, and the pp-III. Each produces neutrinos at different energies.

I think the pp-III branch is responsible for producing higher-energy neutrinos. Let me recall: the dominant neutrino emission comes from the pp-I and pp-III branches. The pp-III branch produces a higher-energy neutrino, around 800-900 keV, while the pp-I produces lower energy, like 400-600 keV. Wait, but the question is about bands 700-800 and 800-900. So maybe the pp-III branch contributes more to the higher band (800-900 keV), since they are higher energy.

If pp-III stops, then the flux from that band would drop. Or wait, the pp-III produces neutrinos in the 800-900 keV range. So if that branch stops, the higher band's flux would decrease, while the lower band (700-800) might be from other sources, like perhaps the pep branch or the pp-I, which might emit neutrinos in the 500-700 keV range, but maybe some can reach up into 700-800.

Wait, the energy spectrum of the solar neutrinos. The main neutrinos come from the pp chain and the CNO cycle. The dominant is the pp chain, which produces neutrinos in the ~ few hundred keV range. The higher-energy neutrinos, like the ones in the 800 keV band, I think are from the pp-III branch. So if pp-III stops, those high-energy neutrinos would be absent.

But the question is about the ratio of flux between 700-800 and 800-900. If pp-III stops, the 800-900 keV band would lose all its neutrinos, right? Because pp-III is the main source for those high energies. So band 2 (800-900) would have almost zero flux, while band 1 (700-800) might have some left if other processes contribute.

Wait, but what about the other branches? Like, the pep branch produces lower-energy neutrinos, around 1.4 MeV, but wait, that's higher than the pp-III's 800 keV. No, wait, I might be getting this mixed up. Let me think again. 

The proton-proton chains:

- PP-I: Two protons fuse into deuterium, emitting a positron and a neutrino. The neutrino energy is about 400 keV. So those would be in the 400-600 range, maybe.

- PP-II: Another step, maybe a higher energy? Or is it the same as I?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the details. Let me try to get the neutrino energies right. 

In the proton-proton chain:

- The first step is p + p → ²H + e⁺ + ν_e. The neutrino energy from this is about 400 keV.

- Then, other steps involve capturing electrons, but the main neutrino emission comes from this first step. But wait, the main emission is actually from the branch where two protons combine, and then another proton combines with a deuterium nucleus (²H). So that's the pp-I branch, which has the 400 keV neutrinos. 

The pp-III branch is a different pathway where three protons fuse in a different way. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me check my notes.

Ah, right. The pp chain has two main branches: the majority is the pp-I branch, which produces about 90% of the neutrinos. The pp-II and pp-III are minor branches. 

PP-I: p + p → ²H + e⁺ + ν. Energy ~0.4 MeV (400 keV).

PP-III: In this branch, two protons combine with a deuterium, forming helium-3, then two helium-3 combine into He-4, releasing two protons. This branch produces higher-energy neutrinos, around 1.4 MeV? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are higher in energy than the pp-I. 

Wait, I think the neutrino energies are: 

- The dominant pp-I branch emits neutrinos around ~0.4 MeV (400 keV).

- The pp-III branch emits higher-energy neutrinos, around 1.4 MeV (1400 keV). No, that doesn't fit into the bands given in the question. Wait, the bands are 700-800 and 800-900 keV, so 0.7-0.8 MeV and 0.8-0.9 MeV.

Hmm, so perhaps I'm getting the energies wrong. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the neutrino types. The Sun also emits electron neutrinos and others, like mu and tau, but the question says flavor changes don't matter here. So, the main thing is the production.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch produces the high-energy neutrinos in the 800-900 keV range. So if that's the case, then without the pp-III, the 800-900 keV band would have almost no neutrinos. But what about band 1, 700-800 keV?

Are there other sources for neutrinos in the 700 keV range? Maybe the CNO cycle produces some, but I think CNO neutrinos are even higher in energy. Or perhaps the pp-I branch can have some spread in energy, so some of its neutrinos might reach 700 keV. Or maybe the question is referring to the 7Be decay neutrinos, which are around 1.8 MeV? No, that's way higher.

Wait, perhaps the 700-800 keV band is dominated by the pp-III branch, and the 800-900 is as well. Or maybe the pp-III is the primary source for the 800-900 keV band.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach this differently.

If the pp-III branch stopped, which neutrino flux would decrease? The pp-III produces higher-energy neutrinos. So the 800-900 keV band would have a much lower flux because that's where the pp-III neutrinos are. The 700-800 keV band might still have significant flux because it's covered by the pp-I branch.

Wait, but what's the energy distribution of the pp-I vs pp-III? The pp-III produces higher-energy neutrinos, so perhaps it's the main contributor to the 800-900 keV band. If so, then when pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 (800-900) would drop to almost zero, while band 1 (700-800) remains at its normal level, which might be much higher. So the ratio would be band1_flux / band2_flux, which would be very high, perhaps 10 or more.

But wait, the question says "the pp-III branch suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago." Hmm, neutrinos travel at the speed of light, so 8.5 minutes is about the time it takes for solar neutrinos to reach Earth. So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from that would stop reaching us now. Or wait, wait—if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, that means that the neutrinos emitted after that time won't come from pp-III. But since the Sun is a large star, the neutrinos come from different depths and times. Wait, but the question is about the current flux, so the neutrinos we detect now are those emitted during the past 8.5 minutes, because any longer ago would have already reached us. Wait, no, that's not right. Because neutrinos are produced in the core, which is about 8 minutes light travel time from the surface. So any neutrino emitted now takes about 8 minutes to reach Earth. So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, then any neutrinos emitted in the pp-III branch after that would have been emitted 8.5 minutes ago and would reach us now. Wait, no—emitted 8.5 minutes ago would reach us now. So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, then no new neutrinos from pp-III would be emitted since then, so the current flux from pp-III is zero. Because the emission stopped 8.5 minutes ago, so no new pp-III neutrinos are being produced, and any that were in transit are already here.

So the neutrino flux from pp-III would drop to zero. But other branches, like pp-I and others, continue.

So, the two bands: band 1 is 700-800 keV, band 2 is 800-900 keV.

Assuming that the pp-III neutrinos are mostly in the 800-900 keV range. So without pp-III, the flux in band 2 would drop to zero (or almost), while band 1 might not be affected much.

Wait, but what if the pp-I neutrinos have some in band 1 and some in band 2? Or are pp-I neutrinos only in band 1? Because pp-I produces lower-energy neutrinos, say around 400 keV, so their spectrum would peak in lower energies, but some might reach up into 700-800.

Alternatively, maybe the main contribution to the 700-800 keV band is the pp-III branch. Wait, no. Since the pp-III produces higher-energy neutrinos, perhaps the 800-900 band is dominated by pp-III. So if pp-III stops, band 2's flux goes to zero. But band 1's flux remains as it was.

Wait, but I might be getting the energy spectra confused. Let me try to find some approximate data.

From what I remember, the solar neutrino spectrum peaks around 0.3-0.4 MeV (300-400 keV) and has a tail extending to higher energies. The dominant contribution is from the proton-proton chain, particularly the pp-I branch. The higher-energy neutrinos (around 1 MeV) come from the CNO cycle, but that's higher than the bands in the question.

Wait, but the question's bands are 700-800 and 800-900 keV. So 0.7-0.9 MeV.

Ah, maybe the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in the ~0.8 MeV range. So if that's the case, pp-III contributes significantly to the 700-800 and 800-900 bands.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are around 1.4 MeV, which is higher than the bands, so the 700-800 and 800-900 keV bands are from the pp-I branch, with some contribution from other sources.

Wait, perhaps the pep branch produces higher-energy neutrinos. Let me think.

The pep branch: p + e → ²H + ν. The neutrino energy here is about 1.4 MeV. So that would be in the 1400 keV range, which is higher than the bands. So I think the pep branch contributes to higher energies than the 700-800 and 800-900 keV bands.

So if the pp-III branch is stopped, which produces neutrinos in the 800-900 keV band, then the flux in band 2 would drop. But band 1 (700-800) would still have contributions from other branches, like the pp-I.

Wait, but the pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos. So if the pp-I produces up to about 400 keV, then perhaps the 700-800 keV band is not much affected. But then, what produces neutrinos in that middle range?

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range, and the 800-900 keV is also from the same branch but higher energy. If that's the case, then stopping pp-III would reduce both bands. But the question is about the ratio between band 1 and band 2 after the pp-III branch stops.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III neutrinos are in the 800-900 keV band, so band 2 would have almost no flux, while band 1 is mostly from the pp-I branch. So the ratio would be high.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the expected flux in each band before the pp-III stops.

If the pp-III contributes a significant amount to band 2 (800-900), perhaps even most of it, then when it stops, band 2's flux drops. Suppose before stopping, band 1 had F1 and band 2 had F2, with F2 being a large fraction from pp-III.

After stopping, F2_new ≈ 0, while F1 remains approximately F1. So the ratio F1/F2 would be very large, perhaps F1/(0) which is undefined. But in reality, there might be a small contribution from other processes to both bands.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III is the main source for both bands, but more so for band 2.

Wait, another approach: The problem states that the pp-III branch stops. So what is the typical energy of neutrinos from the pp-III branch?

I think the pp-III branch involves the reaction where a deuterium nucleus captures a proton, producing helium-3 and emitting a neutron, but wait, no, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the neutrinos are emitted in the steps of the pp chain. Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos than the pp-I. So if the pp-III neutrinos are in the 800-900 keV range, then stopping pp-III would reduce that band's flux. The 700-800 band, which is lower, would have less impact because pp-I produces lower energies.

So the flux in band 2 (800-900) would drop to near zero, while band 1 (700-800) remains at its original level.

So the ratio Band1/Band2 would be original_Band1 / almost_zero, which tends to infinity. But that's not an option here. The options are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1. So what's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are around 800-900 keV, so their stopping would cause band 2 to lose all its flux, but band 1 is still present.

But the question is about the ratio after the pp-III stops. So before stopping, band 1 and band 2 are both getting contributions from pp-III and other sources. After stopping, band 2's flux drops.

But if the pp-III is the main source of both bands, then stopping it would affect both. Let's think about the relative contributions.

Suppose band 2's majority comes from pp-III, while band 1's majority comes from another process. Then after stopping pp-III, band 2's flux drops, while band 1's remains similar.

But I'm not confident about this, so perhaps I should think about the typical energy of the neutrinos from the pp-III branch.

Wait, I found in some notes that the pp-III branch produces neutrinos with energies around 1.4 MeV. Wait, that's higher than both bands. So if that's the case, the 700-800 and 800-900 keV bands wouldn't be affected by stopping pp-III.

But that can't be right because the question mentions these bands. So perhaps I'm wrong about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch emits neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range, and the pp-I in lower.

If that's the case, then stopping pp-III would reduce the flux in band 1 more than band 2. But the question's bands are band1: 700-800, band2: 800-900.

If pp-III is the main contributor to band1, then without pp-III, band1's flux would drop, but band2 might not be much affected (assuming it's from other sources). But that's the opposite of what I thought earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are all in the 800-900 keV band, so without them, that band's flux drops to zero. The 700-800 band is from another branch, so its flux remains. So the ratio would be (flux_band1) / (flux_band2), which is (normal) / (0), but that's undefined. But in reality, perhaps other processes contribute a small amount to band2.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are spread across both bands, so without them, both bands are affected.

Wait, perhaps the flux in each band is as follows:

- Band1 (700-800): Mainly from pp-III and maybe some from pp-I.

- Band2 (800-900): Also from pp-III and perhaps some higher-energy processes.

If the pp-III is the main source for both bands, then without it, both bands' fluxes drop.

But the question is about the ratio. Suppose before stopping, the flux ratio is R = F1/F2. After stopping, both F1 and F2 drop, but perhaps F1 was mostly pp-III, F2 also mostly pp-III. So the ratio might stay similar, unless F1 and F2 have different dependencies on pp-III.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes more to band2 than to band1. So after stopping, F2 drops more than F1. So the ratio F1/F2 would increase.

But without knowing the exact contributions, I'm a bit stuck.

Another angle: The neutrino flux from the Sun is dominated by the pp chain, which produces lower-energy neutrinos (peaking around 0.3 MeV). The higher-energy neutrinos (like the 1.4 MeV from the pep branch) are fewer in number. So the higher-energy bands (like 700-800 and 800-900 keV) would have lower flux than the lower bands.

Wait, the number of neutrinos emitted at higher energies is less because the cross-section for those reactions is lower. So the flux decreases with increasing energy.

So if pp-III is producing neutrinos in the 800-900 keV range, and that's a minor part of the total flux, then stopping it would reduce the flux in band2 more than in band1, which is lower in energy and has more contributions.

So the ratio F1/F2 would increase. For example, if before stopping, F1 was 10 and F2 was 1, the ratio is 10. After stopping, F2 drops to 0.1 (if other sources contribute a tiny amount), then F1/F2 would be 10 / 0.1 = 100.

But the options don't include 100. The highest option is A) 10.

Wait, but perhaps without the pp-III, the flux in band2 becomes negligible, making the ratio very large. The options don't have that, so I must be missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are a significant fraction of the higher-energy bands. So without them, F2 would be almost zero, assuming no other sources contribute. Then the ratio F1/F2 would approach infinity. But that's not an option. So perhaps the question is considering the other sources, like the pp-I branch, which might contribute to both bands.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are only in the higher band (800-900 keV). So without pp-III, band2's flux drops, but band1 remains as it was.

If, before stopping, the flux in band1 was F1 and band2 was F2. Suppose F2 is entirely from pp-III, which is stopped, so F2 becomes zero. But band1's F1 is unaffected, so the ratio is F1/0, which is problematic. But in reality, perhaps other processes emit neutrinos in band1 and a small amount in band2.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are in the 500-700 keV range, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another approach. The Sun's neutrino spectrum: most are from the proton-proton chain (pp-I, pp-II, pp-III) and a smaller fraction from the CNO cycle.

The pp-I branch produces neutrinos around 0.4 MeV (400 keV), the pp-III around 0.8 MeV, and the CNO around 2-4 MeV.

Wait, if that's the case, then the 700-800 keV band is from the pp-III branch, and 800-900 is also from pp-III or higher.

So if the pp-III stops, the 700-800 band (band1) would have less flux, and the 800-900 (band2) would have even less. But this depends on the energy distribution.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch emits neutrinos with energies around 0.8 MeV. So they are spread across band1 and band2.

But in that case, the fluxes in both bands are affected, but possibly more so in band2.

Wait, perhaps without knowing the exact energy, I can think about the relative contributions. If the pp-III is a main source for both bands, but band2 is higher, then stopping it would cause the ratio of F1/F2 to increase.

If originally, F1 is 10 and F2 is 1, ratio is 10. After pp-III stops, F1 drops to 5, and F2 drops to 0.5. Then the ratio is 5/0.5=10. So the ratio remains the same.

Alternatively, the pp-III contributes more to band2 than band1. So F2 is lower after stopping, making the ratio higher.

But without precise data, it's challenging.

Wait, the question says "the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2)."

If the pp-III neutrinos are in the 800-900 keV band, then stopping the pp-III would cause band2's flux to drop to almost zero. Band1's flux remains as it was, which is from other sources (like pp-I). So the ratio F1/F2 would be (flux_band1) / (flux_band2) = (normal) / (almost zero) → very large.

But options don't have a very large number. So perhaps the question is implying that the pp-III neutrinos are in both bands, but more in band2. So when pp-III stops, band2's flux drops more than band1.

Wait, maybe in the standard case, band1 and band2 have similar fluxes, but without pp-III, band2's flux is much lower.

So if normally F1 = F2, then after pp-III stops, F2 is much lower. So F1/F2 becomes larger than 1.

The options have A) as 10. So maybe the ratio would be about 10.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes more to band2, so when it stops, band2's flux drops to a small fraction of what it was. Suppose before stopping, F1 is 1 and F2 is 10. Then ratio is 0.1. After stopping, F2 drops to 0.1, so ratio becomes 1/0.1=10. So the ratio increases to 10.

Hmm, that makes sense. Because if pp-III is the main source for band2, and a minor source for band1, then without pp-III, F2 drops more drastically than F1.

So before stopping, F2 = F_ppIII_2 + F_other_2.

After stopping, F_ppIII_2 becomes zero, so F2 = F_other_2.

If F_other_2 is much smaller than F_ppIII_2, then F2 drops a lot.

Similarly, F1 = F_ppIII_1 + F_other_1.

If F_ppIII_1 is small, then F1 doesn't drop much.

So the ratio F1/F2 would be (F_ppIII_1 + F_other_1) / (F_other_2).

If F_ppIII_1 is small, then F1 ≈ F_other_1, and F2 ≈ F_other_2.

So if F_other_1 and F_other_2 are similar, but F2 used to be larger because of pp-III, then after stopping, F2 is smaller.

So the ratio F1/F2 increases.

But without exact numbers, I'm making some assumptions.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux in band2 is 10 times that of band1 under normal circumstances. So if the pp-III contributes 90% of band2's flux and 10% of band1's, then stopping pp-III would drop band2's flux to 10% of original, while band1's remains at 10% + some.

But it's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the main source for band2, so without them, band2's flux is almost zero. So the ratio F1/F2 would be approximately F1 / 0 → infinity, but that's not an option.

Wait, but neutrinos from other processes might contribute to both bands. For example, the pp-I branch contributes to lower energies but perhaps some in the 700 keV range. So F1 would have contributions from pp-I and perhaps a little from pp-III. F2 would have pp-III and perhaps some from other higher-energy processes.

If the pp-III is stopped, F2 would lose most of its flux. So the ratio would be (F_ppI_1 + F_ppIII_1) / (F_ppIII_2 + F_other_2) → (F_ppI_1) / (F_other_2).

If F_ppI_1 is much larger than F_other_2, then the ratio would be large.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes a small fraction to band1 and the majority to band2. So F1 would drop a little, F2 drop a lot.

Another thought: The solar neutrino flux peaks at around 0.3 MeV (300 keV). So the 700-800 keV band is above the peak, and the 800-900 is even higher. So the flux in higher bands is lower.

If the pp-III is the main source for the 800-900 keV band (band2), then without it, band2's flux is much lower.

If band1's flux was mainly from pp-I and perhaps some pp-III, then F1 drops a little, F2 drops a lot.

So the ratio F1/F2 would be about the same as before if F1 and F2 both lose the same fraction. But if F2 loses more, the ratio increases.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about the possible options.

The options are A) 10, B) 0.01, C) 1, D) 0.1.

If the ratio is F1/F2, and F2 is reduced more, the ratio would be higher than 1. So possible options are A or C.

But the options don't include 100, but A is 10.

So perhaps the correct answer is A) 10.

Alternatively, another approach: The number of neutrinos produced in the pp-III branch is lower than the pp-I. So the flux in band2 (if dominated by pp-III) would be lower than band1 (dominated by pp-I). So the ratio F1/F2 would be higher than 1.

If the pp-III contribution to band2 is significant, then F2 without pp-III would be much lower. So F1/F2 would be about 10.

So I'll go with option A) 10.


The question involves analyzing the ratio of neutrino flux between two energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) under the hypothetical scenario where the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops. The pp-III branch is known to produce higher-energy neutrinos compared to the pp-I branch, which dominates the lower-energy neutrino production. The pp-III branch is a minor contributor compared to the pp-I branch but is significant for the higher-energy neutrinos in the 800-900 keV range.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Neutrino Production in the Sun**:
   - The pp-I branch primarily produces neutrinos with energies around 400 keV, contributing to the lower-energy bands.
   - The pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos, likely in the 700-900 keV range, making it the main source for the 800-900 keV band.

2. **Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch**:
   - If the pp-III branch stops, the flux in the 800-900 keV band (band 2) will drop significantly, as this band is dominated by pp-III neutrinos.
   - The 700-800 keV band (band 1) will still receive contributions from the pp-I branch and possibly a small fraction from the pp-III branch, so its flux will remain relatively unaffected.

3. **Flux Ratio Before and After the pp-III Stop**:
   - Before the pp-III branch stops, the flux in band 2 is significantly higher than in band 1 due to the dominance of pp-III neutrinos in the higher-energy band.
   - After the pp-III branch stops, the flux in band 2 drops sharply, while the flux in band 1 remains largely unchanged. This results in a higher ratio of flux in band 1 to flux in band 2.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **A) 10**: This is consistent with the scenario where the pp-III branch contributes significantly to band 2, causing the flux ratio to increase to around 10 after its stoppage.
   - **B) 0.01**: This would imply that band 1's flux drops to a negligible fraction of band 2's flux, which is inconsistent with the expected behavior.
   - **C) 1**: This suggests that the flux ratio remains unchanged, which is unlikely given the significant contribution of pp-III to band 2.
   - **D) 0.1**: This would imply that band 1's flux drops to 10% of band 2's flux, which does not align with the expected dominance of pp-I in band 1.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible ratio of flux between band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV) after the pp-III branch stops is **10**. This aligns with the expectation that the pp-III branch is a major contributor to band 2, causing its flux to drop significantly while band 1 remains relatively unaffected.

Answer: A
