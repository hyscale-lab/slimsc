Okay, so I've got this question about the area of a pseudosphere with a specific metric given. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think this through.

The metric provided is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit complicated. I remember that the area of a surface in two dimensions can be found using the metric tensor. The area element dA is the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor multiplied by dx dy. But wait, in 2D, the area is the integral of dA over the surface.

So the metric is given in terms of dx and dy. The metric tensor g is a 2x2 matrix here. Let me write it out. The line element is ds² = g_xx dx² + 2 g_xy dx dy + g_yy dy². But looking at the given metric, it's diagonal because there's no cross term. So g_xy is zero. 

The components g_xx and g_yy are both equal to 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the metric tensor is diagonal with both elements equal to that term. Then the determinant of g, which is the matrix of these two components, would be (32/(4−x²−y²))². But wait, the area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy. So sqrt of (32^2)/(4−x²−y²)^2) which is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

But wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, what's a pseudosphere? Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But I'm not entirely sure about the metric of a pseudosphere. Alternatively, maybe the given metric represents a pseudosphere.

Wait, another thought: the metric given looks like it's in 2D, with coordinates x and y. The denominator is 4 - x² - y². Hmm, so that's similar to the metric of a sphere but with a scaling factor. Let me think: for a sphere, the metric in polar coordinates is dr² + (r²) dθ², but this is in cartesian coordinates. Alternatively, if the denominator is (a² - r²) where r is sqrt(x² + y²), then perhaps it's a hyperbolic space.

Wait, because for hyperbolic space, the metric can take the form ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 - (r²/k²)), but I'm not exactly sure about the exact form. Alternatively, maybe it's a metric of a sphere with a certain radius. Let me think: the denominator here is (4 - x² - y²). So 4 is 2 squared. So that suggests that when x² + y² =4, the denominator becomes zero, which might make the metric singular there.

Wait, but the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. So the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. The area of a pseudosphere is, I think, related to the usual sphere area but with some modification due to negative curvature.

Wait, for a sphere with radius a, the area is 4π a². But for a pseudosphere, the area is different. Wait, I'm a bit confused. I think the pseudosphere (or tractricoid) has infinite area. Because as you approach the edge (the 'rim'), the area element becomes larger and larger, leading to an infinite total area. But wait, I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, maybe the given metric's denominator determines the limits of integration. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So for real numbers, 4 - x² - y² must be positive. So x² + y² < 4. So the domain is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. So integrating over all x and y where x² + y² <4.

Wait, but the question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So if the pseudosphere is embedded such that its radius is 2, and the metric is given, then the area would be the integral of dA over this region.

So using the metric, the area element is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy. So the area A is the integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Hmm, but integrating that might be tricky. Let me switch to polar coordinates because of the circular symmetry. So x = r cosθ, y= r sinθ. Then dx dy becomes r dr dθ. The denominator becomes 4 - r².

So the area A = ∫ (from r=0 to 2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dθ d r.

Simplify the integrand. Let me compute the integral step by step.

First, the θ integral: ∫0 to 2π dθ = 2π.

So A = 32 * 2π ∫0 to 2 [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

Wait, that would be 64 π times the integral from 0 to 2 of [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

Let me compute this integral. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → (-du/2) = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of (1/u) * (-du/2).

Which is the same as (1/2) ∫ from 0 to4 (1/u) du.

Wait, wait, let me see: the substitution is r dr = (-du/2). So r dr = (-du/2). So the integral ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr = ∫ [1/(u)] * (-du/2) = (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du.

So ∫ r/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2 is (-1/2) [ ln|u| ] from 4 to 0.

Which is (-1/2)( ln(0) - ln(4) ) → but ln(0) is negative infinity. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me see.

Wait, when r approaches 2, u approaches 0. So u goes from 4 down to 0. So when r is 0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So the integral from r=0 to 2 is:

∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) = [ (-1/2) ln |u| ] evaluated from 4 to 0.

So that's [ (-1/2) ( ln 0 - ln4 ) ].

But ln 0 is negative infinity. So this becomes [ (-1/2) ( -inf - ln4 ) ] → (-1/2)( -inf ) → positive infinity. 

Wait, so the integral diverges. So the area A would be 64π multiplied by infinity, which is infinity. 

So the area is infinite. Looking at the options, option D is +infty.

Wait, but why is the pseudosphere's area infinite? Because as you approach the edge (the rim), the circumference increases without bound, even though the 'radius' is finite. So each ring near the rim contributes an infinite amount to the total area. So the total area of the pseudosphere is indeed infinite.

So the correct answer should be D) +infty.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

and the task is to compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\). The area element in 2D is derived from the metric tensor, which is diagonal here with components \(g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\). The determinant of the metric tensor is \((g_{xx}g_{yy}) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2\), and the area element is 

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

To compute the total area, we integrate \(dA\) over the region where the metric is defined, which is \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\). Switching to polar coordinates (\(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\)), the area element becomes 

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then 

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, integrate over \(\theta\): 

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

Next, compute the radial integral:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{4}^{0} \frac{-16}{u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \(\int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u|\), so:

\[
16 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(0)\right].
\]

As \(r \to 2\), \(u \to 0\), and \(\ln(0) \to -\infty\). This causes the integral to diverge, leading to an infinite result. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

From the options provided:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this does not represent the area of the pseudosphere.
- **C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this is not a valid expression for the area.
- **D) \(+\infty\)**: Correct, as the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.
