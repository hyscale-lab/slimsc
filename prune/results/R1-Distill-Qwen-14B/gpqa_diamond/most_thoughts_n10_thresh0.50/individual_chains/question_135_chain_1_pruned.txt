Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about particle physics, specifically the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem gives me a Lagrangian interaction term. The Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, wait, I think I need to parse that correctly. Oh, right, the interaction term would typically involve the field X coupling to the fermions. So maybe it's something like λ X ψ_f ψ_f, but the exact form might not matter for figuring out the decay modes.

The boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. So I'm supposed to find which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order. Kinematically allowed means that the energy (mass) of X is sufficient for the decay products to be created. So the rest mass of X has to be at least twice the rest mass of each particle in the decay products, since each would require energy to be created from the rest frame of X.

Wait, but wait. For a decay into two particles, the threshold is when the mass of X is equal to twice the mass of the decay product. So if X is 6 GeV, then any fermion pair where each fermion has a mass less than 3 GeV would be allowed. Because 2 * m_fermion <= 6 GeV => m_fermion <= 3 GeV.

So I need to figure out which fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV. Let me list the known fermion masses. Let me recall: 

- Up quark (u): very light, around 2-5 MeV, so definitely less than 3 GeV.
- Down quark (d): similar, about 4-8 MeV.
- Strange quark (s): around 95-100 MeV, still way under 3 GeV.
- Charm quark (c): about 1.5 GeV, so less than 3 GeV.
- Bottom quark (b): around 4.5-5 GeV. Oh wait, 4.5 is more than 3, so 2m_b would be 9 GeV, which is more
