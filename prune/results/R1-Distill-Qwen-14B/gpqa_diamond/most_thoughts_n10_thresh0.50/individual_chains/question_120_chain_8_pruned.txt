Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, assuming stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So the closer a star is, the larger its parallax.

Wait, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs. So if d increases, plx decreases. But in this question, we're assuming stars are uniformly distributed. So that means the number density of stars doesn't change with distance. Or does it? Wait, no. Uniformly distributed in the sky would mean that, on the celestial sphere, the number of stars per unit area is the same everywhere. But considering that area increases with distance, the actual number of stars within a certain volume depends on distance.

Wait, maybe I should think about how many stars are at a certain distance. Suppose the number density of stars is n (number per unit volume), then the number of stars at a distance between d and d+Δd is n * 4πd² Δd. Because the volume of a shell at radius d with thickness Δd is 4πd² Δd.

But wait, the question is about parallax. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So for a small change in parallax Δplx, what's the corresponding
