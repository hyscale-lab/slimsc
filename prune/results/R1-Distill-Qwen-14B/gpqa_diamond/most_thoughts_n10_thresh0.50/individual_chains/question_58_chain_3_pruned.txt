Okay, so I've got this question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I need to figure out which theory doesn't require regularization. Let me think about each option.

Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences—those are infinities that pop up in calculations. Without regularization, these infinities can make the math blow up, which is a problem. So, theories that are "renormalizable" don't necessarily need regularization, but wait, isn't regularization a part of the renormalization process? Or is it a separate step? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I remember string theory operates at higher energies and unifies gravity with other forces. But wait, string theory isn't a quantum field theory in the same way. Oh right, because strings are different—they have a minimum length scale, which is the string length. So maybe string theory doesn't have the same kind of divergences as, say, quantum electrodynamics. Or perhaps it handles things differently without needing the same kind of regularization. I'm not sure, but I think superstring theory might not require regularization since it's a theory that is supposed to be finite, meaning it doesn't produce those infinities. Or maybe it's because it's a background-independent theory and uses different methods.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong force, dealing with quarks and gluons. I know that QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory and is asymptotically free. As for regularization, I think QCD does require regularization, especially because of things like renormalization group equations. Plus, in practical calculations like lattice QCD, they use methods like lattice regularization. So QCD would require regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a renormalizable theory. But to handle the infinities that come up in loop calculations, you need to use regularization methods like cutoff regularization, dimensional regularization, etc. So QED definitely requires regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories are different. They don't involve the same kind of infinities because there's no quantum fluctuations or loop diagrams. Classical electromagnetism deals with fields and charges, but when you have point charges, you get issues like the infinite self-energy of charges. But wait, in classical theory, do we handle that with regularization? I'm not so sure. Because in the classical case, you might not have the same need for regularization as in quantum theories. Or maybe the question is about whether the theory itself is free of the need for regularization. Hmm.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So which of these theories doesn't have the problem of needing to regularize divergences.

Let me think again. Superstring theory: I've heard that it's a background-independent theory and that it's finite. So maybe it doesn't require regularization. Because string theories avoid the usual divergences by having a fundamentally different structure. Strings have higher spin states and perhaps their perturbative expansions don't produce the same kind of divergences as point particles do. So superstring theory might not need regularization.

QED and QCD definitely require it
