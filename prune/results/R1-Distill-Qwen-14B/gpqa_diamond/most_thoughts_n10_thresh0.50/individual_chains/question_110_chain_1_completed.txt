Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and the spectrographs that can detect them. Hmm, let me read through the question carefully.

The question is asking which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. The key points given are about the apparent V magnitudes each can observe. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, meaning apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so apparent V mag <=16.

Wait, wait. Because the brighter the star (lower magnitude), the easier it is to detect. So ESPRESSO can see stars up to 17 mag, and HIRES up to 16 mag. So any star that is brighter than 17 mag (lower or equal to 17) can be detected by ESPRESSO, and brighter than 16 (<=16) for HIRES. So a star that's brighter than 17 can't be detected by HIRES if it's exactly 17. Wait no, HIRES can go up to 16 mag, so any star with V <=16 can be seen by HIRES. ESPRESSO can see V up to 17, so any star with V <=17 can be seen by ESPRESSO.

So the stars that can be seen by both must have V mag <=16 because HIRES can't see beyond 16. Because if a star is 17 mag, it's only detectable by ESPRESSO, not HIRES. So the star's apparent magnitude must be <=16 to be seen by both.

Now, I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude (m_v) for each star. Let's look at each star:

Star1: RA=15, DEC=-75, absolute V mag (Mv)=15.5, distance 10 pc. To find apparent magnitude, use the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log(d/10). So d is 10 pc, so log(1)=0. So m=15.5 +0=15.5. So m=15.5. Both ESPRESSO and HIRES can see it, because 15.5 <=16.

Star2: RA=30, DEC=55, apparent V mag=16.5, distance 5 pc. Hmm, wait, the given m_v is 16.5. So no need to calculate. So m=16.5. But HIRES can only go up to 16. So 16.5 is too faint. So Star2 can be detected only by ESPRESSO, not HIRES. So it's out.

Star3: RA=11h, DEC=48, apparent V=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. Oh, wait, there's extinction. E(B-V) is 0.6, so the total absorption in V is 3.1 * E(B-V). So extinction in V is 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. So the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + extinction? Or wait, no. The apparent magnitude is already the observed value, which is affected by extinction. Wait, no, the star's apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, but because of extinction, we have to correct it. Wait, wait, no. The given apparent magnitude is 15.5, but since it's affected by extinction (interstellar reddening), the actual intrinsic m would be lower. Wait, no. Let's think again.

Wait, the formula for extinction is A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So A_V = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86. Then the observed m is m_true + A_V. So m_true = m_observed - A_V. So if the observed m is 15.5, then the true m would be 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. Hmm, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Because I think when we observe a star, we see it with extinction, so the apparent magnitude is higher (since extinction makes it appear dimmer). So the formula is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. So if we have m_observed of 15.5, then m_intrinsic is 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. But wait, how does this affect whether the star can be detected by the spectrographs?

Wait, the question is about the apparent V magnitude as observed. Because that's what the instruments use to determine detectability. So if a star has an apparent magnitude m, which is the value they observe, then for each instrument, we need to see if that m is <=17 for ESPRESSO and <=16 for HIRES.

But wait, Star3's apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5, but that's after extinction. Wait no, the question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag". So that's already the observed m, including the extinction. So for detectability, the instruments see that m. Because instruments measure the apparent brightness. So for Star3, m=15.5, which is below both 16 and 17, so both can detect. So Star3 is visible to both.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I got it wrong. Let me read the question again. For Star3: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag". Oh, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic one, not the observed. Because E(B-V) is the color excess, which is the difference between the observed B-V and the intrinsic B-V. So the apparent magnitude would be affected by extinction. So perhaps the given 15.5 is the intrinsic m, and the observed would be higher.

Wait, but the question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag". So that's the observed, already including extinction. So if the star's observed m is 15.5, then it is bright enough for both instruments. But wait, let me think again. Let's say Star3 has m=15.5 (observed). So both instruments can detect it.

Star4: absolute V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, distance 10 pc. So first, compute the apparent magnitude without extinction. Distance modulus: d=10, so m=15.5 + 0 =15.5. Then, extinction A_V = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24. So observed m = m + A_V = 15.5 +1.24=16.74. Wait, no. Wait, no: m_observed is the apparent magnitude we see. So when you have a star at distance d, its apparent magnitude without extinction is m = M + 5 log(d/10). Then, extinction adds to it, so the observed m is m + A_V. So for Star4, M=15.5, d=10, so m =15.5. Then A_V = 3.1 * 0.4=1.24. So m_observed=15.5 +1.24=16.74. So m=16.74.

So Star4's apparent magnitude is 16.74, which is higher than 16. So HIRES can't detect it (since it can only go up to 16). But ESPRESSO can, since 16.74 is less than 17. So Star4 can be detected by ESPRESSO, but not by HIRES. So Star4 is only detected by ESPRESSO.

Star5: absolute V mag=16.5, distance 5 pc. No extinction mentioned. So compute m. m = M +5 log(d/10). d=5, so log(0.5)=~-0.301. So m=16.5 +5*(-0.301)=16.5 -1.505≈15. So m≈15. Which is brighter than 16, so both can detect it. So Star5 can be detected by both.

Wait, wait. Let me calculate that again. Distance modulus is 5 * (log10(5) -1). Log10(5)≈0.699. So 5*(0.699 -1)=5*(-0.301)= -1.505. So M=16.5, so m=16.5 + (-1.505)=15.0. So m=15.0. So that's definitely within both instruments' ranges.

Wait, but wait, Star5's absolute magnitude is 16.5. Wait, absolute magnitude is how bright the star would appear at 10 pc. But Star5 is at 5 pc, so it's brighter. So m= M +5 log(d/10). So yes, 16.5 + (5 log(0.5))=16.5 -1.505=15. So m=15. So both can detect.

So which stars can be detected by both? Let's recap:

Star1: m=15.5 → both can detect.
Star2: m=16.5 → only ESPRESSO.
Star3: m=15.5 → both can detect.
Star4: m=16.74 → only ESPRESSO.
Star5: m=15.0 → both can detect.

Wait, wait. But wait, Star3's apparent magnitude is already 15.5, which includes extinction. So it's m=15.5, so both can detect. Star5 has m=15, so both can detect. Star1 has m=15.5, both can detect.

Wait, but the options don't have Star1 and Star5. Let me look at the options.

Options:
A) Star4 and Star5
B) Star3 and Star5
C) Star2 and Star3
D) Star1 and Star4

Wait, so according to my analysis, which stars can be detected by both?

Star1: yes, because m=15.5 <=16 and <=17.
Star3: yes, m=15.5.
Star5: yes, m=15.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, Star5.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both are yes. So that's one possibility.

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → Star4's m is 16.74, which is higher than 16. So only ESPRESSO can see it. So A is incorrect.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4's m=16.74, so only ESPRESSO can see it. So D is incorrect.

So the correct pair would be Star3 and Star5 (Option B) or perhaps Star1 and Star3 or Star1 and Star5.

Wait, let's re-examine each star.

Wait, Star1: RA=15, DEC=-75, Mv=15.5, d=10 pc.

m = M + 5 log (d/10) =15.5 + 5*(log(1))=15.5. So yes, m=15.5. So both can detect, since 15.5 <=16.

So Star1 can be detected by both, so why isn't it in the options?

Wait, looking again at the options, option B is Star3 and Star5.

But the question is which can be detected by both. So:

Star1: both
Star3: both
Star5: both

So which option includes any two of these?

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected by both.

Another option: if any other pair includes Star1, but the only option that includes Star1 is D (Star1 and Star4). But Star4 can't be detected by HIRES. So D is not correct.

So from the options, the only one that includes two stars that can be detected by both is option B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but Star1 can also be detected by both. So the correct answer should include Star1, Star3, and Star5. But the options don't have any trio. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check Star3's calculation.

Star3: apparent V mag=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So that's the observed m, which is 15.5. So for both instruments, that's acceptable.

Wait, but wait, the given apparent magnitude for Star3 is 15.5. But that includes the extinction, so that's the observed m. So it's correct.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1 (15.5), Star3 (15.5), Star5 (15.0). So among the options, option B includes Star3 and Star5, which are both acceptable.

But wait, option B is Star3 and Star5. So the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but what about Star2? Star2's m is 16.5, which is only detectable by ESPRESSO. So it's out.

Star4's m is 16.74, so only ESPRESSO.

So the stars detectable by both are Star1, 3, and 5. Looking at the options, the only one that includes two of them is option B (3 and 5), but also option B includes both, which are correct.

Wait, but the options are given as:

A) Star4 and Star5
B) Star3 and Star5
C) Star2 and Star3
D) Star1 and Star4

So the correct answer is B, because both Star3 and Star5 have apparent magnitudes <=16, so both can be detected by both instruments.

Wait, but Star1 is also detected by both. So why is the option not including Star1?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me check Star1 again.

Star1: m=15.5. So both ESPRESSO (<=17) and HIRES (<=16) can detect it. So Star1 is also a candidate.

So the possible correct pairs are:

Star1 and Star3: but option D is Star1 and Star4. Star4 can't be detected by HIRES because its m is 16.74.

Star1 and Star5: but there's no option with Star1 and Star5.

So the only option that includes two stars that can be detected by both is option B: Star3 and Star5.

But wait, let me recheck Star5.

Star5: absolute mag Mv=16.5, located at 5 pc. Compute m using distance modulus: m = M +5 log (d/10).

d=5 → log(5/10)=log(0.5)= -0.3010.

So m=16.5 + 5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995 ≈15. So m=15, which is within both instruments.

So yes, Star5 is within both.

So the correct answer would include Star3 and Star5 (option B), as both have m <=16.

Wait, but Star1 also has m=15.5, which is within HIRES (<=16), so it's also a candidate. So why isn't there an option with Star1 and Star3 or Star1 and Star5?

Looking back at the options, option D is Star1 and Star4. But Star4 can't be detected by HIRES. So option D is incorrect.

The available options don't include any that have both Star1 and another. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I miscalculated Star4's apparent magnitude.

Star4: Mv=15.5, d=10 pc. So m=15.5 (distance modulus 0). E(B-V)=0.4, so A_V=3.1 *0.4=1.24. So m_observed=15.5 +1.24=16.74. So m=16.74, which is above HIRES's limit of 16. So only ESPRESSO can detect it. So Star4 is out.

So which of the options includes two stars that can be detected by both?

From the stars:

Star1: yes
Star3: yes
Star5: yes

So the possible correct options would be any pair of these three. But the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 no
B) Star3 and Star5 → both yes
C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 no
D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 no

So option B is correct, as both Star3 and Star5 satisfy the condition.

Wait, but according to the initial analysis, Star1 can also be detected by both. But since the options don't include Star1 in any pair that's correct, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with Star1. Let me recalculate.

Star1: Mv=15.5, d=10 pc.

m = M +5 log (d/10) =15.5 + 5*(log(1))=15.5.

No extinction given, so m=15.5.

So for HIRES, which can go up to 16, 15.5 is acceptable. So it's detected by both.

So why isn't any option pairing Star1 with another?

Wait, perhaps the question is about which stars are observable by both, but perhaps their declinations are within the observable ranges of the telescopes, but the question says to disregard the pointing limits and altitudes. So we don't have to consider that.

So perhaps the correct answer is that Star1 and Star3 and Star5 are detectable by both. But the options don't group all three, but the question asks which pair can be detected by both.

So the options are:

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both yes.

So the answer should be option B.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes up to 17, while HIRES can observe stars up to 16. Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤ 16 to be detectable by both instruments.

### Analysis of Each Star:

     \]  
   - Extinction in the V band:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24
     \]  
   - Observed apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m_{\text{observed}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
     \]  
   - Apparent magnitude \( m = 16.74 \), which is > 16.  
   - **Conclusion**: Detectable only by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

5. **Star5**:

   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(0.5) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0
     \]  
   - Apparent magnitude \( m = 15.0 \), which is ≤ 16.  
   - **Conclusion**: Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

### Final Answer:
The stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1 (m = 15.5)**, **Star3 (m = 15.5)**, and **Star5 (m = 15.0)**. Among the given options, the correct pair is **Star3 and Star5**.

**Answer: B**
