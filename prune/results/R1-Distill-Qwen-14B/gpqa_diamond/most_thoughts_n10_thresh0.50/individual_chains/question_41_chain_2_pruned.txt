Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light moving through a glass slab that's itself moving. Hmm, I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to an observer in the lab. Let me think about what I know.

The problem says the glass has an index of refraction n. So the speed of light in the glass when it's at rest, right? I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c divided by n. Since c is given as 1 here, the speed should be 1/n. But wait, the glass is moving. What does that do?

The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. Wait, same direction as the beam. So the light is propagating in the same direction the glass is moving. Hmm, but the glass is moving toward the observer, which is in the lab frame. So the light is moving towards the observer as well. Or wait, the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass. So if the glass is moving towards the observer, which is in the lab, then the beam is also moving towards the observer. Or am I getting this wrong?

Wait, the beam is propagating through the glass, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. Oh, so the beam is going, say, to the right, and the glass itself is moving to the right. But the glass is moving toward the observer. That might mean the observer is on the left, and the glass is moving right towards them. Hmm, maybe that's complicating things.

I think I should approach this using the concept of relative velocity. So the speed of light in the glass is 1/n in the glass's rest frame. Now, when the glass is moving relative to the lab, how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, but in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. Oh right, because when objects move at significant fractions of the speed of light, you have to use the velocity addition formula.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about the speed of light in the glass. So the light's speed in the glass is 1/n in the glass's frame. But the glass itself is moving. So how do we find the speed in the lab frame?

Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at 1/n towards the direction of motion. So perhaps I should apply the Lorentz velocity transformation.

The velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/(
