Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll give it a shot.

So, the question states that stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, what does that mean? Uniformly distributed probably means that the number density of stars is the same throughout space. So, the same number of stars per unit volume everywhere. Got it.

Now, parallax. Oh right, parallax (plx) is a measure of distance. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. The formula I remember is distance (in parsecs) equals 1 divided by parallax (in arcseconds). So, plx = 1/distance. So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Let me think about this. So, we're looking at how the count of stars changes when we consider a small range of parallax values.

If stars are uniformly distributed, their number density (n) is constant. So, n = number of stars per unit volume.

But we need to find how the number of stars in a certain parallax range (say, between plx and plx + dplx) depends on plx.

Hmm, let's think about the volume. Parallax relates to distance. So, plx = 1/d. So, d = 1/plx. But wait, distance in terms of parallax... because as parallax increases, distance decreases.

Wait, maybe I should model this. The number of stars in a spherical shell between distance d and d + dd would be n multiplied by the volume of the shell. The volume of a spherical shell is 4πd² dd. So, number of stars in shell is N = n * 4π d² dd.

But we need to express this in terms of parallax. Since plx p = 1/d, d = 1/p. So, let's substitute d = 1/p into the equation.

So, N = n * 4π (1/p)^2 * (dd). But wait, dd is the change in distance. How does dd relate to the change in parallax, dplx?

Because plx p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. Taking the derivative, dp/d = -1/(d²). So, dp = -d² dd. Hmm, but we can take absolute values here because we're dealing with magnitudes. So, d (parallax) is delta p = |dp| = (1/(d^2)) * dd. But d = 1/p, so delta p = p² * dd. Wait, wait.

Wait, let me redo this. Let's express dd in terms of dplx. So, d = 1/p. So, dd = delta d. Delta p is the change in parallax, which is delta p = delta (1/d) = - (1/d²) delta d. So, delta p = - (1/(d²)) dd. Taking absolute values, delta p = (1/(d²)) * dd. So,
