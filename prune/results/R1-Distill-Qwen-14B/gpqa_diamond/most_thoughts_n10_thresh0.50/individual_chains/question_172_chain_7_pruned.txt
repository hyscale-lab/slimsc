Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, when a star is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann equation. Oh right, the Boltzmann distribution relates the populations of different energy states to the temperature.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So if I let n1 be the number of excited atoms in star_1 and n2 in star_2, then n1 = 2 n2. But wait, wait. Actually, the ratio is given as twice as excited. So n1/n2 = 2.

The energy difference between the levels is given as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. I think that's the energy difference between the two levels we're considering. So the Boltzmann equation is probably what we'll use here.

The Boltzmann factor says that the ratio of populations is proportional to the exponential of -(ΔE)/(k T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

So the ratio n1/n2 should equal the ratio of their Boltzmann factors. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The general form is n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where g is the statistical weight. But in this case, perhaps the statistical weights are the same for both stars, so maybe they cancel out. Or maybe the problem is considering the same transition in both stars, so their g factors are the same.

But the problem doesn't mention anything about statistical weights, so I'll assume they are the same for both stars, which means their ratio would be 1. So the equation simplifies to n1/n2 = exp( - (ΔE)/(k T1) ) / exp( - (ΔE)/(k T2) ) )

Wait, no, let me get that right. For each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (assuming that's what's meant) is n_upper/n_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T)). But in this case, the problem states that the ratio of the excited states between the two stars is 2:1. So perhaps for each star, the ratio of n_upper to n_lower is determined by their respective temperatures.

Wait, maybe I should think about each star separately. For star_1, the ratio of n1_upper to n1_lower is exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star_2, it's exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). So the ratio between the two stars' upper levels is (n1_upper / n1_lower) / (n2_upper / n2_lower) ) = (exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) / (exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) )) ) = exp(ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ) )

But the problem says that n1_upper is twice n2_upper. Wait, no, the problem says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So if n_upper is the number in the excited state
