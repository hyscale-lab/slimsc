Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about an acid-catalyzed reaction. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, and the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to figure out what reagent A and catalyst B are used here.

Wait, pyrrolidine is a five-membered amine ring, right? 3-methylpyrrolidine would have a methyl group on the third carbon. The product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached. Cyclohexylidene means a cyclohexane ring with a double bond, I think. So, the product looks like the pyrrolidine ring with a substituent that's a cyclohexene methyl group.

So, what reaction forms such a product? I remember that acid-catalyzed reactions can lead to various things like alkylation, acylation, or maybe some kind of ring expansion. Wait, maybe it's an example of a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or something else. But wait, pyrrolidine is a secondary amine, and in such reactions, maybe it's acting as a nucleophile.

Alternatively, the product structure makes me think of a ring-opening or ring-forming process. Or perhaps this is a case of ring expansion via some kind of conjugate addition. Oh wait, the product is a bicyclic compound, I think. Because the substituent is a cyclohex
