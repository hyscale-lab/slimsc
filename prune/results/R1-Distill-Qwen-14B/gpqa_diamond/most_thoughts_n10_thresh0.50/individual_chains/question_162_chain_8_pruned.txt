Okay, so I have this question about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me think this through. 

The metric given is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) multiplied by (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like it's in two dimensions because it's just dx and dy. So the metric is for a 2-dimensional space? Or maybe it's embedded in higher dimensions? Not sure yet.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But how does that relate to the metric given?

Wait, I think the metric might be representing something in hyperbolic geometry. Because the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), which looks similar to the form of metrics for hyperbolic space. Let me recall: the standard metric for hyperbolic space in Poincaré coordinates is something like ds² = (2a)^2/(z^2) (dx² + dy²). But wait, that's for the Poincaré disk model, right? Where z is the radial coordinate in the model.

Wait, our given metric has the denominator as (4 - x² - y²), which is 4 - r² where r² = x² + y². So in the denominator, it's (4 - r²). The numerator is 32, so the metric can be rewritten as 32/(
