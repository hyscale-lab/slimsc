Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it and understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star similar in radius to the Sun. Half of its surface (one hemisphere) is covered with dark spots. These spots have a filling factor of 20%, which I think refers to the area they cover on that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K, so their temperature is 5000 K. When this star rotates, the spots come into and out of view from our perspective, causing changes in the star's brightness. This is similar to how an exoplanet transiting in front of the star would block some light and cause a dip in brightness.

The problem is asking, if the star wasn't covered by spots, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet needed to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve. So, we're comparing the brightness variation caused by the spots to that caused by an exoplanet.

Hmm, I remember that the change in brightness (the amplitude of the light curve) depends on the size of the blocking object relative to the star. For a planet transit, the dip is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2, assuming the planet is much smaller than the star. But wait, in this case, the star's brightness is varying because of the spots, and it's not a single transit but a more continuous effect as the spots rotate into and out of view.

So, the star's brightness variation due to the spots: when a spot is facing us, it's cooler and so contributes less light, causing a dip. Since it's on one hemisphere, as the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view again. But how does this affect the overall brightness variation?

Wait, maybe I should model this as a change in the star's apparent brightness over time. The star's total luminosity is the sum of the contributions from all areas on its surface. When spots are on the visible hemisphere, they contribute less. The variation in brightness will depend on the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

The star's total luminosity when unspotted would be L = 4πR^2 σ T_eff^4. But when spots are present, part of the surface is at a lower temperature. Let me think about this.

The filling factor is 20% on one hemisphere, which is half the star's surface. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2πR^2) )? Wait, wait. Because each hemisphere is 2πR². So one hemisphere is 2πR². The filling factor is 20%, so the area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) ) = 0.4 π R².

Each spot has a lower temperature. The flux from a spot F_spot is σ T_spot^4. The surrounding area (non-spot) on the hemisphere has flux σ T_star^4.

So the total flux when the star is viewed so that the hemisphere with spots is facing us is:

Flux = (Area_non_spot * F_non_spot) + (
