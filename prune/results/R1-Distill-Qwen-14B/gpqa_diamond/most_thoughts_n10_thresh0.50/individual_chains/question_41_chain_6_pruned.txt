Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and moving glass. Hmm, let me think. The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. They're asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember from my studies that when light moves through a medium, its speed changes based on the medium's refractive index. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium is c divided by n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, the glass is moving here. Does the movement of the glass affect the speed of light within it from the lab frame?

I'm a bit confused. So the glass is moving towards the observer. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving, but inside the glass, the light is moving at c/n, right? But how does the glass's velocity v factor into this?

Wait, maybe I should think about relative velocity. If the medium itself (the glass) is moving, does that add to the speed of the light as observed in the lab? Or is it more about the frame of reference?

Wait, no. The speed of light in a medium is always c/n regardless of the medium's motion. Because the refractive index already accounts for the medium's properties. But wait, isn't that only when the medium is stationary relative to the observer? Because if the medium is moving, does that affect the observed speed of light through it?

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let
