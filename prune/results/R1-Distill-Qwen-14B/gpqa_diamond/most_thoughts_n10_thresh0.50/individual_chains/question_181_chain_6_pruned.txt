Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun and what happens if the pp-III branch stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the question is about the ratio of neutrino flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The scenario is that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. All other reactions are the same. I need to find the flux ratio band1 over band2.

Wait, pp-III branch... Right, the proton-proton chain in the Sun's core. I remember that the pp chain has several branches. The main pp-I branch is the dominant one, where four protons fuse into a helium-4 nucleus. Then there are other branches like pp-II and pp-III which involve higher energy reactions, perhaps producing different neutrino energies.

Oh wait, the pp-III branch is probably the part where the protons undergo a reaction that emits a positron and a neutrino. Because in the regular pp-I, the first step is two protons fusing to deuterium, then capturing another proton to form helium-3, and so on. But the pp-III branch might involve a different path that produces high-energy neutrinos.

Wait, neutrinos in the Sun are produced mainly via the proton-proton chain, and each of these branches contributes to the overall neutrino flux.
