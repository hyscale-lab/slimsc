Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

We've got 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that's moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when measuring the position, none of the particles were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So, the particles are only between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, the question is asking for the value of 'a'. So, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must satisfy certain conditions, like normalization. The total probability of finding the particle somewhere must equal 1. So, I think I need to normalize this wave function.

The wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but wait, wave functions can have real and imaginary parts, right? And the probability is given by the square of the absolute value of the wave function.

So, the probability density is |ψ(x)|². Let me write that out. |ψ|² = [ (a / sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2 ] because the imaginary part is -0.5i, so when you take the square, it's (0.5)^2. Wait, the imaginary unit i squared is -1, but when calculating |ψ|², it's ψ times ψ*, the complex conjugate. So, ψ* would be (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. Multiplying ψ and ψ*, the cross terms would be (a/sqrt(1+x))*0.5i plus 0.5i*(a/sqrt(1+x)), but that's imaginary, so when you add the real and imaginary parts, the real part would be (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So, the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. Because (0.5)^2 is 0.25.

Now, since the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3, the wave function is zero outside of this interval. Wait, no. The wave function given is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So, that suggests that the wave function is defined only between x=1 and x=3. Or maybe it's non-zero only there? Because in regions where x is less than 1 or greater than 3, the wave function is zero. So, when we integrate the probability density, we do it from x=1 to x=3.

So, to normalize, the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 must equal 1.

So, let's write that integral:

∫_{1}^{3} [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me break this integral into two parts:

Integral1 = ∫ (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to3.
Integral2 = ∫ 0.25 dx from 1 to3.

Compute Integral1 first. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x), so:

Integral1 = a² [ ln(1+x) ] from 1 to3.
Which is a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(2).

Wait, because ln(4) is 2 ln(2), and ln(2) is ln(2), so 2 ln(2) - ln(2) is ln(2).

So, Integral1 = a² * ln(2).

Integral2 is 0.25 times (3-1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

So, total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

Wait, no, wait. The integral is the sum of the two integrals, which must equal 1.

So, a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides: a² ln(2)=0.5.

So, a squared equals 0.5 / ln(2).

Then, a is sqrt(0.5 / ln(2)).

Let me compute that numerically. First, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Wait, 0.5 divided by 0.6931 is about 0.7213. So, the square root of that is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Let me compute 0.5 / ln(2). Since ln(2) is about 0.69314718056.

0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.721347.

The square root of that is sqrt(0.721347) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. So, a is about 0.85, so option B is correct.

Wait, but wait. Did I set up the normalization correctly? Because I'm integrating the square of the absolute value, which includes both terms. So, the setup seems correct.

Another thing to think about: do the boundaries affect the normalization? Like, the wave function is zero outside 1 and 3, so the integral is correct from 1 to3.

So, I think the answer is B) 0.85.


To determine the value of \( a \), we must normalize the given wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \). The normalization condition requires that the total probability of finding the particle in the allowed region (between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \)) equals 1. The probability density is given by \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), which is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} \right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left( \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \right) dx = 1.
\]

This can be split into two separate integrals:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 1.
\]

### First Integral:
\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx.
\]

The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \), so:

\[
a^2 \left[ \ln(1+x) \right]_{1}^{3} = a^2 \left[ \ln(4) - \ln(2) \right] = a^2 \ln(2).
\]

### Second Integral:
\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
\]

### Combining Results:
Adding the two integrals:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \implies \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \implies \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
