Okay, so I need to find the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed determined by its amplitude and the spring constant. But since this is relativistic, I think special relativity comes into play here.

Wait, the question mentions that the oscillator obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. So it's a relativistic version of the simple harmonic oscillator. I remember that in relativity, the equations of motion change because of the gamma factor, which depends on velocity.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed v_max is given by sqrt(kA²/m). But because we're dealing with relativity here, I think the maximum speed can't reach the speed of light, so there must be some correction factor.

Let's think about energy. The total energy in a relativistic oscillator should include both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. At maximum displacement A, the oscillator is at rest (velocity zero), so all its energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.

In the relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², just like in the classical case. But the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore because of relativistic effects. The total energy E is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, so at x=0, the kinetic energy K is equal to the total energy minus the rest energy. Wait, no. The potential energy is (1/2)kx², so at x=0, the potential is zero. So the total energy is all kinetic energy. So E = K + mc²? Or wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, in relativity, the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So E = gamma mc². But the potential energy in the oscillator is (1/2)kx². So when the oscillator is at x = A, all the energy is potential. So at x=A, E = (1/2)kA² + mc²? Or is it just (1/2)kA²?

Hmm, maybe no. Because in the non-relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. So the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA². So at the equilibrium point, all that energy is kinetic.

But in relativity, the total energy E should be (1/2)kA² plus the rest energy mc²? Or is the rest energy separate?

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the oscillator's potential energy as (1/2)kA². So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, x=A, the potential is at its maximum, and the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy E is (1/2)kA². But that's the same as the non-relativistic case. Wait, but then when it moves to x=0, the kinetic energy would be (gamma - 1) mc²? Or is that not correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the total mechanical energy in the relativistic case is (1/2)kA² + rest energy
