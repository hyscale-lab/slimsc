Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about electric potential energy in an isolated system of charges. 

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. That's 3.204 x 10^-19 C per particle.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The thirteenth charge is fixed at P. So, point P is the location of the 13th charge, and the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. 

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system. Oh right, in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. But wait, because like charges repel each other, bringing them closer would require work, so the potential energy should be positive if the system is repelling.

Wait, but the problem says "minimum energy." Hmm. Oh, wait, maybe I'm thinking about it wrong. Because in an isolated system, especially with like charges, the potential energy is positive and higher when the charges are closer. So the minimum energy would be the lowest possible, but I think in this setup, the charges are fixed. So maybe the potential energy is fixed, and the question is just asking for the calculation.

So, we're to find the potential energy of the system. The system comprises 13 charges. The charge at P is fixed, so each of the 12 charges at 2m away contributes to the potential energy.

Wait, but wait a second. Each charge at 2m is interacting with the charge at P. But considering all possible interactions, how do we calculate the total potential energy?

Hmm, I think the formula for the electric potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 q2) / r. So for each of the 12 charges at 2m from P, the interaction is between 2e and 2e, with r = 2m. 

Wait, but wait, we have 12 charges each at 2m from P. So each of them interacts with the
