Okay, so I've got this question about a rhombohedral crystal, and I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see. The question is asking about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Alright, what do I remember about interplanar distances? Oh right, they're calculated using the formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. For a cubic system, it's something like d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but wait, this isn't a cubic crystal. It's a rhombohedral one. Oh right, in a rhombohedral structure, the lattice isn't cubic, so the formula must be a bit different.

I think the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ), but wait, no, wait. I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, I remember that in a rhombohedral system, the lattice has a basis that's more complex, so the formula incorporates the angles between the lattice vectors.

Wait, the formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral crystal is given by d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ), where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. But wait, in a rhombohedral system, all the angles α, β, γ are equal, right? So in this case, all three angles are 30 degrees. So θ would be 30 degrees.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the formula I have is correct. Let me think about where this comes from. Oh, right, the interplanar distance formula for a general hexagonal or rhombohedral system uses the metric tensor. The general formula for d is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + 2(hk(1 - cos α) + hl(1 - cos β) + kl(1 - cos γ))/a². Wait, but in this case, since all angles are equal, it's α=β=γ=30°. So perhaps the formula simplifies.

Alternatively, maybe another approach. The interplanar distance formula for a rhomboh
