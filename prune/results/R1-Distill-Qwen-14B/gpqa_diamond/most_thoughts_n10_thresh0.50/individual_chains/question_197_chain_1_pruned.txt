Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrohalogenation of alkenes. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, when you have an alkene and you treat it with HI and red phosphorus, it's a way to add HI in a way that the phosphorus helps the reaction. I think that's called the oxymercuration or something else? Or wait, maybe that's for alkenes. Alternatively, I think red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrohalogenation of alkenes, maybe in a way that adds HI across the double bond. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics. Let me think again. Oh, right, when you have an alkene and you add HI with red phosphorus, it's a way to do an acid-catalyzed addition of HI. Oh wait, red phosphorus is a catalyst in some reactions, like maybe the addition of HI to alkenes. Or perhaps it's more about the mechanismâ€”like, it's a hydroxy iodide formation.

But wait, I might be mixing things up. Let's get back to the problem. So, the task is to figure out what the final product is when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. To do that, I need
