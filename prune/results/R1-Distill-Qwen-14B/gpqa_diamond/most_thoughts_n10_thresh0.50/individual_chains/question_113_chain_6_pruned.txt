Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's see what the question says. Hmm, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using its FTIR, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometry data. The options are all different chemical formulas, so I need to piece together the clues from the spectroscopic data.

First, let's break down each piece of information. Starting with the FTIR spectrum. I remember that FTIR is useful for identifying functional groups based on their characteristic absorption peaks. The question mentions a very broad absorption around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. The broadness is often because the molecule has hydrogen bonding, which happens in alcohols, phenols, or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but a broad peak could also be from an -OH group in something like an ester or ether? No, wait, ethers don't have O-H bonds. So, more likely, it's an alcohol or a phenol or a carboxylic acid.

But then, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Hmmm. 1700 is a strong peak, which usually corresponds to carbonyl groups (C=O). But wait, the 1650 peak could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring. Let me think. Oh, wait, 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents. Or perhaps it's a C=C (olefinic) stretch. Wait, C=C typically has absorption around 1600-1680 cm-1. But 1650 is on the higher end. Maybe an aromatic ring's C=C would be around there. Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester or ketone.

Wait, the 1700 peak is a strong peak. So that's a carbonyl, which could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. But the presence of a broad peak at 3000 suggests an -OH group. So perhaps it's an ester with an alcohol
