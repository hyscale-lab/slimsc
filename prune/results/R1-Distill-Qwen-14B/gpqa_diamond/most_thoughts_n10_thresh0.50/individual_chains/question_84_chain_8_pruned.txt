Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting, and the question is about the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, specifically involving the matrix exponential function approximated by a fractional approximation.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. So, the problem is about parallel algorithms for solving PDEs, right? Heat equations are usually solved with methods like finite differences, and when you go higher-dimensional, things get more complex. The mention of matrix exponential function makes me think about how the solution evolves over time in these equations, maybe using techniques like exponential time differencing.

Wait, but the question is about converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one. So the key factor here must relate to how the algorithm can be split into parts that can run simultaneously.

Matrix exponentials are involved in the time evolution of the solution, especially in methods like the exponential time differencing. But when you approximate this with a fractional method, perhaps like the Padé approximation or something similar, you might be able to split the problem into separate terms that can be computed in parallel.

Looking at the options:

A) Stability analysis: That's important for ensuring the numerical method doesn't blow up, but I'm not sure how it directly relates to making the algorithm parallel. Stability is more about the method being reliable, not necessarily about parallelism.

B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions: Nonlocal conditions might complicate the setup, but again, how would that directly cause a sequential to parallel conversion? Maybe in certain boundary conditions, the problem can be split, but I'm not certain.

C) Complex roots of fractional approximation: Fractional approximations, like those used in Padé methods, can have poles and zeros. If the approximation has complex roots, maybe this allows for a decomposition into terms that can be handled in parallel, since each term might not interfere with others. Or perhaps the structure of the approximation, with its roots, allows for a way to split the computation.

D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation: Partial fractions involve breaking down a complex function into simpler fractions. If the approximation can be decomposed this way, then each part could potentially be computed in parallel, as they don't interfere with each other. So the ability to write the function as a sum of simpler terms (like partial fractions) would enable parallel computation.

Wait, so the question is about the key factor when using a fractional approximation. So, if the approximation leads to a situation where the matrix exponential can be split into multiple terms that are easier to compute, perhaps each term can be processed in parallel.

Now, partial fraction decomposition is a technique that breaks down a rational function into a sum of simpler fractions. If the fractional approximation of the matrix exponential can be expressed as a sum of such terms, each of which can be computed independently, then the algorithm can be parallelized.

Alternatively, complex roots in the fractional approximation might lead to terms that have oscillatory behavior, which could be handled in parallel if they don't require sequential computation.

Hmm, but the options are between C and D. Let's think again. The question is about the key factor in converting the algorithm into parallel. So the process
