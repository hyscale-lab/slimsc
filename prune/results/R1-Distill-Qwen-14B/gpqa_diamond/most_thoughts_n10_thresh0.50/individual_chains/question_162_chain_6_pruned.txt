Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the area of a pseudosphere with a given metric. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's see what I can remember.

The question gives the metric ds² as (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a 2-dimensional metric since it's in terms of dx and dy. But wait, pseudosphere usually refers to a surface in 3D, but maybe here it's a 2D surface embedded in some way. Or perhaps it's a 2D spacetime? Well, regardless, the area calculation should proceed similarly.

First, I need to find the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh wait, the radius is given as 2, so maybe that's a clue. But the metric given doesn't directly look like the standard pseudosphere metric. Let me think about what a pseudosphere is. A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. In 2D, the metric of a pseudosphere can be written in isothermal coordinates. Oh right, the metric usually looks like ds² = λ² (dx² + dy²), where λ is some function related to the radius and the curvature.

Wait, but the given metric here is ds² = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). So the function here is 32 divided by (4 - x² - y²). Let me see: the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²). So perhaps this is similar to the metric of a hyperbolic space, which is a pseudosphere.

I remember that the metric for hyperbolic space in isothermal coordinates is often written as ds² = (4a²/(a² + r²)) (dx² + dy²), where a is related to the curvature. Alternatively, maybe it's something like ds² = (2a/(sqrt(a² + r²)))^2 (dx² + dy²), but I might be mixing up the exact form.

Wait, another approach: the area of a surface can be found by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor over the coordinates. Since the metric is diagonal here, it's easier. The metric tensor has components (g_xx, g_yy, 0, 0) because it's only dx² + dy² multiplied by a function. So the determinant is just g_xx * g_yy. But since
