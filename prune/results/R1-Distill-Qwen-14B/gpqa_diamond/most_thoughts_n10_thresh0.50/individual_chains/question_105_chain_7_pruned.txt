Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it again and see what it's about.

Alright, so the question is about a star similar to the Sun. It says the star has a radius equal to the Sun, so Rstar is same as R_sun. The star's effective temperature, Teff, is 6000K. Now, one hemisphere is covered with dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I remember means the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere. Oh wait, no, filling factor is the area covered by spots, so it's 20% of the hemisphere's surface. But wait, the hemisphere is half the star, so the total area covered by spots is 20% of that. Hmm.

The spots have a temperature difference of 1000K. Since the star's Teff is 6000K, the spots are either 5000K or 7000K. Wait, but dark spots are cooler, right? Because sunspots are cooler. So the spots would be 5000K. So the spots are 1000K cooler than the surrounding photosphere.

Then, the question says that when we observe this star, because of its rotation, the brightness variations due to the spots (as the spots rotate into and out of view) can mimic the presence of an exoplanet. The task is to find out what the radius of a hypothetical planet would need to be so that its
