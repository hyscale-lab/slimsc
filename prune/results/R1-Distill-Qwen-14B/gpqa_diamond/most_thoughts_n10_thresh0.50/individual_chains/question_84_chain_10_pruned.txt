Okay, so I've got this question about solving higher dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is about converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one. The key factor here, according to the options, is something related to the matrix exponential function being approximated by a fractional approximation. 

Wait, matrix exponential. Right, when solving systems of equations, especially in time-dependent PDEs like heat equations, you often end up with a system that can be written in terms of a matrix exponential. In sequential methods, you might compute this using something like a Taylor series expansion or another method that's inherently sequential.

But when you want to parallelize it, you need a way to break down the computation so different parts can be done concurrently. So how do you do that with matrix exponentials?

I remember something about parallel splitting methods. Oh right, there's a technique where you split the matrix into parts that can be exponentiated separately and then combined. Like, maybe using something called the Kronecker product or the Summation-by-Parts (SBP) method, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the idea might involve using a parallelizable approximation of the exponential, like the matrix exponential is approximated using a sum of terms that can be computed in parallel.

Wait, the question mentions fractional approximation. I think fractional approximation methods are used to approximate the matrix exponential in a way that allows for parallel computation. For example, rational approximations or Pad√© approximants, which can be decom
