Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the density matrix of a qubit. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully about how to approach it.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. So this must be a mixed state because it's a statistical mixture of |0> and |1>.

Wait, I think when a density matrix is a diagonal matrix with equal probabilities on the diagonal, it might be a maximally mixed state. Like, for a qubit, the maximally mixed state is I/2, where I is the identity matrix. So ρ here is I/2 because |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], so when multiplied by 1/2, it's [[1/2,0],[0,1/2]]. Yeah, that's the maximally mixed state.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what that refers to. Oh wait, I remember that qubit states can be represented on the Bloch sphere. But wait, the Bloch sphere is for pure states. Since ρ is a density matrix, perhaps it's in the space of density matrices, which for a qubit is a 3-dimensional space. Oh right, because a 2x2 density matrix has four elements, but due to trace 1 and Hermiticity, it's three-dimensional.

The density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a 3-dimensional vector. So for a maximally mixed state, what is r?

Well, for the maximally mixed state, the density matrix is I/2. So substituting into the equation: I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2. If I multiply both sides by 2, I get I = I + r·σ. Subtracting I from both sides, 0 = r·σ. Since the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, the dot product r·σ must be zero. The only way that's possible is if r is zero vector. Because any non-zero component would make a non-zero contribution.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). But wait, the options are about the position in qubits space. Oh, maybe the question is referring to the coordinates on the Bloch sphere. But wait, the Bloch sphere represents pure states, and the maximally mixed state is in the center of the Bloch sphere, which is at r=(0,0,0).

Looking back at the options:

Option C is (0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, but just to make sure I'm not mixing up anything. The density matrix for a pure state |ψ> is |ψ><ψ|. For ρ here, it's (
