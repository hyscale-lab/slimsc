Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, G releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. 

There's also something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with 2 oxygen atoms. Plus, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog.

Hmm, I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29. So the sum of the lightest and heaviest element's atomic masses in X.

Let me break this down. Let's start by trying to identify what X, Y, W, G, and B might be.

Substance X reacts with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W. Since W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons, let's think about possible gases. Water (H2O) has H and O. H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, but O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. Wait, but H2O as a molecule: each H has 1 proton and 1 neutron? No, regular H is just 1 proton, 0 neutrons. Wait, but maybe it's a different gas.

Wait, another possibility is that the gas is something like CO2? No, wait. Let's calculate. For a molecule where the number of neutrons equals protons. Let's think of each atom in the molecule.

Wait, maybe the gas is H2. Each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. So H2 would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons. That's not equal. What about O2? Each O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. Wait, but each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So for O2, 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So yes, the molecule has equal protons and neutrons. That fits.
