Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The IR peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually corresponds to O-H or N-H stretches. But looking at the options, they don't have any amines. So probably it's an O-H stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong absorbance, which I know is typical for a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound likely has an aromatic ring.

Now, let me check the 1H NMR data to get more clues. The peaks are at 10.5 ppm (a broad singlet, 1H), which is a strong indication of an aldehyde proton. Wait, no, actually, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, but they are also deshielded and appear as singlets. Wait, but in the options, option C is a benzoic acid, which would have a carboxylic acid proton around 10-12 ppm. But the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which sometimes is seen in aldehydes or maybe in enol tautomers, but more likely, it could be the -COOH proton. Wait, but a carboxylic acid proton is usually a broad peak, but I thought maybe it's an aldehyde. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, looking again: the NMR shows 10.5 ppm, which is very deshielded. For a carboxylic acid, the -COOH proton is usually around 10-12 ppm, but it's a broad peak because of hydrogen bonding. So that could fit. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is around 9-10, but a bit upfield. But in this case, 10.5 seems higher for an aldehyde. So perhaps it
