Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativity yet. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds. Their masses are given as 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right. So first, I think I need to find the relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame of reference. Because each is moving at a high speed, I can't just subtract the velocities in the classical way. Relativity comes into play here.

Wait, how do you calculate relative velocity in special relativity? Oh right, the formula is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/c²). Or wait, is it (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)) when both are moving in the same direction? Let me think: if both are moving in the same direction, like both positive x, then yes, that's the way.

So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. From A's frame, what's B's speed? Or maybe the other way around. Wait, the question says the relative speed. Oh, I think it's the speed of one as seen from the other. So which one is which?

Alternatively, maybe the relative speed is given as the speed of the slower one as observed from the faster one. Or perhaps they just want the relative speed regardless of direction. Hmm, but in any case, let's pick one. Let's say we calculate the speed of B as seen from A's frame. Or vice versa, but I think the formula applies either way, just the sign changes.

Wait, wait, let's get the formula right. The relative velocity formula is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/c²), where v is the velocity of the first frame relative to the second, and u is the velocity of the object in the second frame. Or is it the other way around? I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for an example. Ok, if frame S' is moving at speed u relative to S (the rest frame), then
