Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution when they're part of a complex with EDTA. 

Wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, and I think the formula would be something like CaEDTA^2- because EDTA usually has a charge of 4- when it's deprotonated enough to bind metals. So the complex would have a 2- charge.

The K for the complex is given as 5x10^10. Oh, right, K is the formation constant, which tells us how stable the complex is. A high K like this means the complex is very stable, so the metal ions are tightly bound.

The question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. So, even though the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex, some of the calcium ions might dissociate. But wait, with such a high K, the dissociation should be really minimal, right? Because the complex is very stable, so it doesn't break down much.

I think the formation constant (K) is given by the equation K = [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ). But in this case, since the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, and assuming that the solution is at stoichiometric ratio, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

Wait, but EDTA is usually in solution in different protonated forms. Oh, but the problem states that the pH is ideal, so I guess we don't have to worry about the different species of EDTA. I think for this problem, we can assume that all the EDTA is in the form that can bind calcium, which is EDTA^4-.

So, the problem is to find [Ca²+]. Let's write the equation:

K = [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

But wait
