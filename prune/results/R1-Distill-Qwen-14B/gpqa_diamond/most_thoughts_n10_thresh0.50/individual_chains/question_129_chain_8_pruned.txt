Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through the question carefully and try to break it down step by step.

The problem is about a series of reactions leading to compound E. There are several steps, and I also have some hints from the IR spectra and another reaction involving a phosphorous ylide. Let me try to map this out.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

The hints are:
a) Compound A reacts with a phosphorous ylide (probably a Wittig reagent) to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) IR of A has a strong peak at ~1750 cm^-1, which suggests a carbonyl group. E has a peak at ~1715 cm^-1, which is also a carbonyl but maybe a ketone.

Options are four different cyclic ketones. So E is a ketone.

Let me think about each step.

Starting from A:

Step 1: A + HCN → B. HCN is typically a nucleophile. If A is a carbonyl, like a ketone or aldehyde, HCN would add to it. So maybe A is a ketone, and B is a cyanohydrin (a compound with an -OH and -CN group adjacent). But wait, HCN can also react via enolate formation, but I think in ketones, it typically adds to the carbonyl.

Wait, but depending on the conditions, it could also form a cyanohydrin. But ketones reacting with HCN usually form that.

So, if A is a cyclic ketone, adding HCN would give a secondary alcohol and a cyanide group in the adjacent position. So, B would be a cyclo compound with an -OH and -CN next to each other.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. H2 with Pd usually is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So in B, which has a CN group, hydrogenation of the nitrile would probably give an amine. Wait, no—wait, H2 and Pd are for hydrogenation of triple bonds or other unsaturated bonds. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile group (CN) would be hydrogenated to an amine (NH2) or maybe to an aldehyde?

Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Nitriles can be hydrogenated in different ways. For example, using H2 and a catalyst like Raney Ni or Pt, nitriles can be hydrogenated to amines. Alternatively, under certain conditions, maybe to aldehydes, but that's more with other catalysts. Wait, under Pd, maybe more likely to hydrogenate triple bonds to single bonds. Oh, but wait, H2 and Pd is usually for hydrogenation of triple bonds, like alkynes to alkanes. So in B, if there's a double bond, perhaps from the initial addition of HCN.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the structure of B. If A is a cyclic ketone, say cyclopentanone, then reacting with HCN would form a cyanohydrin. So the structure would have an -OH and -CN on adjacent carbons, but in a cyclic structure. So B would be a cyclopentane with an -OH and -CN group next to each other.

Wait, but then when B is hydrogenated with H2 and Pd, maybe the double bond would be hydrogenated. Wait, but in the cyanohydrin, is there a double bond? No, the cyanohydrin adds to the carbonyl, so the carbonyl becomes a single bond with an -O- and -CN group
