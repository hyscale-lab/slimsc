Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators. Hmm, okay, let's break it down.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A_y, which is given as A_y = c·S. They mention that c is h/(4π), and S is a specific 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). 

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, spin operators like S often relate to Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices! The S matrices are proportional to them. Let me think: The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Each is a 2x2 matrix. 

So the given S matrix looks like one of the Pauli matrices. Let me check: σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Oh yes, that's exactly the S matrix here. So S must be equal to σ_y. 

But wait, wait. The Pauli matrices usually have a factor of i in some places. Let me confirm: σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Yep, that's correct. So S is σ_y. 

Now, the operator A_y is c multiplied by S. So A_y = c * σ_y. And c is h/(4π). So substituting, A_y = (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

Eigenvalues of A_y: I know that the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix multiplied by a constant will just be that constant multiplied by the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrix. But wait, wait, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues are real. For σ_y, the eigenvalues are ±1. So when we multiply σ_y by c, the eigenvalues become ±c.

So the eigenvalues of A_y should be ±(h/(4π)). Hmmm, but wait, wait. Let me make sure. Because sometimes the spin matrices are written with a factor of ħ/2 in front. Oh right! Because the spin operator S is (ħ/2) σ for each component. So for example, S_y = (ħ/
