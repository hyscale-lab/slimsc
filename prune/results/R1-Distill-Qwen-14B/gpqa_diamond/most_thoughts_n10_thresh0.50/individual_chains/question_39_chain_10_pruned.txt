Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of wave functions and probability distributions. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the setup: There are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in the same conditions. The particles move along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, and when they measure the position of the particles, none are found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So they only exist between x=1 and x=3. 

The question is asking for the value of 'a'. The options are A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

Hmm, right. I remember that the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So the probability of finding the particle between x and x+dx is |ψ(x)|² dx. And the total probability over all space should be 1. But in this case, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So the integral of |ψ(x)|² from 1 to 3 should equal 1.

Wait, but in the given wave function, there's an 'i' involved. Oh wait, the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, so ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the complex conjugate of ψ would be (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So when I multiply ψ by its conjugate, I get the modulus squared.

Calculating |ψ|²: [(a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i] * [(a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i] = (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2. Because the cross terms would be imaginary and cancel out when multiplied.

So the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. Wait, wait. No, wait. Let me think again. The modulus squared would be (a/(sqrt(1+x)))^2 + (0.5)^2. Because (a/(sqrt(1+x))) is real, and
