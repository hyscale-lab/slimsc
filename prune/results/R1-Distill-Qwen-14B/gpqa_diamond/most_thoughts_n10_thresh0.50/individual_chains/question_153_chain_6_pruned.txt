Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry reactions, specifically the Michael addition. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile, usually an enolate, attacks the beta position, leading to a conjugate addition.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and reaction conditions. I need to find the major products for each and match them with the given options.

Starting with part A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile. In the presence of a base like NaOEt, it should form the enolate. The enolate would then attack the beta position of the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl, which here is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the acrylate has a double bond between C2 and C3 (if I number from the ester group). The enolate would attack C3, but wait, the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me think. The structure is CH2=CH-(p-tolyl) attached to the ester. So the alpha position is next to the carbonyl.

Wait, no. Let me draw it out mentally. Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure: O

OEt-C-CH2-CH2-p-tolyl? No, wait, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. But in this case, the substituent is at position 3. So, the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOEt? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is propenoate: CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl) would have the substituent on the third carbon? Wait, that can't be right because propenoate is only three carbons. Oh
