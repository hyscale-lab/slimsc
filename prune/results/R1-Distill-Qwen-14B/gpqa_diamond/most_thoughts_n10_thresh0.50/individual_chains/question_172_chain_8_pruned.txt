Hmm, okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, but it's the energy difference between the levels that's given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, wait, no, the energy difference is a given value, but the main point is the excitation level.

I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy states is described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between them.

The Boltzmann factor is n_upper / n_lower = exp( -ΔE / (k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is temperature. 

In this problem, the excitation is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2. So, I think that means the ratio of excited to unexcited (or lower) states is twice as much in star_1. Let me denote the ratio as (n_upper/n_lower) for each star.

So, for star_1, the ratio is 2 times that of star_2. Let me write that.

Let me define for star_1: (n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower )

But according to the Boltzmann equation, each ratio is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So,

n1_upper/n1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

n2_upper/n2_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So, substituting into the first equation:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, no. Because the problem says star_1's excitation is twice that of star_2. So (n_upper/n_lower)_1 = 2 * (n_upper/n_lower)_2.

So, equation:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

I can rearrange this equation to find a relation between T1 and T2.

Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides.

ln( exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ) = ln( 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

Which simplifies to:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + ( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Let me rearrange that equation.

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k) from the left side:

ΔE/(k) [ -1/(T1) + 1/(T2) ] = ln(2)

Wait, wait, no. Let me do the steps correctly:

Starting from:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - Δ
