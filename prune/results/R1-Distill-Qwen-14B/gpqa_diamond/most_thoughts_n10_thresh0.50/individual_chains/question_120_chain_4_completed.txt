Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to the concepts, but I'll try to work through it. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, parallax is something I remember being related to distance. Oh right, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance is inversely proportional to parallax. So, distance (d) in parsecs is 1 divided by parallax (plx) in arcseconds. So d = 1/plx.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, like, how many stars are there for each slice of parallax change. Let's think about the distribution. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, that means the number density is constant in all directions. But how does this translate into the number per unit parallax?

Hmm, maybe I should consider the volume of space that a certain parallax range corresponds to. Because the number of stars depends on the volume, since more volume would mean more stars if they're uniformly distributed.

Parallax plx is inversely related to distance. So a small plx means a larger distance. Let me think about what a unit change in plx represents in terms of distance.

Suppose I consider a thin shell at a distance d. The thickness of this shell would correspond to a small change in plx, say d_plx. Since plx is 1/d, the change in d would be related to the change in plx. Let me calculate that.

If plx = 1/d, then d_plx = -1/d² * dd. Rearranging, dd = -d² * d_plx. Since we're considering a small range of plx, maybe I can think about the volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd.

The volume of a spherical shell is (4/3)π ( (d + dd)^3 - d^3 ). But for small dd, this approximates to 4πd² dd. So the volume is proportional to d² dd.

But since d is 1/plx, we can substitute. So d = 1/plx. Then, d squared is 1/(plx)^2. And dd is the change in distance, which from earlier is dd = -(d²) d_plx. Wait, since d_plx is the change in parallax, which is positive if plx increases, but since plx and d are inversely related, when plx increases, d decreases. So perhaps I should take absolute values, but let's not get bogged down in signs.

So the volume element in terms of plx would be 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd), but dd is (d²) * d_plx, which is (1/(plx)^2) * d_plx. Substituting, volume = 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx²) d_plx )? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Let me try again.

Wait, I have:

Volume = 4π d² dd.

But d = 1/plx. So,

Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * dd.

But from the relation plx = 1/d, the derivative dd = - (1/plx^2) d_plx. So,

Volume = 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) d_plx) ) * (-1), but since we're dealing with absolute values, the negative sign goes away.

So Volume ≈ 4π (1/plx^4) d_plx.

Wait, but the number of stars in that volume would be the number density multiplied by the volume. If the number density is uniform, let's say n stars per cubic parsec, then the number of stars in the shell is n * Volume.

So number of stars N = n * 4π (1/plx^4) d_plx.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So, how many stars are there per unit d_plx. So N per d_plx is n * 4π (1/plx^4) d_plx / d_plx = n * 4π (1/plx^4).

Wait, but the question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx)". So, per unit plx. So it's like N per unit plx, which would be (n * 4π (1/plx^4)).

So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/(plx^4). But wait, that's one of the options. Option A is ~1/plx^4. But wait, that would mean that as plx increases (since plx is in the denominator), the number of stars per unit plx decreases rapidly. But I thought that more distant stars (lower plx) would have more stars in a given plx range because the volume increases.

Wait, wait. Let me think differently. Maybe I should look for the number of stars in a specific range of plx.

Suppose I have stars uniformly distributed in space. So the number density is n stars per cubic parsec. So the number of stars between plx and plx + d_plx is the number of stars in the corresponding spherical shell.

The shell at plx is at distance d = 1/plx. The volume of this shell is 4π d² * dd, but as I found before, which is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd). But dd is the change in distance, which is (d^2) * d_plx. So substituting,

dd = (1/plx^2) * d_plx.

So the shell's volume is 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) d_plx) = 4π (1/plx^4) d_plx.

So the number of stars in this shell is n * 4π (1/plx^4) d_plx.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit plx is (n * 4π (1/plx^4)) ) * d_plx / d_plx → (n *4π) (1/plx^4) per unit plx.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx." So we're looking for the number of stars per unit plx, which is proportional to 1/plx^4. So that would be option A.

But wait, I thought that as plx increases (meaning we're looking at more distant stars), the volume per unit plx increases. Because for larger plx (well, actually plx is small for large distances), wait, no, plx decreases as distance increases. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me correct this: larger distances correspond to smaller parallaxes. So when plx is small, the stars are far away.

So for a small change in plx (delta_plx), the volume (and hence number of stars) increases as plx decreases, because the shell's volume is proportional to 1/plx^4.

But wait, the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, which would mean that as plx increases, this number decreases, which makes sense because higher plx (closer stars) are less in number in each unit plx slice. But when plx is small (far away), each unit plx slice would contain more stars because there's a larger volume for each unit of plx.

Wait, but the question is about how the number changes with plx. So, for each unit change in plx, the number of stars is proportional to 1/(plx^4). So the number of stars per unit plx decreases as plx increases.

So the correct option would be A, which is ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought that the number of stars per unit volume is constant, so the number in a volume should increase with volume. So for a given plx range, say from plx to plx + d_plx, the number should go up as 1/plx^4. So the number per unit plx is 1/plx^4. So A is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the exponents. Let me double-check the math.

From the volume calculation:

Volume = 4π d^2 * dd.

d = 1/plx → d^2 = 1/(plx)^2.

dd is the change in distance. Since plx = 1/d, then d_plx = - (1/d^2) dd → dd = -d^2 d_plx.

Substituting d=1/plx, dd = -(1/plx^2) d_plx. So the volume (for a thin shell) is:

4π (1/plx)^2 * ( (1/plx^2) d_plx ) )

Which is 4π (1/plx^4) d_plx.

So yes, the volume is proportional to 1/plx^4 times d_plx. So the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π (1/plx^4) d_plx.

Thus, the number per unit plx is (n *4π) * (1/plx^4).

So the dependence is 1/plx^4, which is option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we analyze the relationship between parallax and distance, as well as the volume of spherical shells at different distances.

1. **Parallax and Distance Relationship**:  
   Parallax \( \text{plx} \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), such that \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). As \( \text{plx} \) increases, the distance \( d \) decreases, and vice versa.

2. **Volume of a Spherical Shell**:  
   The volume of a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is given by:  
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 4\pi d^2 dd
   \]  
   Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), the volume becomes:  
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot dd
   \]  
   To express \( dd \) in terms of \( \text{plx} \), we use the relation \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), which gives \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d_{\text{plx}} \). Substituting this into the volume expression:  
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d_{\text{plx}}\right) = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d_{\text{plx}}
   \]  
   Thus, the volume of the shell is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \) for a small change \( d_{\text{plx}} \) in parallax.

3. **Number of Stars in the Shell**:  
   Assuming a uniform number density \( n \) of stars (stars per cubic parsec), the number of stars in the shell is:  
   \[
   N = n \cdot \text{Volume} = n \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d_{\text{plx}}
   \]  
   The number of stars per unit range of parallax is then:  
   \[
   \frac{N}{d_{\text{plx}}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}
   \]  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \), which corresponds to option A.
