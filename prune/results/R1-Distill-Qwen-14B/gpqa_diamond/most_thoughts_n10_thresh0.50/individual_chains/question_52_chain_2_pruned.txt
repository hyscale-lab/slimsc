Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down. Alright, let's read it again.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics: 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Then, the problem focuses on the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). Observations show that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots. The transition wavelength is about 1448 Ã…, and the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

Hmm, I remember that the ratio of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but here the problem is about the ratio when spots are present and when they're not. So when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower, 5500 K. But how does that affect the individual regions?

Wait, spots are cooler regions on the star's surface. So the non-spotted areas are hotter. But wait, the overall effective temperature is the average. How is that calculated?

Oh, but the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So I think the spots are at a lower temperature than the rest. But wait, when the star doesn't have spots, Teff is 6000 K. When it has spots, the overall is 5500 K. So maybe the spots are much cooler.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on that. Maybe I should focus on the ratio of Ti levels. The ratio decreases when there are spots. So without spots, the ratio is higher. So
