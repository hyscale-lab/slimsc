Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance in a specific region of the sky. The given information is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Hmm, right, parallax is related to distance, so I need to find out how N changes with distance.

Wait, I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So as distance increases, parallax decreases. But wait, in the question, N varies with 1/plx^5, which would mean N is proportional to (1/plx)^5. Wait, no, the given is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Oh, right, because 1/plx is d, so if plx is 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So N is proportional to d^5? Because 1/( (1/d) )^5 is d^5. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The relationship given is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, substituting that in, we get N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5 = d^5. So N increases with d
