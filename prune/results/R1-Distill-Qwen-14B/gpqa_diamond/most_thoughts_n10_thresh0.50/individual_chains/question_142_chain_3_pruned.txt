Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, what does the question actually ask? Oh right, it's about where this particular density matrix is located in the qubit space. The options are some coordinate points, so I think I need to figure out how the density matrix relates to the Bloch sphere or some other geometric representation.

So the given density matrix is rho equals one half times (|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me write that out. So rho = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, but |0> and |1> are orthonormal basis states. So I can expand this matrix to see what it looks like. 

Let me think, |0><0| is a matrix with 1 at (1,1) and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 at (2,2) if we're in a two-dimensional space. So adding them together, each has a 1 in their respective corners, and the matrix becomes:

[1 0;
 0 1]

Then, multiply by 1/2. So each of the diagonal elements becomes 1/2. So rho is:

[ [0.5, 0],
  [0, 0.5] ]

Wait, but what does this represent? I remember that pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors, like |
