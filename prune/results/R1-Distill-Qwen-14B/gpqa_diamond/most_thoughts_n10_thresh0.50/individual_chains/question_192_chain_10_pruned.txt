Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but let's see what I can remember.

Alright, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. Inside it, there's a small cavity of radius r, and the center of the cavity is a distance s away from the conductor's center. So, the conductor is like a bigger sphere, and the cavity is off-center. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.

Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Its distance from the cavity's center is l, and the angle between l and s (the distance from conductor's center to cavity's center) is theta. Both l and L are greater than R, which makes sense because P is outside the conductor.

Hmm, so I remember that when you have a spherical conductor, the charges redistribute in a certain way. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged, right? So when we place a charge inside the cavity, what happens?

I think that the conductor being a conductor means that the charges will move freely. But since it's uncharged, the charge inside the cavity must induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Let me think. For a conductor with a cavity, the charges inside the cavity (even if it's uncharged initially) will cause the inner surface to have an induced charge. But wait, the conductor itself is neutral. Oh, right, because the conductor is uncharged, the total charge on the outer surface must balance any induced charges.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If you put a charge +q inside a cavity of a conductor, the inner surface of the conductor will induce a charge of -q, right? Because the charge +q attracts opposite charges on the inner surface. Since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must then have a charge of +q to balance the -q on the inner surface. So the outer surface ends up with +q, and the inner with -q.

Wait, but wait. The conductor is initially uncharged. So when charge +q is placed in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor (since conductor
