Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again carefully.

The question is about calculating the luminosity ratio between two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. From spectroscopy, the peak wavelengths where each star appears brightest are the same. Additionally, their radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. We need to find out by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming black body radiation.

Hmm, so the first thing I remember is that the peak wavelength of a star's emission is related to its temperature. I think it's Wien's Law. Wien's displacement law states that the wavelength at which the emission is a maximum is inversely proportional to the temperature of the black body. The formula is λ_max * T = constant. The constant is approximately 2.9×10^-3 m·K.

Wait, but in this case, the peak wavelengths are the same for both stars. So, if λ_max is the same for both, that would imply that their temperatures are the same? Because λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So if λ1 = λ2, then T1 = T2. So both stars have the same temperature? Or wait, does the radial velocity affect this? Because Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, which might cause a Doppler shift in its spectrum.

Oh right! The peak wavelengths observed might be affected by the Doppler effect. The radial velocity can cause a shift in the observed wavelength. So the star moving towards us (blue shift) or away (red shift) would change the observed λ_max. Wait, but Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so its observed wavelength is the same as the emitted. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. So I need to adjust the observed wavelength for Star_2 to find out its actual temperature.

Wait, no. Wait a second. The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest (i.e., the observed peak wavelengths) are the same. So Star_1's emitted λ_max1 is observed as λ_obs1 = λ1 because its velocity is zero. Star_2 emits λ_max2, but due to radial velocity, its observed λ2_obs is λ2_obs = λ2 * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ) or something like that. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the relativistic Doppler shift formula.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula is a bit more complicated because velocities are a significant fraction of the speed of light, I think. Wait, 700 km/s is about 0.23% the speed of light (since c is about 3e5 km/s). So for such a small velocity, the non-relativistic approximation might be better. The non-relativistic Doppler shift formula is approximately (1 +
