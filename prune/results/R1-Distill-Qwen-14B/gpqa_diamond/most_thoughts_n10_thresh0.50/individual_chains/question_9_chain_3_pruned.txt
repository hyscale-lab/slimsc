Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about molecular symmetry, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that C3h is one of the point groups in molecular symmetry. Let me think... Point groups are about the symmetry elements a molecule has. C3h is the same as the dihedral group D3, right? Or maybe I'm mixing it up. Wait, no, C3h is a point group with a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule should have a threefold symmetry and a mirror plane that's perpendicular to the rotation axis.

The options are four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, a benzo... something, and another triphenyleno... something. I'm not familiar with all of these, but let's think about each one.

First, triisopropyl borate. Borate usually has a trigonal planar structure around the boron. Wait, triisopropyl borate would have three isopropyl groups attached to boron. Each isopropyl is like a CH(CH3)2 group. So the molecule would have a trigonal structure around the boron. The borate anion is [B(OiPr)3]^- maybe. So the molecule would have a trigonal planar arrangement, which would give it C3v symmetry? Because the threefold rotation and the mirror planes, but perhaps no horizontal mirror plane? Wait, no. C3v has a vertical mirror plane, not horizontal. Hmm. So maybe it doesn't have C3h. Or wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me visualize the structure.

Wait, the molecule is triisopropylborane, perhaps. The structure would be a central boron attached to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is a CH2CH(CH3)2 or something? So the molecule would have a trigonal planar geometry. So each of the three substituents is the same, so symmetry should be present. The molecule would have a threefold rotation axis (C3), and each of the three mirror planes that pass through the boron and each pair of substituents. But those are vertical mirrors, not horizontal. So the point group would be D3
