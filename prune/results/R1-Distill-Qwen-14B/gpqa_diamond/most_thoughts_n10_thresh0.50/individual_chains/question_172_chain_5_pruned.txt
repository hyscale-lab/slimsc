Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2 in a specific energy level. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, it says "twice as excited in a specific energy level." Not sure if that's about the number of atoms in that level or the excitation energy. But I think in this context, it probably refers to the population of atoms in that energy level. So higher excitation would mean more atoms in that higher energy level.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, but why is that number given? Because I remember that the Boltzmann distribution comes into play here, which relates the population of energy levels to temperature.

Boltzmann's equation, right? The ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp(-Î”E/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of the level. But wait, the question says the excitation is twice as much. So maybe the ratio of the populations is 2:1, star_1 to star_2. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, it says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited" as star_2. So star_1 has a higher population
