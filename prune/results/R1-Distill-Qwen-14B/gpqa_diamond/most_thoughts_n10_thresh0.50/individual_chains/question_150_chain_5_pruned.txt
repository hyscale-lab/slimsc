Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's eight carbons, nine hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. The NMR data is provided, so I should start by analyzing that.

The 1H-NMR peaks are:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

I remember that a triplet around 9.7 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes show up around 9-10 ppm, so that makes sense. The triplet suggests maybe coupling with two equivalent protons, like in a CH2 group adjacent to the aldehyde. Wait, no, the aldehyde is RCHO, so maybe the aldehyde proton is next to a CH group that's split into a triplet? Or perhaps it's coupled with another set of protons elsewhere.

Looking at the aromatic region: 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests two sets of aromatic protons. Maybe two para-substituted aromatic rings. For example, two phenyl groups each attached with substituents in the para positions. The doublets would fit if each ring has two equivalent protons. Like, each ring has two protons as a pair, perhaps para to substituents.

Then there's a broad singlet at 6.27 ppm integrating to 2H. Broad signals can be due to exchange, like OH protons. But wait, the question mentions the compound is reacted with reagents, so maybe the OH is deprotonated or involved in some way. Alternatively, these could be alkenyl protons. But 6.27 is a bit upfield for vinyl protons, but not impossible. Alternatively, maybe these are protons on an oxygen-substituted ring, like an enol form or something. Or perhaps they are adjacent to an oxygen, like in a diol or something else.

The 3.66 ppm peak is a doublet integrating to 2H. That's a fairly upfield shift. Maybe these are CH2 groups attached to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. For example, OCH2CH2O or OCH2 attached to something else. But considering the molecular formula, we have an O and a N. Wait, the compound has one N and one O. So maybe the CH2 is next to an oxygen, perhaps an ether or an ester.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents. Wait, the aldehyde is at 9.72, that's a triplet. So the aldehyde proton is likely adjacent to a CH group. Wait, no, the aldehyde is RCHO. How about if the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde? Because that would mean the aldehyde is conjugated to a double bond.

Wait, let's think about the
