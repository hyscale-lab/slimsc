Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. I'm supposed to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each being some function of 1 over plx raised to a power.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So the formula is plx = 1 / distance, where distance is in parsecs. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. Wait, so if I have a range of parallaxes, how does the count of stars in that range depend on plx?

Oh wait, I think this is a volume density problem. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number should depend on the volume. Let me think about how the volume changes with parallax.

If the distance is d, then plx = 1/d. So d = 1/plx. So as parallax increases, the distance decreases because they're inversely related.

Imagine a thin shell at a distance d with thickness dr. The volume of this shell would be the surface area of a sphere with radius d multiplied by dr. But wait, since we're talking about a range of parallaxes, which correspond to a range in distances, I should think about how the volume element changes with distance.

Wait, let me model this correctly. The number density is the number of stars per unit volume. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a volume is proportional to the volume itself.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit parallax. So for a small change in parallax, dplx, how does the number of stars in that dplx depend on plx?

Let me relate distance and parallax. So plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx.

Consider a thin shell at distance d with a thickness dr. The volume of this shell is 4πd² dr. Now, the corresponding change in parallax for this dr is dplx. Let's find d in terms of pl
