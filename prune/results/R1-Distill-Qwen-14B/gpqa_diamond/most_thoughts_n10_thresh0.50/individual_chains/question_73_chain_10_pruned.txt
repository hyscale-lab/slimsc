Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

So the problem says there are two astronauts. The first has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c. The second has a mass of 3m and is moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question is about their relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. So I think the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Let me make sure I have that right. Oh yeah, because when objects are moving at significant fractions of c, you can't just subtract their speeds. So the relative speed isn't 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. That would be the classical approach, but relativity is different.

Wait, wait, actually, I think the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)) when you're finding the speed of one object from the other's frame. So in this case, since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

So the numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So denominator is 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c for relative speed. So that's probably part of the answer.

Now, the total energy part. Each astronaut has relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared. So I need to calculate the total energy of each and add them together.

Wait, wait. The masses are 2m and 3m. So astronaut 1 has mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Astronaut 2 has mass 3m, speed 0.5c. So their energies are gamma1 * 2m c² and gamma2 *3m c². Then sum them.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute gamma for each.

For astronaut 1: v = 0.6c.
v²/c² = 0.36. So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Square root is 0.8. So gamma1 = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So his energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut 2: v = 0.5c.
v²/c² = 0.25. 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. Square root is sqrt(0.75) which is about 0.8660. So gamma2 = 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

So his energy is 1.1547 *3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy is 2.5 +3.464 = about 5.964 m c². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches. Option B says 4.96, which is lower, but I think I did the math right. Let me double-check.

Wait, 3 *1.15
