Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and that causes the spectral lines to shift.

The problem says that two stars have the same mass, similar to our Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. 

Planet #1 causes a spectral line shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is about how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I need to relate the Doppler shift to the orbital period. I think the RV method uses the semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift, which depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance.

The formula I remember is something like:

K = (V) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / (2π)) )^(1/3)

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the radial velocity semi-amplitude. The semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * P) / (2π c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3))

But since the stars have the same mass (M_star is same for both), and the planets' masses are similar, maybe the ratio of K can lead me to the ratio of the periods.

Wait, but the problem says both planets have masses similar to Neptune. So M_p is the same for both. So M_p can be considered the same for Planet #1 and #2.

So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The formula for K (radial velocity semi-amplitude) is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ] * (1/(2π)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune's mass is about 17 Earth masses, and the star is Sun-like, which is way bigger), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So it simplifies to:

K ≈ (G * M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) ) * (1/(2π)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

But wait, I think the exact expression is more like:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) ) * ( (sin i) ) / ( P^(1/3) )

Hmm, maybe I should look for the dependence between K and P.

Since both stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses, sin i
