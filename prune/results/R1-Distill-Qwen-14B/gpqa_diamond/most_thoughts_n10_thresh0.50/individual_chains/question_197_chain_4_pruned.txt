Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The question is about identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are four different organic compounds, each with their own structures. 

First, I need to figure out what Compound X is based on the given IR and NMR data. Then, I can determine what reaction occurs when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and what the product would be.

Let's start by analyzing the spectral data.

The IR data shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad peak usually indicative of an -OH stretch. Wait, but wait, another possibility is an alkyne C-H stretch, which is also in that region. But the strong absorption in the IR around 3400-2500 is more likely to be an -OH group, maybe a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But let me think. Carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300, often with a peak around 2500-3000 cm-1. So maybe a carboxylic acid is present. 

Another IR peak is at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids usually have their carbonyl around 1700 cm-1. So 1720 is a bit higher, which might suggest it's an ester or a ketone. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl, which can shift the peak. Hmm.

Then there's a peak at 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1. Those are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So it's probably an aromatic ring with substituents. The 1610 is probably the stretching for the aromatic ring, and the 1450 might be the substitution pattern—like para substitution, which has different vibrational modes.

Now, the NMR data. Let's look at each signal.

1H NMR:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm. That's a strong indication of an -OH proton, like a carboxylic acid. Because alcohols usually have protons around 1-5 ppm, unless it's an acidic proton. Carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm. So this is probably a carboxylic acid group.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is likely the protons on the aromatic ring. The doublet suggests coupling with one adjacent proton. Wait, in a para-substituted benzene, each proton is para to another group and maybe in a doublet? Or perhaps an ortho coupling? Or maybe it's a meta substitution? Wait, no. Let me think. In a para-substituted benzene ring, the protons are usually split into two doublets. Wait, wait, no. For a para-substituted di-sub
