Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the probability of their transits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. They've already found these planets using the RV method, so they know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh wait, so if Planet_1's period is shorter, that means it's orbiting closer to its star, right? Because the closer a planet is to its star, the shorter its orbital period.

Both have circular orbits, so that's good. Circular orbits might make the transit timing more predictable, but the question is about the probability, not the timing. So the key factors for transit probability are the orbital distance and the sizes of the star and planet. The formula I remember is that the probability of a transit (P) is approximately equal to (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, we can approximate P ≈ R_star / a. Wait, no, actually, I think the formula is R_star / a, because the planet has to pass in front of the star from our point of view. So the probability depends on the size of the star relative to the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis).

Wait, let me get this right. The transit probability (P) is given by the formula P = (R_star / a) * (1 + R_planet / R_star). But since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, the term (1 + ...) is approximately 1. So P ≈ R_star / a. So essentially, the probability is the radius of the star divided by the orbital distance (semi-major axis) of the planet.

Wait, no, I think I might have that flipped. Let me think again. The probability is the ratio of the star's radius plus the planet's radius over the orbital distance, but if the planet's radius is negligible compared to the star, then it's just R_star / a. So yeah, P ≈ R_star / a.

But wait, wait, in the question, both host stars have the same radii. Oh, right! The problem
