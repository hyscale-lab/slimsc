Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question involves a reaction where substance X reacts with liquid Y. The products are a gas W, precipitate G, and another substance B. Oh, and there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Plus, X's analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Interesting.

First, I need to break down the information. Let's see. Substance X has a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So, X is probably a diatomic molecule or something with isotopes. The reaction with Y releases gas W, whose molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, W is a molecule where protons equal neutrons. Common gases that fit this... Let me think. For example, CO2 has 12 C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and 2 O (8 each). But wait, CO2's molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons? Wait no, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So CO2 has (6 + 16) protons, which is 22, and (6 + 16) neutrons? Wait no, the protons are fixed, but the neutrons vary based on isotopes. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe W is H2O? Because H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and one O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So each molecule has 2+8=10 protons, and 0+8=8 neutrons. Wait, that doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe W is something like NH3? No, that's a gas too, but NH3 has 14 (N) +3(1 H each) =17 protons. Neutrons would be 14-7=7 for N, and 1 for each H. So 7+3=10. So protons (17) vs neutrons (10), which doesn't match. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. If W has same number of protons and neutrons in the molecule, then sum of all protons equals sum of all neutrons in each molecule
