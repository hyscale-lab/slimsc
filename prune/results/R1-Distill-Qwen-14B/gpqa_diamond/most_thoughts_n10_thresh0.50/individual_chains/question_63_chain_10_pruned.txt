Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled by the quantum rotation-vibration model. I remember that this model considers both rotational and vibrational energy states of the molecule.

The problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So, the next state would be the first excited state. But wait, the question is about the momentum of a photon that needs to be absorbed for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, I think this refers to the molecule moving from the ground state (fundamental) to the first excited state.

So, I need to find the photon's momentum. Oh, right, momentum for a photon is related to its energy and wavelength. The formula I remember is p = E/c, where p is momentum, E is energy, and c is the speed of light. So if I can find the energy of the photon, I can find its momentum.

But how do I find the energy the photon needs to supply? The molecule's transition is from the ground state to the next state. I think the energy difference would be the energy of the photon. So, delta E = E_next - E_ground. Since it's the next state, the photon's energy should match the energy gap.

Wait, but the model is the rotation-vibration model. So, the energy levels have contributions from both rotation and vibration.
