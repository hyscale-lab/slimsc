Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the parts.

The question is about a substance X that incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 atoms of oxygen. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's similar to another substance. The task is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, let's break this down.

First, let's think about the reaction between X and Y. Violent reaction, gas W, precipitate G. Gas W has equal protons and neutrons. So what gas has the same number of protons and neutrons? The common ones I know are H2O (but that's a molecule, not a gas here), maybe CO2? No, wait, CO2 has 12 and 16 in the molecule, but each CO2 molecule has 12 (from C) + 16*2 (O) but I'm not sure about the counts. Alternatively, maybe H2? No, H2 has 1 proton each, but no neutrons. So that's not it.

Wait, the molecule must have equal numbers of protons and neutrons. Let's think of possible gases. Maybe CH4? No, that's not a gas with equal protons and neutrons. Wait, maybe NH3? No, not a gas that's released in such reactions. Alternatively, maybe CO, but that's a gas. Let me calculate.

Wait, the molecule of W has same number of protons and neutrons. So each atom in W's molecule must have the same number. Or perhaps each molecule as a whole?

Wait, no, I think each molecule of W has the same number of protons as neutrons in total. So for example, if W is H2O, the total protons would be 2 (from H) + 8 (from O) = 10 protons. The total neutrons would be 0 (H has no neutrons
