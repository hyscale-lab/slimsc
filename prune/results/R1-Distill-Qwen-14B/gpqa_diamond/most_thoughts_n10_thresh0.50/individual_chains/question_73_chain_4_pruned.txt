Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic speeds... Oh right, that means I can't just use classical mechanics. I should think about special relativity here.

Alright, the problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. My goal is to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

First, the relative speed. Wait, how do you find the relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds? Oh right, you can't just subtract the velocities because of the velocity addition formula in special relativity. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, I should make sure about the signs. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative velocity is the difference.

So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's frame, what is B's speed? Let me plug into the formula: (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). Wait, that would be (-0.1c)/(1 - (0.3c²)/c²) → (-0.1c)/(1-0.3)
