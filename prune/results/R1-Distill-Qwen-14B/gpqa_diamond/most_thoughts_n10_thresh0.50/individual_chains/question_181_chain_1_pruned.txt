Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this neutrino flux ratio problem. Hmm, let's see. The question is about what happens when the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stops suddenly. And we need to find the ratio of fluxes between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2).

Wait, I remember that the pp chain is a series of reactions in the Sun's core that produce energy via proton-proton fusion. The pp-I branch is the dominant one, and pp-II and pp-III are less significant, I think. Oh right, the pp-III branch produces higher energy neutrinos compared to pp-I. So if pp-III stops, that changes the neutrino flux.

Neutrinos are produced in the Sun mainly through the decay of beryllium-7, I believe. Or wait, more specifically, the dominant neutrinos from the Sun come from the proton-proton chain, particularly the pp-I branch. The pp-III branch is a minor contributor but produces higher-energy neutrinos.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, the production of high-energy neutrinos from that branch would stop. But wait, the question says the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Since neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, it would take about that time for the changes in the Sun's core to be felt on Earth. So, now (on Earth), the neutrino flux from that part would have changed.

But what about the other branches? The question says all other reactions remain as they were. So, the pp-I and pp-II are still active, producing neutrinos as usual.

Now, the neutrino flux we detect consists mainly of the 7Be decay neutrinos, which have a certain energy spectrum. If the pp-III branch was stopped, that would affect the high-energy end of the neutrino spectrum.

Wait, the pp-III branch produces neutrinos with higher energies. So, if it's stopped, the flux in higher energy bands would decrease more. But in the question, the flux is divided into two bands: 700-800 and 800-900 keV. So, band 1 is lower than band 2.

But wait, the total neutrino flux is a combination of all the sources. So, if pp-III is a minor source, its stopping would affect the higher energy bands more. Let me think about the flux in each band.

Assuming that the pp-III branch contributes significantly to the higher energy neutrinos, stopping it would reduce the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) more than in band 1 (700-800 keV). But wait, what's the typical energy distribution? The main neutrino peak from 7Be decay is around 0.47â€“0.51 MeV, so 470-510 keV. So, higher energy bands would have lower flux. But the pp-III neutrinos are from a different process, maybe the pep branch or something else?

Wait, the pp-III branch is the proton-electron-proton branch, which produces higher-energy neutrinos. So, if that stops, the high-energy tail would
