Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars. Star 1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star 2, and the same goes for their masses—Star 1 is 1.5 times more massive. But I remember that mass isn't directly related to luminosity, so maybe that's a red herring here. The important part is the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest. They found that both stars have their maximum brightness at the same wavelength. Oh, right, I think that relates to their temperatures because of Wien's Law.

Wien's Law says that the wavelength of maximum emission is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if both stars have the same maximum wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2. That makes sense.

Next, the problem mentions radial velocities. Star 1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star 2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But wait, the question is about the actual luminosity, which depends on the intrinsic properties—radius and temperature. The observed wavelength might be shifted, but since the problem is about their actual luminosities, maybe the radial velocities don't directly impact the calculation. Or wait, could it affect the temperature measurements? Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, its emitted wavelengths shift. But the problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, but that's the observed wavelength. So maybe their intrinsic temperatures are the same, but their observed temperatures (due to Doppler shift) might not be the same. But the problem says they radiate as black bodies, so perhaps we're considering their actual temperatures regardless of Doppler.

Wait, no, if the observed maximum wavelength is the same, that would include any Doppler shift. So the observed wavelength lambda_obs = lambda_emitted * (1 + v_r / c), approximately, for small velocities. But both stars have the same observed lambda_max. So let's think about that. Let me formalize this.

Let’s denote:
- λ1_obs and λ2_obs as the observed max wavelengths for Star 1 and 2.
- λ1_emit and λ2_emit as the emitted max wavelengths (before Doppler shift).

But the problem states that λ1_obs = λ2_obs. So:

λ1_emit * (1 + v1_r / c) = λ2_emit * (1 + v2_r / c)

Wait, but if Star 1 has a radial velocity of 0, then v1_r is 0, so λ1_obs = λ1_emit. For Star 2, v2_r is 700 km/s. So equation becomes:

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + 700/c )

But wait, that can't be right because if Star 2 is moving towards us, its observed wavelength would be shorter (blue shifted). But the problem says both have the same observed wavelength. Hmm, so maybe I got the direction wrong. Let's see, if Star 2 has a radial velocity of 70
