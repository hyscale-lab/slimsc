Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR problems can be tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read the question again.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and then it's reacted with a series of reagents. I need to figure out what the product is from the options given.

First, let's think about the NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows peaks at:
- 9.72 ppm: A triplet integrating for 1H. That's a pretty downfield shift, so maybe an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, maybe on a double bond or adjacent to some other structure.

- 6.98 ppm and 6.51 ppm: Both are doublets integrating for 2H each. These are in the aromatic region, probably para-substituted because the doublets are typically for two equivalent protons. So maybe two para-substituted benzene rings. Wait, 6.98 is downfield, possibly next to an electron-withdrawing group like a nitro or carbonyl. But our molecular formula has N and O, so maybe something else.

- 6.27 ppm: A broad singlet for 2H. Broad signals can be from OH protons, but wait, that's for two protons. Or maybe they're adjacent to something else. Alternatively, maybe they're on a double bond, but the broadness is confusing. But in the NMR, maybe these are vinyl protons that are in a conjugated system.

- 3.66 ppm: A doublet for 2H. That's more like a methylene group adjacent to something. Maybe an oxygen, like an OCH2 group. Or perhaps a CH2 connected to an electronegative atom.

Now, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation can be calculated. Each degree is a ring or a double bond. The formula is C8H9NO.

The general formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, X=0. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be, say, a benzene ring (3 degrees) plus a double bond and a ring (but that might complicate). Alternatively, one ring and four double bonds... Hmm, but more likely, the benzene ring (3) plus a double bond (1), and a ketone or aldehyde (another double bond). Or maybe a ring and an aldehyde and a double bond.

Wait, the NMR has a triplet at 9.72, which is probably an aldehyde. So one degree from that. Also, the 6.98 and 6.51 could be two separate aromatic rings, perhaps. Wait, but wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the carbons. If there are two benzene rings, each has
