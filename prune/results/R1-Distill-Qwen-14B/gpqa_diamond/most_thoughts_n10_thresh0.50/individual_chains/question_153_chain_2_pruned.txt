Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry reactions, specifically the Michael addition. Hmm, I remember the Michael addition involves the attack of a nucleophile on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let's think through each part of the question step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I'll tackle them one by one.

Starting with reaction A: the reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. I think NaOEt is a strong base, so it probably deprotonates something. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. The other reactant is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, which is the Michael acceptor here.

In the Michael reaction, the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta position of the acrylate. So the nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate. The methyl group in the acrylate is at the alpha position, and the p-tolyl is at the beta. So when the enolate attacks, it adds to the beta carbon, which is the p-tolyl-substituted carbon. Wait, no, the acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Structure-wise, it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, with the p-tolyl on carbon 2.

The enolate from dimethyl malonate (which is CH2(COOCH3)2-) would attack the beta carbon (carbon 2) of the acrylate. So the nucleophile adds to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. So the product would have the malonate group attached to the p-tolyl group.

Wait, so the acrylate is methyl propenoate but with the substituent. The attack would add the malonate's R groups (CH2(COOCH3)2-) to the acrylate's beta position. So the product would have a structure like CH2(COOCH3)2 attached to the p-tolyl group. Let me draw this out.

The acrylate is O

CH2-C-O-Me

p-tolyl

Wait no, the structure is CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, the formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be substituting on the third carbon? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the numbering. Let me think again.

The correct structure should have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2. The acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the second carbon. So it's
