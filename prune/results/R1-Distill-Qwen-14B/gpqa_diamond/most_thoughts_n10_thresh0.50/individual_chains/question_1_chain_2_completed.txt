Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish the two levels. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. 

Wait, but in this case, the lifetimes given are the lifetimes of each state. So each state has its own lifetime. I think the time uncertainty Δt for each state is the lifetime itself. So for E1, Δt would be 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, it's 1e-8 seconds. 

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So the energy difference ΔE must be such that the uncertainty in energy (from each state's lifetime) is smaller than the actual energy difference. Otherwise, the two states might not be distinguishable. 

So, the uncertainty in energy for each state would be ħ divided by the lifetime. Let me calculate that. The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. 

For E1: ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J. To convert that into eV because the options are in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602176634e-19 joules. So, 1.05e-25 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = approximately 6.56e-7 eV. So about 6.56e-7 eV uncertainty for E1. 

Similarly, for E2: τ2 is 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J. Convert to eV: 1.05e-26 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 6.56e-8 eV. 

Wait, but the energy difference ΔE should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of both states, I suppose. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, you can't resolve them. So the energy difference needs to be bigger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2. 

So the minimum energy difference should be larger than the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2. Let me compute those again. 

ΔE1: 1e-34 /1e-9 = 1e-25 J -> 6.56e-7 eV.
ΔE2: 1e-34 /1e-8 =1e-26 J -> 6.56e-8 eV.

Wait no, wait, τ1 is 1e-9, so ΔE1 is bigger than ΔE2. So the maximum uncertainty is ΔE1. Thus, the energy difference must be larger than ΔE1 ≈ 6.56e-7 eV. 

Now looking at the options:
A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 is much less than 6.5e-7. So no, too small.
B)1e-11 eV → even smaller. Also no.
C)1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV. That's much larger than 6.5e-7. So yes, that would work.
D)1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV. Hmm, which is less than 6.5e-7. So no, because 1e-8 is smaller than 6.5e-7. So D is too small.

So the correct option is C, 1e-4 eV.


To determine the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish the two quantum states, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Here, the lifetimes of the two states, τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s and τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s, represent the time uncertainties (Δt) for each state. 

For each state, the uncertainty in energy is given by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{\tau}
\]

Using ħ ≈ 1.0545718 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s and converting the result to electron volts (1 eV = 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ J), we calculate:

1. For τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s:
   \[
   \Delta E₁ = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \, \text{eV} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
   \]

2. For τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s:
   \[
   \Delta E₂ = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \, \text{eV} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
   \]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE must be larger than the maximum uncertainty, which is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.56 × 10⁻⁷ eV. Evaluating the options:

- **A) 10⁻⁹ eV**: This is much smaller than 6.56 × 10⁻⁷ eV, so it is too small.
- **B) 10⁻¹¹ eV**: This is even smaller than A, so it is also too small.
- **C) 10⁻⁴ eV**: This is 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 6.56 × 10⁻⁷ eV, so it satisfies the condition.
- **D) 10⁻⁸ eV**: This is 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 6.56 × 10⁻⁷ eV, so it is too small.

The only option that ensures the energy difference is large enough to distinguish the two states is **C) 10⁻⁴ eV**.
