Okay, so I've got this problem about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks interesting. I remember that metrics can describe different types of spaces, like spheres or hyperboloids, depending on the form.

So, the question is asking about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere? Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, kind of like a hyperbolic space. But wait, in two dimensions, a pseudosphere is actually a hyperbolic plane, right? Or is it a sphere with imaginary radius?

Wait, maybe I should think about the metric first. The general form of a metric in 2D could be something like ds² = E dx² + E dy², which would be a conformally flat metric. The conformal factor here is 32 divided by (4 - x² - y²). So the metric is conformally flat, which might mean it's a surface that's conformal to flat space.

Let me think: the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So, when x² + y² is less than 4, the denominator is positive, so the metric is positive definite. But if x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, making the metric blow
