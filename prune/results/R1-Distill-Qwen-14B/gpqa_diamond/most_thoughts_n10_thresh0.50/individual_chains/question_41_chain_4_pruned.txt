Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me try to think through it. Alright, the question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer in the lab. And the question is, what's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So light is moving through the glass, and the glass itself is moving. But wait, the glass is moving towards the observer, same direction as the beam? Or is it that the beam is going in the same direction as the glass's movement? Wait, the glass is moving toward the observer. Oh wait, no, if the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam towards the observer, that would mean the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving that way too. Or maybe the beam is going in the same direction as the glass's velocity. Hmm, I think I need to clarify that.

Wait, no, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer. So the observer is seeing the light coming from the direction where the glass is moving. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving through it in that same direction.

But wait, how does the motion of the medium (glass) affect the speed of light in it? I remember that in a medium at rest, the speed of light is c/n. But when the medium is moving, does that affect the speed of light relative to an external observer?
