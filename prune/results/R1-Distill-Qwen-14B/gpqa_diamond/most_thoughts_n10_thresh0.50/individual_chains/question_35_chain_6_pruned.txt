Okay, so I've got this question about angular momentum operators and eigenvalues. Hmm, let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

The question is about a muon's intrinsic angular momentum Y-component, represented by the operator Ay. It's given as a 2x2 matrix. So, I remember that for spin-1/2 particles like electrons or muons, the spin matrices are related to Pauli matrices.

The operator Ay is defined as c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). Wait, that looks familiar. Let me write that down:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

Hmm, wait a second. The Pauli matrices, sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Sigma y is [0, -i; i, 0], right? So S must be sigma_y here.

Yes, so S is the Pauli matrix sigma_y. And Ay = c * S. So substituting c = h/(4π), the operator becomes Ay = (h/(4π)) * sigma_y.

Wait, but sigma matrices are usually 2x2, and their eigenvalues are ±1. So when multiplied by a scalar, the eigenvalues will change accordingly.

The question asks about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay
