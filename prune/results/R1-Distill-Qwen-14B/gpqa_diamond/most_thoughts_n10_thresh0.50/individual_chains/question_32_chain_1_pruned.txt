Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is about finding the energy of the collider so that the speed of a certain nucleus, X, is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. Hmm. Let me try to break this down.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons because lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number A is protons plus neutrons. So 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6. So X is lithium-6, right? So the nucleus is ^6Li.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. I remember that when particles are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we need to use relativistic equations. The speed given is 0.96c, which is pretty high, so definitely relativistic effects are significant here.

I think the energy being referred to is the total relativistic energy of the nucleus. The total energy E is given by gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So E = gamma * m_0 c².

But wait, the problem is about the energy of the collider. Do they mean the kinetic energy or the total energy? Hmm. The options are in GeV, which is a unit of energy. In particle physics, when they talk about collider energy, it's usually the kinetic energy, but sometimes the total energy. Wait, no, actually, I think in colliders, the energy they refer to is the kinetic energy added to the rest mass energy. Or wait, no, wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Wait, the total energy is gamma times rest energy. The kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) times rest energy. So if the problem is asking for the energy of the collider, probably it's the kinetic energy that's being imparted, but I'm not entirely sure. Hmm. Alternatively, sometimes colliders are described by their center-of-mass energy, but this question might be more straightforward.

Wait, the question says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c
