Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. The formula I recall is that parallax (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is distance. That means if a star is closer, its parallax is larger, and as it gets farther, the parallax decreases.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform distribution in what sense? I think it means that the number of stars per unit volume is constant. So in space, there's the same number density everywhere. So if you consider a sphere with radius d, the number of stars inside would be proportional to the volume of that sphere.

The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So the number of stars within distance d would be proportional to d³. But the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let me see.

Let's say we have a small range in parallax, delta plx. This corresponds to a range in distance. Since plx = 1/d, a small change in plx would correspond to a change in d. Let me find delta d in terms of delta plx.

Taking plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Differentiating both sides, dd = -1/(plx²) * d plx. Wait, but when plx increases by delta plx, d decreases because d is 1/plx. So the range of d corresponding to a delta plx is delta d = (delta plx) / (plx²). Because plx is small, the negative just tells direction, but the magnitude is delta plx / plx².

Now, the number of stars in that distance range (from d to d+delta d) would be the volume element multiplied by the number density. The volume element is the surface area at radius d times delta d. The surface area is 4π d². So the volume element is 4π d² delta d.

Putting it all together, the number of stars N in that range is proportional to 4π d² delta d.

But since N is the number in a small delta plx, let's express everything in terms of plx. Remember d = 1/plx. So d² is 1/plx², and delta d is delta plx / plx².

Substituting these into N:

N ∝ 4π (1/plx²) * (delta plx / plx²) )

Wait, that would be 4π * (1/plx²) * (delta plx / plx²) = 4π delta plx / plx^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of plx, so that would be N per delta plx. So N / delta plx ∝ 1/plx^4.

Wait, wait,
