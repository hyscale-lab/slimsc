Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think it through step by step.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. There's a small cavity inside it, and the cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center. The radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are larger than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

I remember that when dealing with conductors and charges inside cavities, the conductor's charges redistribute in a certain way. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So what happens when we add a charge inside the cavity?

Oh right! In electrostatics, when you place a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface will induce an opposite charge, and the outer surface will have the same charge as the original. But wait, wait. Let me get this straight. Since the conductor was initially neutral, adding a positive charge +q inside the cavity would cause the inner surface of the conductor to have a charge of -q. But because the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must then have a charge of +q to balance it out. So the total charge on the conductor is zero, but the inner and outer surfaces have charges.

Wait no, wait. The conductor is uncharged, so the total charge is zero. The charge inside the cavity is +q. So the inner surface of the conductor must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, the outer surface must have +q because the conductor's total charge is zero (since the inner surface is -q and the original conductor was neutral). So the outer surface has +q.

Now, point P is outside the conductor. So when we're calculating the electric field at P, we can treat the conductor as a point charge, but what's the effective charge?

Wait, the field outside a conductor depends only on the total charge on the conductor. So the outer surface has +q, so the conductor as a whole behaves as if all the charge is at the center, right
