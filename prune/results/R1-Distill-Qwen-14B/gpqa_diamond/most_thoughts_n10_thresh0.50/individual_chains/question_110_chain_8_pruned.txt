Okay, so I've got this question here about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, let me think. I remember that each spectrograph has different brightness limits. From what I recall, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes up to 17, while HIRES can go down to 16. So any star that's brighter than 17 mag (so 17 or higher?) can't be seen by ESPRESSO, and anything up to 16 mag can't be seen by HIRES. Wait, actually, I think the way it's phrased is that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, meaning apparent magnitude less than or equal to 17. Same with HIRES—brighter than 16, so apparent mag <=16.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." Oh wait, no—the way it's written is that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, which would mean apparent mag less than or equal to 17, because lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So for a star to be detected, its apparent V magnitude must be <=17 for ESPRESSO and <=16 for HIRES. Wait, no, the wording is confusing. The
