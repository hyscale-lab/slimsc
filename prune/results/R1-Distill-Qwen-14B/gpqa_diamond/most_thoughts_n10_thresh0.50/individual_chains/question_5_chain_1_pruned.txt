Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

Alright, the operator is P, and it's a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. The question gives me each component as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like P are often related to angular momentum or spin, but I'm not entirely sure here. Wait, the problem says it's a muon, which is a lepton, but more importantly, muons have spin-1/2, so the operator is likely the spin operator.

The problem is asking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh, right, because for spin systems, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2 for the spin components. So the operator here is probably the spin operator, and the eigenvector would be the spin-up state along direction n.

Wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane. So n can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but since it's in the x-z plane, φ would be 0 or π, so maybe it's along some angle θ from the z-axis. Or perhaps it's better to think in terms of the direction vector (x, 0, z), but I'm not sure. Maybe I'll get back to that.

The operator P is a vector operator, so the total operator is the sum of the components multiplied by the respective direction unit vectors. So the operator along an arbitrary direction n is P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero, so P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but what are the components P_x, P_y, P_z? Let's write them down.

Given:
P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So each component is (ħ/2) multiplied by the respective Pauli matrix. Oh yeah, these are the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. So the total operator P_n is the sum of n_x P_x + n_z P_z because n_y is zero.

Let me denote the direction vector as n = (n_x, 0, n_z). Since it's a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. But wait, the direction is arbitrary, so the eigenvector should depend on the angles θ and φ of the direction. However, since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero (assuming we take the direction along the x-z without any y component), so θ is the angle from the z-axis.

Wait, no. If the direction is in the x-z plane, the polar coordinates would have φ=0 or φ
