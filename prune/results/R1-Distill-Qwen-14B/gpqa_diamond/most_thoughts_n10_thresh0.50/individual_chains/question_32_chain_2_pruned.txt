Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity and particle physics, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking for the energy of RHIC when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium. So, Li with 3 neutrons would be Li-6, because lithium typically has 3 protons, so 3 +3=6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6.

So, the problem is about relativistic energy. I remember that when particles are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, their energy increases significantly due to relativistic effects. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

First, I need to calculate gamma for v=0.96c. Let me think about how to compute that. So, v is 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, right? Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Let me check that calculation again. Wait, 0.28 times 0.28 is 0.0784, yes. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but maybe I should do it more accurately. Let me compute it step by step. Let's compute 1 - (v^2/c^2) = 1 - (0.96)^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Then the square root of 0.0784. Let me think, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, so sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 100/28 ≈ 3.57142857.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate it more precisely to avoid approximation errors. So 0.96^2 is 0.9216. 1-0.9216=0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28.

Wait, 1 divided by 0.28 is the same as 100/28, which is approximately 3.57142857. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Next, I need to find the total energy of the nucleus. The energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy (m c²). But
