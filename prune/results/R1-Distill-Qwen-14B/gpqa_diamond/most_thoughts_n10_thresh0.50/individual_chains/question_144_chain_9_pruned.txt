Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, mesons are subatomic particles, right? And the question is asking about the mean decay distance of a particular meson X. The given data includes the production energy (E_X = 8 GeV), the mass (m_X = 1.2 GeV), and the width (Γ_X = 320 MeV). The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters. 

I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh wait, the formula for the mean decay length (L) is c multiplied by the lifetime (τ), multiplied by the velocity (βc), so L = βcτ. But wait, I think another way might involve the particle's lifetime being determined by its width. The uncertainty principle relates the width Γ to the lifetime τ. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that Γ * τ ≈ ħ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. So τ is approximately ħ / Γ.

Wait, no, wait. The relation is τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Right. Because the width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the inverse of the lifetime. So Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think again. The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So yes, that's correct.

But wait,
