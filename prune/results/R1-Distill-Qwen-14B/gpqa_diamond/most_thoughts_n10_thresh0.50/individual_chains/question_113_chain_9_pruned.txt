Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using different spectroscopy techniques. The options are four possible chemical formulas, and I need to figure out which one is correct based on the given data.

First, let me go through the information step by step. The compound was characterized with FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry.

Starting with the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in the IR usually indicate O-H stretching. So, this could mean the compound has an alcohol group, maybe a carboxylic acid, or some sort of hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl. But wait, a broad peak can also come from an amine, but the options don't have N, so probably not that. Another thing, the broad peak at 3000 might be from -OH (like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol) or maybe an amine, but the options don't have N, so focus on O-H.

Then there are two other strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, the 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, maybe carboxylic acids. But why two peaks? The 1650 is a bit lower than the usual 1700, so maybe conjugation or another functional group. Wait, 1650 could be a C=C double bond or perhaps an ester or something else. Alternatively, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is a conjugated double bond.

Looking at the 1H NMR: several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, so that suggests there's a C=C in the molecule. So the compound has a double bond, probably an alkene.

Mass spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. I need to think about what fragments give 45. Common fragments include CH3CO (29), but wait, 45 is a higher mass. Maybe a CH2O group? Let me think. 45 could be a fragment like (CH2)2O or maybe an acetyl group attached to something else. Wait, I remember that the fragment at m/z=45 could correspond to a ketene ion or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3COO group or some ester. Another thought: 45 could be (CH3)2CO-, which is a ketone. The molecular weight of acetone is 58, but the fragment might be a part of it.

Now, considering all the data together. The FTIR shows O-H (broad peak) and two carbonyl peaks. Wait, two strong peaks in IR: 1700 and 1650. I'm a bit confused about that. Maybe one is a carbonyl group and the other is a conjugated C=C. Alternatively, I've heard that esters show two peaks around 1735 and 1700 due to
