Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the layer of a star where light is emitted, and when a star is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of energy levels of atoms can be described by the Boltzmann distribution.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the excitation here refers to the number of atoms in a particular energy state. Let me think, the ratio of the populations should be related to the temperature of the stars.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n_i and n_j are the number of particles in states i and j, g is the statistical weight, and k is Boltzmann's constant. Oh, right, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited at a specific energy level compared to star_2. Let me denote the energy levels as E1 and E2, but wait, wait. The problem says the energy difference between the considered energy levels is about 1.38e-23 J. Let me call that Î”E = E_upper - E_lower = 1.38e-23 J.

So, for each star, the ratio of the number of atoms in the upper energy level (n_upper) to the lower (n_lower) would be given by the Boltzmann factor. Let me denote for star 1, the ratio is 2 times that of star 2.

Wait, actually, the problem says in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So for star_1, n_upper / n_lower = 2 * (n_upper' / n_lower') where the prime is for star_2. Or wait, maybe the ratio is 2 times higher. Let me clarify.

Wait, the question says: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So the excitation is twice as much. I think that means the population ratio for the excited state
