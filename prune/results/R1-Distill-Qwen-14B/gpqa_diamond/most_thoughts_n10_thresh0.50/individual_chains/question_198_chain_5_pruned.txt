Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. We're given the stability constants (β) for the different cobalt thiocyanato complexes. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt species.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants relate to the formation of complexes. Each β value corresponds to a different complex. So, β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, and so on. But wait, how many complexes are we considering here? The β values given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So four complexes in total.

Wait, the question specifically mentions dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands attached. So that's the Co(SCN)₂^2+ complex, right? Or wait, maybe it's Co(SCN)_2^(n+). Let me think. Cobalt typically has a +2 oxidation state here. Each SCN- is -1, so two would be -2. So the overall charge would be Co^2+ plus 2*(-1) from two SCN- ions, giving Co(SCN)₂^0. Wait, but that can't be right because the solution is aqueous. Maybe I should just focus on the formation steps.

Stability constants are for the stepwise formation of complexes. So β1 is the formation constant for CoSCN^+ (Co with one SCN-). β2 would be the formation of Co(SCN)₂^2+, right? Because each β represents adding another SCN-.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The general form for the nth complex is β_n = [CoL_n]/([CoL_{n-1}} [L]). So for β1, it's [CoL]/([Co][L]). For β2, it's [CoL2]/([CoL][L]). So the overall formation constant for CoL2 would be β1 * β2. Oh wait, no,
