Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on. Alright, the setup is that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. Each particle's wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Interesting. And when they measured the positions, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So all the particles are in that interval.

Wait, so the question is about finding the value of 'a'. The options are A to D, which are numerical values. I remember that the wave function has to satisfy certain conditions, like normalization. Oh right, the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1.

But wait, in this case, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Oh, wait, that's a complex function. So the wave function ψ(x) is complex. But when calculating the probability, we take the modulus squared, which is ψ*(x)ψ(x). Let's see.

Wait, but in the given wave function, there's an 'i' term. So ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) ) minus 0.5i. So it's a complex wave function. So when we compute the modulus squared, it would be [a/(sqrt
