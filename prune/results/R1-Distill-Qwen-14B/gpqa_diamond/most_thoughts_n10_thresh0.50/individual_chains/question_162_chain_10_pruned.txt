Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, okay, I remember that metrics can describe the geometry of a space. So this looks like a 2-dimensional metric because it's got dx² and dy² terms.

I think that the area element in a metric is found by taking the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric tensor here is diagonal because there are no cross terms like dxdy. So the components would be g_xx and g_yy, which are both 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))². The square root of that is 32/(4 - x² - y²).

Wait, but wait, the metric is written as (32/(4 - ... )) multiplied by (dx² + dy²). So yeah, the g_xx and g_yy are both 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element dA would be sqrt(det g) dx dy, which is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

But wait, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So the area element is (32 dx dy) / (4 - x² - y²
