Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants β1 to β4 are given as 9, 40, 63, and 16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, right, dithiocyanato would be with two SCN- ions. But which complex is that? The problem mentions "blue," which is a clue. I think for Co(II) complexes, the blue ones are the ones with more SCN- ligands. Oh yeah, I remember that [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) complexes have different colors. The blue one is probably [Co(SCN)_2]^0, the dithiocyanato complex.

Stability constants, or formation constants, tell us the equilibrium of the complex formation. Each β represents how much the complex is formed. The higher β, the more stable the complex. So the order here is β3=63 is the highest, then β2=40, then β1=9, and β4=16 is next. Wait, no, wait. The order is 63,40,16,9? Wait no, β4 is 16. So the order is β3 (63) is the highest, then β2 (40), then β4 (16), and β1 (9) is the lowest.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think. The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Oh wait, wait, no, that's not the order. Wait, β3 is 63, which is the largest. Then β2 is 40, then β4 is 16, and β1 is 9. So the complexes form in the order of the highest β first.

So the possible complexes are:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ CoSCN^(+), β1=9
