Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where there's a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds to metal ions. So, Ca-EDTA is a complex ion.

The problem states that the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Stochiometric, right, so that means it's in a 1:1 ratio. So, the formula would be something like CaY^2-, where Y is the EDTA part. 

The given K for the complex, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. Oh wait, K is the formation constant, which tells us how stable the complex is. The higher the K, the more the complex forms. 

We're asked to find the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. I think this involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The formula for the formation constant K is K = [Ca][EDTA]/[CaEDTA]. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The formation reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2-. So the formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Right.

But in this problem, we probably need to use the dissociation constant. Oh wait, because K
