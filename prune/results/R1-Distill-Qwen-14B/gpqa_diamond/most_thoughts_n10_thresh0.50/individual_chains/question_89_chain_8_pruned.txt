Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try my best.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's a pretty rigid molecule with four cyclohexane rings fused together in a diamond-like lattice. The 1,3-dibromo part means there are bromine atoms at two of the bridgehead positions.

Heating this with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH... so that's a strong base. I think this is an elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) are treated with a strong base, they usually undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal; the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. Hmm, so maybe it's a different kind of elimination.

Wait, perhaps it's a double elimination? Like each Br leaves, and forms two alkenes. Or maybe it's a ring-opening or some sort of rearrangement. Oh, wait, adamantane is a cage structure, so maybe the Br's are on adjacent bridgeheads. Oh wait, no, 1,3 positions are not adjacent. So when you heat with KOH, maybe it's an elimination to form an allene or something else. Or maybe it's a neighboring group effect
