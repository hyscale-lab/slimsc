Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

Alright, the problem says the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by some Lagrangian. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

Hmm, I remember that when a particle decays, the decay products must have enough mass to be produced. For a boson like X to decay into fermions, each fermion pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to the mass of X. Otherwise, the decay isn't allowed because of conservation laws.

So the first thing I need to do is figure out which fermions have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV each because X is 6 GeV. Wait, wait, no. Because when a boson decays into a pair of fermions, each fermion's mass must be less than half the boson's mass. Because each fermion would have a mass of m, and two of them make 2m. So 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤ 3 GeV.

Right, so each fermion pair's mass must be ≤ 6 GeV. But actually, each individual fermion must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. Because if each is 3 GeV, then two of them would sum to 6 GeV, which is exactly the mass of X.

Wait, but the fermions come in pairs. So for each pair, like electron and positron, or quark and antiquark, their masses are each m, so the pair's combined mass is 2m. So 2m must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. So m ≤ 3 GeV.

So I need to list all possible fermions with mass ≤ 3 GeV.

What are the known fermion masses?

Let me recall:

Quarks:
- Up (u): around 2-5 MeV (so definitely much less than 3 GeV)
- Down (d): similar, around 3-6 MeV
- Strange (s): about 95-100 MeV
- Charm (c): around 1.2-1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): around 4.1-4.7 GeV
- Top (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV
Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: even lighter, but since we're considering charged fermions for decay (as neutrinos are neutral), but wait, the interaction term given is with ψ_f, which is a fermion field. Wait, the Lagrangian is -λf ψ_f-bar X ψ_f, so the interaction term is X coupling to a fermion ψ_f and its conjugate ψ_f-bar, meaning it's a Yukawa coupling. So X can decay into a pair of ψ_f and ψ_f-bar. So for each fermion species, X can decay into that fermion and its antiparticle.

So the decay products would be into pairs like e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, and quark-antiquark pairs.

Wait, but what about the quark masses? Because if the quarks are too heavy, their mass would make the pair's mass too big.

So let's list the fermions by their masses:

1. Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV → way below 3 GeV.
2. Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV → also much less than 3 GeV.
3. Tau (τ): ~1777 MeV → 1.777 GeV, so less than 3 GeV.
4. Neutrinos: negligible, but since the interaction is with charged leptons (I think? The problem says fermions, but the Lagrangian has ψ_f; maybe it's considering all, but in reality, neutrinos don't have electric charge, so perhaps the interaction is with charged fermions only. Hmm, but the problem statement is unclear. Wait, the Lagrangian uses ψ_f, which could be any fermion, including neutrinos. But since X is a boson, which couples to fermions, but the decay products must be charged? Because otherwise, neutrinos are neutral and can't be detected. But the question is about possible decays, regardless of charge, I think. But wait, for a fermion and its antifermion, their charges would be opposite. So in the decay X → e+ e-, that's possible. Neutrinos are neutral, so X→ ν ν̄ would be possible, but maybe in the given options, the neutrinos are not included because the options don't list them. Looking at the options, they have e+, e-, mu, etc., but not neutrinos. So probably the problem assumes charged fermions only.

Wait, but the options don't include neutrinos. So I can ignore neutrinos for this problem.

Now, for the quarks:

Light quarks u, d, s have masses much less than 3 GeV. The c (charm) quark is about 1.2-1.5 GeV, so 2m would be about 2.4-3 GeV. So
