Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to understand what's being asked.

The question says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A to D, each with two pH values.

Hmm, okay. So first, I need to figure out what happens when we dilute the acetic acid. Then, during titration with NaOH, I should find the pH at 25% of the equivalence point and at the equivalence point itself.

Let me start by calculating the dilution of the acetic acid. We have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³, right?

The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) can be calculated. Moles = concentration × volume (in liters). So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

When we dilute it to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the new concentration will be moles / volume. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but is that right? Wait, 20 mL + 20 mL = 40 mL, so 0.04 L. Yeah, 0.05 M *0.02 L is 0.001 mol. Divided by 0.04 L is 0.025 M. That makes sense.

So now, when we titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na^+ + H2O.

At equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will be equal to the moles of acetic acid present. So let's find the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence.

Moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume required is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Wait, the initial acetic acid solution after dilution is 0.025 M, 40 mL. The moles are 0.025 * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Correct.

So equivalence point is when we add 10 mL of 0.1 M NaOH.

Now, the problem asks for the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

First, let's tackle the 25% titration point. That means we've added 25% of the NaOH needed to reach equivalence. So 25% of 10 mL is 2.5 mL of NaOH.

So, 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH. Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Since acetic acid reacts with NaOH in a 1:1 ratio, the moles of acetic acid remaining and the moles of acetate ion formed can be calculated.

Initially, moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 mol. Moles of NaOH added = 0.00025 mol, which is 25% of the total needed. So, after reaction:

Moles of CH3COOH left = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed = 0.00025 mol.

Now, the total volume of the solution at this point is the initial 40 mL plus 2.5 mL NaOH, which is 42.5 mL (0.0425 L).

So concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ Let's compute that. 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approximately 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, to find the pH, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is the negative log of Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1/(1.85e-5)).

Wait, log(1.85e-5) is about 4.736? Wait, no. Wait, 1e-5 is 5. So wait, 1.85e-5 is 1.85*1e-5. Log(1.85) is about 0.267. So log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So using Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

[A^-] = 0.005882 M, [HA] = 0.017647 M.

So log(0.005882 / 0.017647) = log(0.3333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. So approximately 4.26.

Now, looking at the options. Let me check each option.

Option A: 4.26; 8.52 → 4.26 is the first value, which matches. But what about the equivalence point?

Wait, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution will be a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution will be basic.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So the concentration of acetate ions is moles / total volume.

The total volume is 40 mL (original) + 10 mL (NaOH) = 50 mL = 0.05 L.

Moles of acetate = 0.001 mol, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

To find the pH, we can set up the expression for Kb.

Let me denote [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M.

Let x be the concentration of OH^- produced.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x² = 0.02 *5.405e-10 → x² = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 3.29e-6 → pOH = -log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.48 → pH = 14 -5.48 = 8.52.

So at equivalence point, the pH is about 8.52.

Looking back at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52. So that would be the correct option for both points.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations because some options have different values.

Wait, when I calculated the pH at 25% titration, I got approximately 4.26, which matches option A. At equivalence point, 8.52, which also matches option A's second value.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the 25% titration part.

Wait, when using Henderson-Hasselbalch, I had [A^-] = 0.00025 / (0.0425) = approximately 0.005882 M.

[HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

So the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333.

Log(0.333) is about -0.477, so pH is pKa (4.733) -0.477 → 4.256, which rounds to 4.26. So that part seems correct.

At equivalence point, the acetate ion concentration is 0.02 M, and the Kb is 5.405e-10. The calculation of x gives [OH^-] as 3.29e-6, which gives pOH 5.48, so pH 8.52.

So the two pH values are 4.26 and 8.52, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D has 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution. Let me check that again.

Wait, the initial solution is 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles are 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then we add 20 mL of water, so total volume 40 mL. So concentration becomes 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.

Then, at 25% titration, we add 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH, which is 0.00025 mol. So moles of HA = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075. Moles of A^- = 0.00025. So the ratio is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. So that's correct.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log(1/3) → pKa is about 4.733, so 4.733 - 0.477 = about 4.256 → 4.26. So that's correct.

At equivalence point, the solution is 0.02 M acetate. Kb = 5.405e-10. So [OH^-] is sqrt(0.02 * 5.405e-10). Let me compute that more accurately.

0.02 *5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11. Square root of that is sqrt(1.081e-11) is approximately 3.288e-6. So [OH-] = 3.288e-6 → pOH = log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288) is about 0.5168, so 5.5168. So pH = 14 -5.5168 = 8.483, which rounds to 8.48, which is about 8.52. So that's correct.

So option A is 4.26 and 8.52, which matches. So why is another option like D appearing in my mind? Maybe I'm mixing up the steps.

Wait, but looking at the other options, option D has pH values of 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, perhaps I should check the calculations again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the initial dilution is not 40 mL, but maybe I made a mistake in the dilution calculation. Wait, no, 20 mL + 20 mL is 40 mL. So the initial dilution is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the 25% titration point. 25% of the equivalence volume (10 mL) is 2.5 mL. So moles of NaOH is 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. That's correct.

Another possibility: perhaps I should have considered the dilution at the 25% titration point. Because when you add 2.5 mL of NaOH, the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 mL, which I did.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the solution at 25% titration is a buffer solution, which is correct. So I think I did it right.

Another thought: perhaps I should compute the exact pH at equivalence point without the approximation. Let me see.

At equivalence, the solution is 0.02 M acetate. The Kb is 5.405e-10.

The equation is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-]

Let [OH^-] = x.

So (x)(x)/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, so denominator ≈ 0.02.

So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → 1.081e-11 → x = 3.288e-6.

Which gives [OH^-] = 3.288e-6 → pOH = 5.48 → pH 8.52. So the approximation holds.

Alternatively, let's calculate without assuming x is negligible.

The equation is x² = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x)

x² = 1.081e-11 - 5.405e-10 x.

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 = 0.

This is a quadratic equation. Using quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)] / 2a

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11 → (2.92e-19) + (4.324e-11) ≈ 4.324e-11.

sqrt(D) ≈ 6.576e-6.

So x = [-5.405e-10 ± 6.576e-6 ] / 2. Taking the positive root:

x ≈ (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (6.576e-6) / 2 → 3.288e-6. So same result. So approximation holds.

Therefore, the pH at equivalence is 8.52, which matches option A.

But wait, looking at the options again, option A is 4.26;8.52. So that's the correct pair.

But wait, in the initial problem statement, the options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73

C) 4.73; 7.00

D) 4.57; 6.92

So option A is the correct one.

Wait, but I thought for a moment that option D was correct. Hmm, perhaps I can think why another option might seem correct, but I think my calculations are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch calculation. Let me recheck.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

In our case, [A^-] is 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

[HA] is 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

Ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is -0.477.

pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 -0.477 ≈ 4.256 → 4.26.

So that's correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. The initial dilution of acetic acid: when we add 20 mL of water to 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid, the concentration becomes 0.025 M. That's correct.

So I don't think I made any mistake here.

Another possible error could be in the equivalence point calculation. But no, that seems correct.

So the correct answer should be option A: 4.26; 8.52.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the dilution of acetic acid. Initially, we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. The moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
\text{Concentration of CH}_3\text{COOH} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.04} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the NaOH required to reach the equivalence point has been added. The total moles of NaOH needed for equivalence are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH for equivalence} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Thus, 25% of this is:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH added} = 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

After the reaction:
- Moles of unreacted acetic acid: \( 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol} \),
- Moles of acetate ion (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)): \( 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \).

The total volume of the solution is now \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 \) (0.0425 L). The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately \( 4.26 \).

### At Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. The solution contains only \( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \), which hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The total volume of the solution is \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 \) (0.05 L). The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The \( \text{K}_b \) for acetate is:

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{\text{K}_w}{\text{K}_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the expression for \( \text{K}_b \):

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}][\text{OH}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}.
\]

Assuming \( [\text{OH}^-] = x \), we have:

\[
5.405 \times 10^{-10} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x^2 = 0.02 \times 5.405 \times 10^{-10} = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}, \quad x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6}.
\]

Thus, \( [\text{OH}^-] = 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M} \). The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48,
\]

and the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is \( 4.26 \), and the pH at the equivalence point is \( 8.52 \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
