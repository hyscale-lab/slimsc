Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. In the classical case, it's F = -kx. But wait, this is a relativistic version, so things are going to get a bit more complicated.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass in this oscillator. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different expressions. Let me think about how to approach this.

In the classical case (non-relativistic), the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², where A is the amplitude. So the kinetic energy at maximum speed would be (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max². Solving for v_max gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is a relativistic problem, so classical mechanics might not apply here.

Relativistically, the energy considerations change. The total energy of the oscillator would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, in relativity, the total energy includes the rest mass energy, so when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (amplitude A), all the energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. But wait, in relativity,
