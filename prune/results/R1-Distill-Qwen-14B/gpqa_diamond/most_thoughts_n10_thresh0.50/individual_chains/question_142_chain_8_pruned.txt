Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (i.e., a statistical mixture of pure states) rather than pure.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, so each of those terms is a projector, right? Because |0⟩⟨0| is a projection operator onto the state |0⟩, same with |1⟩⟨1|. So when you add them together and multiply by 1/2, you're creating a mixed state that has equal probability of being in |0⟩ or |1⟩.

I think the next step is to represent this density matrix in terms of the Bloch sphere. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of qubit states. For a pure state |ψ⟩, the density matrix is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, and its representation on the Bloch sphere is a point on the surface. But for a mixed state, like this one, the density matrix would correspond to a point inside the Bloch sphere.

Wait, how does that work exactly? I remember that any 2x2 density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector that determines the state's position on the Bloch sphere. Oh right, because each component of r corresponds to a Pauli matrix: σx, σy, σz.

So let's break it down. Let's express ρ in terms of the identity matrix and the Pauli matrices. The identity matrix I is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| + |0⟩⟨1| + |1⟩⟨0|) ? Wait, no, wait. The identity matrix for 2x2 is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So when we have ρ as given, let's compute it.

ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let's write out each term
