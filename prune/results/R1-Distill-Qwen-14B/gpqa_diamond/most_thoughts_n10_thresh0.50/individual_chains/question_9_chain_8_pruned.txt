Okay, so I've got this question about molecular symmetry. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let's see if I can figure this out. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that symmetry in molecules involves different types of operations like rotations and reflections. 

Wait, what's C3h symmetry? I think the h stands for horizontal mirror plane. Oh right, so C3h would be a point group with a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also have a mirror plane that's horizontal.

The options are four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, and two others with long names. Let's try to visualize each one.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. I remember that triisopropyl borate is a borane with three isopropyl groups attached. The structure is something like B with three CH(CH2CH3)2 groups. Is that structure symmetrical enough for C3h? Well, each isopropyl group is the same, so maybe it has some symmetry. Does it have a three-fold axis? If the boron is the center, rotating 120 degrees would map each isopropyl onto another. So a three-fold axis is present. But what about the mirror planes? Each isopropyl is symmetric, but does the molecule have a horizontal mirror plane? I'm not sure. Wait, I think triisopropyl borate has a trigonal pyramidal shape. In that case, the mirror planes would be vertical, not horizontal. So maybe it doesn't have a C3h but instead a C3v symmetry or something else. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong here. Alternatively, if the molecule is planar, but I don't think so because boron is in the center with three substituents. 

Option D is quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound, right? It has a structure that's like a bridge. I think it has a seven-membered ring, with two bridgeheads. Quinuclidine is a cage compound, I remember that. Its structure is similar to norbornane but with an additional bridge, making a more symmetrical structure? Wait
