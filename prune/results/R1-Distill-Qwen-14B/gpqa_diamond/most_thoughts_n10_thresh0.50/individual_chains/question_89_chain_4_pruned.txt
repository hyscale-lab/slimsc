Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Alright, let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's break down each step to see what's happening.

First, the compound is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking this might be an elimination reaction. Since we're dealing with dibromide, heating with a base usually leads to dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. So, product 1 is likely an adamantane derivative with a double bond. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). Wait, that's a bit confusing because elimination would typically form an alkene, but maybe I'm missing something. Oh, wait, maybe it's more of a substitution reaction. Wait, no, KOH typically deprotonates in E2 mechanisms. Hmm.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane: so two bromines are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. Heating with KOH (a strong base) would likely cause elimination, removing two bromides and forming a double bond. But wait, the IR peak is at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe it's not elimination but substitution. But if two bromines are on adjacent carbons, perhaps they undergo
