Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about calculating the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are related to the crystal structure and the Miller indices of the planes.

The question gives me a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance? Oh right, that's the distance between atoms in the lattice, like the edge length of the unit cell, right? So in a rhombohedral structure, all edges are equal, so a = b = c. But wait, rhombohedral is a special case where all edges are equal and all angles are equal too. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees each.

The plane in question is the (111) plane. I need to find the interplanar distance d for this plane. I remember there's a formula for interplanar distance in crystals, something involving the reciprocal of the plane indices and the lattice parameters.

The formula I think is d = (a) / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... something with the angles maybe?) Wait, no, that's for cubic systems. Oh, wait, for a general crystal system, especially with non-orthogonal axes, the formula might be a bit more complicated.

Right, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) * (some terms involving the angles).

Wait
