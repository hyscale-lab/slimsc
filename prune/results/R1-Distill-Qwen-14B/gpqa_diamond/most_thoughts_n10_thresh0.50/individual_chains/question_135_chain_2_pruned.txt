Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically dealing with the decay of a boson. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term involving a bosonic field X and some fermions. The mass of X is 6 GeV. I need to find the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

Hmm, the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps I should parse this correctly. Let me write it out again: 

L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Wait, no, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Oh wait, perhaps it's written as:

L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Wait, maybe the superscript f is a typo. Wait, looking again: The term is -λ f (ψ_f)^dagger (ῡ + X) ψ_f. So it's a Yukawa interaction term, similar to the Higgs coupling with fermions.

Wait, but perhaps the interaction is written as L = -λ f ψ_f ψ_f (ῡ + X), but that doesn't make much sense dimensionally. Alternatively, perhaps the term is -λ f ψ̄_f (ῡ +
