Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. So, I've got a question about titrating acetic acid with NaOH, and I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that titration involves neutralizing an acid with a base, and that pH changes during this process. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem states that we diluted 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. So, I think I need to calculate the new concentration after dilution. Oh right, dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. So, the initial volume is 20 cm³, and we're adding another 20 cm³ of water. Wait, so the final volume is 40 cm³.

So, M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2. Plugging in the numbers: M2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me compute that: 0.05 * 20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So, the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. Let's handle each part separately.

Starting with the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So, the moles of acetic acid initially would be Molarity * Volume in liters. Let me calculate that. Wait, the diluted solution is 0.025 M in 40 cm³. So, moles of CH3COOH = 0.025 mol/L * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. 

Since it's a 1:1 reaction (acetic acid with NaOH), the moles of NaOH needed are also 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume required would be moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. Wait, but the question is about the pH at equivalence. Hmm, for weak acids and strong bases, the equivalence point is basic because the conjugate base is formed. So, after reaction, the solution has the acetate ion, which is the conjugate base of acetic acid. 

But wait, the solution at equivalence point would be a solution of sodium acetate. So, the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water. The pH can be found using the Kb of acetate. Since I know the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5, I can find Kb by Kw/Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10. 

The concentration of acet
