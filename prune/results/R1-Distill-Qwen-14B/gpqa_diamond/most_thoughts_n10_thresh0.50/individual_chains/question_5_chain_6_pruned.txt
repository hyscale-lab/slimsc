Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of eigenvectors and operators. Let's try to break it down.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz, each as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator P itself is a vector operator, right? So the operator would be P · n, where n is a unit vector in the x-z plane.

Wait, the direction n lies in the x-z plane, so its components are (nx, 0, nz) with nx² + nz² =1. Since it's arbitrary, maybe the eigenvector will involve some angles or something. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

The eigenvalue equation is (P · n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. So the eigenvector corresponds to eigenvalue +ħ/2. But wait, each component of P is a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write down each component.

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1,0], [0, -1]]

So the operator P · n is (n_x Px + n_z Pz), since the y-component is zero (because n is in x-z plane). Because the direction is in x-z, Py component can be ignored, right? So our operator is P = n_x Px + n_z Pz.

Wait, but what are n_x and n_z? Let me think. Since n is a direction in the x-z plane, it can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but since it's in x-z, maybe φ=0 or some other angle. Wait, no. Let me think in terms of polar coordinates. The direction n can be parameterized with an angle θ from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ cosφ, but since it's in
