Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so their reaction should form acetate ions and water.

The problem says we're diluting 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, let me think about the initial dilution. The volume doubles, so the concentration should halve. Oh right, because when you mix equal volumes, the new concentration is half. So the initial concentration after dilution will be 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but for the titration, I need to know the equivalence point. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid initially: volume (L) * concentration. So 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. Oh wait, wait. No, wait. Initial before dilution: 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, so 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. Then when we add 20 cm³ of water, the volume becomes 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So the concentration becomes 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Right.

So when titrating, the moles of NaOH needed to reach equivalence would be the same as moles of acetic acid. So moles of NaOH = 0.001 moles.

Wait, but the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³.

Wait but the question says to find the pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence point
