Okay, so I have this question about a rhombohedral crystal and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that in crystallography, the interplanar distance (d) is given by the formula derived from the structure factor. The main formula I think is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * cos(180 - theta) ) ), but wait, I might be mixing some terms here. Oh wait, no, for a rhombohedral crystal, all the lattice parameters a, b, c are equal, and the angles α, β, γ are all the same. So in this case, it's a rhombohedral system with a = b = c = 10 Angstroms, and each angle is 30 degrees.

Wait, no, I think the formula might be different. Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a} {\sqrt{ (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\alpha) } }

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and all angles are the same. So α = β = γ = 30°, right? So substituting, the denominator becomes:

h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cosγ + hl cosβ + kl cosα )

Since all the cosines are the same, that simplifies to:

h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos30 - 2hl cos30 - 2kl cos30.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me be more precise. The general formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral system is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) ( 1 + cos(alpha - beta) + cos(alpha - gamma) + ... ) ) } }

Wait, I think I'm mixing things up. Another approach: perhaps using the Miller indices and the unit cell parameters.

Wait,
