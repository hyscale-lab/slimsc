Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Let me try to think it through. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means they're spread out evenly in all directions. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh wait, right! The parallax of a star is the angle at which the star's position appears to shift when observed from two different points in Earth's orbit around the Sun. So the closer the star, the larger the parallax. Parallax is measured in parsecs, and the formula is distance (in parsecs) = 1 / parallax.

Wait, so if a star is at a distance d, its parallax plx is 1/d. So higher parallax means closer star. But the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So it's about the number density in the parallax space.

Hmm, let me think about the distribution. If stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means that their actual spatial density (number per volume) is constant. So in three-dimensional space, the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume. But when we observe them, their apparent distribution depends on their distances because more distant stars have smaller parallaxes.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of parallax, so it's like a histogram in parallax. So imagine you're counting stars in bins where each bin is a range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx. How does the count in each bin vary with plx?

Let me think about the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So as plx increases (stars are closer), d decreases. The volume of a spherical shell between d and d + dd is 4πd² dd. Oh, because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the volume of a thin shell is approximately 4πd² dd.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a volume is proportional to the volume. So the number of stars between d and d+dd is proportional to 4πd² dd. But d is 1/plx, so substituting that in:

Number of stars = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd) * (constant of proportionality).

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit parallax. So we need to express this in terms of plx. Let’s denote plx as p for simplicity. So p = 1/d => d = 1/p.

So the number of stars between p and p + dp (since dd is related to dp) would be proportional to 4π (1/p)^2 * (something involving dp). Wait, but how is dp related to dd? Because d = 1/p, so dd = - (1/p²) dp. So the negative comes from the derivative, but since we're considering small positive increments, I can ignore the sign for the magnitude.

So substituting, number of stars N is proportional to 4π (1/p)^2 * (1
