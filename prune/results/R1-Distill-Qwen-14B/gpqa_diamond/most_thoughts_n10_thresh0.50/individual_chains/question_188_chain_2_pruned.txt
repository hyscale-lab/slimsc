Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that a rhombohedral structure has all sides equal and all angles equal. So the unit cell is a rhombohedron. The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I think the formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by (a)/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + ... something with angles... )) But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Oh right, for a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But this is a rhombohedral system, which is not cubic. So the formula must be more complicated because the angles aren't 90 degrees. I remember that in such cases, the formula involves the angles between the lattice vectors. 

The general formula I think is d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos γ) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos α) ) ) multiplied by something. Wait, no, that might not be quite right. Alternatively, the interplanar distance formula for a general crystal system is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos γ) ) )

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think. In a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, so the lattice parameters a, b, c are all equal, and the angles between the edges are all equal (but not necessarily 90 degrees).

The Miller indices are (hkl), so for (111), h=1, k=1, l=1.

The formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is a bit different from cubic. I think it's:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos γ) +
