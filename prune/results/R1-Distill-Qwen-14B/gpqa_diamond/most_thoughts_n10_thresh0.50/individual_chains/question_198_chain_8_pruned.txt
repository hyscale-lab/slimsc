Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. The given data includes the concentrations of Co(II) and SCN⁻ ions, and the stability constants for the different complexes. 

So, first, I remember that stability constants (β) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex tends to form. The complexes here are Co(SCN)n²−, I think. The subscripts go from 1 to 4, so n=1 to 4.

The blue dithiocyanato complex is probably the one with two SCN⁻ ligands, so that's n=2. Wait, but wait, the question says 'dithiocyanato', which I think means two SCN⁻ ligands. So the complex we're interested in is [Co(SCN)₂]²−, which is the n=2 case.

But wait, the problem says "dithiocyanato" so maybe it's [Co(SCN)₂]^something. Not sure about the charge, but for the purpose of calculating the fraction, I think the charge won't matter as much as the stability constants.

The problem gives β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the stability increases up to β3 and then β4 is lower. So the most stable is the n=3 complex, but we're interested in the n=2 one.

I think the approach is to calculate the fraction of each species (n=0, 1, 2, 3, 4) present in the solution and then find the percentage contributed by the n=2 complex.

The general formula for the fraction of each complex is based on the stability constants and the concentrations. The formula for the fraction of the nth complex is (βn * [SCN]^n) divided by the sum over all m of (βm * [SCN]^m).

So the denominator is Sum_{m=0}^4 (βm * [SCN]^m). Wait, but wait: [Co] is given as 1e-2 M. Oh wait, because each complex has a certain number
