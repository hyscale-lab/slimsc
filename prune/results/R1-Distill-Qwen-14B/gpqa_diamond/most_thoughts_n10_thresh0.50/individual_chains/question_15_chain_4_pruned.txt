Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet is more likely to transit so the researchers should observe that one. Let me start by understanding the problem.

Both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a period three times shorter than Planet_2. Wait, so Planet_1 is closer to its star since it has a shorter orbital period. Oh right, because according to Kepler's third law, shorter period means closer orbit.

Also, the host stars have the same radii but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But wait, same radius? That's interesting. So the two stars are similar in size but different in mass.

Transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. The formula for the probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by something else... Wait, no, I think the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / a)^2 where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Or wait, maybe it's (R_p / R_*) / (a / R_*) ), squared? Or perhaps the probability is (R_p / a) * (something else).

Wait, I remember that the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_*)^2 multiplied by (something about the orbital distance). Or maybe it's the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis? Hmm. Let me think.
