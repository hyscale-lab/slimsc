Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to parse it and figure out what's going on. Okay, the question is about the intrinsic angular momentum operator, specifically the Y-component, denoted as A_y. The setup says that A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix.

The matrix S has its first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So I can write S as:

S = [ [0, -i],
      [i, 0] ]

And then A_y is c * S. So substituting c, that becomes (h/(4π)) * S. 

The question is asking about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. So I need to find the eigenvalues (a) and eigenvectors (φ) such that A_y φ = a φ.

Wait, but wait a second. Since A_y is a 2x2 matrix, it's a spin-½ system, probably for a muon, which is a lepton, so it has spin-½. So the eigenvalues of the spin components are ± ħ/2, but wait, in this case, A_y is expressed as c times S. Let me think about the structure here.

Wait, what's S here? Let me think. S is given as a matrix, so perhaps S is the Pauli matrix for the Y-component. Wait, Pauli matrices are usually denoted as σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Let me recall what σ_y is. Oh right, σ_y is:

[0, -i]
[i, 0]

Which matches the S matrix given here. So S is σ_y, the Pauli Y matrix. That makes sense.

So A_y = c * σ_y. And c is h/(4π). Hmm. So A_y = (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

Now, I'm to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix. Let's start with the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving det(A_y - a I) = 0.

Wait, but the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrix σ_y are ±1, right? Because Paul
