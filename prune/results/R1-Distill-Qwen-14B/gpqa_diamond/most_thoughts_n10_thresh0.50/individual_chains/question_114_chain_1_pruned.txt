Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) and NaCN in the presence of reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A to D, each giving possible reagents A and B. I need to figure out which combination is correct.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is a ketone. The reaction with NaCN suggests a nucleophilic substitution or addition. Wait, but ketones undergo nucleophilic addition typically, not substitution. So maybe this is a nucleophilic addition of cyanide.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding cyanide (CN-) would attack the carbonyl carbon. But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's write that structure.

The product has a CN group and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So it's (CH2CN)(CH2CH3)COH? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methyl
