Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that sounds a bit complex. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group attached at position 1, and there's also a carbaldehyde group (CHO) on the same carbon as the substituent. Wait, no, actually, looking again. The formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means the cyclohexane ring has a CHO group. Then, on the same carbon (position 1), there's a substituent which is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl.

Wait, maybe that's not the correct way. Alternatively, the structure could be a cyclohexane ring where one carbon (position 1) is attached to a CH2 group, which in turn is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. And on that same carbon (position 1), there's a CHO group. So, it's something like cyclohexane with a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)CH2 group? Or maybe more accurately, the carbon 1 has a CH2 group where one H is replaced by OH and another by cyclohexyl, and the same carbon also has a CHO.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the synthesis steps. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, that's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (Câ‰¡CCH2-) attached.

I need to get to a molecule that has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes a hydroxyl group, a cyclohexyl group, and a methyl group attached to the same carbon as an aldehyde. Hmm.

Let me think about possible reactions. Ethynylcyclohexane can undergo various additions. One possibility is the Markovnikov addition of something
