Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question states that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, which is 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r. The options are A) around r cubed, B) r^5, C) r^4, D) r squared.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star due to the Earth's movement around the Sun. The formula I think is that parallax (plx) in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by the distance (d) in parsecs. So plx = 1/d. That makes sense because the closer a star is, the larger its parallax (since it appears to move more in the sky).

Wait, so if plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So distance is inversely proportional to parallax. Got it.

The number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is inversely proportional to d, I can substitute plx with 1/d. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Because plx is (1/d), so replacing plx gives 1/( (1/d)^5 ).

Let me compute that. 1/( (1/d)^5 ) is the same as (d^5). Because (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, and the reciprocal of that is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So like, how does N change as we go from r to r+dr? Or perhaps it's about the number density as a function of distance.

Wait, another approach: If N varies as d^5, then for each increment in distance, the number increases by that factor. But wait, perhaps I should think in terms of differential. Like, how does N per unit volume or per unit distance change.

Wait, no. Let me think about the initial setup. The number of stars varies as 1/(plx
