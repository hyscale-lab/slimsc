Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let me try to think this through. Alright, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh, right, I remember that in stars, the excitation of atoms is related to the temperature. The higher the temperature, the more excited the atoms are because thermal energy is higher.

Wait, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, I see. So this energy difference is probably the ΔE that goes into the Boltzmann equation. Boltzmann factor relates the population of energy levels. The formula is something like N2/N1 = exp(-ΔE/(kT)), right? Where N2 is the number in the higher energy level, N1 in the lower. So in this case, for star_1, N1_1 / N1_2 is the ratio of populations. Wait, but the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So I think that means the population in the excited state is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. Or wait, let me read that again. Oh, it says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So if the energy levels are E1 and E2, with E2 being higher, then N2/N1 would be the ratio. So if star_1 has twice as many in E2 as star_2, then the ratio N2/N1 for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2.

Wait, let me clarify. Let's say for star_2, the ratio is R2 = N2_2 / N1_2. For star_1, it's R1 = N2_1 / N1_1. According to the question, R1 is twice R2. So R1 = 2 R2. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe it's that the excitation is twice as much, so the number in the excited state is twice as high. So for star_1, N2 = 2 * N2'. Where N2' is star_2's N2. Or wait, maybe it's that star_1 has twice the excitation; perhaps the ratio is 2 times
