Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read the problem carefully.

So, the question is about a wave function for particles in a tube along the x-axis. Each particle's wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. Then, when they measure the position of these particles, they're only found between x=1 and x=3. I need to find the value of 'a' from the given options.

Hmm, okay. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalized. That means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. Because the probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 100%.

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So that's a complex function. The absolute square of ψ would be ψ*ψ, where ψ* is the complex conjugate.

Let me write that down. The wave function ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the complex conjugate ψ*(x) would be (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i.

So the absolute square |ψ|² is ψ*ψ. Let me compute that.

Multiplying the two: [(a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i] * [(a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i]

Using the formula (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b². So this becomes [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) ]² - (0.5i)². 

Wait, but i squared is -1. So the second term is (0.5i)^2 = -0.25.

But wait, no, wait. Let me calculate it correctly. The second term is (0.5i)^2. So (0.5i)^2 is (0.5)^2 * i^2 = 0.25*(-1) = -0.25.

So putting it all together: |ψ|² = [ a² / (1+x) ] - ( -0.25 ) → because I have minus the
