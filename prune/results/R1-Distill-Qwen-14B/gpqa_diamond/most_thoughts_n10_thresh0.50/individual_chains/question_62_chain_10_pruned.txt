Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is asking.

The goal is to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to understand the target molecule. The name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a methyl group attached to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. Also, the cyclohexane ring has a carbaldehyde group (CHO) as a substituent.

Wait, maybe I should draw this out. But since I can't do that right now, I'll visualize it. So the main part is a cyclohexane ring. Attached to carbon 1 is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. And another substituent is a CHO group on the same ring.

So the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynyl is a triple bond between two carbons, so it's a cyclohexane ring with a CH2-C≡CH group attached? Or wait, ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡C-CH2- group? No, wait, ethynyl is the substituent, so probably it's a cyclohexane ring with a -C≡C-CH2- group attached. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. Ethynyl is -C≡CH, but the structure of ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a triple bond attached as a substituent. So it's cyclohexane- with a -C≡CH group attached.

So the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. The target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes another cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group attached to a methyl group. And there's also a CHO group.

So the plan is to convert the ethynyl group into something that can add the necessary substituents. Let's think about the steps required.

First, the triple bond in ethynylcyclohexane. One common reaction is to reduce it. But what's the end goal? The product has a cyclohexyl group attached, so maybe we need to introduce a ring-opening or a substitution.

Wait, another thought: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a methylene group (CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)). So perhaps we can perform a cyclopropanation or some kind of ring-opening, but that might not be the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond can be converted into a diol via some reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the ethynyl group can be converted into a ketone. Triple bonds can be reduced to carbonyls. For example, using a dihydrogenation or other reagents. Let me think about the possible reagents.

Option A: NaNH2 and
