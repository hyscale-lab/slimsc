Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Å, and the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm. I remember that in LTE, the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations (n1/n2) is proportional to exp(-(E2-E1)/(kT)). 

Wait, E here is the energy difference between the two levels. Since the transition wavelength is 1448 Å, which is in the near UV range, I can find the energy using E = hc/λ. 

So first, let's compute the energy difference. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1.448e-7 meters.

E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7)
Calculating that: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Divided by 1.448e-7 gives roughly 1.372e-18 J per photon.

But wait, I think it's more useful to express this energy in terms of temperature using k (Boltzmann's constant). Because the energy difference would relate to the temperature via E = k*T*Δ. 

Wait, the Boltzmann factor is exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So the ratio of the populations depends on the temperature. 

When the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K) compared to when it doesn't (6000 K). Since the spots are cooler, the overall temperature of the photosphere as observed is 5500 K. 

But wait, when spots cover 40% of the surface, the effective temperature drops. But the spots themselves are cooler than the surrounding, right? So the photosphere's temperature structure changes, but the question is about the observed effective temperature, which is lower when spots are present.

The ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So when T decreases, the exponent becomes less negative (since denominator is smaller), so exp becomes larger. So n1/n2 increases when T decreases.
