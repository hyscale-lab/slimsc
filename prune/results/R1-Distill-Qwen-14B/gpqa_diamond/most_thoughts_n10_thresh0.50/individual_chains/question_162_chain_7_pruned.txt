Okay, so I've got this question here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this looks like a 2-dimensional metric because it's only involving dx and dy. So the space is two-dimensional, right? But it's called a pseudosphere, which is a term I usually associate with hyperbolic geometry, like in the Poincaré disk model.

Wait, the Poincaré disk model has a metric like ds² = [4/(1 - x² - y²²)] (dx² + dy²), if I remember correctly. So the given metric is similar but scaled differently. Let me check: in the standard model, the denominator is (1 - r²) where r² = x² + y², right? So the given denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which is like 4 times (1 - (x² + y²)/4). So maybe this is a scaled version of the Poincaré disk.

But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere. I know that in the Poincaré disk model, the entire hyperbolic plane has infinite area, but a pseudosphere is a finite surface, isn't it? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? So perhaps it's a finite surface?

Wait, no. A pseudosphere is an infinite surface. Like the tractricoid, which is a surface with finite volume but infinite surface area. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Or maybe I should think about the metric and the area element.

To find the area, I need to compute the area element for the given metric. The area element in 2D is usually sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. But wait, in 2D, for a metric ds² = E dx² + 2F dx dy + G dy², the area element is sqrt(EG - F²) dx dy. But in this case, the metric is diagonal, so F is zero. So the area element becomes sqrt(EG) dx dy.

Looking at the given metric: ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx²
