Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled using both rotational and vibrational energy states. But wait, the question is about the fundamental state and the photon absorption to switch to the next state with the lowest energy. I'm a bit confused, but let me think through this.

The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. Oh wait, wait. In the quantum mechanical model, the ground state for both rotation and vibration is different. For a rigid rotor (which this is, since it's the rotation-vibration model), the ground state is when the rotational quantum number is zero, but for vibration, the ground state is the lowest vibrational level, right?

Wait, no. Wait, the question says the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model. Oh, right, the non-rigid rotor allows for bond stretching, so it's considering both rotation and vibration. Hmm, but the problem says it's in the fundamental state. Fundamental state usually refers to the lowest vibrational energy state with the lowest rotational state. So, the ground state is vibrational ground state and rotational ground state.

The molecule absorbs a photon and moves to the next state with the lowest possible energy. What's the next possible state? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Because in the quantum models, transitions can occur between states where either the vibrational or rotational quantum numbers change. But the lowest energy transition would be the one that requires the least energy.

Wait, the question specifies the next state
