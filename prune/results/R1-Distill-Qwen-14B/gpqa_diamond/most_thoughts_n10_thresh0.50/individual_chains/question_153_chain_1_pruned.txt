Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, producing an enolate intermediate. 

The question has three parts, reactions A, B, C, and I need to find out the products for each. Then match them with the given options.

Let's start with reaction A: dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH. 

So, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile here because it's a diethyl ester of malonic acid. It can act as a nucleophile in the Michael reaction. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the p-tolyl group on the 3rd carbon? Wait, wait. Wait, the formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-O-. So 3-position would be the end of the double bond. So it's CH2=CH-C-O-(p-tolyl?) No, wait. Wait, the structure of (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-O-(p-tolyl) methyl? Or is the acrylate group attached to the p-tolyl at the 3 position? Wait, maybe it's (E)-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-CO-OCH3? No, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think.

Wait, the correct structure for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C-(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Because the numbering would go from the ester group: the double bond is between C1 and C2, with the ester on C3. Or wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the positions. Maybe it's 3-p-tolyl substituent on the acrylate
