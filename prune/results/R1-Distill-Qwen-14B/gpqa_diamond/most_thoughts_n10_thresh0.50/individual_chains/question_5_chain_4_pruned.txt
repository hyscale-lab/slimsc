Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still trying to get a handle on eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Let me read the question again.

The problem says we need to calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. They give the components Px, Py, and Pz as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, right. So the operator P is a vector operator, probably the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. Oh wait, yeah, because the components look familiar. Let me jot down what each component is.

Px is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]. That's the sigma_x matrix. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is sigma_y. And Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is sigma_z.

Wait, so operator P is like a vector of these scaled Pauli matrices. So the operator along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh, right, the direction is in x-z plane, so the unit vector n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), perhaps? Or maybe (cosθ, 0, sinθ)? Wait, I think that when you have a direction in the x-z plane, the polar
