Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. When they react, they release a gas W, form a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. Also, the melting point of B is close to 277 K. There's another part about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analogs, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out what Substance X is. Since it's used in organic chemistry and reacts with something to form a precipitate and a gas, I'm thinking maybe it's something like a metal. Wait, but metals are often used in reagents. Oh, like maybe sodium or something similar. Wait, but sodium is Na, a metal.

The reaction produces a gas W whose molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So, the gas could be something like CO2? Wait, no, CO2 is C (6 protons) and O (8 each). Wait, no. Let me think. Another possibility is H2O, but H and O's protons and neutrons don't match. Wait, wait. The molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So for each atom in W, the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Let me think of possible molecules.

Wait, another thought: if W is a molecule with each atom having the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's see, maybe D2O? No, that's heavy water. Or maybe CH4? No, because C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons? No, carbon has 6 protons, and if it's a heavier isotope, maybe it's C-13, but wait, the problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope. So perhaps the gas W is something like NH3, but wait, N has 7 protons, and if it's an isotope with 7 neutrons (like N-14), but then W would have three H atoms, which are 1 proton each. So the molecule would have 7+1+1+1 = 10 protons and 7+1+1+1=10 neutrons (if N is N-14 and H is H-1). Wait, but H has 0 neutrons normally. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps W is something like O2? No, O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (like O-16). So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So that would satisfy the condition. Wait, but O2 is a diatomic molecule, so each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if it's O-16). So the whole molecule would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That would fit the description.

But I'm not sure. Another possibility: maybe the gas is H2. But H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so that doesn't match. What about CH3Cl? No, that's probably not. Wait, maybe the gas is CO? C has 6 protons, O has 8. So for each molecule, 6+8=14 protons, and 6+8=14 neutrons (if C is C-12 and O is O-16). Wait, but C-12 has 6 neutrons and O-16 has 8. So each atom's protons and neutrons: C (6,6), O (8,8). So each atom has same number of protons and neutrons. So CO would have 6+8 =14 protons and 6+8=14 neutrons. That fits the condition.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is N2? N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (if N-14). So N2 would have 14 of each. That also fits.

Wait, but the reaction produces a precipitate when X reacts with Y. Let me think about that. If X is sodium (Na), maybe Y is water (H2O). But sodium reacting with water would produce NaOH and H2 gas. Wait, but in that case, the precipitate wouldn't form because NaOH is soluble. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Wait, another approach: when X reacts with Y, it forms precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. B has a melting point close to 277 K. Let's calculate 277 K in Celsius: 277-273=4°C. So B's melting point is around 4°C. What compounds have a melting point near there?

Wait, I remember that ammonium nitrate has a melting point around
