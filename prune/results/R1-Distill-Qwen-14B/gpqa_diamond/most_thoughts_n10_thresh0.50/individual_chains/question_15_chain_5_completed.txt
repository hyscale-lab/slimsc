Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and the probability of them transiting. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and their orbital distances.

The question says both planets are Earth-like and have the same mass. But their orbital periods are different—Planet_1 has a shorter period, three times shorter than Planet_2. Oh wait, shorter period means it's closer to its star because orbital period relates to distance via Kepler's laws. Right, Kepler's third law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So Planet_1's period is P1 = P2/3. Let's think about that. If P1 = P2 /3, then (P1)^2 = (P2)^2 /9. So a1^3 would be (M_star) * (P1)^2 / (4π²), but since both are around different stars, the mass comes into play. Wait, the host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's star. So their semi-major axes would be different based on both their periods and the masses.

Wait, maybe I should get the ratio of their semi-major axes. Let me denote M1 as the mass of Planet_1's star (which is twice M2, so M1 = 2 M2). The period of Planet_1 is P1 = P2 /3.

Using Kepler's third law: (a1^3) / (M1) = ( (P1)^2 ) / (4 π²) * (G factors) but since the constant factors are the same for both, perhaps I can find the ratio a1/a2 in terms of P1, P2, M1, and M2.

Wait, Kepler's law in terms of period and semi-major axis is a³ = [G(M_star) P²]/(4π²). So for each planet:

a1³ = (G M1 P1²)/(4π²)
a2³ = (G M2 P2²)/(4π²)

So the ratio a1³/a2³ = (M1/M2) * (P1²/P2²)

We know M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = P2 /3.

So,

a1³/a2³ = (2 M2 / M2) * ( (P2²/9) / P2² ) 
= 2 * (1/9)
= 2/9

So a1³ = (2/9) a2³
Taking cube roots: a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3)
Hmm, let's compute that. 2/9 is approximately 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6, because 0.6^3 is 0.216. So a1 is roughly 0.6 a2.

But wait, maybe I should keep it symbolic for exactness.

So a1 = a2 * (2/(9))^(1/3) 

But perhaps I can relate a to the star's radius as well because the transit probability depends on the orbital distance relative to the star's radius.

Wait, the transit probability (P) is given by the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance. The formula is P ≈ (R_star / a)², but I'm not sure. Wait, I think the actual formula is something like (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, it's approximately R_star / a. And since the probability is the area of the star as seen from Earth divided by the area of the sphere the planet's orbit describes, which is (π R_star²) / (4 π a²) ) = (R_star / (2a))². So the probability is approximately (R*/(2a))², which is roughly R*²/(4 a²). So P ∝ (R* / a )².

Wait, but the exact formula is P = (R*/a)^2. Or maybe P = (R* + R_p)^2 / a^2, but since R_p << R*, it's approximately (R*/a)^2. Wait, no, I think the correct formula is (R*)/(a) multiplied by something else. Let me think again.

The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the planet's orbit. The area of the star is π R*². The area of the planet's orbit (the circle it's moving in) is 4 π a². So the probability is (π R*²) / (4 π a²) ) = R*²/(4 a²) = (R* / (2a))². So P = (R*/(2a))².

But in this problem, both host stars have the same radii. The question states that both host stars have the same radii. So R1 = R2 = R.

Wait, but the orbital periods are different, so a1 and a2 are different. So for each planet, the probability is (R/(2 a))². So P1 = (R/(2 a1))², P2 = (R/(2 a2))².

We need to find which planet has a higher P, which would mean higher (R/(2a))². So higher a makes lower P, so we want smaller a for a higher transit probability.

Wait, wait, no: because if a is small, R/(2a) is larger, so (R/(2a))² is larger. So the closer the planet is to the star, the higher the probability. So P is inversely proportional to a².

So which planet has a smaller a? Since a1 is shorter than a2 (as Planet_1 is closer), so P1 is larger than P2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

But wait, let me compute the ratio P1/P2.

P1 = (R/(2 a1))²

P2 = (R/(2 a2))²

So P1/P2 = (a2/a1)^2.

From earlier, we have a1 = a2 * (2/(9))^(1/3) )

So a2/a1 = (9/2)^(1/3) = cube root of (4.5) ≈ 1.6506.

So P1/P2 = (1.6506)^2 ≈ (2.724). So P1 is about 2.724 times P2.

Wait, that would mean that Planet_1 has a higher probability. So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1 because it's more likely to transit.

Wait, but let's go back. Did I make any miscalculations?

Wait, the ratio a1/a2 is (2/9)^(1/3). Let me compute that more accurately.

2/9 is approximately 0.2222. The cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606. So a1 is about 0.606 a2.

So a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

Wait, wait, no, if a1 = 0.606 a2, then a2 = a1 / 0.606 → approximately 1.65 a1. So a2 is longer.

So a1 is smaller, so a2 is larger. So P1 = (R/(2 a1))², P2 = (R/(2 a2))². Since a1 is smaller, P1 is larger.

So P1/P2 = (a2/a1)^2. a2/a1 is 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65. So square is about 2.72. So P1 is about 2.7 times higher than P2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher, so they would prefer to observe Planet_1. So the correct answer is either C or D.

Wait the options are:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability.

Hmm, according to my calculation, P1 is about 2.7 times higher. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but why did I think that a1/a2 is (2/9)^(1/3)? Let me double-check the earlier steps.

We have a1³/a2³ = (M1 / M2) * (P1² / P2² )

M1 is 2 M2, so M1/M2 = 2. P1 is P2/3, so P1² = P2²/9.

Thus, a1³/a2³ = 2 * (1/9) = 2/9.

So a1³ = (2/9) a2³ → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

So a1 is smaller than a2.

Thus, P1 (probability) is (R/(2a1))², and P2 is (R/(2a2))².

So P1/P2 = (a2/(a1))² = (1/( (2/9)^(1/3) ))^2 = (9/2)^(2/3).

Because (a2/a1) = 1/(a1/a2) = 1/( (2/9)^(1/3) ) = (9/2)^(1/3).

So (9/2)^(2/3) = ( (9/2)^(1/3) )².

What's 9/2? 4.5.

So 4.5^(1/3) is approximately 1.6506. Squared, that's about (1.6506)^2 ≈ 2.724.

So P1 is about 2.72 times higher than P2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability, and the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1. So the correct option is D.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability \( P \) is proportional to \( \left(\frac{R_*}{a}\right)^2 \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the orbital distance of the planet. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends on the orbital distance \( a \): the smaller \( a \), the higher the transit probability.

### Step 1: Orbital Distance Ratio
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the mass of the host star \( M_* \) by:

\[
a^3 \propto \frac{M_* P^2}{4\pi^2}
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) (Planet_1's host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's host star).
- \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's).

The ratio of their semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_1}{M_2} \cdot \frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \) is smaller than \( a_2 \), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its host star.

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is proportional to \( \left(\frac{R_*}{a}\right)^2 \). Since both stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability ratio is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2
\]

From earlier, \( \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65 \). Squaring this:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = 1.65^2 \approx 2.72
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since Planet_1 has a significantly higher transit probability, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.
