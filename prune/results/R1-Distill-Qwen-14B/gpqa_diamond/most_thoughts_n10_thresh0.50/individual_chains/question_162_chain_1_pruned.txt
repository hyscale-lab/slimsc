Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

Alright, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. It reminds me of metrics in general relativity, or maybe some kind of geometry with a specific curvature.

Wait, so the question is about the area of a pseudosphere. A pseudosphere is like a surface with constant negative curvature, right? I remember something about the area of a pseudosphere—oh wait, isn't it that as the radius approaches a certain limit, the area can become infinite? Or maybe it's something else.

Let me think about the metric. It's in two dimensions because it's written in terms of x and y. The general form of a metric in 2D can be expressed as ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²). So in this case, the function g(x,y) is 32/(4 - x² - y²). 

I think this metric might be representing a space with negative curvature because the denominator (4 - x² - y²) suggests that when x² + y² approaches 4, the metric blows up. That would mean the curvature is getting stronger as you approach that radius. Wait, the radius is 2 here because 4 is 2 squared. Oh, so maybe this is a metric for a pseudosphere with radius 2.

So the area of a pseudosphere, I think, is related to the Gaussian curvature. The formula for the area of a surface with constant curvature K is something like Area = (2π r²) / sqrt(-K), but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, wait, for a pseudosphere (which has negative curvature), the area is actually infinite. Because the Gaussian curvature is negative, the surface extends infinitely, kind of like a horn. So even though it's a finite radius, the total area is unbounded. 

Wait, but wait—what's the formula again. Let me recall. For a sphere with positive curvature, the area is 4π r². But for a pseudosphere (negative curvature, K = -1/r²), the area is something different. Oh right, the area of a pseudosphere is (2π r²) / something. No, wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe the area is (2π r^2
