Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Hmm, okay, let me think through it step by step.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh, wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that for the movementâ€”just the electric potential energy.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The thirteenth charge is fixed at P. So I guess I need to find the minimum energy of the system. Minimum energy usually refers to the potential energy when the system is in its most stable configuration, which is when the charges are as close as possible. But wait, in this case, the twelve are fixed at 2 meters away, so maybe their positions are fixed relative to point P.

Wait, no, the twelve are at 2 meters from point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the system's potential energy is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

So each of the twelve charges at 2 meters contributes to the potential energy. The 13th charge is fixed, so it's at P. So, each charge at 2 meters is interacting with the 13th charge, and also with each other.

Wait, right. So the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies between each pair. Since
