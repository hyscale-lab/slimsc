Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's going on.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It's heated with excess KOH, which probably causes some kind of elimination reaction, maybe dehydrohalogenation. The product is a light yellow solid product 1. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which I remember is around the range for carbonyl groups, so that suggests maybe a ketone or ester or something like that. But wait, KOH is a strong base, so elimination would make sense here. Since it's dibromine on adamantane, which is a diamondoid structure, heating with KOH likely leads to the formation of an epoxide? Or wait, no, more likely, since each Br is on adjacent carbons, perhaps the elimination forms an alkene.

Wait, no. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms on positions 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. When KOH is used, it's a base and a good nucleophile. But in such a structure, heating with KOH would likely cause an E2 elimination. So each Br is on adjacent carbons? Wait, no. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantaneâ€”so if it's a diamondoid structure, maybe each Br is on
