Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass attached to a spring oscillates. But this is a relativistic version, which probably means we have to consider special relativity effects. Oh right, because at high speeds, Newtonian mechanics don't hold anymore.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are given, so I need to figure out which formula is correct.

Let me think. In a classical harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement (amplitude A) is converted into kinetic energy at the equilibrium point. But since this is relativistic, the kinetic energy formula is different. In relativity, the total energy is gamma mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, I'm not sure if that's the approach here or if there's another way.

Wait, the problem states that it's a 1-dimensional oscillator obeying Hooke's law F = -kx. So the potential energy is (1/2)k x². But since the mass is moving relativistically, I can't use the classical approach directly.

In the classical case, the total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum displacement, all energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic. So E = (1/2)k A² = (1/2) m v_max². Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(k A² / m). Oh wait, that's option C. But wait, that's the classical non-relativistic case. Since this is a relativistic problem, that must not be the correct answer.

So I need to think about relativistic energy. The total energy should be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, in SHM (simple harmonic motion), the energy oscillates between kinetic and potential. But in the relativistic case, maybe the total energy isn't constant? Hmm, no, wait, actually, in a conservative system, energy should still be conserved, but the expressions for kinetic energy change.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to use the relativistic version of the harmonic oscillator's energy equations.

Wait, so the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy. At the maximum displacement A, the oscillator is momentarily at rest (so kinetic energy is zero), and all the energy is potential. So E = mc² + (1/2)k A². But wait, in the classical case, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², but in relativistic case, is it the same? I think the potential energy is still (1/2)k x² because the potential comes from the spring force, which is F = -kx, same as before.

But when the mass is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic. So the total energy E at x=0 is the kinetic energy plus the rest energy. Wait, no, the total energy should be the same at all points. So when the mass is at x=0, the kinetic energy is maximum, and the potential is zero. So E = K + U.

Wait, no, in the classical case, E is (
