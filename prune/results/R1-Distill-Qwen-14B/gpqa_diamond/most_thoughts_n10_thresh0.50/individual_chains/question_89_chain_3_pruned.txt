Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reaction mechanisms, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's pretty rigid. The molecule has two bromine atoms on the first and third positions. Now, when it's heated with excess KOH, what happens? Oh wait, KOH is a strong base, and with vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalo), it usually does an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. But here, it's 1,3-dibromo, which are not adjacent. So maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation across two carbons? Wait, no, elimination requires adjacent leaving groups. Oh wait, no, maybe it's an E2 mechanism but the positions are such that when the two Br leave, they form a double bond between carbons 1 and 3? Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a substitution reaction, but with two bromides, maybe it's a double elimination.

Wait, another possibility: heating with KOH, which is a strong base, could lead to the formation of an epoxide. No, because epoxides typically come from dihalides via an SN2 mechanism, but that's when the two leaving groups are adjacent. So in this case, the product is 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid, and the NMR shows specific peaks.

Looking at the NMR data: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR has a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is indicative of an ester or maybe a ketone? Wait, esters have strong absorption around 1720-1740 cm^-1 due to the carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe a ketone is around 1700. So if it's an ester, that would imply an ester group is formed.

Wait, but when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps it's a double elimination. Wait, but elimination would form a diene, but then why the
