Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that crystals have different structures, and rhombohedral is one of them. The question is asking about the interplanar distance of a (111) plane. 

Wait, interplanar distance... I think that's the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. Oh right, it's calculated using the formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. But wait, the formula might differ based on the type of crystal system.

The crystal is rhombohedral, which I believe is a type of hexagonal crystal system, but maybe it's a separate category. Oh wait, no, rhombohedral is a subset of cubic, but with all edges equal and all angles equal but not 90 degrees. So it's like a cube that's been skewed, perhaps. The interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each. 

Wait, the formula for interplanar distance d is given by d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α' + 2hl cos β' + 2kl cos γ' ), where a is the lattice parameter, and hkl are the Miller indices. Oh wait, no, I think the formula is adjusted based on the structure. Alternatively, for a general hexagonal or rhombohedral system, maybe it's d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) -
