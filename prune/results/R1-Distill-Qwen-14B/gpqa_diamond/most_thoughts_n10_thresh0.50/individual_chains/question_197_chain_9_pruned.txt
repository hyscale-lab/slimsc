Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down.

The question is about a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the product from the options given.

First, I should look at the spectroscopic data provided for compound X to determine its structure. The IR and NMR data are given, so I'll start with those.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad region that usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But since there's no mention of amines, I'm thinking it's an O-H group. Next, a strong peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Then, peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those are around the ranges for aromatic C=C stretches. So putting that together, the compound probably has an aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and an O-H group. Maybe a carboxylic acid because the O-H would be strong and the carbonyl is present. Alternatively, maybe an ester or ketone, but the IR also shows O-H, which is more indicative of a carboxylic acid.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a very downfield shift, which is typical for an aldehyde proton. Wait, no, wait. Aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm, but a carboxylic acid proton would be around 10-12 ppm. But this is a broad signal (bs), which is more like an O-H proton. For a carboxylic acid, the O-H is usually broad and around 10-12 ppm. So this might be a COOH group. But wait, if the IR shows a peak around 1720, that's more like an ester or possibly a ketone. Wait, but a carboxylic acid's carbonyl is around 1700 cm-1. Oh, but in the IR, the 1720 is a bit higher, which is more like an ester. Hmm, maybe it's an ester then? Or perhaps an acid
