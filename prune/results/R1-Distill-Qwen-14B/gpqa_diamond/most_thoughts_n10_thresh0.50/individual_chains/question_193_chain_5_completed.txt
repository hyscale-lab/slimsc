Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's read it carefully. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5). And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are various powers of r, like r cubed, r fifth, etc.

Hmm, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if distance increases, parallax decreases. The formula I think is that plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So, plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs.

So if plx is 1/r, then plx^5 would be (1/r)^5, which is 1/r^5. So 1/(plx^5) would be 1 divided by (1/r^5), which is r^5. Because 1/(1/r^5) is r^5.

Wait, let me think again. If N is proportional to 1/(plx^5), and plx is 1/r, substituting that in gives N proportional to 1/( (1/r)^5 ) = r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So, if N is proportional to r^5, then for each additional unit of r, the number increases by r^5. But that's the total. The question is about the change per unit range. So, maybe we need to think about the derivative of N with respect to r.

Wait, no. Because the number of stars per unit range would be the density. Or maybe the question is about the number of stars in a thin shell at radius r. So, the number in a thin shell would be proportional to the surface area times the thickness (which is dr), but that's for a volume. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's the number per unit volume.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think in terms of proportionality. The number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5). Since plx is 1/r, substituting gives N proportional to r^5. So as r increases, N increases as r^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance. So per unit range, the number of stars increases by r^5.

Wait, but let me make sure. So the question is, the number of stars varies with 1/(plx^5). So what is the number as a function of r? Parallax is 1/r, so 1/(plax^5)= r^5. So N = k * r^5, where k is a constant of proportionality.

But how does the number change with distance? Like, if you move a little bit further (a small change in r), how much does N change? That would be the derivative dN/dr. So dN/dr would be 5k r^4. So the change per unit distance is proportional to r^4. But wait, the options are about the number changing as a function of r, not the derivative. Hmm, perhaps I got the question wrong.

Wait, let's read the question again. It says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So maybe it's asking about the number per unit distance, so the density along the line of sight.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me think about it in terms of integration. The total number of stars in a region up to a distance r. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the number of stars per unit volume. Wait, but in astronomy, when you count stars in a certain region of the sky, you're looking along the line of sight. So the number you see depends on the density of stars along that line and the path length (distance). So if the density of stars is uniform (n stars per cubic parsec), then the number you observe would be n * (volume along the line of sight) = n * π r^2 * dr, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. It's given that N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/r, N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars increases with r^5. So the change per unit distance would be the derivative, which is 5r^4. But wait, the question is phrased as the number of stars changes with distance. So perhaps it's asking for the dependence as a function of r. So the number of stars is proportional to r^5, which is option B.

Wait, but the options are in terms of how the number changes with distance. So if the number is proportional to r^5, then the change in number with distance is proportional to r^4, because dN/dr would be the rate of change. But the question says, "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So is it the rate of change, which is the derivative, or just the dependence.

Wait, the wording says "how does the number ... change with distance". So if the number is proportional to r^5, then the number increases with r^5. So as r increases by a certain amount, the number increases by that amount multiplied by r^5. So the change in number is proportional to r^5. But perhaps it's the rate, the derivative. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the question is a bit ambiguous. Let's think of it this way. If N = k r^5, then the number of stars increases as r^5. So the change in N with distance is proportional to r^5. So the number is proportional to r^5, which would be option B.

Wait, but when you're asked how the number changes with distance, perhaps they are asking about the derivative, the slope. So dN/dr = 5k r^4, which would be r^4. So the change per unit distance is proportional to r^4, which would be option C.

But I'm not entirely sure which way the question is phrased. Let me re-read the question. The question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So per unit range of r, which would be the derivative.

So, if N = k r^5, then dN/dr = 5k r^4. So per unit change in r, the number changes by 5k r^4. So the change is proportional to r^4.

But looking at the options, option C is ~ r^4.

Wait, but another approach: If the number of stars per unit volume is n, then the number in a volume element dV is n dV. For a spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr, the volume is 4π r^2 dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be N_shell = n * 4π r^2 dr. But that's if the density is uniform, and we're considering all space up to r.

But wait, the question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So maybe N is the total number of stars observed up to a certain distance r. So as r increases, N increases as r^5. So the change in N with r is proportional to r^5. But the question is about the change per unit range, which would be the derivative, which is 5 r^4. So the correct option would be C, r^4.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting interpretations. The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx^5). Since plx = 1/r, this becomes N ∝ r^5. So N = kr^5. Now, the question is, how does the number change with distance. So when you increase r by a small amount dr, the change in N is dN = 5k r^4 dr. So per unit dr, dN is proportional to r^4.

So the change in number is proportional to r^4, which is option C. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The question asks, how does the number of stars change with distance. So, if the number is N(r) = kr^5, then N depends on r^5. So per unit distance, the change is dN/dr =5 kr^4.

So the change in number per unit distance is proportional to r^4.

So the correct answer would be option C, ~r^4.


The problem states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), with \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting this into the given relationship, we find \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the total number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance "per unit range of distance, \( r \)." To determine this, we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which represents the rate of change of the number of stars with distance. Taking the derivative of \( N = kr^5 \), we find:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} = 5kr^4
\]

This shows that the change in the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( r^4 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
