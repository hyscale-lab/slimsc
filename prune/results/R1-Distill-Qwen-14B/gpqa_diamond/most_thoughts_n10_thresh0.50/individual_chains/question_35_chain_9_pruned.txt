Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The question says that Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator represented as c·S. The constant c is h/(4π), right? And S has a specific form: the first row is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). I remember that matrices like this often come up in angular momentum operators, especially in spin systems. Since the muon is a spin-1/2 particle, the spin matrices should be the Pauli matrices.

Wait, so the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. The given S matrix looks familiar. Let me write it out:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Hmm, wait, that's actually the form of the σy Pauli matrix multiplied by i, isn't it? Because the standard σy is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. Oh wait, no—wait, σy is actually [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is the same as σy. So S is the Pauli y matrix.

Wait, but in the problem, Ay = c * S. So c is h/(4π), and S is σy. So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

I'm supposed to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Let me recall how to find eigenvalues. The eigenvalues a satisfy the equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So, let's compute Ay. Since S is σy, we can write Ay as (h/(4π)) times that matrix. So:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So the matrix Ay is:

[ [0, -(i h)/(4π) ],
  [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ] ]

The eigenvalues of a matrix like this (which is proportional to σy) should be ± (h/(4π)) times the eigenvalue of σy. But wait, what are the eigenvalues of σy? Let's think. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So σy has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Therefore, Ay should have eigenvalues (h/(4π)) * (+1) and (h/(4π)) * (-1). So the eigenvalues would be a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait a second—no, because the Pauli matrices are 2x2 and their eigenvalues are ±1. So when we compute Ay = c σy, the eigenvalues of Ay are c * (±1), so ±c. Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π).

So looking at the options, let's see. Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues should be real scalars, not complex. So option A is incorrect because the eigenvalues of Ay should be real, not imaginary.

Option B
