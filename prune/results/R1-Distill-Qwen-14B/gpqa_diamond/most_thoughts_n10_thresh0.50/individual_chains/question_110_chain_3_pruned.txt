Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO and HIRES. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that the brightness of a star as seen from Earth is crucial. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, meaning apparent V magnitude ≤17. HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so apparent V ≤16. So a star has to be within both of these limits to be detected by both spectrographs.

Now, looking at each star:

Star1: Absolute magnitude 15.5, distance 10 pc. Wait, I think absolute magnitude is how bright it would appear at 10 pc. Since it's at 10 pc, its apparent magnitude would be the same as absolute, 15.5. That's within both ESPRESSO (17 mag) and HIRES (16 mag) limits. So Star1 can be detected by both.

Star2: Apparent V is 16.5 mag. That's brighter than 16.5, right? Wait, wait. Wait, HIRES can go up to 16.0 mag, so anything brighter (lower number) than 16 is okay. So 16.5 is actually fainter than 16.0, meaning it can't be detected by HIRES. Because HIRES can't go beyond 16. So Star2 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, which goes up to 17. So Star2 isn't detected by both.

Star3: Apparent V is 15.5 mag. But wait, there's extinction (E(B-V) = 0.6 mag). The question explains that total absorption in V is 3.1 times E(B-V). So extinction A_V = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. So the actual apparent magnitude would be: what's the observed apparent magnitude? Because the star's light is dimmed by dust. So the observed apparent V is 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36
