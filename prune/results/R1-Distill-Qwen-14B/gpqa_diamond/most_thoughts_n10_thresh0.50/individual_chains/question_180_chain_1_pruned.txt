Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, okay, the question is about finding the minimum energy of an isolated system of charges. Let's see.

So, the setup: there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. And they're saying all of them have negligible mass, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. It's just about their potential energy, I think.

The problem says that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P is where one charge is, and the other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So, point P is the location of one charge, and the other 12 are points on a sphere of radius 2 m around P?

Wait, but the system is isolated, so all interactions between the charges contribute to the potential energy. I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. But since all the charges are identical, the calculation should be symmetric.

So, I need to compute the potential energy of the entire system. But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P, so maybe only the other 12 are being moved into place. Or do I have to consider all interactions?

Wait,
