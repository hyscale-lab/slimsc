Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

First, let's break down each piece of data given.

The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad peak because of hydrogen bonding, right? Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol. But another possibility is an amine, but I don't see any N in the formula options, so probably not.

Then, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm. The 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or maybe an acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower. That could be an conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester. Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl like in a carboxylic acid? Wait, but the acid would have a broad peak around 2500-3300, but the broad peak here is at 3000, which is more like an alcohol.

Wait, the 1700 cm^-1 is a strong peak, so that's probably a carbonyl. The 1650 might be an aromatic ring with conjugation, like C=C (but those usually come around 1600-1650). But the presence of both 1700 and 1650 suggests maybe a conjugated carbonyl group, or perhaps two different types of carbonyl groups? Alternatively, maybe the 1700 is an ester or ketone, and the 1650 is another group, like an aromatic
