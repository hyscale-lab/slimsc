Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me think about what that might mean. The molecular formula can sometimes hint at the structure, especially if I look at the degrees of unsaturation. 

Degrees of unsaturation calculation: Each degree is a ring or a double bond. For C8H9NO, the formula is C8H9NO. Let me see, the general formula for a saturated compound is CnH2n+2OxN. Wait, the formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2n + 2 - X)/2, where X is the sum of hydrogen, halogens, etc. But in this case, N is present. Hmm, maybe I should adjust for that. Alternatively, I can calculate it using the formula DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, I'm a bit confused, let me think again. Oh right, the formula is DoU = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2, where X is the number of halogens. Here, X is zero, so it's (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2? Wait, wait, because N is treated as a heteroatom. Let me recheck. Oh right, for each N, it's as if it contributes an extra hydrogen, so DoU = (2C +2 - H + N - X)/2. So plugging in the numbers: C=8, H=9, N=1, X=0. 

So (2*8 + 2 -9 +1)/2 = (16 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2 = 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Five could be two rings and one double bond, or one ring and three double bonds, etc. But looking at the NMR data might give more clues.

The 1H NMR data is as follows: 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H). Hmm. Let me think about each peak. 

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet. That's a high chemical shift, so probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aldehyde group in the molecule. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, so maybe it's adjacent to a CH2 group. 

Next, the 6.98 ppm is a doublet of 2H. That's in the aromatic region. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. So perhaps two protons on a benzene ring that's para-substituted? Or maybe ortho. Also, the 6.51 ppm is another doublet of 2H. So maybe a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, but both doublets could be from two separate aromatic systems. Alternatively,
