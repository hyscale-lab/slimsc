Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. So this ρ is a mixture of the states |0⟩ and |1⟩, each with equal probability since the coefficients are both 1/2.

Wait, I think that when you have a density matrix like this, it's a diagonal matrix. Let me write it out. The standard basis states for a qubit are |0⟩ and |1⟩, which are represented as 2x2 matrices when you compute the outer products. So |0⟩⟨0| would be a matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is a matrix with 1 in the bottom-right corner and 0 elsewhere.

So when I add these two matrices, I get [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then ρ is (1/2) times the identity matrix. So ρ equals (1/2) I.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position of this density matrix in qubit space. I'm a bit confused about what that means exactly. Wait, I remember that for a single qubit, the space of density matrices is 4-dimensional, but there's a way to represent them in the Bloch sphere, which is a 3-dimensional representation.

The Bloch sphere represents qubit states, and any density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector r. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space with components (x, y, z). Each component corresponds to one of the Pauli matrices: σ_x, σ_y, σ_z.

So, let's see. My ρ is (I)/2. Let me write that as (I + 0·I)/2. Hmm, wait, because (I + 0·σ)/2 would be (I + 0)/2 = I/2, which matches our ρ. So that implies that the vector r is (0,0,0). Because the coefficients for σ_x, σ_y, and σ_z are all zero.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. The Bloch vector r is given by 2 times (ρ - I/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices. Or, more accurately, ρ can be written as (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. So for ρ = I/2, this would mean that the coefficients r_x, r_y, and r_z are all zero. So the vector r is at the origin.

Looking back at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So that's probably the correct answer.

Alternatively, I can think about what this state represents. Since ρ is a completely mixed state
