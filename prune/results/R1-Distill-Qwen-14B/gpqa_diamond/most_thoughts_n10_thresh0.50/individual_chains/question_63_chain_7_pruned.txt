Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule switching energy states when a photon is absorbed. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

First, the question is about a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. They mention using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. Oh wait, wait—no, wait. The non-rigid rotor model is also called the rotational-vibrational coupling model, right? So I guess the molecule's energy levels are a combination of rotation and vibration.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. Wait, fundamental state—oh, right, that's the lowest energy state. So it's the ground state. Now, the question is about what momentum a photon should have so that the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state. Oh, wait, the next state with the lowest possible energy. So that must be the next higher energy state, the first excited state.

So, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized. The energy levels depend on both the vibrational and rotational states. The fundamental state is when both the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers are at their lowest. So, the vibrational quantum number ν is 0 (ground state), and the rotational quantum number J is 0 (ground state for rotation as well).

If the molecule absorbs a photon, it will transition to the next higher energy state. But what's the next state? Well, the energy levels in the rotational-vibrational model can be increased by either changing the vibrational state (ν increases by 1) or the rotational state (J increases by 1). But the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one with the smallest increase in energy. So which transition gives the lower energy photon?

Wait, but in the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator approximation, the energy levels are quantized. The total energy is E = E_vibrational + E_rotational. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_v = (ν + 1/2) ħω, and rotational by E_r = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

But the non-rigid rotor model... Hmm, maybe that's a bit more complex. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply considering the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator model.

If the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational state (ν=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=
