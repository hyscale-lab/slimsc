Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is with another reagent B (and H2O) to convert 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile into 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that in organic chemistry, when you have a ketone reacting with a cyanide source, it's typically a nucleophilic addition. But wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So adding NaCN would probably be a cyanide ion acting as a nucleophile. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN-.

Wait, but adding NaCN to a ketone usually leads to a substitution. Oh, right! The formation of a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with a cyanide to form a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached. So the general reaction is R2CO + CN- â†’ R2C(OH)CN.

But wait, how does that work? The mechanism involves the ketone attacking the cyanide. The ketone's carbonyl oxygen is a good leaving group? Or wait, in the presence of an acid catalyst, right? Because the formation of the cyanohydrin usually requires an acid as a catalyst.

Wait, let me think. The reaction of a ketone with a cyanide ion in acidic conditions. So, the acid (like H3O+) would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen would pick up a proton, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin.

So, in the first reaction, the reagent A is probably H3O+ because that's the acid catalyst needed for the cyanohydrin formation. So that narrows down the options. Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3.

Wait, but what about the second reaction? The second reagent B is used
