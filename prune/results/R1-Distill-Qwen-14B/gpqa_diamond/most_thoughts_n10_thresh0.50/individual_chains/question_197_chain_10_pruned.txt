Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of a nitrile group. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, when a nitrile is treated with HI in the presence of red phosphorus, it undergoes hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid. Or wait, is it the other way around? Hmm, maybe I should think about the reagents. Red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. So if Compound X has a nitrile group, then the product would be a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the IR and NMR data for Compound X. Let me analyze them.

Starting with the IR data: The IR shows peaks around 3400-2500 cm-1. That's a broad region, usually indicative of O-H or N-H stretches. But more likely, O-H for a carboxylic acid or alcohol. Wait, but if it's reacting with HI, maybe it's a nitrile. Wait, maybe the IR peaks can tell me more.

Wait, another peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Also, the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So there's definitely an aromatic ring in the compound.

Now the 1H NMR data. Let's list them:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet. That's probably an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, in a carboxylic acid, the OH is usually broad and around 10-12 ppm. So maybe the compound has a carboxylic acid group?

Wait, but if the IR has a peak at 1720, which could be a carboxylic acid (but carboxylic acids usually have higher C=O around 1700). Wait, maybe it's an ester. Esters have C=O around 1720-1740. So maybe it's an ester group.

Alternatively, if it's a ketone, the C=O is around 1700-1750. So the peak at 1720 could fit that.

Looking at the NMR shifts:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Possibly an -OH proton.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Aromatic protons, perhaps para-substituted. So maybe a para-substituted benzene ring.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Also aromatic, possibly another doublet. So perhaps two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents in the para positions, but that
