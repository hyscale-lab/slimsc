Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the minimum energy of a system of charges. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's going on.

Alright, the setup is: there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. 12 of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. And we need to find the minimum energy of this system.

Hmm, so wait, 12 charges are fixed at 2m from P, and the 13th is at P. I think this means that the 13th is the one fixed, so it's stationary. So the 12 charges are each located on a sphere of radius 2 meters around point P, where the 13th charge is.

But wait, the question says "isolated system," so I'm thinking about electric potential energy here. Because in an isolated system, the potential energy is a key factor, and we're looking for the minimum energy.

The particles have charge 2e each, so each has twice the elementary charge. The elementary charge e is about 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2 * 1.602e-19 = 3.204e-19 C.

Now, I remember that the electric potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: U = (k * q1 * q2) / r. But when there are multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

Wait, but in this case, the charge at P is fixed, so maybe we need to calculate the potential energy of each of the 12 charges with the fixed one, plus the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P. So each of them is at a distance of 2m from the fixed charge. So the potential energy between each of the 12 and the fixed charge is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m). There are 12 such charges, so that's 12 * [ (k*(2e)^2)/(2) ].

But wait, the 12
