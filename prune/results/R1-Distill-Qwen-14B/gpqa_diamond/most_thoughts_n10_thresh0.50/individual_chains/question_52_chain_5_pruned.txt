Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question involves the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Ã…, and the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm, okay, so I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation or something related to the distribution of atoms in energy levels. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. The formula I remember is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff decreases. So during normal times, Teff is 6000 K, and when spots are present, it's 5500 K. But wait, the spots themselves are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, right? So when spots are present, the average temperature of the entire photosphere is lower. But the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered. So the effective temperature is an average of the spotted and unspotted regions.

Wait, but how does that affect the photospheric conditions? Well, the photosphere's overall temperature is lower when spots are present. So when the spots are there, the effective temperature of the entire star is 5500 K. So the average conditions in the
