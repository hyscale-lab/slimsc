Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this.

The question is asking which theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization again? I remember it's a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergent integrals. These are problems where the calculations give infinite results, which are physically meaningless. So regularization introduces a temporary momentum cutoff or some other method to make the integrals finite, and then we remove the cutoff with renormalization.

Now, which theories require regularization? Let's go through each option.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, that's the non-quantum version, right? So in classical theories, we don't have these divergent loop integrals because they don't involve quantum processes. So classical E&M doesn't need regularization because those infinities come up in quantum theories when you calculate, say, the self-energy of electrons or photon loops.

Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is option C. Oh, right! QED definitely requires regularization. Because when you calculate things like the electron self-energy or the vacuum polarization, you get these divergent terms. You need to regularize them before you can renormalize. That's why QED uses methods like the Pauli-Villars regularization or dimensional regularization.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is option B. QCD deals with the strong force, and it's a non-abelian gauge theory. It does have issues with divergences, so regularization is needed as well. Although I think asymptotic freedom might make things a bit easier in certain energy regimes, but overall, you still need to handle divergences.

Superstring Theory, option A. Superstring theory is a quantum theory that attempts to unify all forces, including gravity. I remember that in string theory, the concept of regularization is different. Instead of using a cutoff like in QFT, string theory uses the string length as a natural regulator. Because strings have a minimum size (related to the string length parameter), this might prevent the same kind of divergences that occur in point-particle theories. So in string theory, you don't need to add an ad hoc regularization scheme because the theory's structure handles the divergences inherently.

Wait, but wait a minute. Does string theory avoid diverg
