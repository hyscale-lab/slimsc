Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish between these two energy levels. The options are A to D.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I remember something about the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time is at least ħ/2. Or was it ħ? Let me think. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. Or maybe I'm mixing this up with something else. Oh, no, wait, I think it's ħ over two, but sometimes people use the approximation without the ½ factor. Hmm.

So the idea is that the shorter the lifetime (Δt) of a state, the less precisely we can know its energy. Because a shorter Δt implies a larger uncertainty ΔE, right? So the energy difference between the two states needs to be larger than the uncertainty for them to be distinguishable. Otherwise, their energies would overlap, making it hard to tell them apart.

Wait, but in this problem, each state has its own lifetime. Oh, wait no, wait. The two states have different lifetimes. So perhaps each state has a certain uncertainty in energy. But we're looking for the energy difference between E2 and E1, let's say ΔE = E2 - E1. We need this ΔE to be such that it's larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state, so that they can be resolved.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Each state has a certain lifetime, which relates to the uncertainty in their energy. The uncertainty in energy for each state is given by ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt), where Δt is the lifetime. So for E1, Δt1 is 1e-9 seconds, so ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2e-9). Similarly, for E2, Δt2 is 1e-8 seconds, so ΔE2 is ħ/(2e-8). Wait, but E2 has a longer lifetime, so its energy uncertainty is smaller. No, wait, longer Δt means smaller ΔE because delta E is inversely proportional to delta t.

Wait, right
