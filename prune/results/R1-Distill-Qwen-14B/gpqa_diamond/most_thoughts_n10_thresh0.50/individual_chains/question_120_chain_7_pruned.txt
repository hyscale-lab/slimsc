Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think it through.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So, they're spread out evenly if we look at the entire celestial sphere. Now, we need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are in terms of 1 over some power of plx.

Wait, parallax. Right, parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance to the star in parsecs. So higher plx means closer star, and lower plx means farther away.

But wait, no, actually, the parallax is inversely proportional to the distance. So if a star is nearby, its parallax is larger. For example, a star at 1 parsec has a parallax of 1 arcsecond, one at 2 parsecs has 0.5, and so on.

Now, the problem is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. Let's imagine we're looking at a range of parallaxes, say from plx to plx + dplx. How many stars would we expect in that range?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed in space, that means the number density is the same everywhere. So the number of stars in a volume depends on the volume. But how does that translate to parallax?

Let me think about how distance relates to parallax. So d = 1/plx. So as plx decreases, the distance increases.

If the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density n is constant. So the number of stars in a certain volume would be n times that volume.

But we're looking at a range of parallax values. So I need to relate a change in parallax (dplx) to a change in distance (dd), and then to a volume.

Let me see: plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx.

If I take a small change in plx, dplx, what's the corresponding change in d? Let's do a differential. d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, but for small changes, I can take the absolute value. So the change in d is approximately (1/plx²) times the change in plx. So dd ≈ (1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, but I'm looking at a thin shell of stars at a particular distance d, right? The volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the volume between r and r+dr is approximately 4πr² dr.

So the number of stars in the shell would be n multiplied by the volume of the shell. So number of stars N = n * 4πd² dd.

But we want the number of stars per unit parallax range dplx. So how does dd relate to dplx?

From before, dd ≈ (1/plx²) dplx. Substituting that into N:

N = n * 4π d² * (1/plx²) dplx.

But wait, plx is 1/d, so plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So d squared is (1/plx)^2, which is 1/(plx²).

So substituting d² = 1/(plx²) into N:

N = n * 4π * (1/(plx²)) * (1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, let me double-check that. Because d = 1/plx → d squared is 1/(plx)^2. So substituting into N:

N = n *4π (1/(plx^2)) * (1/(plx^2)) dplx? Wait, no, wait. Because the expression is:

N = n *
