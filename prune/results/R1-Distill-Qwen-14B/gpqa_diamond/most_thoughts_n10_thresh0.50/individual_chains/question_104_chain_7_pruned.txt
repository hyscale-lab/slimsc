Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. 

So, the setup: two stars of the same mass (like the Sun), each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both have circular orbits. The RV method detected each planet by measuring the shift in a spectral line. 

Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms (I think that's 5e-3 angstroms), and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method relates to the velocity of the star. The formula for the semi-amplitude of the RV (K) is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ))^(1/ something? Wait, maybe I should recall the exact formula.

Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:
K = [ (G * P ) / (2π) ) ]^(1/3) * [ (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ] 

But wait, M_p is much smaller than M_*, since Neptune is much less massive than the Sun. So M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So, the formula simplifies. 

Wait, let me think. The formula I remember is:

K = ( ( (2π G) / (P) ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) * (1 + (M_p/M_*))^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, the denominator term (1 + M_p/M_*) is approximately 1. So, the formula becomes:

K ≈ ( (2π G) / (P) ) )^(1/3) * (M_p) / ( M_*^(2/3) )

But wait, for the same star mass (M_* same for both stars), and same planet mass (same as Neptune),
