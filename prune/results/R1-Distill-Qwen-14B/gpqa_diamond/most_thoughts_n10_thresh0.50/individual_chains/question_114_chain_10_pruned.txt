Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two parts, with two reactions. I need to figure out which reagents A and B are used in each step. The options are given as A, B, C, D, each with different reagents for A and B.

First reaction: butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then, the second reaction is taking 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, treating it with reagent B (in H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, okay. Let's tackle the first reaction. I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's probably a substitution reaction. So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? When a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion (CN-), that's typically a nucleophilic substitution. But wait, ketones have carbonyl groups where the carbonyl is adjacent to two R groups. So the mechanism would be something like a ketone reacting with a cyanide, replacing the oxygen with the CN group.

Wait, no, maybe it's more about the addition of CN. Oh wait, maybe it's a condensation reaction? Or perhaps it's a cyanide acting as a nucleophile in a substitution. Alternatively, I think about the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh right! Cyanohydrin formation is when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with a cyanide ion to form a hydroxy nitrile. The reaction is usually done under acidic conditions because the H+ protonates the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic. So the mechanism involves the addition of CN- to the carbonyl carbon, then water or something else comes in for the elimination of the leaving group. Wait, actually, I think the cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral intermediate, and then the proton from somewhere helps in the next step. Oh, but wait, in a cyanohydrin formation, the product is an alcohol and a nitrile group on the same carbon. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutan
