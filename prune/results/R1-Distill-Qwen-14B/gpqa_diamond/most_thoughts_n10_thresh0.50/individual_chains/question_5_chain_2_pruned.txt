Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, it's about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The problem is asking for the normalized eigenvector of the operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz, each represented by 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, so each component of P is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write down the matrices for each component.

Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix:
[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ]

Py is (ħ/2) times:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

Pz is (ħ/2) times:
[ [1, 0],
  [0, -1] ]

The operator P is a vector operator, so P = n_x Px + n_y Py + n_z Pz. But the direction n is in the x-z plane, which means the y-component n_y is zero. So, n is (n_x, 0, n_z). Since it's a direction vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

Wait, but the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So the operator P would be along the direction n, which is a combination of x and z. So the operator is P = (n_x Px + n_z Pz) * ħ/2.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Each component is scaled by ħ/2. So the operator P would be n ⋅ (Px, Py, Pz), right? So:

P = n_x * Px + n_y * Py + n_z * Pz.

But since n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x * Px + n_z * Pz.

But wait, each component is scaled by ħ/2. So, let me write each component as:

Px = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
Py = (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
Pz
