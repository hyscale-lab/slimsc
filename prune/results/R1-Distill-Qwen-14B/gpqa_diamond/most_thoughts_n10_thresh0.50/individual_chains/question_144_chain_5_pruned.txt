Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The question is about a meson resonance, X, and the mean decay distance. The given values are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. But wait, how exactly do I calculate that? Oh right, the mean decay distance (L) is given by the product of the velocity (v) and the lifetime (τ) of the particle. So L = v * τ.

But wait, I also recall that for a particle that's moving relativistically, the lifetime in the lab frame can be longer than its proper lifetime because of time dilation. The proper lifetime is τ_0, and the observed lifetime is γ * τ_0, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

So, I need first to find the lifetime of the meson. The width Γ is related to the lifetime by the uncertainty principle. Specifically, Γ is the total decay width, and the proper lifetime τ_0 is inversely proportional to Γ. The formula I think is τ_0 = ħ / Γ. But wait, in natural units where ħ = 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s, so Γ is in GeV, right? So I should convert
