Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I'll need to figure out which one matches the given data.

Starting with the FTIR results. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in this region usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, another strong peak at 1700 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group (C=O), which could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. There's also a peak at 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, that might be from conjugated double bonds or maybe an aromatic ring, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be a carbonyl with some conjugation or another functional group.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR. It mentions several peaks, including those for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond. This suggests some kind of unsaturated structure, maybe an alkene or an aromatic ring. But wait, vinyl hydrogens in NMR typically show up around 4.5-7 ppm if it's an isolated double bond, or higher if it's more substituted. But I'm not sure how that ties into the other data yet.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. I need to think about what fragments would give that. Common fragments at 45 include the methyl group (CH3+) would have m/z=15, but maybe it's something else. Wait, the molecular ion for some compounds could break down into smaller fragments. For example, if it's an ester, maybe the ester group breaks off. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone or something else. Alternatively, m/z 4
