Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the problem states: two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. Oh right, when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them normally because that would give something greater than c, which is impossible. So I remember there's the velocity addition formula in special relativity. Let me recall that formula.

The relative velocity formula, I think it's v = (u - v') / (1 - (u v')/c²), where u is the velocity of one object and v' is the velocity of the other from the first object's frame. Wait, no, wait. Or is it the other way around? Wait, the problem is asking for their relative speed, so which one is the frame here. Oh right, the relative speed is how one astronaut sees the other moving. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, then from A's frame, what is B's speed?

So let me define u as A's speed, 0.6c, and v' as B's speed, 0.5c. So from A's perspective, the relative speed v is (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, let me compute the numerator and denominator. The numerator is (0.5 - 0.6) c = (-0.1)c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1 c) / 0.7 = approximately -0.1428c. But speed is positive, so the magnitude is 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. So that would match options C and D, which have v_rel = 0.14c.

Now, for the total energy of the system. Oh, right, in relativity, the total energy is the sum of the energies of both astronauts. But wait, each astronaut has rest mass energy plus kinetic energy, but sometimes when you're asked for the total energy, you might need to consider it relativistically.

The energy of each astronaut is given by gamma * m c². So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.36)=1/sqrt(0.64)=1/0.8=1.25. So energy E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2
