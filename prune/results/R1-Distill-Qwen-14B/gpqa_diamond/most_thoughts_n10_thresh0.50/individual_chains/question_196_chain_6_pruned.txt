Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. I remember that in the classical harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is achieved when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy is (1/2)kA², so the speed would be v = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so I can't just use the classical formula.

Relativistic effects come into play when speeds are significant compared to the speed of light c. So the mass would experience a relativistic increase in momentum or energy. I think in relativity, the total energy isn't just the sum of kinetic and rest mass energy. Oh right, the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy.

Wait, the oscillator is relativistic, so we can't ignore relativistic dynamics. The potential energy is still (1/2)kA², but the kinetic energy can't be treated classically. Or wait, maybe the energy stored in the oscillator is relativistic as well?

Let me think about the energy. In the classical case, the total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential, which at maximum displacement (amplitude A) is all potential. So E = (1/2)kA². But in relativity, energy is different. Wait, perhaps I should start by considering the conservation of energy in a relativistic context.

In relativity, the total energy includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The equation for energy of a particle is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)², where p is momentum.

But wait, the harmonic oscillator equation in relativity isn't straightforward. I might need to use the relativistic equation of motion. The force equation is F = d(p)/dt, where p is relativistic momentum. Oh wait, but Hooke's law is F = -kx, so F = m a? No, wait, in relativity, F isn't m a, because m in relativity is the rest mass, and momentum p is gamma m v.

So the equation of motion would be d(p)/dt = -k
