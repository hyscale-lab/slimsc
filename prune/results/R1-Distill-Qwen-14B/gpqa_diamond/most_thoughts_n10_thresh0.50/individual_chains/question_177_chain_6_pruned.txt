Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. 

So, Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh, and the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, so their masses and radii are the same ratio. But wait, the problem mentions that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission depends on its temperature. Oh right, that's Wien's Law! The wavelength where the emission is maximum is inversely proportional to the temperature, λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. 

So if their λ_max is the same, that means their temperatures are the same too. Because λ_max is the same for both, T1 equals T2. So both stars have the same temperature. 

Now, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity is the speed at which the star is moving away or towards us. But how does this affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right, Doppler shift. If a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted; moving away, it's redshifted. But if Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, that means its observed wavelength isn't shifted due to Doppler effect. Star_2, moving at 700 km/s, but wait, in which direction? Oh, the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700, but doesn't specify direction. Hmm, for Doppler shift, the direction matters. But since their λ_max as observed is the same, I think this might affect their observed temperatures. Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. 

Wait, the problem says that through spectroscopy, the astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest were the same. So, the observed λ_max is the same for both. But what's the actual peak emission of each star? Because if the star is moving, the observed λ_max would shift. So
