Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux ratios in two different energy bands. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me think through this.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago, and we're supposed to find the ratio of flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that the proton-proton chain (pp) is the main source of the Sun's energy. The pp chain has different branches. The pp-I, II, and III branches. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves higher energy reactions, maybe involving heavier elements? But I'm not too sure. Oh wait, I think the pp-III branch is where two protons fuse into a diproton, then one of them emits a positron and a neutrino to become helium-2. That's part of the main pp chain, right?

So, if the pp-III branch stops, what happens to the neutrino production? Neutrinos are produced when a positron is emitted during beta-plus decay in the pp-III process. So if that process stops, the neutrino flux from that source would drop. But other reactions, like the pp-I and pp-II, might continue, or maybe they're affected too.

Wait, the question says all other reactions remain as they were. Oh,
