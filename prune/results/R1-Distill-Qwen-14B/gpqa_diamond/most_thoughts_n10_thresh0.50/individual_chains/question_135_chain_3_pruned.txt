Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about the decay of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that correctly. Oh, right, the interaction term usually involves the field X coupling to fermions. So the Lagrangian probably looks like λ ψ̄ X ψ, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact form. But the key point is that X is a boson that interacts with fermions.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So I need to find out which fermions X can decay into. The options are about different possible decay channels.

Wait, kinematically allowed decays depend on the mass of the boson and the masses of the fermions it's decaying into. Because for a particle to decay into two particles, their combined rest mass must be less than or equal to the mass of the decaying particle.

So X is a boson with mass 6 GeV. If X is decaying into a fermion-antifermion pair, then each fermion must have a mass less than 3 GeV, because 2m_f ≤ m_X. Wait, no, wait—wait, actually, the rest mass of each fermion must be less than or equal to half of the boson's mass because each fermion is at rest in the center-of-mass frame. So, m_f ≤ m_X / 2. So m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So let's list the known fermion masses. Let's think:

Electron (e): mass ~0.0005 GeV → way less than 3 GeV → allowed.
Muon (μ): ~0.1 GeV → allowed.
Tau (τ): around 1.78 GeV. So 1.78 ≤ 3 → allowed.
Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top.

But wait, up and down quarks are super light. Their masses are like a few MeV, so definitely allowed. Strange qu
