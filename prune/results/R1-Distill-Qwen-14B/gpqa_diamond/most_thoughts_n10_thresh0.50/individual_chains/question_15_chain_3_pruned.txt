Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. They've already detected them using the Radial Velocity (RV) method, so they know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Wait, both have the same mass. But Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh right, shorter period means it's orbiting closer to its star. Also, both have circular orbits.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radii. Oh, interesting. So Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but same size. Wait, why would a more massive star have the same radius? Hmm, but maybe that's just given for this problem.

The question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. But since they're already detected via RV, we know their orbits and the inclination, but maybe it's more about the geometry for transits.

Wait, the transit probability formula is something like the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. No, wait, no. Let me think. The probability that a planet's orbit, randomly oriented, will cause a transit is given by the formula: (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet. But since the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, it's approximately R_star / a_planet. Wait, no, more accurately, the probability P is (R_*/ (a_p (1 - e))) ), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so P â‰ˆ R_*/(a_p).

Wait, but R* is the radius of the star. So, a planet with a smaller a_p (closer in) would have a higher transit probability because R* is divided by a smaller number. Wait, no, if a_p is small, R*/a_p is larger. So a planet with a smaller semi-major axis (closer in) has a higher probability of transiting because the orbital plane is more likely to edge
