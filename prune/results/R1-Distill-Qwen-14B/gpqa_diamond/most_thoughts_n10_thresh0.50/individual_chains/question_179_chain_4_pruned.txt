Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. It's about matrices and some properties related to them. I need to figure out which statement is correct among the options A to D. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let's parse the question. The matrices given are W, X, Y, Z. Each matrix is provided with rows separated by semicolons. So for example, W is a 3x3 matrix where the first row is 0, 0, 1; the second is 0,1,0; and the third is 1,0,0.

The options are about whether certain matrices are unitary, Hermitian, or if their exponentials have certain properties. Let me recall some concepts.

In quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. The evolution operator (time evolution) is represented by a unitary matrix, which can be written as e^(-iH), where H is Hermitian. So, to determine if a matrix is an observable, I need to check if it's Hermitian—that is, if it equals its conjugate transpose.

Similarly, the evolution operator must be unitary. For a matrix U to be unitary, U*U† must equal the identity matrix, where † is the conjugate transpose. Alternatively, U† U = I. So, I need to check if a matrix is unitary.

But wait, the question gives matrices W, X, Y, Z, and the options state various claims about them. Let's look at each option.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Hmm. So, e^X multiplied by a vector. The norm changing would imply that e^X is not unitary. Because unitary matrices preserve the norm of vectors. So, if e^X is not unitary, then multiplying a vector by it would change the norm. So for this option to be correct, e^X must not be unitary. Alternatively, if e^X is unitary, then multiplying any vector by it would preserve the norm.

Wait, but how do I know if e^X is unitary? Well, if X is a skew-Hermitian matrix, then e^X would be unitary. Because for a skew-Hermitian matrix, X† = -X. Then, the exponential e^X is unitary because (e^X)† = e^{-X} = e^{X†} = e^{-X} = (e^X)^{-1}.

So, is X skew-Hermitian? Let's compute X†.

X is:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So, the conjugate transpose X† would have entries:

Column 1 of X becomes row 1 of X†:
i* → -i
1 → 1
2i* → -2i

Wait, no. Wait, X's first column is i, 1, 2i.

So X† is:

Row
