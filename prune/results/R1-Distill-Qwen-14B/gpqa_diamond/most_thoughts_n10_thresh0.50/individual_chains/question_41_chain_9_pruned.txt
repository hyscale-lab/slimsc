Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium, observed from the lab frame. Hmm, I remember that in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, this problem mentions a glass with index of refraction n. So maybe it's not about special relativity directly but more about the properties of the medium.

Wait, no. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v. So the lab frame is the rest frame, and the glass is moving at v in the same direction as the light beam. The light is moving toward the observer, so it's going from the glass into perhaps air or vacuum? Or is the entire setup in the glass?

Wait, the setup says the light is propagating through the glass, which is moving. So the glass is the medium, and it's moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam, toward the observer.

Wait, but light's speed in the glass is normally c/n, right? Because the refractive index n is the ratio of c to the speed in the medium. So in the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is c/n. But here, the glass is moving, so what's the speed as observed in the lab?

I think I should consider the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because we have a frame where the glass is moving, and light is moving at c/n relative to the glass. So the lab is the stationary frame, and the glass is moving at v. So I need to find the speed of light
