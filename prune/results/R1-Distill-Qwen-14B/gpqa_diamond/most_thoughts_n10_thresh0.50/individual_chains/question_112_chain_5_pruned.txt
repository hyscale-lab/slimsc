Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem, but I'm a bit confused. Let me see if I can work through it step by step.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I guess I need to normalize this state because it's only proportional, not necessarily normalized. The |up> and |down> states are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so they form an orthonormal basis.

Hmm, right, to normalize, I need to find the normalization constant. The state is given as a linear combination, so the normalization factor would be 1 over the square root of the sum of the squares of the coefficients. But wait, each coefficient is a complex number, so their squares would be the modulus squared.

Wait, the coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2 - i) for |down>. Let me compute the modulus squared for each.

For (1+i), the modulus squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because |a + ib|^2 is a² + b².

For (2 - i), modulus squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7). But wait, the question says it's proportional, so maybe we don't have to worry about the normalization for everything except when calculating probabilities.

Wait, no, probabilities depend on the square of the amplitudes, so I definitely need the state normalized. So I'll proceed with the normalized state.

Next, the question asks about the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator with matrix elements Aij. The operator has Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, the operator is:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2 0 ]

Wait, because for i≠j, it's ħ/2. So the matrix is zero on the diagonal and ħ/2 off-diagonal.

Wait, but what's the operator? It
