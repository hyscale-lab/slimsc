Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes. The main one is the proton-proton chain, which has different branches. The pp-III branch is one of them, right? And I think it's responsible for producing helium-4 nuclei. So if the pp-III branch stops suddenly, that must affect the production of certain particles, like neutrinos.

Wait, the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands. The bands are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to find the ratio of flux in band 1 to band 2 after the pp-III branch stops.

I think the pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos. Oh right, because in the pp-III process, two protons fuse into a deuterium nucleus, which then captures another proton to form helium-3. Then, two helium-3 nuclei can fuse into helium-4, releasing two protons. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact neutrinos involved. Oh, right, neutrinos are produced during beta decay steps. In the pp-III branch, the key reaction is He-3 + He-3 → He-4 + 2 protons. But I think the neutrinos come from the beta decay of He-3 to tritium, so each He-3 emits a neutrino.

Wait, no—He-3 doesn’t decay. Oh, wait, maybe it's the decay of tritium that produces the neutrinos. Because He-3 captures a proton to make He-4 and emits a positron and a neutrino. So each fusion step in pp-III produces a neutrino.

So if the pp-III branch stops, then the production of those neutrinos would stop as well. But the question is about the ratio of fluxes in two bands. So I need to figure out how each band's neutrinos are produced.

Another point: the pp-III neutrinos are high-energy. I think the main neutrinos from the Sun are the ones from the pp-III branch, which have energies around a few hundred keV. So if the pp-III stops,
