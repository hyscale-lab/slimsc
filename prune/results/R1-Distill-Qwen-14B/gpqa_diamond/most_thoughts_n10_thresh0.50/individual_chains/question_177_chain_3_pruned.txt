Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see... The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. 

So, the given information is: Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, so radius and mass are both 1.5 times. But wait, the question is about luminosity. Oh right, luminosity depends on radius and temperature, not directly on mass. Because I remember that for stars, luminosity is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius and T is temperature. So mass might not be directly relevant here, maybe it's a red herring. But perhaps the mass is used to find the temperature somehow?

The problem also says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's about their peak emission. So according to Wien's Law, which states that lambda_max * T = constant (like 2.898 ×10^-3 m·K). So if both stars have the same lambda_max, then their temperatures must be the same. Because if T were different, lambda_max would change. So both stars have the same temperature. That's an important point. So T1 equals T2.

Wait, but I thought that more massive stars are hotter. But in this case, perhaps the other factors are at play, but according to the problem, their peak wavelengths are the same, so their temperatures are same. So T1 = T2.

So with the same temperature, then the luminosity ratio between Star_1 and Star_2 depends only on their radii. Because L is proportional to R² T⁴, and T is same, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)².

Given R1 is 1.5 times R2, so (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. But wait, the options have A as ~2.25, D as ~2.23. Hmm, but the problem mentions that the
