Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: Let |alpha> be the state describing an electron, such that it is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of that operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Also, I have to find the average value of that operator.

The options are A, B, C, D with different probabilities and average values.

First, let me break this down. The state |alpha> is given as a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are orthonormal eigenstates of S_z. So, I can probably normalize |alpha> first because the problem says it's proportional to that expression.

Wait, the problem says it's proportional, so I need to find the normalization constant. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let's compute the norm (magnitude squared) of this vector.

The norm squared is (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i). Because when you have a vector a|up> + b|down>, the norm squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2.

Calculating |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, |a|^2 is a times its complex conjugate. So for (1+i), the conjugate is (1-i), so (1+i)(1-i) = 1 - i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2. Similarly for (2 - i): (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 4 +1 =5. Wait, no, that's not right. Because |2 - i|^2 is (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 4 +1 =5. So the total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the state is (1/i) normalized when divided by sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, no, because if the original state is proportional to that, then the normalized state would be that divided by sqrt(7), since the norm is sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, no, wait. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2+5=7. So the square root is sqrt(7), so the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So the coefficients are (1+i)/sqrt(7)
