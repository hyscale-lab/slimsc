Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but let me try to think this through.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options are about the relative speed and the total energy, so I need to calculate both.

I remember that when dealing with relative velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). So I should plug in v1 as 0.6c and v2 as 0.5c into that.

Calculating that, the numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²). Let me compute that denominator. The numerator of the fraction part is 0.3c², so when you divide by c², that becomes 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So the relative speed would be 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. Looking at the options, option C says 0.14c and option D also has 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the problem says "relative speed." Oh, but wait, which astronaut are we considering as the observer? Because in relativity, the relative velocity depends on the frame. Oh, but both are moving in the same direction, so the one with the higher speed (0.6c) would measure the other as moving away at a lower speed? Or vice versa? Wait, no. Wait, the relative velocity is the speed of one as seen from the other's frame.

Wait, the formula I used earlier is correct for the relative speed when considering one frame moving at v1 and another at v2. So for instance, if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, the relative speed of B as seen from A would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)) = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1/0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that matches options C and D.

Now, the total energy part. Total energy in relativity is the sum of the energies of each astronaut. The energy of each is gamma times m c squared. Wait, but the astronauts have different masses and different velocities. So for each, I need to compute gamma and multiply by their respective masses.

Wait, let me recall the formula for gamma. Gamma is 1 /
