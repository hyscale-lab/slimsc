Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that in stars, the photosphere's temperature plays a big role in the ionization and excitation of atoms.

So the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but wait, how does that work? Oh right, the spots are cooler, so when a part of the surface is covered, the average temperature of the whole star goes down.

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

In the stellar photosphere, under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the number of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is proportional to (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

So the ratio R = (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1.

The transition corresponds to about 1448 Angstroms. I think that's in the near-ultraviolet or maybe far-UV. So the energy difference ΔE can be calculated using the wavelength. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. But wait, that's the photon emitted when transitioning from higher to lower energy. So ΔE = hc/λ.

Let me compute that. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. The speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters, which is 1.448e-7 meters.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) = approx 1.372e-18 J per photon.

But wait, we can also express this in terms of eV because the Boltzmann constant is easier to handle in eV. 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So E in eV is E = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 8.57 eV.

Wait, but wait, is ΔE the energy difference between the two levels? So if the photon emitted is when going from higher to lower, then ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

But in the Boltzmann equation, it's (E2 - E1)/ (k T). So that term would be positive if E2 > E1.

Wait, but wait, the exponent is negative, so if E2 > E1, exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) would be a small number, leading to n2 being less than n1. But if E2 < E1, then ΔE negative, so exp becomes exp( positive ), which is a larger number, leading to n2 greater than n1.

But the problem states that the ratio R = (n2)/(n1) decreases when the star has spots. So when the star is
