Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question. Hmm, let me read it again.

So the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. When it's not covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Then, when they look at the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes.

Wait, the ratio decreases when the spots are present. So when there are no spots, the ratio is higher, and when spots are present, it's lower. So the factor is (ratio without spots)/(ratio with spots) = ?

I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2-E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight and E the energy.

But in this case, the ratio is (n1/n2), because when the spots are present, the ratio decreases. Wait, no. Let me think again. The problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in levels 1 and 2 decreases. So, (n1/n2) goes down when the spots are present.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify
