Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point when we titrate diluted acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let's see. I'll start by breaking down the problem step by step.

First, the initial solution: we have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Wait, so the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ or 0.040 L. 

Dilution usually follows the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. So the initial concentration after dilution would be (0.05 M * 0.020 L) / 0.040 L. Let me calculate that. 0.05 * 0.02 is 0.001, divided by 0.04 gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, the titration is with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid initially. Moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.025 M * 0.040 L = 0.001 moles. So for equivalence, NaOH needs to provide 0.001 moles.

The volume of NaOH needed at equivalence would be moles / concentration. 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. But wait, the question is about 25% titration. So at 25% of the equivalence point, the volume of NaOH used is 2.5 cm³. But wait, no, 25% of the equivalence point would be 25% of the required NaOH volume. So yeah, 2.5 cm³.

But wait, the problem asks for the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. Let's tackle each part.

First, the equivalence point.
