Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I remember that the brightness of a star as seen from Earth, which is the apparent magnitude, determines if a telescope can observe it. Both spectrographs have different brightness limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, while HIRES can go down to brighter than 16. So, a star must be brighter than 17 in V for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 for HIRES. Wait, wait, no, actually the way it's phrased is that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. Since lower numbers are brighter, that means V less than or equal to 17 can be seen. Similarly, HIRES can see brighter than 16, meaning V <=16.

Wait, no, because when the question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO, that means the star's apparent V magnitude must be less than 17. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So a star with V=17 is at the limit for ESPRESSO, but anything brighter (like V=16) is okay. Similarly, for HIRES, stars brighter than 16, so V <=16.

So, a star has to have an apparent V mag <=17 to be seen by ESPRESSO and <=16 to be seen by HIRES. But wait, the question is which stars can be detected with both. So the star must be detectable by both. That means the star's apparent V magnitude must be <=16 because HIRES is the stricter one, requiring V <=16. Because if it's <=16, then it's also <=17, so it's acceptable for ESPRESSO.

So the first thing I need to do is calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star. But wait, some stars have absolute magnitudes and distances. Others have apparent magnitudes given. So for the stars where the apparent magnitude isn't given, I need to calculate it using the distance and absolute magnitude
