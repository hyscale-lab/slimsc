Okay, so I've got this question here about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, parallax... I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger, and if it's farther away, the parallax is smaller.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. So, like, if I look at a range of parallax values, how many stars would I expect in each range? Let me think about this.

I think this has to do with the distribution of stars in space. If they're uniformly distributed, meaning the same number in any volume of space, then the number of stars we observe would depend on how much volume we can see at different distances.

So, when parallax (plx) is small, that means the stars are far away. The volume at a larger distance would be a sphere with radius d. The volume is (4/3)πd³. But since parallax is 1/d, d would be 1/plx. So the volume would be proportional to (1/plx)^3, right?

Wait, but we're looking at the number of stars per unit of parallax. Let's say I take a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx. The volume of that shell is the surface area of the sphere times the thickness in distance. The surface area is 4πd². The thickness in distance, how does that relate to dplx? Because plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. The distance between plx and plx + dplx is Δd = d(plx) - d(plx+dplx) = (1/plx) - (1/(plx + dplx)).

Wait, maybe there's an easier way. Since plx is inversely proportional to distance, maybe we can express the number of stars in terms of plx.

The number density of stars is uniform, so n = N/V, but wait, in this case, stars are uniformly distributed, so the number in a volume is proportional to the volume. So for a given shell at distance d, the volume is 4πd² dd, where dd is the thickness (change in distance). But since we're dealing with parallax, let's express this in terms of plx.

Since d = 1/plx, dd = -d (dplx)^2, wait no, let's get it right. Let me think: plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx.

So, the thickness in distance, dd, when plx changes by dplx, is dd = d(plx + dplx) - d(plx) = (1/(plx + dplx)) - (1/plx). Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Maybe for small dplx, I can approximate this as a derivative.

Wait, so for small changes, d(plx) = d(1/d) → d = 1/plx → so d(plx) = -
