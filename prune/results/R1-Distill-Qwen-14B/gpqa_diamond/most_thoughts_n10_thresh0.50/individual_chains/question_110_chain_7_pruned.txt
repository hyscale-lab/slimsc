Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs. But the question is about which stars they can observe, so I need to consider their brightness limits.

The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the way it's phrased: "brighter than 17 mag" â€“ but wait, lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So, a star that is brighter than 17 mag would have a V magnitude less than 17. Because the magnitude scale is inverse. So, a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17, which is brighter than V=18, etc.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So brighter than 16 means V <16.

So a star must be detectable by both, which means it must be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 mag for HIRES. Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V brighter than 17 can be observed. So for ESPRESSO, the V magnitude must be less than 17. Because the brighter the star, the lower the magnitude. So, if a star is brighter than 17, it's V <17.

Similarly, for HIRES, stars brighter than 16 can be observed, so V <16.

So for a star to be detected by both, it must have V <17 (since HIRES can do V<16, which is a stricter condition). Wait, no. Wait, both? No, wait. Wait, no. Because ESPRESSO requires V <17, and HIRES requires V <16. So the more restrictive is V <16. So a star needs to have V <16 to be detectable by both, because if it's V <16, it's brighter than 16, which is what HIRES needs, and it's also brighter than
