Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read through it carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and after reacting with a series of reagents, I need to find the final product. The options are A to D. Hmm, I'll start by analyzing the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound.

The 1H-NMR peaks are:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) – that's a triplet. High ppm, so maybe an aldehyde proton? Or perhaps a nitrile? Wait, no, nitrile is usually around 2-3 ppm. So aldehyde makes sense here. But wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. A triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, or maybe an aromatic ring? No, aromatic protons are lower. Hmm, aldehyde would be a singlet normally, but if it's next to something else... Not sure yet.

Next peak: 6.98 ppm (d, 2H). That's a doublet with two protons. Probably aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted aromatic rings, like a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton.

6.51 ppm (d, 2H) – another doublet, two protons again. This could be part of the same aromatic ring as the previous peak but in a different substitution pattern.

6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, two protons. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like an -OH proton. But wait, it's a singlet, so perhaps adjacent to an oxygen? Or maybe something else like an enol.

3.66 ppm (d, 2H) – a doublet, two protons. This seems like a CH2 group. The downfield shift suggests it's perhaps next to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Like an OCH2 group or something similar. But wait, it's a doublet, so each proton is coupling with one other proton. Maybe a CH2 connected to something else, like an oxygen in a ring.

Wait, let me think about the molecular formula: C8H9NO. So the degree of unsaturation would be (2C +
