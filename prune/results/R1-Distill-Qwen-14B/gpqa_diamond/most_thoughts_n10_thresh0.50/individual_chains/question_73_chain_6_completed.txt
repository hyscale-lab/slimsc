Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me try to think it through. 

The question says two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Hmm. So first, I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them normally because that would give a speed faster than light, which isn't possible. I think the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. Let me recall the formula. Oh right, the relative velocity u' between two objects moving at u and v relative to a stationary observer is given by (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Or wait, maybe it's (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/c²) when they're moving in the same direction. Wait, no, because if both are moving in the same direction, subtracting their speeds gives the relative speed of one from the other. So the formula for relative velocity when both are moving in the same direction would be (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²))? Or wait, maybe it's (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Let me think: if u is the speed of the first object and v is the speed of the second, but relative to the same frame, so when you're calculating the speed of one as seen from the other, it's u - v adjusted by the relativity factor.

Wait, no, actually, I think the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So in this case, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, the second at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So relative to the second astronaut, the first is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let's compute that.

Simplify numerator: 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So 0.1c / 0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c when rounded. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c, which would match either option C or D for the relative speed.

Next, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared. So for each, calculate their gamma factor.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute for each.

First astronaut: v = 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So his energy is 2m * gamma1 * c² = 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: v = 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So his energy is 3m * 1.1547 c² ≈ 3 * 1.1547 = 3.464 m c².

Total energy E = 2.5 m c² + 3.464 m c² ≈ 5.964 m c². Rounding to two decimal places, that's about 5.96 m c².

So looking at the options, option C has v_rel = 0.14c and E = 5.96 mc². Option D has E=5 mc², which is lower than what we calculated. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, let me double-check the relative speed calculation. I had (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²) = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. So 0.14c is correct, which is option C and D. But E in option C is 5.96, which matches our calculation. Option D's E is 5, which is too low, so option C must be correct.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative velocity between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of the First Astronaut (\( m = 2m \), \( v = 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of the Second Astronaut (\( m = 3m \), \( v = 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

---

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is \( E \approx 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5.96m c^2 \)**.

Answer: C
