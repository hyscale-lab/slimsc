Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the probability of them transiting in front of their host stars. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So, the question says that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. That means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1's period is P1, and Planet_2's is 3P1.

The orbits are circular, which is good because eccentricity can complicate things. The host stars have different masses. Planet_1's host is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But interestingly, both stars have the same radius. I remember that more massive stars are usually larger, but maybe Planet_2's star is a bit evolved, like a subgiant or something, so it's expanding but maybe not as much in radius as a main-sequence star.

The main question is about transit probability. The researchers have limited time and want to observe the planet with the higher probability of transiting. So which planet is more likely to transit?

I recall that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit. Specifically, the transit probability (P) can be approximated by the formula P â‰ˆ (R_p / a)^2, where R_p is the planet's radius and a is the orbital separation. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, the probability is the ratio of the area of the star that the planet can block relative to the planet's area. Or is it the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's size?

Wait, no. The transit probability for a planet is given by (R_star + R_planet)/a, but when R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately (R_star) / a. Wait, no. I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach. The probability that a planet transits is roughly (R_star / a), where R_star is the radius of the star, and a is the semi-major axis (which, since the orbit is circular, is just the orbital radius). But wait, that's not exactly correct. Because the planet's orbit must
