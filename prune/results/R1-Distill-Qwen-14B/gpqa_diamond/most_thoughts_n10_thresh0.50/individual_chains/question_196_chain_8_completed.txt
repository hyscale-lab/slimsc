Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a 1D relativistic setup. The options given are A to D, each with a different formula involving c (speed of light), m (mass), k (spring constant), and A (maximum amplitude).

Wait, wait. The problem mentions it's relativistic, so we have to consider relativistic effects. Oh right, because when velocities get close to the speed of light, classical mechanics doesn't hold anymore. So the kinetic energy can't be treated with the usual (1/2)mv² formula. Instead, we use the relativistic kinetic energy equation.

In the classical case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and at maximum displacement x = A, so potential energy is (1/2)kA². That potential would convert into kinetic energy, which is (1/2)mv_max². Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But this is the non-relativistic case. So option C must be the classical answer, but the question is relativistic, so the correct answer should be different.

So, moving to relativistic considerations. The total energy in relativity is given by E = gamma * mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

In the case of a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. But wait, in the relativistic scenario, does the potential energy equation change? Hmm, I think Hook's law F = -kx still holds because it's given. But the kinetic energy is relativistic.

At the maximum displacement x = A, the potential energy U is (1/2)kA², same as before. The kinetic energy K is the rest of the total energy. Wait, but the total mechanical energy E in the relativistic case isn't just K + U as in the classical case. Or is it? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me clarify.

In the harmonic oscillator, mechanical energy is conserved. So E = K + U, where U is the potential energy. But in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². So, E would be the sum of the rest energy (mc²) plus the kinetic energy. Wait, maybe I should model it as the total energy E being the sum of the potential and the relativistic kinetic energy.

Let me think. When the oscillator is at maximum displacement (x=A), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. But when it's at the equilibrium point (x=0), the velocity is maximum, and all energy is kinetic. Wait, but the question is about the maximum speed, which would occur as the oscillator passes through the equilibrium point.

So the maximum speed is when all the energy is kinetic. But wait, let's think about it in terms of energy conservation. The total mechanical energy E is conserved. So, E = U_max + K_min (which is zero at x=A). So, E = (1/2)kA². But at x=0, all of E is kinetic. So in relativistic terms, E = K_max + U_min. U is zero here because x is zero, so E = K_max.

Wait, but K is the relativistic kinetic energy. So, K_max = (gamma - 1) mc² = E = (1/2)kA². So,

(gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because when x=0, the potential is zero, so yes, all energy is kinetic.

So, solving for gamma:

gamma = 1 + ( (1/2)kA² ) / ( mc² )

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

gamma = [ mc² + (1/2)kA² ] / mc² = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c² )

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

gamma = [ 2 m c² + k A² ] / ( 2 m c² )

Wait, maybe I should write it as:

gamma = 1 + ( (k A²) )/( 2 m c² )

Yes.

So, gamma = (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )) )

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check.

At x=0, all energy E is kinetic:

E = K = (gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2)k A².

So,

gamma = 1 + ( (1/2)k A² ) / (mc² )

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²) / (2 m c² )

Yes, that looks right.

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²) / (2 m c² )

But gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²) / (2 m c² )

Let me call the term (k A²)/(2 m c² ) as Q for simplicity. So,

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + Q.

So,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + Q)

Squaring both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1 / (1 + Q)^2

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [ 1 / (1 + Q)^2 ]

So,

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + Q)^2 ]

Simplify:

v² = c² [ ( (1 + Q)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + Q)^2 )

Expanding numerator,

(1 + 2Q + Q² - 1 ) = 2Q + Q² = Q (2 + Q )

So,

v² = c² [ Q (2 + Q ) ] / (1 + Q )^2 )

But Q is (k A²)/(2 m c² ), so let's substitute back.

v² = c² [ (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )) ) ]^2 ]

Hmm, this is getting a bit messy. Let me factor out 1/(2 m c²) from numerator and see.

Wait, let me compute Q = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

v² = c² [ Q (2 + Q) ] / (1 + Q)^2 )

Substituting Q,

= c² [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + (k A²/(2 m c²))) ] / [ (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2 ]

Simplify numerator:

= c² [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) * ( [4 m c² + k A² ] / (2 m c²) ) ) ] / denominator.

Wait, maybe I should factor out the terms.

Wait, 2 + Q = 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ) = [4 m c² + k A² ] / (2 m c² )

So,

v² = c² * [ (k A²/(2 m c² )) * (4 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c² )) ) ] / [ ( (2 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c² ) ) ) ]²

Wait, because denominator is (1 + Q)^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c² ) ) ]²

Let me compute numerator and denominator step by step.

Numerator inside the brackets:

(k A²/(2 m c² )) * ( (4 m c² + k A² ) / (2 m c² ) ) ) 

= [k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ] / [ (2 m c² ) (2 m c² ) ]

= [k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ] / [4 m² c^4 ]

Denominator:

[ (2 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c² ) ) ]^2 

= (2 m c² + k A² )² / (4 m² c^4 )

So, putting it all together,

v² = c² * [ [k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ] / (4 m² c^4 ) ] / [ (2 m c² + k A² )² / (4 m² c^4 ) ) ]

The denominator of the big fraction is the denominator expression.

So,

v² = c² * [ numerator ] / [ denominator ]

Which becomes,

c² * [ (k A^2 (4 m c² + k A² )) / (4 m² c^4 ) ) ] * [ 4 m² c^4 ) / (2 m c² +k A² )^2 ) ]

The 4 m² c^4 terms cancel out.

So,

v² = c² * [ k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / (2 m c² + k A² )^2 )

Hmm, maybe factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, 4 m c² + k A² = 2*(2 m c² ) + k A². Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, let's factor 2 m c² from numerator and denominator.

Wait, denominator is (2 m c² + k A² )^2.

Numerator inside the brackets is k A² (4 m c² + k A² )

Wait, 4 m c² is 2*(2 m c² ), but not sure.

Alternatively, let me write 4 m c² as 2*(2 m c²) = 2 * (denominator part minus k A² )

Hmm, not sure. Maybe another approach.

Wait, perhaps instead of expanding all that, let's take the expression for gamma and manipulate to find v.

We have gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

gamma = [ 2 m c² + k A² ] / ( 2 m c² )

So,

gamma = [ 2 m c² + k A² ] / (2 m c² )

So,

gamma^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A²)^2 ] / (4 m² c^4 )

But also,

gamma^2 = 1 / (1 - v^2/c^2 )

So,

1/(1 - v^2/c^2) = [ (2 m c² + k A² )^2 ] / (4 m² c^4 )

Inverting both sides,

1 - v^2/c^2 = (4 m² c^4 ) / (2 m c² + k A² )^2 )

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - [4 m² c^4 ] / (2 m c² + k A² )^2 

= [ (2 m c² + k A² )^2 -4 m^2 c^4 ] / (2 m c² + k A² )^2 

Expanding the numerator,

(2 m c²)^2 + 2*(2 m c²)(k A²) + (k A²)^2 -4 m^2 c^4

= 4 m² c^4 +4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 -4 m² c^4 

= 4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 

= k A² (4 m c² + k A² )

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / (2 m c² + k A² )^2 )

Which brings us back to the same point as earlier.

So, v = c * sqrt( [k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / (2 m c² + k A² )^2 )

Let me factor out terms in numerator and denominator.

Wait,

[k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] = k A² (4 m c² + k A² )

Denominator: (2 m c² + k A² )^2 = [2 m c² + k A²]^2

Let me write 4 m c² as 2*(2 m c² )

So,

v = c * sqrt( [k A² ( 2*(2 m c² ) +k A² ) ] / [2 m c² +k A²]^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ 2 k A² (2 m c^2 + (k A^2)/2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ]^2 )

Not sure if this helps. Alternatively, factor the numerator and denominator.

Wait, maybe factor numerator and denominator as:

Numerator: k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) = k A² ( (2 m c² ) * 2 + k A² )

Denominator: (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 = [ (2 m c^2 ) +k A^2 ]^2

Hmm, not seeing a simple way to express this. Maybe we can write it as:

v = c * sqrt( [k A² (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 )

= c * sqrt( k A² (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 )

= c * [ A sqrt( k (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ) ]

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can factor out k A² from numerator and denominator.

Wait,

Let me factor out (k A² ) from numerator and denominator.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps let me write the expression as:

v = c * sqrt( [k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / (2 m c² +k A² )^2 )

= c * sqrt( [k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] ) / (2 m c² +k A² )

= c * A sqrt( k (4 m c² +k A² ) ) / (2 m c² +k A² )

Hmm. Let's think about the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m) )^2 )

Wait, no, let's look at each option.

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2m) ) )^2 )

Hmm. Not matching.

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²/(2 m c^2 )) ) )

Wait, no, let me write each out.

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, no. Let me see.

Option D: sqrt(1 -1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps let me compute gamma again.

We have gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

gamma = (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 )

gamma = [ (2 m c^2 ) (1) + k A^2 ] / (2 m c^2 )

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps express v in terms of gamma.

We have gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

So,

gamma^2 = 1/(1 - v²/c² )

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/gamma^2

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma^2

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/( (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) )^2 )

= c * sqrt( 1 - (4 m^2 c^4 )/(2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 )

Hmm, perhaps that's not helpful. Let me compute 1 - 1/gamma^2.

gamma = [2 m c^2 +k A^2 ]/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1/gamma = [2 m c^2 ]/(2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

So,

1/gamma^2 = [4 m² c^4 ]/( (2 m c² +k A² )^2 )

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [4 m² c^4 ]/(2 m c² +k A² )^2

= [ (2 m c² +k A² )^2 -4 m² c^4 ] / (2 m c² +k A² )^2 

As before, the numerator is 4 m c^2 k A² + k² A^4.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (4 m c² k A² + k^2 A^4 ) ) / (2 m c² +k A^2 )

Hmm.

Alternatively, factor numerator:

= k A² (4 m c² +k A² )

So,

v = c * sqrt( k A² (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ) / (2 m c² +k A^2 )

= c * A sqrt( k (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

Hmm, not seeing an obvious simplification.

Wait, perhaps take (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) as 2*(2 m c^2 ) +k A^2.

Not sure.

Alternatively, let me think of the expression for v_max in terms of gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express v in terms of gamma and (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ).

Wait, let me write gamma as 1 + x, where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

gamma = 1 + x

Then,

gamma^2 = (1 + x)^2 = 1 + 2x + x²

v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma^2 = 1 - [1/(1 + x)^2 ]

So,

v²/c² = [ (1 + x)^2 -1 ] / (1 + x)^2 

= [ 1 + 2x + x^2 -1 ] / (1+x)^2 

= (2x +x² ) / (1 +x )^2 

= x (2 + x ) / (1 +x )^2 

But x is (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v²/c² = [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) * (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ] / ( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )^2 

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) * (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ] ) / [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) ]

Hmm, perhaps that's easier to write.

Alternatively,

Denote y = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Then,

v = c * sqrt( y (2 + y ) ) / (1 + y )

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ y (2 + y) ] ) / (1 + y )

Hmm, perhaps square both sides:

v²/c² = [ y (2 + y) ] / (1 + y )^2 

So,

v²/c² = [ y (2 + y ) ] / (1 + y )^2 

Hmm, let's see if any of the options can be manipulated into this form.

Looking at the options:

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2/(2m))^2 ) )

Not sure if that matches.

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, let me compute the inside:

1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

But that would be 1 + [ 1/( (2 m c^2 - k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) ) ] = 1 + (2 m c^2 )/(2 m c^2 -k A^2 )

Which is [ (2 m c^2 -k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 ] / (2 m c^2 -k A^2 )

= [ 4 m c^2 -k A^2 ] / (2 m c^2 -k A^2 )

Hmm, not matching what we have.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

So, inside the sqrt:

1 - [1/(1 + y )^2 ] where y is k A^2/(2 m c^2 )

Which is,

[ (1 + y )^2 -1 ] / (1 + y )^2 

= [ 1 + 2 y + y² -1 ] / (1 + y )^2 

= (2 y + y² ) / (1 + y )^2 

Which matches the v²/c² expression I derived earlier.

So, v = c * sqrt( (2 y + y² ) / (1 + y )^2 )

Which is,

v = c * sqrt( ( y (2 + y) ) / (1 + y )^2 )

Which is the same as option D's inner expression.

Wait, option D is:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, no, option D is written as:

D) v_max = c√[1 − 1/(1 + (kA²/(2mc²))² ) ]

Wait, no, option D is:

D) v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2mc²)) )^2 )

Wait, let me see:

If option D is:

1 - 1/(1 + y )^2, where y = k A²/(2 m c^2 )

Which is exactly what we have for v^2/c^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( [1 - 1/(1 + y )^2 ] )

Which is the same as option D.

Wait, wait.

Wait, no. Because v²/c² is [ y (2 + y ) ] / (1 + y )^2 

But option D's expression inside the sqrt is:

1 - [ 1/(1 + y)^2 ]

Which is,

[ (1 + y )^2 -1 ] / (1 + y )^2 

= [1 + 2 y + y² -1 ] / (1 + y )^2 

= (2 y + y² ) / (1 + y )^2 

Which is the same as what we have for v²/c².

So yes, option D matches.

So, the correct answer is option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), spring constant \( k \), and maximum amplitude \( A \), we must account for relativistic effects. The total energy of the system is conserved, and at maximum displacement (\( x = A \)), all energy is potential energy (\( U = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \)). At the equilibrium point (\( x = 0 \)), all energy is kinetic energy. In the relativistic regime, the kinetic energy is given by \( K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).

Equating the total energy \( E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \) to the relativistic kinetic energy at \( x = 0 \), we have:

\[
(\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

Solving for \( \gamma \), we get:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Since \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we substitute this into the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Let \( y = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + y
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + y)^2
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + y)^2}
\]

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + y)^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \) back, we find:

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
\]

This matches the expression given in **Option D**. The other options do not correctly account for the relativistic effects or the energy conservation principles involved.

**Answer: D**
