Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is to the star, I think.

The problem says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune's mass. Both planets are in circular orbits, so that simplifies things.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is, how much longer is planet #2's orbital period compared to planet #1?

Wait, I think the RV method's measured velocity is related to the mass of the planet and the characteristics of its orbit. The formula I remember is something like the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is proportional to ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star) ) * ( (1 AU) / (a) )^(1/2) ) divided by (1 + (M_p / M_star))^(something). Or wait, maybe it's more accurate to think about the equation for the RV signal.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * ( 1/(1 + (M_p/M_star)) ) )^(1/ something). Hmm, maybe I should look for a more precise formula.

Alternatively, I think the formula is K = ( (2π G) / (c T) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ), where T is the orbital period and c is the speed of light? Or wait, perhaps the formula is K = (v) as a function of the mass and period.

Wait, let me think again. The RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The star and planet orbit their common center of mass. The velocity amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the distance of the planet from the star.

But the formula I remember is that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3)) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)} ), but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to relate the RV signal to the orbital period. Since the stars have the same mass, and the planets have the same mass, the only difference is the RV shift which is 5 and 7 milliangstroms.

Wait, the RV shift K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * ( (1 / (a^0.5)) ), but I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, I know that the RV semi-amplitude K can be approximated by the formula:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) ) )^(1) ) * ( (2π / P) )^(1/3) ) / c
