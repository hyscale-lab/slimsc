Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So the question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species in the solution. The given data includes the concentrations of Co(II) and SCN- ions, and the stability constants for different complexes.

Let me start by recalling what stability constants mean. The stability constant (β) is a measure of the stability of a complex. It's the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from its ions. So a higher β means the complex is more stable.

The problem states that the stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I'm assuming these correspond to the complexes [Co(SCN)]^n+ where n increases with each β. So β1 is the first complex, maybe [CoSCN]^+, β2 is the second, perhaps [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, and so on. Wait, but I should confirm the order. Oh right, higher β means more stable, so β3 is the most stable here.

Wait, wait. Actually, the order of stability is β1 < β2 < β3 > β4. Because β3 is 63, which is the highest. So the most stable complex is the third one, [Co(SCN)3]^3+? Or wait, maybe the number of SCN- ligands corresponds to the order. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^3+, and β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^4- or something else? Hmm, but wait, the number might not directly correspond if the charge is different. But perhaps that's the standard way.

So the problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I'm not exactly sure which complex is blue, but I think in the case of cobalt complexes, [Co(SCN)3]^3+ is blue, while maybe [Co(SCN)4]^4- is more of a different color. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the colors. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to [Co(SCN)2]²+ as the dithiocyanato, which is two SCN- ligands. So maybe that's the second complex, β2=40.

Wait, but the question says "dithiocyanato," which would imply two SCN groups. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)₂]^2+. So that's the second complex, with β2=40.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. So perhaps the blue color corresponds to the [Co(SCN)3]^3+ complex, which is the third one. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)4]^4-? Not sure. The question might be referring to the most stable complex as blue, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the blue refers to a specific complex. I remember that [Co(SCN)6]^3-
