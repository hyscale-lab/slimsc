Okay, I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice chemistry problem. Let me go through the question step by step and think about each clue.

So, the question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectral data. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. 

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. So, maybe the compound has an -OH group, like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, the user said "very broad"; carboxylic acids have very broad O-H stretches, while alcohols are broad but maybe less so. So, I'm thinking it's maybe a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. 

Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 cm⁻¹ peak could be an alkene (C=C) stretch or another carbonyl, maybe conjugated. Wait, another thought: if it's a carbonyl, then maybe we have two different types of carbonyl groups? Or perhaps one is from a conjugated system. Alternatively, the 1650 could be an aromatic ring's C=C stretch, but the problem didn't mention anything about aromaticity. Hmm.

Moving on to the 1H NMR spectrum. It says there are several peaks, including ones for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, so that suggests the compound has a double bond, like an alkene. That would fit with the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak, which could be the C=C stretch. So, we have both a carbonyl group and an alkene in the structure.

Now, the mass spec data: a fragment peak at m/z =45. What could that be? Let me think about common fragments. 45 is a common mass for a fragment like (CH3)2O (which is 45, but that's 27 for O and 18 for two CH3 groups? Wait, wait. Let me double-check. Carbon is 12, hydrogen is 1. So, (CH3)2O is (12*2 + 6*1) + 16 = 24 +6 +16=46? No, wait: (CH3)2O has 2*(CH3) which is 2*(12+3*1) = 2*15=30, plus O which is 16. So 30+16=46. Hmm, that doesn't match 45.

Wait, another fragment: the methyl group (CH3) is 15, but maybe something else. Oh, another possibility is the acetylium ion, CH3CO+ which is 43. Or maybe a (CH2)2O group—no, that's more than 45, I think. Alternatively, the fragment could be CH2O (formaldehyde) which is 30. Or something else. Alternatively, I'm thinking about the base peak in mass spec. Maybe the molecular ion is at a higher m/z, but a fragment breaks off.

Wait, 45 could be (CH3)CO+ which is 58? No, wait. Let's calculate. (CH3)CO+ would be 12*2 + 3*1 + 16 +1 (wait, the formula is C2H5O, but as a fragment? Alternatively, maybe a fragment with 45 is (CH3)2C=O, which would be 58? No, that doesn't add up. Maybe another approach: 45 could be a CH2CH2O group or something else. Alternatively, perhaps a ketene ion or something.

Alternatively, another way to approach this is to think about the possible molecular formulas and see which one can produce a fragment of m/z 45. Let's look at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. Let's see, the possible molecular weight is (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72+12+32=116. So the molecular ion is at m/z 116. Possible fragments could break off. For instance, if the molecule has an ester group, maybe breaking off a smaller fragment. Alternatively, a loss of something like water (18) would leave 98, but that's not 45. Maybe a cleavage could produce a smaller
