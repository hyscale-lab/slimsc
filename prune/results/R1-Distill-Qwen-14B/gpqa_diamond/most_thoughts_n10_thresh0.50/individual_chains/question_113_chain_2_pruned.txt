Okay, so I've got this question about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question gives me the data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. My goal is to figure out the chemical formula from the options provided.

Starting with the FTIR data. The very broad peak around 3000 cm-1 probably indicates an O-H stretch, which is common in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but a broad peak could also be from an -OH group in a phenol or maybe an alcohol. Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Hmm, the 1700 area is typical for carbonyl groups. A carbonyl could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might suggest something like conjugation or possibly an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group, like an aromatic ketone or maybe an ester. Or perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl?

Next, looking at the 1H NMR. They mention peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests the compound has a double bond somewhere. So maybe an alkene is present, which would explain the vinyl hydrogen peaks. Also, the presence of an alkene could relate to the IR peaks if there's conjugation, like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or ketone.

Now the Mass Spectrometry part. The fragment peak at m/z 45. I need to think about what fragments typically give that. The most common fragment at 45 is the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but wait, wait. Another possibility is the CH3CO+ group. Let me think. The molecular ion of acetic acid would lose a water molecule to form CH3CO+, which is 45 (12*2 + 1*3 +16= 45). Alternatively, maybe a propyl group or something else. Or perhaps a ketene ion?

Wait, but wait. Another
