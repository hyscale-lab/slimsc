Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the major products for each and match them with the options provided.

Let's start with part A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. Hmm, NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, which is a strong base, so this probably deprotonates something to form an enolate.

Wait, the Michael reaction involves an enolate attacking a conjugated carbonyl compound. Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate. The other reactant, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, is a Michael acceptor since it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

So, the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta position of the acrylate. Let me sketch this out mentally. Dimethyl malonate has two methyl groups and two carbonyl groups. The enolate would form at the central carbon next to the carbonyls. When it attacks the acrylate, which has a p-tolyl group at the beta position, the attack would add the malonate's enolate to the acrylate's alpha,beta-unsaturated system.

Wait, so the product would have the p-tolyl group attached via the former acrylate, and the malonate part would be connected. The structure might end up as a trimethyl ester because we started with dimethyl malonate. Let me think about the connectivity. The attack would happen at the beta carbon of the acrylate, so the p-tolyl group is at the end, and the malonate would add to the alpha and beta positions.

Wait, the product structure for A in the options: looking at option A, it's trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. That makes sense. The central
