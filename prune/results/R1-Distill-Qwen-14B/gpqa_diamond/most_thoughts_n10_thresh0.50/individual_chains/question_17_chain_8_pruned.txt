Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of problems. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The Ca-EDTA complex is formed, and the formation constant (K) tells us how strong the complex is.

Wait, the formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where EDTA binds the metal ion. So for the formation of the Ca-EDTA complex, the reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. The K for this reaction is given as 5x10^10.

The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. But I'm supposed to find the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

I think I can use the formula for the formation constant. The K is equal to the concentration of the complex divided by the product of the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So K = [CaEDTA^2−] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

But wait, in this case, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So [CaEDTA^2−] is 0.02 M. But I don't know [Ca²+] or [EDTA^4-]. However, I think that in most cases, the EDTA is present in excess, so that the concentration of free EDTA is approximately the same as the initial concentration minus the amount that has bound to Ca²+. But if the K is very large, which it is here (5e10), that means the reaction goes almost to completion. So almost all the Ca²+ and EDTA would form the complex.

Wait, but if the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA^2−, then the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- must have been such that they
