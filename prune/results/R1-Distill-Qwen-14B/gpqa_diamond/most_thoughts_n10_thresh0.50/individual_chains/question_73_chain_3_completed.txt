Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see, the question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Their masses are 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them normally because that leads to speeds exceeding the speed of light, which is impossible. So the correct way is to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula for relative velocity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). Wait, wait, but let me make sure I get the signs right. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference between their speeds, but adjusted for relativity.

So the two velocities are 0.6c and 0.5c. Let me plug them into the formula. So v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let's compute the numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.6 * 0.5 c² ) / c². The c² cancels out, so it's 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. So approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c. So that's the relative speed part.

Now, the total energy part. Each astronaut's energy would be their relativistic kinetic energy plus their rest mass energy. Or wait, no, wait. The total energy of each is their rest mass energy multiplied by gamma, right? Because each is moving, so their energies are gamma*m*c².

So for the first astronaut (2m mass, 0.6c speed):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v1²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.36 c²)/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So their energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (3m, 0.5c):

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.25 c²)/c²) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1/(0.8660) ≈ 1.1547.

E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So that's approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc², which is lower. So the only option that matches both the relative speed and the energy is option C.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Gamma for first: (0.6c)^2 = 0.36 c². 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt is 0.8. 1/0.8 is 1.25. Correct.

E1: 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5. Correct.

Gamma for second: 0.5c squared is 0.25 c². 1 - 0.25 is 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is about 0.866, so 1/0.866 is approx 1.1547. Multiply by 3m: 3 * 1.1547 = 3.464. So E2 is 3.464 mc².

Adding 2.5 and 3.464 gives 5.964, which rounds to 5.96. So that's option C.

So the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m c^2) = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m c^2) \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**
