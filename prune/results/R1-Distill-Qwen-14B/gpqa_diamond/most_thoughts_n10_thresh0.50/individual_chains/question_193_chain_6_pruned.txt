Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Hmm. Parallax and distance are inversely related, right? So parallax plx is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs, like plx = 1/d. Oh wait, wait, wait. No, actually, the formula is that parallax (in arcseconds) is 1 divided by distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/d. So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The problem says the number of stars varies with 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down. So number N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N would be proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's work that out. 1/( (1/d)^5 ) is the same as (d^5)/1, so N is proportional to d^5. Oh wait, but wait, that's the number of stars proportional to d^5. But the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range.

Wait, I think I need to think about how the number of stars in a shell at distance r would change. Because when you consider a region of the sky, it's like a thin shell at a certain distance. The number of stars in that shell would depend on the volume of the shell, but also on how star density varies with distance.

Wait, let me think. The number of stars in a volume is given by the number density multiplied by the volume. But in this case, the number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, 1/(plx)^5 is d^5. So N = k * d^5, where k is some constant. But wait, this seems a bit odd. Because the number of stars usually depends on the volume, which is a function of radius squared or something. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the differential. Because the question is about the number of stars per unit range of distance. So if we're looking at how many stars are present between r and r
