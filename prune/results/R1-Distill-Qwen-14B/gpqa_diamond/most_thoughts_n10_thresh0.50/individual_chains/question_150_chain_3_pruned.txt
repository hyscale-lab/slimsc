Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and then it undergoes a series of reactions. The question is asking what the final product is. The options are A to D, all of which seem to be different substituted butenals or something similar.

First, let's break down the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting material. The 1H-NMR shows peaks at:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) â€“ that's a triplet, probably an aldehyde proton since aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. But wait, the next peak is at 6.98 (d, 2H), which is around the aromatic region, maybe para-substituted something. Then 6.51 (d, 2H), also aromatic, perhaps another para group. Then 6.27 (bs, 2H), broad singlet, maybe some kind of enol or maybe diol protons? And 3.66 (d, 2H), which suggests maybe a CH2 group next to something else, like an oxygen perhaps.

Hmm, so the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1 (since formula is C8H9NO). So, substituting: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9)/2= 9/2=4.5? Wait, degrees of unsaturation must be an integer. Did I calculate that right?

Ah wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate. The formula is C8H9NO. The general formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. X is 0 here. So, (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2. So 18 -9 is 9, plus 1 is 10. 10/2 is 5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be, for example, a ring and a double bond, or two rings and a double bond, but more likely, it's a combination of rings and double bonds.

Looking at the NMR, there are aromatic protons, so probably two aromatic rings. Each benzene has 3 degrees (since each ring is 3 degrees, right?), but wait, each benzene ring contributes 4 degrees of unsaturation because a benzene has three double bonds and a ring. So each ring is 4? Wait no, each ring plus double bond is a degree. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Wait, each ring is one degree, each double bond is another. So benzene has three double bonds (each contributes 1) and a ring, so 4 degrees. So two benzene rings would be 8 degrees, but the formula gives 5. So that's impossible. So perhaps each ring isn't fully substituted. Maybe they are not benzene but maybe mono-substituted rings or something else.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's see, if the compound has a benzene ring, then C6H5... and then the rest is C2H4NO. Hmm, but wait, C6H5 would have 6 carbons, leaving 2 more. So perhaps it's a benzaldehyde derivative or something with a side chain.

Looking at the NMR data again. The peak at 9.72 is a triplet. That's a bit unusual for an aldehyde, which is usually a singlet. Maybe it's an alpha proton adjacent to something else. Wait, could it be an enal, like a conjugated aldehyde and double bond? I'm not sure. Or maybe it's an aromatic proton near an electron-withdrawing group.

Wait, the 9.
