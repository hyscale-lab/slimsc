Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm. So, first, I remember that stability constants (β) tell us about the formation of complexes. Each β corresponds to a complex with a certain number of SCN- ligands. So β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)₂, β3 for Co(SCN)₃, and β4 for Co(SCN)₄?

Wait, but I should make sure about the order. Typically, β values increase with the number of ligands up to a point because each additional ligand increases the stability. But in this case, β4 is 16, which is less than β3. That might mean that the most stable complex is Co(SCN)₃²+ because β3 is the highest.

The question is about dithiocyanato complexes, which I think refers to complexes with two SCN- ions. So the blue complex would be Co(SCN)₂²+? Or maybe another one, but the question specifies blue dithiocyanate, so probably the [Co(SCN)₂]²+ ion.

Our goal is to find the percentage of this specific complex relative to all cobalt species. So I'll need to calculate the concentration of each complex and then find the fraction that's [Co(SCN)₂²+].

I remember that the fraction of a particular complex can be found using the log of the formation constants and the concentrations of the ligand. The formula involves the stability constant and the ligand concentration. But how exactly?

I recall that for a series of complexes, you can use the concept of the distribution of species. Each complex is formed step-wise, and the fraction of each can be determined using the stepwise formation constants and the ligand concentration.

The formula for the fraction f_n of the complex with n ligands is:

f_n = (β_n * [L]^n ) / (1 + β1[L] + β1β2[L]^2 + β1β2β3[L]^3 + ... + β1β2...βn[L]^n )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the cumulative formation constants. The general formula for the fraction of the complex with n ligands is:

f_n = (β_n * [L]^n) / (sum over k=0 to n of (β_k * [L]^k))

Wait, but β_k is the cumulative constant for k ligands. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused between the cumulative and stepwise β values.

Wait, the β given here are the stepwise formation constants. So β1 is K1 = [CoL]/([Co][L]), β2 is K2 = [CoL2]/([CoL][L]), so the overall β for n ligands is the product of K1*K2*...*Kn.

Wait, no. Wait, for a complex that forms stepwise, the overall formation constant βn is the product of the stepwise constants up to n. So β1 = K1, β2 = K1*K2, β3 = K1*K2*K3, etc. But wait, in this problem, the given βs might not be cumulative. Wait, the question says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes" are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each βn is the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)n]²+.

Wait no, usually stability constant (formation constant
