Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on iron atoms' energy levels. Hmm, let me think about what I know.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's photosphere relates to the thermal energy of the star. Since the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), we can probably use the Boltzmann distribution here.

The Boltzmann equation describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The formula I remember is something like the ratio of populations in two energy levels, which is N_upper/N_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( - (E_upper - E_lower)/(k T) ), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy difference is given as E = 1.38e-23 J. Wait, the question says that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So if I consider the ratio for each star, N1/N2 = 2, where N1 is the population in star_1 and N2 in star_2 for the same energy level.

Wait, no, maybe I should think of it as the ratio of the excited state to the ground state. Let me clarify: for each star, the population in the excited state (say, level 2) relative to the ground (level 1) is N2/N1. But the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited â€“ perhaps that means the ratio N2/N1 is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2? Or maybe that the excitation in star_1 is higher, so the population in the excited state is higher there.

Wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So for star_1, the population in that energy level is twice that of star_2. Or wait, perhaps it's that the excitation (the energy state) is twice as much. Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of the ratio of the populations.

Wait, let's try to model this. For each star, the population ratio is given by the Boltzmann factor.
