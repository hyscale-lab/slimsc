Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The state of the electron is given as |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, I think I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator S_z. So the spin-up and spin-down states.

The problem asks me to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Also, find the average value of that operator.

Wait, so first, I need to find the probabilities of measuring the electron in each eigenstate of operator A. Then, find the expectation value (average value) of A.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's find the state |alpha> correctly. The given state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So I think I should normalize this to get the actual state vector.

The state is:

|alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>

Wait, but what is the normalization factor? The norm is the square of the sum of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

So the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). Let me compute their magnitudes squared:

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 =
