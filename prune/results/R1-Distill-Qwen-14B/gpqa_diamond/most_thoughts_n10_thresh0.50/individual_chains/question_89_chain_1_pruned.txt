Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

First, the problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very rigid and has four bridgehead carbons. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two of the bridgehead positions.

Heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C. Oh, KOH is a strong base. I think this is likely an elimination reaction, maybe forming an alkene. But wait, since it's dibromide and KOH, it might be a dehydrohalogenation. But wait, with two bromines, could it form a diene? Or maybe each Br leaves, forming a double bond each? No, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the two Br atoms on adjacent bridgeheads, so when they eliminate, perhaps the structure becomes a diradical or forms a bridge with a double bond.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Another thought: KOH can cause elimination. So, each Br could eliminate, but how? Since it's on bridgehead carbons, perhaps it's not possible to form a normal double bond because of the structure's rigidity. Maybe it forms an allene or some kind of conjugated system. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening, but I think more likely elimination to form a diradical that could form a new structure.

Wait, the product is called product 1. The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. That peak is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. Oh wait, wait, 1720 is a bit lower than a typical ketone (usually around 1715-1740). Hmm, but maybe it's an ester or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe a ketone with some conjugation.

The 1H NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Let's think about what this could be. The 4.79 ppm could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, maybe an ether or ester. Alternatively, a carb
