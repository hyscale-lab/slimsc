Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about the luminosities of two stars. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, that's interesting. Also, their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. The question is about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Alright, so first, I should recall the formula for luminosity of a star. Black body radiation, so I think the Stefan-Boltzmann law applies here. The luminosity L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power. So L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Wait, but the problem says to compute the luminosity of Star_1 compared to Star_2. So I can write L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4.

I know R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 is 1.5. So (1.5)^2 is 2.25. But what about the temperature ratio, T1/T2?

Hmm. The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength λ_max is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if their λ_max is the same, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2. Wait, but wait a minute, is that correct? The problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So both have the same λ_max, so T1 = T2. Oh, that's a key point. So T1/T
