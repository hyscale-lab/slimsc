Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrostatics. But let's take it step by step. The question is about finding the minimum energy of a system of charges. Hmm, I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges depends on the work done to assemble them, especially when dealing with like charges which repel each other.

So, the setup is 13 identical particles each with charge 2e. Oh, wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. The problem says 12 of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So, I guess the 13th is at the center, and the others are arranged around it on a sphere of radius 2 meters.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy of the system. I'm trying to remember: when you have a system of charges, the potential energy is the work done in bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. But since all the 12 are identical and placed at the same distance from P, maybe there's a way to calculate their contributions.

Wait, no. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So the first thing is bringing the 12 charges into place around it. So each of the 12 charges is placed at 2 meters from P. But wait, isn't that each at a distance of 2 meters from the
