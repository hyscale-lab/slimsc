Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about selecting suitable reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one, sodium cyanide (NaCN), and a reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (in the presence of H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different reagents for A and B.

Hmm, okay. So I need to figure out what reagents A and B are. Let's tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, let me draw that. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. When a ketone reacts with NaCN, I think this is a nucleophilic addition. Wait, but in the presence of what?

Wait, I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition with cyanide. But usually, the reaction of ketones with HCN (or CN-) is under certain conditions. Oh right, for the formation of cyanohydrins. The cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile and adds to the carbonyl group, and then the oxygen gets a proton. So the product would be a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structure: the nitrile group (CN) is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl group. So it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no, wait. Let me see.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So the carbonyl is at position 2. When CN- adds, it would add
