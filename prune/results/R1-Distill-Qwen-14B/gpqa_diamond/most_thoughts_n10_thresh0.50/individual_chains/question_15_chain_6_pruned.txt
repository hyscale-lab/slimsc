Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method works when a planet passes in front of its host star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, shorter period means it's closer to its star, right?

The stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's host is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Oh, because if the star is more massive, it might be larger too, but in this case, their radii are the same. Interesting.

I need to find out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The probability of a transit is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a_s / a_p), or wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Let me think again. Oh right, the transit probability depends on the relative size of the planet to the star and the alignment of the orbit. The formula I remember is:

Probability = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p sin i)), but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the probability of a transit is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a_p * (1 - e^2)^0.5)), but both planets have circular orbits, so e is zero. So that part simplifies to 1/a_p.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Another approach: the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / a_p), but I might be mixing factors. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p * (something else))). Hmm.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p * sin i)), but since sin i is part
