Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I think I can figure it out.

The problem is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Let's read the question again.

We're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D.

Right, so first, I think I need to find out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Then, figure out the equivalence point, and the pH at 25% titration and the equivalence point.

Let me start by calculating the initial concentration after mixing. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³.

Molarity is moles/volume. Moles of acetic acid before dilution: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the volume is 0.04 L. So the new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, wait. Because when you dilute, the number of moles remains the same. So yes, initial moles are 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction will be: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid.

So, moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. So, to reach equivalence, moles of NaOH needed are 0.001 mol.

Since the NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, no. Wait, no, 25% of the titration refers to the amount of acid that's been neutralized. So 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So, for the 25% point, the moles of NaOH added would be 25% of 0.001 mol, which is 0.00025 mol.

Alternatively, I need to compute the concentrations at these points.

Let me tackle the two parts separately: 25% titration and equivalence point.

Starting with the 25% titration point.

At this point, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So, let's think about the reaction.

Each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, producing a mole of acetate ion.

So, in the solution after 25% titration:

Moles of CH3COOH remaining: initial moles (0.001) minus moles reacted (0.00025) = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed: 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total volume has increased because we added NaOH
