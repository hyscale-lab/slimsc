Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down what each step does and then analyze the products.

First step: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240Â°C. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. The NMR and IR data are given.

IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which I recognize as a carbonyl group (C=O). So product 1 has a ketone or maybe an ester or something with a carbonyl. But considering the starting material is adamantane with two bromine atoms, the reaction is probably a dehydrohalogenation or elimination.

Wait, KOH is a strong base. So when dibrominated compounds react with base, they usually undergo elimination, forming double bonds. Since there are two bromines on adjacent carbons (1 and 3 in adamantane?), wait, but adamantane's structure is a diamondoid, so 1 and 3 might be across each other. Hmm, maybe I should think about the structure.

Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four carbons in a chair-like arrangement. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Brs on two opposite vertices. When heated with KOH, which is a strong base, it would eliminate two equivalents of HBr, forming a double bond.

Wait, but wait, if both Brs are in positions that can eliminate, perhaps they eliminate to form a bridge structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a 1,2-elimination but with two bromines, leading to two double bonds or a ring expansion.

Hmm, but the IR shows a carbonyl, which suggests oxidation. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a diketone. Wait, no. Because KOH is a base, but I don't think it would oxidize. Wait, maybe it's an E2 elimination. So two HBr molecules are eliminated, leading to a conjugated diene or something like that.

Wait, but the NMR of product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a singlet, perhaps from an -OCH2O- group, but that's maybe stretching it. Alternatively, it could be an -O
