Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about a star with spots and how it relates to detecting an exoplanet. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

So the question says that the star has a radius equal to the Sun, and one hemisphere is covered with dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. Oh wait, wait, the filling factor is the area covered by spots over the total area of the hemisphere. So if the filling factor is 20%, that means 20% of the hemisphere's area is spots. 

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the spots are at 5000 K, right? Because 6000 minus 1000 is 5000.

Now, the problem is about photometric variations. When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view from our perspective, causing a change in brightness. This is similar to how an exoplanet transiting in front of the star would block some light. But wait, here the star is not just a single spot; it's a hemisphere covered in spots. So the varying brightness would be due to the spots rotating in and out of view as the star spins.

The question is asking what the radius of an exoplanet would need to be to produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spotted star. So, if the star wasn't spotted, what planet's radius would cause the same dip in brightness when it transits.

So, the key here is to calculate the change in brightness caused by the spots, and then compare that to the change from a planet transit.

First, let's model the brightness variation. The star's total flux without spots is based on its effective temperature. When part of the star is covered by spots, the flux decreases because spots emit less light.

The star's total flux is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4. But since we're dealing with relative changes, I think we can work with flux proportions.

The change in flux when a spot is visible can be calculated. The area of the spot compared to the star's area is important. But wait, the spots are covering a hemisphere. So the area of a hemisphere is
