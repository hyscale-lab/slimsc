Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction produces gas W, a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. Also, the melting point of B is near 277 K. There's a part about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and its analog is also a reagent.

First, let's parse the information. I think I'll start by identifying each component step by step.

Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X is probably a diatomic molecule because when it reacts, it's likely part of a common reaction. The reaction is violent, which suggests maybe something like an acid-base reaction, or perhaps a reaction involving a strong oxidizing agent.

When X reacts with liquid Y, gas W is released. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So W's formula would have equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. Common ones are H2, O2, N2, etc. Wait, but for the same number of protons and neutrons—so if it's H2, each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, but that wouldn't match. Wait, no, wait. The molecule as a whole, not each atom. So W is a molecule with same number of protons and neutrons in total. So if W is H2O, but that's not a gas in this context. Wait, maybe CO2? Protons: 12 (C) + 16×2 (O) = 12+32=44. Neutrons: C has 6, O has 8 each, so 6 + 16 =22. No, that's 44 vs 22—doesn’t match.

Wait, another approach: the gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons in total. So for a molecule, sum of all protons equals sum of all neutrons. Let's think of possible molecules. Maybe CH4? No, that's a gas but maybe not. Let me think of H2O: H is 1, O is 8. So protons: 2 + 8 =10. Neutrons: (since H has 0, O has 8) so 0*2 +8=8. Not equal.

Another possibility: CO. Protons: C (6) + O (8) =14. Neutrons: C has 6, O has 8. So total neutrons: 6+8=14. Oh! That's equal. So W could be CO. But wait, CO is a gas and is a byproduct in some reactions. Alternatively, maybe CO2? Let me check. CO2: protons=12 (C) + 16×2= 44. Neutrons: C is 6, O is 8 each. 6 + 16=22. 44 vs 22—no. So CO is 14 each. That matches. So W could be CO.

But wait,
