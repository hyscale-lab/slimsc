Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance, given that the number varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, so I think I'll need to connect those two.

Wait, parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance in some unit, right? Like, the formula is plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So if the parallax is small, the distance is large. That makes sense because nearby stars have larger parallaxes.

Now, the number of stars N varies as 1/(plx)^5. So N is proportional to 1/plx^5. But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N would be proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that. 1 divided by (1/d)^5 is the same as d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. Oh, I think r here is the distance, like a range. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

But I'm a bit confused. The question says "per unit range of distance." So maybe it's about the differential change? Like, how does the number change as you move a little bit further. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the number density. Like, how many stars are there in a shell at distance r with thickness dr. So the number of stars in a thin shell would be proportional to the surface area of the shell times the volume element. Wait, no—the number of stars depends on distance, but in this case, the given relation is already N ∝1/plx^5, which is d^5.

Oh wait, perhaps the number of stars as a function of distance is N(r) = k * r^5, where k is a constant. So as r increases, N increases as r^5. But wait, that doesn't make sense because if you're going further away, shouldn't you see fewer stars? Because stars are more spread out. Hmm, but according to the given relation, N is proportional to plx^-5. Since plx is invers
