Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I know that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The question is asking me to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Oh wait, wait, no, actually, wait a second. The wording says A_ij = hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Or does it? Let me check: the operator's matrix elements are Aij = hbar/2 if i != j, else 0. So that's a 2x2 matrix because the electron spin is either up or down, so two states.

Wait, no, wait. The states are |up> and |down>, so the operator has a 2x2 matrix. So for a 2x2 matrix, the elements would be:

A_11 = 0 (since i=j=1)
A_12 = hbar/2
A_21 = hbar/2
A_22 = 0

So the matrix looks like this:

[ 0     hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0     ]

Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that such a matrix represents an operator proportional to the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and here each off-diagonal element is hbar/2. So the operator A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. 

Wait, wait, the Pauli matrices are usually in terms of sigma_x, sigma_y, etc. So sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So operator A is (hbar/2) * sigma_x. So, the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of sigma_x, which are the eigenstates of the X (or spin-x) operator. 

But wait, the question says that |
