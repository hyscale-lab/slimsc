Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. The setup is that a light beam is propagating through a glass with an index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the lab. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is generally given by v_medium = c / n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, this is when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. But in this case, the glass is moving, so I think we have to consider the velocity of the medium relative to the observer.

Wait, so the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. The light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. So I need to find the speed of the light as observed from the lab frame.

Hmm, maybe I should think about this using the concept of relative velocity. Oh wait, but light's speed is tricky because it's always c in a vacuum, but when a medium moves, the speed changes based on the medium's properties and motion.

Wait, no, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, but when the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed? I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

In the rest frame of the glass, the
