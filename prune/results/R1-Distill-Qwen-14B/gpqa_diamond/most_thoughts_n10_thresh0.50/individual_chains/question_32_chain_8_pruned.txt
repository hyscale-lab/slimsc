Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of relativistic mechanics. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a nucleus X is moving at 0.96c. X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, Li usually has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6? Because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. Or wait, sometimes isotopes are denoted differently. So the mass number A for Li-6 is 6, so the nucleus is Li-6.

I remember that the energy of a particle in relativity is given by the total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Oh wait, but wait—the question just asks for the energy, which I think refers to the total energy here. Because in particle accelerators, the energy they refer to is usually the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. Hmm, I need to clarify.

Wait, the problem says the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c. RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so the energy is the total energy. Because when they say the energy of the collider, they mean the total energy each ion has. So I should calculate the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy.

So first, I need to find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is mc². But wait, what's the mass of Li-6? I think it's approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons, but I might need to look it up or remember the exact value.

Wait, the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is about 6 atomic mass units (u). Because a proton is about 1.007276 u, a neutron is about 1.008665 u. But wait, the actual mass of Li-6 is a bit less than 6 u because of binding energy. Oh wait, but for heavy ions, the mass is approximately the mass number times u. Hmm, but maybe I should look for the precise value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to just use the mass number in atomic mass units, then convert it into energy.
