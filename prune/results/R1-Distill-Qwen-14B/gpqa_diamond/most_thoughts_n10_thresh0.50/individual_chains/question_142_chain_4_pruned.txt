Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. Pure states are like |ψ><ψ|, but this one looks like a mix of |0> and |1>.

Wait, each term in the sum is a projector, right? |0><0| is the projector onto state |0>, same for |1>. So when I add them, that should give me the identity matrix for a qubit, because |0> and |1> form an orthonormal basis. Oh wait, but wait—no, because the identity matrix for a qubit is 2x2. Let me check:

|0><0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 and 0. Similarly, |1><1| is diagonal with 0 and 1. Adding them gives a 2x2 identity matrix. Then multiplying by 1/2 would give (1/2)I. So ρ is (1/2) * [[1,0],[0,1]]. That makes sense. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with 1/2 and 1/2 on the diagonal. So ρ = [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubits space. Hmm, I'm thinking that qubit states are in a 2-dimensional Hilbert space, but when we talk about the geometry, maybe we're referring to the Bloch sphere representation.

Wait, the Bloch sphere is a way to represent single qubit states. Each qubit state can be represented as a point on the unit sphere. For a pure state |ψ>, it's a vector on the sphere, but for a mixed state, like this density matrix, how does that fit in?

I remember that for a mixed state, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector with magnitude ≤1. So when
