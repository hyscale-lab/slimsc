Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

Alright, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed. So I'm thinking that means their density is the same throughout space, right? But wait, when they say 'uniformly distributed in the sky,' does that refer to their angular distribution or their actual spatial distribution? Hmm, maybe it's about how they appear in the sky, but the underlying assumption is that their physical distribution in space is uniform. That makes more sense.

Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that the distance d (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of the parallax plx (in arcseconds), so d = 1/plx. So parallax is inversely proportional to distance.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Let's say we're looking at a small range in parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx. How does the number of stars in that range, N, depend on plx?

I think it has to do with how the volume of space changes with distance. Because if stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a given volume depends on the volume. So if you're looking at a shell between distance d and d+dd, the volume of that shell is 4πd² dd (since it's a spherical shell). 

But wait, parallax is related to distance. So plx = 1/d. So if plx increases, d decreases. The question is about per unit parallax, so we need to express everything in terms of plx.

Let me think. The number of stars in a thin shell would be proportional to the volume of the shell. The volume of a shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² dd. Since number density n is uniform, N = n * 4π d² dd. But we want this in terms of plx.

Since d = 1/plx, substituting that in: 4π (1/plx)^2 * dd.

But wait, how does dd relate to dplx? Because plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But since we're looking for the number of stars per unit plx, I think we can take the absolute value.

So substituting, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, wait, let me make sure. So, dd = (d dplx) where d is the derivative. Let me compute dd in terms of dplx.

dd = derivative of d with respect to plx times dplx. Since d = 1/plx, dd/d plx = -1/plx². So d d = (-1/plx²) dplx. But since we're dealing with positive ranges
