Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and jot down what I know.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I think this means we're dealing with spin-½ particles because those have two eigenstates for the z-component.

The first part asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. This operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, okay, so what does this matrix look like?

Well, for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are hbar/2. So the matrix A would be:

[0   hbar/2]
[hbar/2  0 ]

Wait, but this looks familiar. Oh right, the Pauli matrices! The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So if we take (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix, that's exactly what this A matrix is. So operator A must be (hbar/2) σ_x. Because σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, so the eigenstates would be the eigenstates of σ_x.

So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σ_x. What are the eigenstates of σ_x? Oh right, they are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) for eigenvalue +1, and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) for eigenvalue -1.

But wait, the problem states that the operator has matrix A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, else 0. So the operator is A = (hbar/2)(σ_x), right? So the eigenstates are the same as σ_x.

Wait, but the state we're given is |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So maybe we should normalize this state first. Because when we calculate probabilities, we need it to be a unit vector.

So first step: find the normalization factor for |alpha>.

Let me compute the inner product <alpha|alpha>. Let's denote |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> multiplied by a normalization constant, say c. So |alpha> = c [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ].

The inner product <alpha|alpha> is c² [ (1-i)(2+i) + (2+i)(1-i) ] + other terms? Wait, no, more carefully: the state is a linear combination, so the inner product is:

(1-i) * (1+i) * |<up|up>| + (1-i)(2-i)*|<up|down>| + (2+i)(1+i)*|<down|up>| + (2+i)(2-i)*|<down|down>|

Wait, |up> and |down> are orthon
