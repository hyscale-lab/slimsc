Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question talks about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. The goal is to find the energy difference that would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A through D.

Hmm, okay, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It says that there's a fundamental limit to how precisely certain pairs of physical properties can be known. One of the key applications is the energy-time uncertainty relation. The formula I recall is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Wait, but I think in many contexts, people use ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt, ignoring the 1/2 factor because the exact value isn't critical for order-of-magnitude estimates. So the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime (which is the time uncertainty). That makes sense because a shorter lifetime means a less precise measurement of energy.

So the idea here is that for each energy level, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime. If the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainties, then they can be distinguished. But if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the states might not be resolvable.

Let me think about each state. The first has a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds. Let's compute the uncertainty in energy for that. Similarly, the second has 10^-8 seconds.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between the two states. So, we need to ensure that the energy difference is larger than the combined uncertainties of both states? Or do we compare it to each individually?

No, wait, actually, each state's energy has its own uncertainty. The energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of both states so that they can be clearly distinguished. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainty, the two energies could overlap in their possible ranges.

Wait, another approach: the energy difference ΔE must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Or perhaps the uncertainty in the difference is the sum of the uncertainties of E1 and E2.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Let me clarify.

Each state has its own energy uncertainty. The energy difference between the two states, ΔE = E2 - E1 (assuming E2 > E1), must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties to be resolvable. Because if ΔE is smaller than the sum, there's a possibility that the uncertainties could make E2 and E1 overlap.

Wait, perhaps I should model this with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

The uncertainty in energy for each state is ΔE_i ≈ ħ / Δt_i.

So for state 1: ΔE1 ≈ ħ / (1e-9 s)
State 2: ΔE2 ≈ ħ / (1e-8 s)

So ΔE1 is larger than ΔE2 because the lifetime is shorter for state 1. So ΔE1 > ΔE2.

The total uncertainty when considering the difference between E2 and E1 would be ΔE
