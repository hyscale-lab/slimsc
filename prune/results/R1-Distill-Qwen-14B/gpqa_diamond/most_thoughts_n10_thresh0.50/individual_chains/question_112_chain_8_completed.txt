Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The state of the electron is given as |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because the question says it's proportional, meaning it's not necessarily normalized yet.

The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I know are the standard spin-up and spin-down states. Each has eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively. But maybe that's not directly needed here.

The next part says we need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix then, since it's for spin-½ particles. Let me write this matrix out.

So for a 2x2 matrix, A would look like:
[0, ħ/2]
[ħ/2, 0]

Because when i≠j, the elements are ħ/2, and diagonal elements are 0. Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh right! That's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (ħ/2) * σ_x.

Wait, but the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of σ_x, right? Because multiplying by a scalar doesn't change the eigenvectors, just the eigenvalues. So the eigenstates are the eigenstates of σ_x, which are |+x> and |-x>, the spin states aligned along the x-axis.

So the problem now is to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates, and then the probabilities will be the square of the coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to diagonalize the operator A in terms of the standard basis (|up> and |down>), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to rewrite |alpha> in the basis of the eigenstates of A.

Wait, but perhaps another approach is to find the eigenstates of A and then project |alpha> onto them. Let me think.

First, let's find the eigenstates of A. The matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. The eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0.

So the matrix A - λI is [[-λ, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -λ]]. The determinant is λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0 → λ² = ħ²/4 → λ = ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

To find the eigenvectors, for λ=+ħ/2: (A - (ħ/2)I)|v> = 0.

The matrix becomes [[-ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -ħ/2]]. So the equations are:

(-ħ/2)v1 + (ħ/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 = 0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvector can be written as |+x> = (1, 1) / sqrt(2), because the sum of squares must be 1. So normalized, it's (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2, the matrix becomes [[ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, ħ/2]]. The equations are (ħ/2)(v1 + v2) =0 → v1 = -v2. So the eigenvector is (1, -1)/sqrt(2) → |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2).

So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |−x>, as I thought.

Now, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let's first normalize |alpha>.

Let me compute the normalization factor. Let the state be |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a = (1+i), b = (2 -i).

The norm squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2: |1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|b|^2: |2 -i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5.

So the total norm squared is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> all divided by sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [(1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>]/sqrt(7).

Now, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |−x>, because those are the measurement eigenstates, and the probabilities are the square magnitudes of the coefficients.

So let's write |alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |−x>.

We can find c_+ and c_- by projecting |alpha> onto |+x> and |−x>, respectively.

|+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

So c_+ = < +x | alpha >.

Similarly, c_- = < -x | alpha >.

Let me compute c_+:

c_+ = [ ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) )

So computing the inner product:

= [ (1+i) + (2−i) ] / [ sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) ) ]

Wait, no. Wait, the inner product is (1+i) * 1 (since <up|up> is 1) plus (2-i) * 1 (since <down|down> is 1), but wait, wait. Wait, the inner product is:

c_+ = (1+i)* (1) / sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) + (2−i) (1) / sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) ?

Wait, no, let me compute it properly.

Wait, the inner product < +x | alpha> is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

So the inner product is (1+i) <up|up> / sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) + (2−i) <down|up> / sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) + (1+i) <up|down> / sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) + (2−i) <down|down> / sqrt(2)*sqrt(7).

But <down|up> and <up|down> are zero. So only the terms where the same basis states are present contribute.

So c_+ = (1+i + 2 -i) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

Simplify numerator: (1+2) + (i -i) = 3 + 0 =3.

So c_+ = 3 / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) = 3 / sqrt(14).

Similarly, c_- = < -x | alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Again, compute:

(1+i) <up|up> / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) - (2 -i) <down|down> / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

Which is (1+i - (2 -i)) / (sqrt(14)) )

Simplify numerator: 1 + i -2 + i = (-1) + 2i.

So c_- = (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14).

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2:

(3/sqrt(14))² = 9 /14 ≈ 0.64286.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.64286, which is about 0.64 when rounded. Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 0.64 as the first probability.

Now |c_-|^2 is |(-1 +2i)|² /14.

The magnitude squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5. So |c_-|^2=5/14≈0.3571, which is about 0.36.

So probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but wait, that's one part. The question also asks for the average value of the operator A.

The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

But since A is a 2x2 matrix, perhaps it's easier to compute this directly.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, and the expectation value of X is given by the Bloch vector's x-component, but perhaps I should compute it directly.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is expressed in terms of |+x> and |−x>, the expectation value would be c_+ * (ħ/2) * (1) + c_- * (ħ/2)*(-1) ) because |+x> has eigenvalue +ħ/2 and |−x> has eigenvalue -ħ/2.

Wait, let's think again. The expectation value of A is sum (c_i * lambda_i ), where lambda_i are the eigenvalues.

So lambda_+ is +ħ/2, lambda_- is -ħ/2.

So <A> = |c_+|^2 * (ħ/2) + |c_-|^2 * (-ħ/2) ) ?

Wait, no, no. Because the expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha> = sum_i (c_i^* * lambda_i * c_i ), which is sum_i |c_i|^2 lambda_i.

So <A> = |c_+|^2 (ħ/2) + |c_-|^2 ( - ħ/2 )

We have |c_+|^2 = 9/14, |c_-|^2=5/14.

So <A> = (9/14)*(ħ/2) + (5/14)*(-ħ/2) ) = [ (9 -5) * ħ/2 ] /14.

That's (4 * ħ/2 ) /14 = (2 ħ ) /14 = ħ/7.

Wait, so the average value is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options, option A) has probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7. That matches.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Because the way I computed <A> as 9/14*(ħ/2) + 5/14*(-ħ/2).

That's (9-5) * (ħ/2) * (1/14) ) → 4 * (ħ/2) * (1/14) = 2 ħ /14 = ħ/7. Yep, that's correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64286 and 0.35714, which round to 0.64 and 0.36. Wait, but 9/14 is about 0.642857, which is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places. 5/14 is approximately 0.3571, which is 0.36.

So the first part of the answer is 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7. So looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7. So option A is the correct one.

Wait, but let me check the normalization again. Because when I calculated c_+, I got 3/sqrt(14), which is correct because |c_+|^2 is 9/14. Similarly, |c_-|^2 is 5/14. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which sum to 14/14=1, correct.

Another way to compute the expectation value is using the standard matrix representation.

The state |alpha> is (1+i, 2-i) / sqrt(7). Let me represent this as a column vector: [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The operator A is a 2x2 matrix [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

The expectation value is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A multiplied by |alpha>.

So |alpha>^dagger = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ]

Multiplying by A:

|alpha>^dagger A |alpha> = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7) , (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Compute the product:

First, compute A |alpha>:

A |alpha> = [ (0)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (ħ/2)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (ħ/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

So A |alpha> = [ ( (2 -i) * ħ/2 ) / sqrt(7), ( (1+i) * ħ/2 ) / sqrt(7) ) ]

Now, multiply by |alpha>^dagger:

[ (1-i)/sqrt(7) , (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ ( (2 -i) ħ/2 ) / sqrt(7), ( (1+i) ħ/2 ) / sqrt(7) ]

Each term is:

(1-i)(2-i) * ħ/2 / (7) + (2+i)(1+i) * ħ/2 /7.

Compute each part:

First term: (1-i)(2-i) = 2 -i -2i +i² = 2 -3i -1 (since i²=-1) → 1 -3i.

Second term: (2+i)(1+i) = 2(1) + 2i +i(1) +i² → 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

So the sum is (1-3i) + (1+3i) = 2.

Multiply by ħ/2 and 1/7:

So [2 * ħ/2 ] /7 → ħ /7.

Which matches the earlier result. So the average is indeed ħ/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (≈0.64) and 5/14 (≈0.36), average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7. So that's correct.


The problem involves an electron in the state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator **A**, whose matrix representation is given by A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of **A** must be computed.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The given state is |α⟩ = (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. To normalize it, compute the norm:
\[
\|α\|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩ \right).
\]

### Step 2: Identify the eigenstates of **A**
The operator **A** has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenstates of **A** are the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix, which are:
\[
|+x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |up⟩ + |down⟩ \right), \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |up⟩ - |down⟩ \right).
\]

### Step 3: Express |α⟩ in terms of |+x⟩ and |-x⟩
To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, project |α⟩ onto these eigenstates:
\[
c_+ = ⟨+x|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
c_- = ⟨-x|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:
\[
P(+x) = |c_+|^2 = \left( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64,
\]
\[
P(-x) = |c_-|^2 = \left( \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the average value of **A**
The average value of **A** is given by:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle α|A|α⟩.
\]
Using the eigenstates of **A**:
\[
\langle A \rangle = P(+x) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-x) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Substitute the probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of **A** are approximately **0.64** and **0.36**, and the average value of **A** is **ħ/7**. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**A) 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7.**
