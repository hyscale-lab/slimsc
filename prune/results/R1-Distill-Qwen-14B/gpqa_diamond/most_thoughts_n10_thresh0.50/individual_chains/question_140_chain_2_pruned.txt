Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, wait, if a molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, that means each atom in the molecule must have equal numbers of N and P. Hmm, because protons are in the nucleus, and neutrons also. So for each atom in W, the number of protons equals the number of neutrons.

Wait, but wait. The molecule as a whole? Or each atom? I think each atom because if the molecule has multiple atoms, like maybe H2O, each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so that's not equal. So probably each atom in W has equal protons and neutrons. So for example, carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. Or oxygen-16 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. Or maybe something else.

But the gas W is released. Let's think about common gases. CO2 is a gas, but in CO2, each C has 6 protons, 8 neutrons (assuming C-12). O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons each. So for CO2, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, but C has 6 each. So W can't be CO2 because the atoms in W don't all have equal protons and neutrons.

Wait, but W is a molecule where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. So perhaps the molecule is something like CO2 where each O has 8p and 8n, but the C doesn't. So that may not fit. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is something like CH4? No, C has 6, H has 1 each. Doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach. The molecule W has same number of protons and neutrons. That would make each atom in W have the same number of protons and neutrons. For example, if the molecule is O2, each O has 8p and 8n. So O2 would fit. Or maybe another diatomic gas like N2? Wait, N has 7 p and 7 n if it's N-14
