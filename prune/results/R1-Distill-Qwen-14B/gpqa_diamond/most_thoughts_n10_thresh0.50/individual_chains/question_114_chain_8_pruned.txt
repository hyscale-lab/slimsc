Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two different reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A to D, each giving possible reagents A and B.

Hmm, I remember that NaCN is a nucleophile. But wait, butan-2-one is a ketone. So, I think this is some kind of nucleophilic addition reaction. When ketones react with something like CN-, maybe it's a substitution? Or maybe it's a condensation reaction.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When NaCN is added, I think in the presence of an acid catalyst, the ketone might undergo a reaction where the carbonyl group is attacked. Oh wait, isn't that the formation of a cyanohydrin? Yes, I remember that. A cyanohydrin is formed when a ketone reacts with cyanide ion in the presence of an acid catalyst. So, the product would have an alcohol and a nitrile
