Okay, so I've got this science question here about mitochondria and a new anti-diabetes drug. Hmm, I'm trying to figure out which experiment wouldn't help determine the drug's effect on mitochondria. Let me think through each option step by step.

The question says that the drug's effect is being tested on HEK293 cells. So, I need to figure out which experiment doesn't relate to mitochondrial function.

Option A: Differential centrifugation extraction of mitochondria followed by a glucose uptake assay. Wait, differential centrifugation is a method to isolate mitochondria because they're dense and pellet under certain speeds. If they extract mitochondria and then do a glucose uptake assay, that might measure how well the mitochondria are taking in glucose. But wait, don't mitochondria primarily use fatty acids and other molecules, not glucose? Or maybe they can take up glucose under certain conditions. Either way, this assay would look at mitochondrial function, so this experiment would help. So A is not the correct answer.

Option B: Transformation with recombinant luciferase and luminometer reading after luciferin addition. Hmm. Wait, luciferase is an enzyme used in reporter assays. If the cells are transformed with luciferase, and then luciferin is added, they'll produce light. But how does that relate to mitochondria? Oh wait, there's a thing called the ATP luciferase assay. Mitochondria produce ATP, and if the drug affects ATP production, the luciferase would light up less.
