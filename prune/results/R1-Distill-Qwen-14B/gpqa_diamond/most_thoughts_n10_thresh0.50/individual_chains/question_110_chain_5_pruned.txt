Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs. The question gives me some key points about their observing capabilities. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, meaning it can see stars up to about magnitude 17. HIRES can go down to 16 mag, so it's a bit more sensitive. So any star that is brighter than 17 mag (which is fainter than 17, wait no, wait, brighter is lower magnitude number. Oh, right, magnitude scale is a bit tricky. So a star with magnitude 16 is brighter than 17. So ESPRESSO can see up to 17, and HIRES can see up to 16. So any star that is brighter than 17 mag (i.e., magnitude less than 17) can be seen by both. Wait no, because if a star is brighter than 17 mag, its actual V magnitude is lower (like 16 or lower). So both can observe stars that are brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait, but the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Oh wait, no, that's confusing. Because apparent magnitude is the brightness as seen from Earth. So if a star's apparent V mag is brighter than 17 (i.e., magnitude less than 17), it's brighter than that threshold. So for ESPRESSO, any star with V mag ≤17 can be observed. For HIRES, stars with V mag ≤16 can be observed. So a star that's V mag=16.5 can't be observed by HIRES because 16.5 is greater than 16. Wait no, no, wait: lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So if the apparent V mag is brighter than 17, that's magnitude less than 17. So if a star is 16.5, it's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can observe it. But
