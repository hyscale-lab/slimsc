Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let's parse that. So the structure probably has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group attached to the cyclohexane, and there's an aldehyde group as well. Wait, no, the name suggests maybe the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part is attached to the cyclohexane ring, and the substituent is at position 1.

Wait, the structure would be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent at position 1. That substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So maybe the molecule is like a cyclohexane ring with a CH(OH)CH2-cyclohexyl group attached, and also a formyl group (aldehyde) at position 1.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the substituent is at position 1. So the substituent is a hydroxy methyl group attached to cyclohexane. So the substituent is -CH2
