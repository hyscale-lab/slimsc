Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit confused, but let's break it down. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the concentration given is 0.02 M. The temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. 

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, and the formation constant K is a measure of how strong the complex is. A high K value like 5e10 suggests it's a very stable complex, so the calcium ions are probably tightly bound.

Wait, the problem gives me that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. But I'm being asked about the concentration of free calcium ions. Since the complex is formed, the free Ca^2+ concentration should be really low, right? Because the K is so large, almost all the Ca should be tied up in the complex.

The formation constant K for a complex like Ca-EDTA would be the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The K is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). So if I know K and the concentration of the complex, I can find [Ca^2+] if I know [EDTA^4-], or vice versa.

But wait, in this solution, the problem says it's the stoichiometric solution. Stoichiometric means that the amounts of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- are exactly in the ratio needed to form the complex. So if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, that implies that all the Ca and EDTA present are used to form this complex. So, for every mole of Ca, a mole of EDTA is used.

Wait, but if the solution is at stoichiometric point, does that mean that all the Ca and EDTA have formed the complex? So the initial concentrations must have been equal because the reaction is 1:1. So, for example, if you started with 0.02 M Ca^2+ and 0.02 M EDTA, they would form 0.02 M CaEDTA^2-.

But in reality, there might be some equilibrium. Oh wait, but the problem states it's at stoichiometric, so maybe we're assuming that all the Ca and EDTA have reacted. But wait, that can't be right because at equilibrium, some will remain as free ions. But wait, no, because the formation constant is so large, K is 5e10, which is a very large number, meaning the complex is almost completely formed.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to consider that in the solution, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we can find the concentrations of the individual ions. Let me think.

Let me write the reaction again: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2-.

At equilibrium, the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. Let’s assume that the concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- are x. Because the formation of the complex consumes them. 

Wait, but in a 1:1 reaction, the initial concentrations would be such that [Ca], [EDTA], and [Complex] are related. But if the solution is made by adding Ca^2+ and EDTA such that their stoichiometric amounts are exactly 0.02 M each, then upon forming the complex, the concentration of the complex would be 0.02 M, and the remaining Ca and EDTA would be negligible. But with K being 5e10, the concentrations of the free ions would be extremely low.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to treat the formation of the complex. Let me consider the equilibrium. The formation constant K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-}) =5e10.

At the stoichiometric point, the concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- are equal because they were initially in a 1:1 ratio. So, let me denote [Ca^2+] = [EDTA^4-] = x.

So, substituting into the equation: 5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) → 5e10 = 0.02 / (x²).

Wait, wait! Wait, no. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. The other species, Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-, are x each. So, K = [complex]/([Ca][EDTA]) = 5e10 = 0.02/(x²).

So, solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 2e-12 / 5e10? Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 0.02 /5e10 = 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/(5)) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → wait, sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5. So 2e-6.5 → but wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. So 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2*3.16e-7 is approx 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, that would make x about 6.3e-7 M. So [Ca^2+] is 6.3e-7 M, which is option C. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7, which matches.

Wait, but I should double-check my calculations. Let me recalculate.

K = 5e10 = [complex]/([Ca][EDTA]) → [Ca][EDTA] = [complex]/K.

Since [Ca] = [EDTA] = x,

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2.

So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 → (0.4) *1e-12 = 4e-13.

x² =4e-13 → x= sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5.

Wait, 2e-6.5 is 2 * 1e-6.5 → 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2 times that is ~6.32e-7 M.

So the [Ca^2+] is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex \([ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ]\) is given as 0.02 M. Let the concentrations of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) be \(x\). The formation constant is expressed as:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.
