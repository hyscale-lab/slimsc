Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Hmm, let me think about it. The question says that in a certain region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are various powers of r.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax plx is the reciprocal of distance in parsecs. So plx = 1 / r, where r is in parsecs. Oh wait, no, actually, the formula is r = 1 / plx. So if the parallax plx increases, the distance decreases. Because as something gets closer, its parallax appears larger.

The problem says the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But I want to express N in terms of distance r, since the question is about how N changes with r.

Since r = 1 / plx, I can substitute plx with 1/r. Let me plug that into the equation. So 1/(plx)^5 becomes 1/( (1/r)^5 ) which is r^5. Because (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, and 1 over that is r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, so that would mean the number of stars is proportional to r^5. So for a given range of r, how does N change? Hmm, I think the question is about the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars per unit volume (or maybe per unit distance) would be r^5.

Wait, but wait, when we talk about distance in the sky, it's a bit different. Let me think in terms of flux or density. Oh, but in this question, the relation is given as N varies with 1/plx^5. So if I'm considering a thin shell at radius r, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to r^5.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So per unit change in r. So if N ∝ r^5, then the derivative dN/dr would be 5 r^4. But wait, the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars in that region
