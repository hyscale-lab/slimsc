Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm.

First, I remember that the interplanar distance d is given by the formula d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² - 2lm cos α - 2ln cos β - 2mn cos γ)), where a is the lattice parameter, and l, m, n are the Miller indices. Wait, but wait... wait, does that apply to any crystal system or only specific ones? Because rhombohedral is a bit tricky since all angles are equal, and sometimes it's treated similarly to cubic systems.

Wait, no, wait. Rhombohedral systems have all sides equal (a = b = c) but angles α = β = γ, which aren't necessarily 90 degrees. So in this case, the problem gives a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance (so lattice parameter a) of 10 Angstroms, and all angles are 30 degrees. The plane is (111), so l=1, m=1, n=1.

So the formula I need is the general one for interplanar spacing in any crystal system. Let me write that down again. The formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cosα - 2hl cosβ - 2kl cosγ). Wait, but in rhombohedral, since a = b = c, and angles are same, maybe the formula can be simplified.

Wait, wait, in a rhombohedral system, the three axes are equal, a = b = c. So the formula might have a more symmetric form. Let me see. Let me think about the general case. The interplanar distance is given by the reciprocal of the square root of (h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ), multiplied by a. So yeah, that's correct.

In this problem, h, k, l are all 1 for the (111) plane. So plugging those in:

d = a / sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 - 2*1*1 cos
