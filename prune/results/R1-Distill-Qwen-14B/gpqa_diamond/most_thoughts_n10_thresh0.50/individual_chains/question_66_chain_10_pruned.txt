Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Hmm, I need to think through what each of these symmetries means and how they apply to operators in SMEFT.

First, let me recall what SMEFT is. SMEFT is a framework that extends the Standard Model (SM) by including higher-dimensional operators, which are suppressed by a high energy scale, usually the Planck scale. These operators parameterize our ignorance of new physics beyond the SM. But when we construct these operators, certain symmetries must be preserved; these are the same symmetries that the SM respects.

So, the first symmetry is Lorentz Symmetry. I remember that all SM interactions respect Lorentz symmetry, which includes rotations and boosts. So any operator in SMEFT must also respect this because they are supposed to be Lorentz-invariant. So Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations? Oh right, because the Poincare group includes both Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations. The SM respects this, so SMEFT operators must also respect Poincare symmetry. But wait, isn't that automatically included if the theory is Lorentz-invariant and has a well-defined energy-momentum? So if the operators are Lorentz scalars, then they would automatically satisfy Poincare symmetry because you can move the origin with translations. So does that mean that respecting Lorentz symmetry implies respecting Poincare? Or are they separate?

Hmm, I think that in QFT, the Poincare symmetry is more about the spacetime symmetries in general. The SM includes Poincare symmetry as part of its fundamental structure. So in SMEFT, the operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare. But wait, if Lorentz symmetry is already included, then Poincare is too, because the operators are built as Lorentz scalars, so they transform correctly under both rotations, boosts, and translations. So does that mean that when you respect Lorentz symmetry, you automatically respect Poincare? Or is Poincare a separate condition that also must be satisfied?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: the P
