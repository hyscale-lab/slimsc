Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But wait, which symmetries are these?

The question asks which of the listed symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. Let me think about each one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think that in any relativistic quantum field theory, operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. Because SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, it should maintain the same symmetry principles as the Standard Model. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely one that must be respected. So option 1 is correct.

Then Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if the theory is Lorentz symmetric, does it automatically have Poincare? Well, I think SMEFT is formulated in a way that includes all Poincare symmetries. Or wait, no. Wait, the Poincare group includes the Lorentz group and translations. But in an effective theory, perhaps the operators are constructed in such a way that they are invariant under Poincare. But is that a must-respect symmetry?

Wait, SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, but does that imply Poincare? Because Poincare includes translations. So if the operators must be invariant under the full Poincare group, then yes. But I'm
