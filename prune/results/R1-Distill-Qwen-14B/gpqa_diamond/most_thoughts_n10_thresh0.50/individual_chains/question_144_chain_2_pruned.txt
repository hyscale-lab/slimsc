Okay, so I have this physics problem about meson resonances, and I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are its production energy (E_X = 8 GeV), mass (m_X = 1.2 GeV), and width (Γ_X = 320 MeV). The options are four different distances in meters, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance (or mean proper decay length) is related to the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. The formula I think is something like c * τ * β, where c is the speed of light, τ is the lifetime, and β is the velocity over the speed of light (v/c).

Wait, right, because the particle is moving, so the decay length is how far it travels before decaying. So first I need to find the lifetime τ, then multiply it by βγ (but wait, no, since β is v/c and γ is the Lorentz factor, but wait, I'm a bit confused here).

Wait, let's think. The mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ via the uncertainty principle. The natural linewidth is Γ = ħ/τ, so τ = ħ/Γ. Oh wait, but actually, Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime by τ = ħ/(Γ). So yes, that's the first step.

But wait, units are going
