Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data are E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, with some numbers in meters. I remember that decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime and its velocity. 

Wait, right. The mean decay distance (L) is calculated using L = v * τ, where τ is the mean lifetime. Oh, but how do I find τ? Oh, right, τ is related to the width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. I think τ is approximately ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

But wait, let me be careful. The width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. That makes sense. So once I have τ, I need to find v, the velocity of the meson.

Hmm, how to find v? Well, the meson is produced with energy E_X, which is 8 GeV. The mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So I can find the velocity using relativistic equations. The energy of a relativistic particle is E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. So γ = E / (m c²). But since E and m are given in GeV, and c is a big number, perhaps I can compute β, the ratio of velocity to the speed of light, using β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

Wait, let's get the formula right. So, E = γ m c², so γ = E / (m c²). Plugging in the numbers: E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.667. 

Then, β is sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). Let's compute 1/γ². γ is 6.667, so γ squared is about 44.444. So 1/44.444 is roughly 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887, which is about 0.989. 

So, β ≈ 0.989, which means the velocity v is 0.989c. But wait, let me double-check that calculation. Let me compute γ more accurately. 8 divided by 1.2 is exactly 6.666..., so 6.666666... so γ squared is (6.6667)^2 = 44.4444. So 1/44.4444 is approximately 0.0225. So yeah, 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887, so yes, β is around 0.9887.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute it more precisely. Let me calculate 1/γ² exactly. 8 GeV divided by 1.2 GeV gives 8/1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.6666667. So (20/3)^2 is 400/9 ≈44.444444. So 1/(400/9) is 9/400 = 0.0225. So yes, that part is correct.

So, β is sqrt(1 - 9/(400)) = sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(391)/20. Wait, 391 is 19.774... So sqrt(391) = approx 19.774, divided by 20 is about 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887c. 

Now, the lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. Let me make sure about the units. ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, no: ħ is 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds? Wait, no, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, but more accurately, ħ is 197.33 MeV·fm, which is a commonly used value. Alternatively, in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but I need to be careful here.

Wait, let me think in terms of units. Γ is given in MeV. So I need to convert ħ into units that will cancel out the GeV or MeV in Γ.

Wait, I might be mixing units. Let me get this right. Let me write down the formula:

τ = ħ / Γ

But the units for ħ are J·s (joule-seconds), but in particle physics, it's often expressed in units of GeV·s. So ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, and ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.054e-34 J·s. But converting to GeV·s: 1 J = 6.242e12 eV, so 1 J·s = 6.242e12 eV·s. So ħ = 1.054e-34 J·s = 1.054e-34 * 6.242e12 eV·s ≈ 6.582e-25 eV·s. Wait, but GeV is 1e9 eV, so 6.582e-25 eV·s equals 6.582e-34 GeV·s. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recheck.

Wait, 1 GeV = 1e9 eV. So 1 eV·s = 1e-9 GeV·s. So ħ in GeV·s is 6.582e-25 (eV·s) * (1 GeV / 1e9 eV) ) = 6.582e-25 / 1e9 = 6.582e-34 GeV·s? Wait, that seems way too small. Hmm, maybe I confused the numbers. Let me look up the value of ħ in GeV·s.

I think ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds. Yes, that sounds right because when Γ is in GeV, dividing by ħ in GeV·s gives τ in seconds.

So, Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me do the math: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32.

6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32 ) * 1e-25.

6.582 / 0.32 = let's calculate that. 0.32 * 20 = 6.4, which is 6.4, and 6.582-6.4=0.182. 0.182 / 0.32 is approximately 0.56875. So 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. So τ ≈ 2.057e-24 seconds.

Now, the velocity v is approximately 0.9887c. The speed of light c is 3e8 meters per second. So v = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, the decay length L is v * τ. So L = (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.057e-24 s) ≈ let's calculate that.

2.966e8 * 2.057e-24 = 

Multiply 2.966 * 2.057 ≈ let me compute that.

2.966 * 2 = 5.932, 2.966 *0.057≈ 0.167. So total ≈ 6.099.

So 6.099e(8-24) = 6.099e-16 meters.

Wait, 8 -24 is -16. So 6.099e-16 m. But wait, the options are in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16.

Looking at the options:

A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m

B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m

C)5.0223 *10^-15 m

D) 4.0655 *10^-16 m

Hmm, my calculation got about 6e-16 m, but none of the options are near 6e-16. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

First, let's compute τ more accurately. Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / 0.32 GeV = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s.

6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24 s. That's correct.

Next, velocity. Let me compute β more accurately. Earlier, I approximated it as 0.9887, but perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

Wait, actually, in natural units where c=1, it's beta = sqrt(1 - m^2 / E^2).

So m is 1.2 GeV, E is 8 GeV.

So m² = (1.2)^2 = 1.44 GeV².

E² = 8^2 = 64 GeV².

So m²/E² = 1.44 / 64 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

So beta = sqrt(0.9775) = let me compute that more accurately.

What's sqrt(0.9775)?

Well, 0.9887^2 is approximately 0.9775 because 0.9887 * 0.9887 =?

0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.

0.0087^2 ≈ 0.00007569.

But more accurately, let's compute 0.9887^2.

0.9887 * 0.9887:

Compute (1 - 0.0113)^2 = 1 - 2*0.0113 + 0.0113^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0226 + 0.000128 ≈ 0.9775.

Yes, so beta is approximately 0.9887. So that part is correct.

So v = 0.9887 * c.

c is 3e8 m/s, so v = 0.9887 * 3e8 = 2.966e8 m/s.

So L = v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.

Wait, let me compute that again.

2.966e8 * 2.057e-24 = (2.966 * 2.057) e(8-24) = (2.966 * 2.057) e-16.

Compute 2.966 * 2.057:

2 * 2 is 4. 2.966 * 2 is 5.932.

2.966 * 0.057: let's compute 2.966 * 0.05 = 0.1483, 2.966 * 0.007 = 0.020762. So total 0.1483 + 0.020762 = 0.169062.

So 5.932 + 0.169062 ≈ 6.099062.

So 6.099062e-16 m.

Hmm, so around 6.1e-16 m. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made an error in using the correct expression for L.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should use the formula for decay length which is L = (c * τ) * β.

Which is the same as v * τ because v = β c.

So L = β c τ.

Which, with the numbers, would be the same as before.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the energy E is the total energy, so E = gamma m c². So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should compute beta more accurately. Let's compute sqrt(0.9775) with more precision.

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775). Let's compute it using the Newton-Raphson method or perhaps a calculator approach.

But perhaps a better way is to note that 0.9887^2 is 0.9775, as we saw earlier.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it using more precise steps.

Let me compute 0.9887^2 = (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*(0.98)(0.0087) + 0.0087^2.

0.98^2 = 0.9604.

2 * 0.98 *0.0087 = 2 * 0.008526 = 0.017052.

0.0087^2 is 0.00007569.

Adding all together: 0.9604 + 0.017052 = 0.977452 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.97752769. Which is very close to 0.9775. So beta is indeed approximately 0.9887.

So the calculation of L is correct, coming to about 6.1e-16 m.

But the options don't have that. So maybe I messed up the calculation of tau.

Wait, let's recheck tau calculation. Tau = ħ / Γ.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units of ħ.

Wait, ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So Γ is 0.32 GeV. So 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should use a more precise value of ħ. Let me check exact value.

I just checked, and ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. So that's correct.

Hmm, maybe the error is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider relativistic gamma when calculating the lifetime. Because the lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime. Wait, no, because the mean lifetime is already given by τ = ħ / Γ, which considers the particle's lifetime in its rest frame. But when the particle is moving, the lifetime in the lab frame is longer by a factor of gamma. Because particle's lifetime is dilated when moving.

Wait, wait! Oh, that's a crucial point. The mean lifetime τ is the proper lifetime, measured in the rest frame of the particle. But in the lab frame, the lifetime is γ τ. Because from the lab's perspective, the particle's clock is running slow. So for us, the lifetime is longer by gamma. So when calculating L = v * t_lab, t_lab is gamma * tau.

Oh! I think that's where I went wrong. I used tau as the lifetime, but actually, the lifetime in the lab frame is longer. So I should have used τ_lab = gamma * tau.

So going back, let me redo the calculation with this in mind.

So tau_rest is ħ / Γ = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

But tau_lab is gamma * tau_rest = 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ let's compute that.

6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 = (6 * 2.056875) + (0.6666667 * 2.056875) )e-24.

6 * 2.056875 = 12.34125.

0.6666667 * 2.056875 ≈ 1.37125.

So total ≈ 12.34125 + 1.37125 = 13.7125e-24 s.

So tau_lab ≈ 1.37125e-23 s.

Wait, 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

Let me compute that:

6.6666667 * 2.056875 = ?

Let's compute 6 * 2.056875 = 12.34125.

0.6666667 * 2.056875 ≈ 1.37125.

So total ≈ 12.34125 + 1.37125 = 13.7125.

So tau_lab ≈ 13.7125e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.

Now, L = v * tau_lab = 0.9887c * 1.37125e-23 s.

c =3e8 m/s.

So v = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.9661e8 m/s.

So L = 2.9661e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s = (2.9661 * 1.37125 )e(8-23) = (2.9661 * 1.37125 )e-15.

Compute 2.9661 * 1.37125.

Let me compute 3 * 1.37125 = 4.11375. But since it's 2.9661, which is 3*(0.9887), so 2.9661 = 3 * 0.9887.

So 2.9661 * 1.37125 = 3 * 0.9887 * 1.37125.

Compute 3 * 1.37125 = 4.11375.

Then 0.9887 * 4.11375 ≈ let's compute.

4 * 0.9887 = 3.9548.

0.11375 * 0.9887 ≈ approximately 0.1122.

So total ≈ 3.9548 + 0.1122 ≈ 4.067.

So the product is approximately 4.067e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15. So the closest is option B.

Wait, but let me compute 2.9661 * 1.37125 more accurately.

2.9661 * 1.37125:

= 2.9661 * 1 + 2.9661 * 0.3 + 2.9661 * 0.07 + 2.9661 * 0.00125.

= 2.9661 + 0.88983 + 0.207627 + 0.003707625.

Adding these up:

2.9661 + 0.88983 = 3.85593.

3.85593 + 0.207627 = 4.063557.

4.063557 + 0.003707625 ≈ 4.0672646.

So approximately 4.0673e-15 m.

Looking at the options again, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.

So the correct answer should be option B, 4.0655 * 1e-15 m.

Wait, but wait! Let me make sure I included gamma correctly. Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma, so I used it correctly. So yeah, that's right.

So the mistake I made earlier was forgetting to include the gamma factor in the lifetime when calculating the decay length in the lab frame.


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}}
\]

where \( v \) is the velocity of the meson and \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \) is the lifetime in the lab frame. The proper lifetime \( \tau_{\text{rest}} \) is related to the total decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau_{\text{rest}} = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

and the lab-frame lifetime is dilated by the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \):

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau_{\text{rest}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau_{\text{rest}} \)
The reduced Planck constant \( \hbar \) is approximately \( 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), and the total decay width \( \Gamma \) is given as \( 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Thus:

\[
\tau_{\text{rest}} = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.057 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X}
\]

where \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Thus:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.667
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \)
The lab-frame lifetime is:

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau_{\text{rest}} = 6.667 \cdot 2.057 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.371 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( v \)
The velocity \( v \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}, \quad v = \beta \cdot c
\]

where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). First, calculate \( \beta \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{6.667^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

Thus:

\[
v = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate \( L \)
Finally, the mean decay distance is:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}} = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.371 \times 10^{-23}) \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 6: Match with the options
The closest option to the calculated value \( 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.

### Final Answer:
Answer: B
