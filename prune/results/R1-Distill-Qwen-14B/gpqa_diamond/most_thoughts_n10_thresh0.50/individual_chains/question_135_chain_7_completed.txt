Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to wrap my head around it. The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf [ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y)], and the mass of X is 6 GeV. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different possible decay products.

Hmm, I remember that when a particle decays, the decay products must have enough energy to meet their rest mass requirements. So the mass of X has to be at least the sum of the masses of the decay products. Also, in terms of quantum numbers, the boson X is probably a scalar since it's a bosonic field, and the Lagrangian looks like it's for a Yukawa interaction.

Wait, the interaction term is something like λ f ψ̄ (v + X) ψ. So this is similar to the Yukawa coupling where a scalar (maybe the Higgs) couples to fermions. So X could be similar to a Higgs boson here. Or perhaps X is a scalar boson.

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. Now, the possible decay products would be fermion-antifermion pairs. Let's list the possible fermion pairs and their masses.

Fermions include quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top) and leptons (electron, muon, tau, neutrinos). But wait, since X is a boson and the interaction is with fermions, the decay must produce a pair of fermions.

But each fermion has a rest mass. So for X to decay into a pair of fermions f and f-bar, the sum of their masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

So let's list the masses of all the fermions:

- Up quark: around 2.2 MeV (so about 0.0022 GeV)
- Down quark: similar, maybe 4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)
- Strange quark: about 100 MeV (0.1 GeV)
- Charm quark: about 1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark: about 4.7 GeV
- Top quark: way too heavy, around 173 GeV. So X at 6 GeV can't decay into top quarks because 2*m_top is 346 GeV, which is way bigger than 6 GeV.

For leptons:
- Electron: ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon: ~0.105 GeV
- Tau: ~1.777 GeV
- Neutrinos are almost massless, so their decays would be negligible, but I don't think they are considered here because neutrinos are hard to detect and perhaps the interaction doesn't involve them.

So the possible fermion pairs would have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let's see each option:

Option A: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-
But wait, the b quark (bottom) is about 4.7 GeV. So each b is 4.7 GeV, so 2 * 4.7 is about 9.4 GeV. That's way more than 6. So X can't decay into b b-bar. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-
c quark is about 1.5 GeV. 2*1.5=3 GeV, which is less than 6. So X can decay into c c-bar. s s-bar would be 2*0.1=0.2 GeV. u and d are even lighter, so their pairs are possible. Tau is 1.777 GeV each, so 2*1.777 is about 3.55 GeV, which is under 6. So tau pairs are allowed. Muons are 0.105 GeV each, so 2*0.105 is about 0.21 GeV. Electrons are even lighter.

So the possible decay products in B are c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. So B is a possible option.

Option C: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, t t-bar, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-
Wait, t quark is the top, which is 173 GeV. 2*m_t is 346 GeV, way above 6. So X can't decay into t t-bar. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-
Same issue as option A. The b quark is 4.7 GeV, so 2*m_b is 9.4 GeV which is way above 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar. So option D is incorrect.

Wait, but let me think again. Could the X boson decay into a pair of particles where each is less than 3 GeV? Because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than 3 GeV can pair up.

Looking at the fermions:

- u: 0.0022 GeV
- d: 0.0047 GeV
- s: 0.1 GeV
- c: 1.5 GeV
- b: 4.7 GeV (too big)
- t: 173 GeV (way too big)
- e: 0.0005 GeV
- mu: 0.105 GeV
- tau: 1.777 GeV each (2 * 1.777 = 3.554 GeV, which is more than 6? Wait, no. Wait, 3.554 GeV is less than 6. So 2 *1.777 is 3.554 GeV, which is less than 6. So tau pair is allowed.

Wait, wait, wait! Wait, 2*m_tau is 3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into tau+ tau-.

So which fermion pairs are allowed?

- c c-bar: 2*1.5=3 GeV → allowed.
- s s-bar: 0.2 GeV → allowed.
- u u-bar: allowed.
- d d-bar: allowed.
- tau+ tau-: allowed.
- mu+ mu-: 0.21 GeV → allowed.
- e+ e-: allowed.

But what about b quarks? As I thought before, m_b is 4.7 GeV, so 2*m_b is 9.4 GeV >6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar.

Looking back at the options:

Option B includes c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau, mu, e. So that's correct because all their masses are under 3 GeV.

Option D includes b quark, which is not allowed.

So the correct answer must be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the given interaction Lagrangian. The decays must satisfy the condition that the total mass of the decay products is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \). The interaction term suggests that \( X \) couples to fermions, and the possible decay products are fermion-antifermion pairs.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mass Constraints**: For \( X \) to decay into a pair of fermions \( f \bar{f} \), the combined rest mass of the pair must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. This means each fermion must have a mass less than 3 GeV.

2. **Fermion Masses**:
   - Up quark (\( u \)): \( \sim 0.0022 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - Down quark (\( d \)): \( \sim 0.0047 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - Strange quark (\( s \)): \( \sim 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - Charm quark (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy, \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \))
   - Top quark (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy, \( 2m_t > 6 \, \text{GeV} \))
   - Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \) (combined mass \( 2m_\tau \sim 3.554 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \))

3. **Allowed Decays**:
   - \( c \bar{c} \): \( 2m_c = 3 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - \( s \bar{s} \): \( 2m_s = 0.2 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - \( u \bar{u} \): \( 2m_u = 0.0044 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - \( d \bar{d} \): \( 2m_d = 0.0094 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - \( \tau^+ \tau^- \): \( 2m_\tau = 3.554 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - \( \mu^+ \mu^- \): \( 2m_\mu = 0.21 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - \( e^+ e^- \): \( 2m_e = 0.001 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \)

   Decays into \( b \bar{b} \) or \( t \bar{t} \) are not allowed because their combined masses exceed 6 GeV.

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.
   - **Option B**: Lists \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Correct**.
   - **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.
   - **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) at the lowest order.

**Answer: B**
