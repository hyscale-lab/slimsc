Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle physics. Let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X.

First, the given Lagrangian is L = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that correctly. It looks like it's a Yukawa interaction term. The Lagrangian is usually written as L_int = y ψ̄ ψ X, but here it's written with some terms. Oh, wait, the way it's written, it's -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So, perhaps λf is the Yukawa coupling, and it's multiplied by the fermion fields.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me restate what I know. The interaction term is between the boson X and some fermions. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

I remember that in particle physics, a boson can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if the mass of the boson is greater than twice the mass of the fermions. So, the condition is M_X ≥ 2 m_f, where m_f is the mass of the fermion.

So, the possible decay products are pairs of fermions whose individual masses are less than half the mass of X. Since X is 6 GeV, each fermion must be less than 3 GeV in mass.

Wait, but what fermions are we considering here? The problem doesn't specify, but the interaction term involves ψ_f, which could be any fermion, but I think the options will give me clues.

Looking at the options, the decay channels include various quark and lepton pairs. The mass thresholds matter here. Let's list the masses of the known fermions:

- Up quark (u): about 2.2 MeV
- Down quark (d): about 4.7 MeV
- Strange quark (s): about 95 MeV
- Charm quark (c): about 1.27 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): about 4.7 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV
- Electron (e): negligible, ~0.0005 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.1 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Neutrinos are even lighter, but the problem doesn't mention them, so probably not in the answer.

Wait, but the problem says "lowest order," so perhaps considering tree-level decays, but that's more about the interaction type rather than kinematics.

So, for X to decay into a pair of fermions f and f̄, the sum of their rest masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Since each fermion is m, 2m ≤ 6 GeV →
