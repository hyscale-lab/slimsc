Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model plus higher-dimensional operators that are suppressed by some scale, like the Planck scale or something. But wait, the question is about which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect.

The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices given are A, B, C, D, each combining different ones.

Wait, I should think about each symmetry one by one. Let me start by recalling what each symmetry entails.

Lorentz symmetry: This is the symmetry of special relativity, meaning the laws of physics are the same for all observers in inertial frames. All interactions in the Standard Model are Lorentz invariant. SMEFT is built as an effective theory, so I think the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. Because effective theories are supposed to incorporate all the symmetries of the underlying theory, which in this case would include Lorentz symmetry.

Poincare symmetry: That's the combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations. So it includes things like momentum conservation. If Lorentz symmetry is a part of Poincare, then if operators respect Poincare, they must respect Lorentz. But wait, can operators violate Lorentz symmetry but still respect Poincare? No, because Lorentz is part of Poincare. Alternatively, if Poincare is required, then operators must also respect Lorentz. But what I'm trying to
