Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question has three parts, each being a reaction, and I need to figure out the products A, B, and C. The options are A, B, C, D, each providing different products for these reactions.

First, I'll tackle reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH. I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. So, the nucleophile is the enolate, and the electrophilic part is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile here. It's a diethyl malonate derivative. When it reacts in a Michael addition, the enolate would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. In this case, the other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of that would have a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, with a p-tolyl group on carbon 3 and a methyl ester on carbon 4 maybe? Or wait, perhaps the double bond is between 3 and 4, making the structure CH2=C(C6H4-4Me)CO2Me? Not sure, but the structure is something like that.

So the Michael donor (nucleophile) is the enolate of dimethyl malonate. When it attacks the beta carbon, the acrylate, which is the Michael acceptor, will have the nucleophile adding to the less substituted end of the double bond. Wait, noâ€”Michael addition is when the nucleophile attacks the beta position, which is the more substituted end. Or wait, no, the attack is on the beta (the less substituted side) because the alpha is the carbonyl.

Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is probably CH2=C-(p-tolyl)CO2Me, but wait, E-geometry is about the arrangement. So the substituents on either
