Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what the concentration of calcium ions is in a solution. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The problem says there's a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, okay. I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. So when Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- combine, they form a complex, right? The formula is probably CaY^2- where Y is the EDTA part.

The formation constant, K, is given. K is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where Ca^2+ and EDTA combine to form the complex. The higher the K, the more the complex is formed.

So the reaction should be: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The K for this is 5e10, which is a huge number. That means the complex is very stable, so most of the Ca and EDTA will be tied up in the complex.

The solution initially has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So I think that's the concentration of the complex at the start. But wait, what about the dissociation? Because the complex can dissociate into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. So I need to find [Ca^2+].

Since the complex dissociates, the concentration of Ca^2+ won't be zero because the complex isn't 100% stable, but with K so high, it's almost all complex. But we can't ignore it completely because the question is about the free ions.

So the setup would be using the formation constant equation. The K expression for the formation of the complex is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in the solution, the only species present are the complex and the ions from its dissociation. Since the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we can let
