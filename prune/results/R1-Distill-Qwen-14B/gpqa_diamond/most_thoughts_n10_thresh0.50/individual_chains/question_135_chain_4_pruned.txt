Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about particle physics and decay modes of a boson. Let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by some Lagrangian. The mass of X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. The options are A to D, each listing different possible decay channels.

Wait, I remember that in particle physics, the decay of a boson into fermion-antifermion pairs depends on the mass of the boson and the masses of the fermions involved. The general rule is that the boson's mass must be at least twice the mass of the fermion to allow that decay channel. Because you can't create a pair of particles whose combined rest mass exceeds the available energy.

So the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. I need to figure out which fermion pairs can be produced. Let me list the possible fermions and their masses. Wait, but wait—the fermions here are the standard model particles, right? So like electrons, muons, taus, quarks, etc.

Wait, but the given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf \bar{ψ}_f (y) (ν + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, not sure if I need to parse that. Oh, wait, maybe it's a Yukawa-type interaction. But perhaps more importantly, the interaction terms would determine which fermions the boson X can couple to. Because for a decay X → f f-bar, X must couple to the fermions f. So the Lagrangian tells us which fermions are involved.

Looking at the given Lagrangian: L = -λf \bar{ψ}_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm a bit confused by the notation. Let me try to parse this. It looks like a Yukawa interaction term. Normally, Yukawa terms are like g ψ† ψ X, where X is the boson field. So in this case, the interaction is for each fermion ψ_f, with a coupling λ_f. So the Lagrangian is written as a sum over all fermions f, each with their own coupling λ_f. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that it couples to.

But wait, the problem is about kinematically allowed decays, so even if X couples to a fermion, if the fermion's mass is too high, the decay isn't possible. So I need to consider both the coupling (from the Lagrangian) and the mass constraints.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify which fermions are allowed by the Lagrangian. So perhaps the interaction is such that X couples to all fermions, but the decay is allowed only if the fermion's mass is less than half of X's mass. Because X has a mass of 6 GeV.

So let me think about the masses of the fermions. The lightest fermions are the up and
