Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The astronomers are interested in their luminosities. The given data is: Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. From spectroscopy, the wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. Oh, and their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively. The question is about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, I remember that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power.

Wait, but the problem says they have the same wavelength at which they appear brightest. The peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (about 2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if the wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same, right? Because lambda_max depends inversely on temperature. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. Oh, right, that's about the Doppler shift. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, its emitted light's wavelength shifts. But in this case, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so no Doppler shift. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. So the observed wavelength might be different, but the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. Oh, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, no, the initial statement says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So even after considering their velocities, the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So that would imply that their intrinsic temperatures are adjusted due to Doppler shifting
