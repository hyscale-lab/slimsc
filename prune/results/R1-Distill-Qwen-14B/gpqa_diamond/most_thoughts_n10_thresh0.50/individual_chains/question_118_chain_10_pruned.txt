Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. It says, what's the major outcome when 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol reacts with bromine. Hmm, let me think. I remember that enols can undergo some kind of addition reactions, maybe something like bromination.

Wait, cyclopent-1-enol is an enol. Enols have a double bond adjacent to an -OH group. Oh right, the enol form is more reactive because of the conjugated double bond. So when bromine (Br2) is added, it should undergo an electrophilic addition.

Bromine usually adds across double bonds through an electrophylic addition mechanism. The enol has the double bond between C1 and C2. So bromine would add across that double bond. But wait, how does the stereochemistry work here?

Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, could it be a conjugate addition? No, I think for alkenes, bromine adds directly. So the initial step is the opening of Br2. The double bond would attack the Br2, leading to a cyclic bromonium ion intermediate.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is an enol. So the structure is cyclopentane with a double bond between C1 and C2, and an OH group on C1, and two methyl groups on C4. Wait, no, wait: 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So the ring is cyclopentene with substituents.

Specifically, the enol is at position 1, so the structure
