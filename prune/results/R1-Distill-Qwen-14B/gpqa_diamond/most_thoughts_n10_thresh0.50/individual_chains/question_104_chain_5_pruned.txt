Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what it's about. Oh right, exoplanets and the radial velocity method. I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble.

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits, so that's good, no eccentricity to complicate things.

The key part is about the spectral line shifts. For planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm. I think the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the Doppler shift. Oh right, K is the maximum velocity of the star towards or away from us, which causes the spectral lines to shift. So a larger K means a bigger shift. Wait, but in the question, the shift is given in terms of wavelength, not velocity. So I think I need to relate the wavelength shift to velocity.

Wait, the Doppler effect relates the change in wavelength (Δλ) to the velocity (v). The formula I remember is Δλ/λ0 = v/c, where λ0 is the original wavelength and c is the speed of light. But I'm not sure if I should be using λ0 or the rest wavelength here. Alternatively, maybe I can find the ratio of velocities without knowing the actual λ0 because it would cancel out when taking the ratio.

So for each planet, the shift is in milliangstroms. Let's call planet #1's shift Δλ1 =5 mas, and planet #2's shift Δλ2=7 mas. The ratio of their shifts would be Δλ2/Δλ1=7/5=1.4. But wait, because the Doppler shift formula is velocity proportional to the wavelength shift. So the velocity K is proportional to Δλ. So K2/K1 = Δλ2 / Δλ1 = 7/5=1.4.

But wait, I'm not sure. Wait, because the shift in wavelength is related to the velocity. So if the wavelength shifts by more
