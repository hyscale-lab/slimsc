Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, wait. The formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. Right, the reaction would be Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- â†” CaEDTA^2-. So the K expression would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-}) = K.

But wait, the problem says the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. Assuming that the solution is at ideal pH, which probably means that the EDTA is in its proper form (like Y^4-), so we don't have to worry about other forms of EDTA.

So, the CaEDTA complex is 0.02 M, which means the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Now, the formation constant is 5e10, so plugging into the equation:

K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca][EDTA])

But wait, the stoichiometry is 1:1 for Ca to EDTA. So, when the complex is formed, each mole of complex
