Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in wavelength can tell us about the planet's mass and orbital period.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet similar to Neptune. Both stars are Sun-like, and the planets have circular orbits. The key data points are the shifts in their spectral lines: planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. We need to find how much longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method relates the semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I remember is K = (v) where v is the velocity amplitide of the star. The formula for K (the radial velocity semi-amplitude) is K = ( (G * (M_p)^3 ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 * (1 - e^2) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (2π G))^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Oh, right, another approach is the formula for the semi-amplitude K:

K = ( (2π G) / (P (1-e²)^(1/2)) ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But since both planets have similar masses to Neptune, and the stars are the same, M_p is the same for both, and M_* is the same. Also, since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so (1-e²) is 1. So the formula simplifies.

So, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, let me get this right. Rearranging the formula, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3))) )

Wait, but M_p is the same for both planets, M_* is same for both stars. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So, K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

Wait, so if planet #1 has a K1 of 5 milliangstroms, and planet #2 has K2 of 7, then the ratio K1/K2 is 5/7.

But if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) )

Wait, let me think again. Let me write the formula.

Since K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)), then P ∝ 1/(K^(3)).

Wait, no, more accurately, from K = constant * (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3}) ) * (1
