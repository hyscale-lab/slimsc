Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting from compound A and leading through several steps to compound E. My goal is to identify compound E from the given options.

Let's break down the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints provided:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) The IR spectrum of compound A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

Let's start by analyzing the hints and the reactions.

First, looking at hint (a). The product when A reacts with a phosphorous ylide is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, phosphorous ylides are typically used in the Wittig reaction. The Wittig reaction usually converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. So if A reacts with a ylide to give an alkene, that suggests that A has a carbonyl group (either aldehyde or ketone).

The structure of the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw this structure mentally. Cyclopentane with substituents at positions 1,2, and 4. The substituents are methyl groups at 1 and 2, and at position 4 there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be a methylene group attached to a propane, but as a ylide? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, it's a substituent that's an alkene, perhaps.

Wait, the product is from a Wittig reaction. So the ylide would attack a carbonyl group in compound A, forming a new double bond. So compound A must have a carbonyl adjacent to some substituents.

Let me think: if the product is 1,2-dimethyl and has a propenyl group at position 4, perhaps the starting compound A is a cyclic ketone. Let's imagine A is a cyclopentanone derivative. Let's say it's 3,4-dimethylcyclopentanone? Wait, but when the Wittig reacts, it would form a double bond where the carbonyl was. So if A is a cyclopentanone with substituents, the Wittig would add a double bond between, say, the carbonyl carbon and another position.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure of the product. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane ring has methyl groups at C1 and C2, and at C4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2=C(CH3)-, right? Because the ylide would have the structure (CH2CH(CH3))=P+ ... something. So the Wittig reaction would add a CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 group? Wait, no, the ylide typically has a structure like R2P=CH- something. So when it reacts with a carbonyl, it forms R-CH=CH-R'.

Wait, perhaps I'm
