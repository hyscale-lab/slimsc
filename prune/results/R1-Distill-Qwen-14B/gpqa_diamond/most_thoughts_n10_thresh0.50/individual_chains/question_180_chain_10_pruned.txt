Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. Their masses are negligible, which probably means we can ignore kinetic energy or mass-related terms.

Out of these 13 particles, 12 are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. We're supposed to find the minimum energy of this system. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Wait, energy in an electrostatic system. So I think this is about the electrostatic potential energy between charges. Because all the charges are identical and have the same charge, they'll repel each other.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So the 12 charges are each at 2 meters from P. So each of these 12 charges is a distance of 2m away from the 13th charge. Hmm, but wait, the 12 charges are all at 2m from P, but are they all at the same point? Or are they arranged around P in some configuration?

Wait, the problem says they are "constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P." So each of the 12 is at a distance of
