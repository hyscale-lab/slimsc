Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question has two parts, both involving reagents and reactions. I need to select the correct reagents A and B from the options given.

First reaction: butan-2-one is reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that ketones reacting with cyanide typically involves some kind of addition. Oh wait, it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Right, when a ketone reacts with NaCN in the presence of an acid catalyst, it forms a cyanohydrin. So the reaction is probably a ketone addition with HCN. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions, but in a basic solution or acidic?

Wait, but in the presence of an acid catalyst, like H3O+ (which is option A and B as reagent A), the mechanism would proceed. The acid would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- would attack, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin. So reagent A should be an acid, like H3O+.

So looking at the options, reagent A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which is a source of H+ (acidic conditions). But in the first reaction, the product is a cyan
