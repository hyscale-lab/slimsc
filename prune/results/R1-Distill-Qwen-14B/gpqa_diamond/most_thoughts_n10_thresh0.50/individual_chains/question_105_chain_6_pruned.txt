Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem here. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand. 

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The setup is that these spots cause brightness variations as the star rotates, and this can mimic the presence of an exoplanet. The question is asking, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same amplitude in the star's light curve? So, if the star wasn't spotted, what planet radius would do the same thing.

Hmm, I remember that the transit method is used to detect exoplanets. When a planet passes in front of the star, it blocks some light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. The formula I think is (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the area is proportional to the square of the radius.

But wait, in this case, the star has spots. The spots are cooler, so when they are on the visible side as the star rotates, they make the star appear a bit dimmer. So the variations in brightness come from spots rotating in and out of view. The question is saying that these variations are similar to what we'd see if a planet were transiting. So we need to find the planet radius that would cause the same change in brightness as the spots.

I think the approach is to calculate the brightness change due to the spots and then set that equal to the transit depth caused by the planet. Then solve for R_planet.

The star's total brightness without spots would be based on its effective temperature. The spots are cooler, so they emit less. When the star rotates, the spots come into view, making the observed brightness dip.

First, the effective temperature of the star is 6000 K. The spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K. 

The star's luminosity is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4. Since the star's radius is the same as the Sun's, R_star = R_sun.

The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So the area of the spots can be calculated. The total surface area of the star is 4πR². One hemisphere is 2πR². 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². But wait, no, wait. The filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So the total area of spots on the hemisphere is 0.2 * (2πR²) ? Or is it 0.2 of the entire surface? Let me think.

Wait, the problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's spots. So each hemisphere has area 2πR², and the spots cover 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

So when the star rotates, the spots come into view. Since it's one hemisphere, the maximum coverage would be when the spots are facing us. So the variation in brightness would depend on how much the spots contribute to the overall brightness.

The star's total flux without spots would be based on T_eff = 6000 K. The spots have T_spot = 5000 K.

The flux from the star when the spots are on the visible side is the normal flux minus the flux from the spots, which are now cooler. Wait, no, actually, when the spots are facing us, their lower flux would
