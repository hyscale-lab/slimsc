Okay, so I need to figure out the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about harmonic oscillators. In the classical case, like a mass on a spring, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx², and when x is at maximum amplitude A, that's when the potential energy is highest. So the maximum speed v_max would be when the kinetic energy is (1/2)kA², right? But wait, that's the non-relativistic case.

Now, the question is about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Oh right, in relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic; it includes rest mass energy. So I think I need to use relativistic energy equations here.

In special relativity, the total energy E of a particle is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor: 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The kinetic energy K is then E - m c² = (gamma - 1) m c².

But wait, in this oscillator, how does the potential energy come into play relativistically? For a classical harmonic oscillator, the potential and kinetic energies swap as the mass moves. But in relativity, perhaps the total energy includes both rest mass, kinetic, and potential energies.

Wait, the problem states that it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law, F = -
