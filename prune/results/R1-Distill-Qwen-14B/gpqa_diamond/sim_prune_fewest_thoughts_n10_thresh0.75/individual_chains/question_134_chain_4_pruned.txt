Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

The problem states that we have three solutions being mixed: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids reacting with bases to produce water and possibly a salt. The enthalpy change for these reactions is usually measured in kilocalories (kcal) or kilojoules (kJ), but the options here have both, so I need to be careful.

Wait, wait. The question is about the enthalpy of neutralization. I think that typically, the enthalpy of neutralization is given per mole of H+ reacting. But wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So each mole can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; each mole gives two OH- ions, right?

So the first step is to figure out how many moles of H+ and OH- are present in each solution.

Let me break it down:

1. HCl: It's a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.

Moles HCl = Molarity * Volume (in liters)
HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

2. H2SO4: It's a strong acid too, but diprotic, so each mole gives two H+.

Molarity is 0.3 M, volume 0.3 L.
Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.
H+ from H2SO4: 2 * 0.09
