Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which reagents A and B are used in the given reactions. Let me break it down step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN plus reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O), leading to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, let's start with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is a ketone, right? So the reaction with NaCN. Wait, I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide source, it typically undergoes a substitution. Oh, right, the nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group. So the ketone (butan-2-one) would react with NaCN, which provides the cyanide ion as a nucleophile.

But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the ketone has been converted into a nitrile with an added hydroxyl group. Wait, wait. Let me think: when a ketone (R2CO) reacts with CN-, I think it forms an addition product. The cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a cyanohydrin. The structure of the product would have an alcohol (from the protonation during the addition) and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon.

So the initial product is an addition product of the ketone and cyanide, which is a cyanohydrin. But for that, usually, you need an acid catalyst. Because the cyanide ion is a strong nucleophile but the carbonyl is not very reactive without protonation. So the reaction between ketones and CN- typically uses a protic acid as a catalyst, like H3O+ (which is option A or B for reagent A).

So reagent A is probably H3O+.

Now, looking at the options, option A says A is H3O+ and B is HCl. Option B has A as H3O+ and B as CH3COOH. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3, which I'm not sure about yet.

Moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and with reagent B (H2O) it becomes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid.

How does that happen? I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic conditions to form carboxylic acids. The typical reaction is nitrile + H2O, with an acid catalyst, possibly HCl or another strong acid, under reflux. Alternatively, using H2SO4 as a catalyst. So the reagent B here is probably a strong acid. Because the product is a carboxylic acid, which is a result of hydrolysis of the nitrile.

So reagent B is HCl. Looking at the options, reagent
