Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment in a changing magnetic field. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says that the particle has a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times Sz, which is the spin component in the z-direction. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction, so I guess the particle's moment is aligned with that field. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, I remember that when the magnetic field changes, the spin precesses around the new field direction. But wait, this seems like a transition from one state to another. Or maybe it's about the time evolution of the spin state when the field changes.

So initially, the particle is in an eigenstate of Sz. When the magnetic field is suddenly changed to the Y direction, the Hamiltonian changes. The new Hamiltonian would be proportional to S_y because the magnetic field is along Y. Oh right, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the energy is proportional to the dot product of mu and B. So the Hamiltonian H is -mu·B, which would be -gamma B (S · direction vector).

In this case, the new B is along Y, so H = -gamma B S_y. Since the particle is spin-1/2, S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But wait, spin matrices in different directions have different eigenstates.

The initial state is an eigenstate of Sz. Let's think about the state before the field change. Let's say the initial state is |+z>, which is spin up in the z-direction. When the field is along Y, the eigenstates of S_y will be the new eigenstates. So the initial state |+z> can be expressed as a combination of the eigenstates of S_y.

The time evolution of the state will be governed by the new Hamiltonian. The time-dependent part is given by the energy eigenstates. But since the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, the eigenstates are the |+y> and |-y> states.

So the initial state |+z> can be written in terms of |+y> and |-y>. Let me recall the exact expression. I think |+y> is (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> is (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2). Wait, no, wait. Actually, the states |+y> and |-y> are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.

The time evolution under the Hamiltonian H = -gamma B S_y. Wait, S_y is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Y matrix, right? So H = -gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y. Hmm, but I think the Hamiltonian is written as H = -mu·B, and mu is gamma S, so H = -gamma S · B. Since B is along y, that would be H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but the energy levels will be E_plus = (-gamma B)(+ħ/2) and E_minus = (-gamma B)(-ħ/2) = gamma B ħ/2. Wait, no, S_y for |+y> is +ħ/2, so E_plus would be -gamma B (ħ/2) times something? Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y. So H = -gamma B S_y. So the energy eigenvalues are E = -gamma B (s_y), where s_y is ± ħ/2. So E_plus = -gamma B (ħ/2), E_minus = +gamma B (ħ/2).

The initial state is |+z> which is (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2) times some factor? Let me get the exact expansion. The state |+z> can be written as |+y> + |−y> over sqrt(2), perhaps?

Wait, let's compute the matrix elements. The |+y> state is (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2). So when you express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>, you can write |+z> = |+y> + |−y> / sqrt(2), but I might have the signs wrong. Let me be precise.

The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2). So when you solve for |+z>, you can write it as (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2). Right, because if you add
