Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is. An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). I need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. The options are given, so maybe I can work through it step by step.

First, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the conjugate transpose of the spinor multiplied by the operator matrix, multiplied by the spinor itself. Oh wait, that's right, it's ⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩, where Ô is the operator.

The spin state is given as (3i, 4). I think that means the spinor is a two-component vector: ψ = [3i, 4]^T. So ψ is a column vector. But wait, when taking the conjugate transpose, each component's complex conjugate is taken. Since the first component is 3i, its conjugate would be -3i. So the conjugate transpose, which is ψ†, would be [-3i, 4], right?

The operator for S_y is given as σ_y, which is the Pauli matrix:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

But wait, the spin operator S is (ħ/2) times σ, right? Because each Pauli matrix corresponds to spin components multiplied by ħ/2. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

So I'll need to compute the expectation value by doing ψ† * S_y *
