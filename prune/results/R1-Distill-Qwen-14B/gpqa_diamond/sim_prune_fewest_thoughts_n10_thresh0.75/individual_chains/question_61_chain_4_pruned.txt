Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's try to break it down step by step. Okay, the starting material is benzene. The first reaction is with HNO3 and H2SO4. Oh, right, those are nitrating agents. So benzene would undergo nitration. Nitration typically happens in a nitrating mixture, which is a mix of sulfuric acid and nitric acid. Benzene reacts to form nitrobenzene, I think. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Next, product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder. Iron and Br2... wait, that sounds like a bromination reaction. Oh, right, iron is a catalyst for electrophilic substitution. So nitrobenzene would undergo bromination. But where does the bromine add? Nitro is a meta-directing group. So if the nitro group is in position 1, the bromine will enter in position 3 or 4? Wait, benzene is a ring, so let me imagine nitrobenzene. The nitro group is at position 1. Electrophilic substitution with bromine, which is a meta director. So the bromine would go into the meta position relative to nitro. So if nitro is at 1, bromine would be at 3 or 4? Wait, in benzene, each position is numbered such that the substituents are in the correct positions. So nitro is at position 1. The bromine would enter at position 3 when considering meta direction for nitro. So product 2 would be 3-bromonitrobenzene? Or wait, is it 4-bromo? Hmm. Wait, the nitro group is a strong meta director. So when you have nitrobenzene and add Br, the Br adds in the meta position relative to the nitro. So in nitrobenzene (nitro at position 1), the bromine would be at position 3 or 4? Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. If nitro is at position 1, then positions 2,3,4,5,6 are around. The meta positions for nitro would be positions 3 and 5. So bromine would enter at position 3. So product 2 is 3-bromo-nitrobenzene. Alternatively, maybe it's para? No
