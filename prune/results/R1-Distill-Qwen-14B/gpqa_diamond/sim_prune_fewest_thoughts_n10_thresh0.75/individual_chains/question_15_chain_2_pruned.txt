Okay, so I've got this question about planet transits and which one is more likely to transit. Hmm, let me think. So, transit method detects planets when they pass in front of their star, blocking some light. The probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight.

The question says both planets have the same mass. They were detected via the RV method, which gives minimum mass and orbital period. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1 is closer to its star since shorter period usually means smaller orbit, right?

The host stars have the same radii but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Wait, but same radius—so maybe they're similar in size but different in mass. But wait, radius is what matters for transit probability because the planet needs to block the star's light.

Transit probability is given by (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by some factors, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Oh wait, I think the probability is roughly the ratio of the area of the planet to the area of the star, which is (R_p / R_s)^2. But wait, there's another factor. Oh, right, the probability also depends on the alignment of the orbit. If the orbit is edge-on, the probability is higher. But in reality, the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the distance between the star and planet, multiplied by some other factors. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the impact parameter.

Wait, the transit probability formula I remember is P = (R_p / a) * ( (R_p + R_s) / R_s ), but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, the probability is approximately (R_p / a) * something else. Let me think again. Oh, the probability of a transit is (R_p / a) multiplied by (R_s / a) or something else... Hmm, maybe not. Let me get this straight.

Wait, I've read that
