Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, so I need to think carefully.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let's break them down one by one.

First part: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which one does NOT show tautomerism. I remember that tautomerism involves the shifting of a hydrogen and the movement of a double bond, like in keto-enol tautomerism. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups, but I'm not sure about its structure. Wait, benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O, right? So it's a cyclic structure with two ketone groups opposite each other.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups, each at positions 1,3,5. So all three are on adjacent carbons, I think. Or are they every other carbon? Let me visualize. 1,3,5 would be every other carbon, so they're alternating. So in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each ketone is separated by a CH2 group. 

Wait, what about tautomerism? Tautomerism occurs when a hydrogen can shift, leading to a different arrangement of double bonds. For example, in a diketone, if there's a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl, it can tautomerize. But in benzoquinone, each oxygen is on a benzene ring, so maybe the structure is rigid. Wait, no, benzene rings are conjugated, so maybe tautomerism isn't possible here. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can't tautomerize because the structure is fully conjugated. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring, which is a fully conjugated system. So any possible tautomer would require breaking that conjugation, which might not be favorable. 

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups. Each is on alternate carbons. Let me think about the structure. So, the ring is six-membered with three carbonyl groups. Each carb
