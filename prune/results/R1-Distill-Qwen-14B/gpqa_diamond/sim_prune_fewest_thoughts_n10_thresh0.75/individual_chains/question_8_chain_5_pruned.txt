Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the setup is that we're looking into genes in white lupine that contribute to resistance against anthracnose, which is a fungal disease. They found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knock-out mutants for each (g1, g2, g3) and also some double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). 

The key point is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, transcription factors usually regulate the expression of other genes. 

The experiment tested the resistance of these mutants. The resistance levels are compared to the wild-type control, which is 100% resistant. The results for each mutant are given as percentages:

- g1: 75% (so 75% as resistant as control)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

I need to figure out the interaction among these genes. The options given are A, B, C, D, each describing different relationships like transcription factors, pleiotropy, gene redundancy, and epistatic relationships.

Hmm. Let me think about what each result implies. 

First, looking at the single mutants:

- g1 has 75% resistance. So, it's less resistant than wild type but not completely susceptible. Maybe G1 is involved but not the only gene.
- g2 is 0%, so completely susceptible. That's a big hit. So, G2's function is critical for resistance. Since it's a knockout, either G2 is necessary for resistance, or its product is required for the plant's defense mechanisms.
- g3 is 50%, so its effect is additive or maybe part of a pathway.

Now, the double mutants: 

- g1g2: 0% resistance. Both single mutants are 75% and 0% respectively, so the double is worse than either. But wait, since g2 alone is 0%, the double would still be 0% regardless of g1. So, that makes sense. 

- g1g3: 10%. Each single has 75% and 50%, so the double is even worse than either. So, the effect isn't just additive; it's more than additive. That suggests that their functions might be in parallel pathways, and knocking both makes resistance much worse.

- g2g3: 0%. Since g2 alone is 0%, the double is also 0%. So, adding g3 knockout doesn't change the resistance, which suggests that in the presence of a non-functional G2, G3's function isn't contributing to resistance. Or perhaps G3 is downstream of G2 or vice versa.

Wait, but the question says that at least one gene is a transcription factor upstream of others. So, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor. Because when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is zero, which suggests that G2 is necessary for the expression of other genes involved in resistance.

If G2 is a transcription factor, then when it's not working (g2), other genes downstream can't be expressed. So, G2 might regulate G1 or G3. Let's see.

Looking at the double mutants, especially g1g3: 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%) alone. So, perhaps these genes function in separate pathways, and both contribute. But when both are knocked out, the effect is much worse.

Alternatively, if G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are downstream of G2, then in the absence of G2 (g2),
