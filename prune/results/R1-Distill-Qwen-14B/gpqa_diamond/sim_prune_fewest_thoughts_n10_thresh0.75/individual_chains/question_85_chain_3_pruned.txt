Okay, so I just came across this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too familiar with all the concepts involved, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about two planets orbiting a star, and we need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. The options are given, and I need to figure it out using the information provided.

Hmm, the star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. The two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, have their own masses and radii. Planet1's mass is 7 Earth masses, radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses, radius 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular.

The question mentions that they've been detected using transit and RV methods. Oh right, the transit method measures the dip in brightness when a planet passes in front of the star, which gives us the planet's size. The RV method detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull, giving us the planet's mass.

But wait, the problem says that both planets induce periodic shifts in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. For Planet1, the shift is up to 0.03 Å, and for Planet2, it's 0.04 Å. Oh, that's probably the RV method, so the Doppler shift is due to the star's movement caused by the planet's orbit. So the shift is proportional to the planet's mass and the star's velocity response, which relates to the planet's orbital period and distance?

Wait, but I'm not supposed to get into the mass measurements here. The main thing is equilibrium temperatures. Equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo (which is given as the same for both, so that cancels out).

Right, equilibrium temperature (Te) formula is Te = [ (L / (16πσ D²) ) * (1 - A) ) ]^(1/4 ), where L is the star's luminosity, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, D is the distance between the planet and star, and A is albedo. Since albedos are same, they can be ignored in the
