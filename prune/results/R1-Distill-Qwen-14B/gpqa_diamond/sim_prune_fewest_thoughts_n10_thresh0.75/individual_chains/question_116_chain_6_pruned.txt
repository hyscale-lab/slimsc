Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these NMR interpretations and reaction mechanisms.

Alright, the question starts with compound A showing two signals in the proton NMR. The first signal is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet usually means each proton is next to two others (like in a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2). And the quartet suggests each proton is next to three others, maybe in a CH group next to a CH3.

Looking at the integration: 6H and 4H. So that's 10 hydrogens total. Wait, but for a molecule, the total Hs should add up. Let me think. The triplet at 0.9 is probably from two equivalent methyl groups (CH3) each, like maybe two CH3 groups next to a CH2. Because each CH3 has 3H, so two would be 6H. And the quartet at 1.3 ppm is 4H, which could be four hydrogens in a single CH2CH2 group, but wait, that doesn't make sense because each CH2 would have 2H. Oh wait, maybe it's two CH2 groups each. Wait no, because each CH2 has 2H, so two CH2's would be 4H. But wait, if it's a quartet, that means each proton is adjacent to three others. So if you have a CH2 next to another CH2, each CH2 would be a quartet? Or maybe it's a CH2 connected to a CH3.

Wait, maybe I should think of a structure that has two CH3 groups and a CH2CH2 group. Oh, perhaps something like neopentane? No, neopentane is 2,2-dimethylpropane. Its NMR would have a singlet for the central CH2 and triplets for the CH3 groups, but that's not matching here. Or maybe it's another structure.

Wait, maybe it's 2,2-dimethylbutane? Let's see: Structure would be CH2C(CH3)2CH2. No, that's 3
