Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's see. The question describes a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and leading through several products, finally ending up with product 3. The task is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step. First, I'll try to outline each reaction and see what each product might be.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating it with excess KOH at 240Â°C. From what I remember, when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction to form an alkene. So, probably, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two equivalents of HBr and form an alkene. Wait, but wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal. Oh wait, wait. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3 positions are on adjacent carbons? Or maybe not. Wait, no, in adamantane, the structure is such that each carbon is connected in a way that makes it quite rigid. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would be on carbons that are not adjacent but maybe across a bridge or something. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the reaction conditions. KOH in such a high temperature would cause elimination, but perhaps for a dibromide, it would form a diene? No, wait, maybe it's a double elimination, but let's think about the structure.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane must have two bromine atoms on the same adamantane structure. When treated with KOH, perhaps each Br undergoes elimination with adjacent H's. But wait, each Br is on a bridgehead? Or maybe not. Wait, maybe the structure is such that each Br is on adjacent carbons, so elimination would form a double bond between those two carbons. So, the product after KOH would be an adamantane derivative with a double bond. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. Wait, that's a carbonyl stretch. Oh wait, 1720 is usually
