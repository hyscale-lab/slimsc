Okay, so I've got this question here about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity usually means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a molecule has chirality, which is when it has a non-superimposable mirror image. So each compound needs to be checked for whether it's chiral.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
Wait, the structure is a chloroalkene. The molecule is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe I should draw it. The structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? Or wait, wait, no, wait: 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.

But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. So the structure is ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait, no: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 2-methyl would make it CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2Cl? Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to the first carbon, and a methyl on the second. Structure: Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that's a double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group). So the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2?

Wait, no, wait. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 2-methyl would be, on the second carbon, a branch. So substituting the second carbon with a methyl
