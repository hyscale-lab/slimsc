Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. Let me break it down.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, wait, that's in polar coordinates, right? So r is the radial distance, and θ is the angular part.

I remember that in two-dimensional systems, especially when dealing with central potentials (which depend only on r), the Schrödinger equation can be solved in polar coordinates. But wait, this potential isn't purely a function of r because of that cos²θ term. So this isn't a central potential anymore because it depends on the angle θ. That complicates things a bit because it's not spherically symmetric.

Wait a second, maybe I can separate the potential into radial and angular parts. Let me see: V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. I can factor out r², so V = r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos²θ ]. Hmm, or maybe it's better to write it as V = (1/2) k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Not sure if that helps yet.

Alternatively, perhaps I can rewrite the potential in terms of cos(2θ), since cos²θ can be expressed using a double angle identity. Remember, cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let me try that substitution.

So substituting, V becomes:
V = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2.
Let me compute that. The second term is (3/2) kr² * (1+cos2θ)/2, which is (3/4)kr² (1 + cos2θ). So overall, V is:

(1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ.

Adding the first two terms: (1/2 + 3/4) = 5/4. So V = (5/4)k r
