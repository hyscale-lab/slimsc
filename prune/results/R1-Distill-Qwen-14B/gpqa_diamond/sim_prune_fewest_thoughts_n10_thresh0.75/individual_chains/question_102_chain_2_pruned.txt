Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about a scientific experiment involving a ligand-receptor pair in neural crest cells. The setup is a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down.

First, the experiment uses a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs, so two genes are being expressed from the same vector. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor's ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. So the vector probably has the ligand first, then the receptor.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I think CBA stands for chicken beta-actin, which is a strong promoter often used for expression. The receptor has an IRES regulatory element upstream. IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry sites, which can drive the translation of the second ORF without needing a second promoter. So the ligand is driven by CBA, and the receptor by the IRES downstream of the ligand.

There are stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272. Between ligand and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272. So, without Cre, the stop cassette would prevent expression of the tag (mCherry or eGFP) because the ORF is interrupted. When Cre is present, it would recombine the lox sites, removing the stop, so the tags are expressed.

Wait, no. The stop cassette is in between the ORF and the tag. So, for the ligand, the ORF is ligand, then stop, then mCherry. Wait, no, I think it's actually that the ligand is in frame with mCherry, but the stop cassette is in between. Hmm. Let me think again.

Wait, the setup is: ligand ORF is at 5', then a stop in a loxP cassette, then mCherry. So normally, without Cre, the stop would prevent expression beyond the ligand ORF. But when Cre is present, it would excise the stop, allowing the ligand and mCherry
