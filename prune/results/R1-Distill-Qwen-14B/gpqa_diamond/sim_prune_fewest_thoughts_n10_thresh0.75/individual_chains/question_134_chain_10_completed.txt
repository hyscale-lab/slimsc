Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water. The enthalpy change is usually measured in kJ per mole of H+ or OH- ions involved. Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the specifics.

The problem says we're mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy of neutralization when they're mixed.

Wait, enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The typical value for strong acids and bases is around -57 kJ/mol, but I think the problem might be asking for the total heat change based on the moles involved.

But wait, the options are given in kcal and kJ. Oh right, sometimes it's expressed in kcal, sometimes in kJ. So I need to calculate the total moles of H+ from the acids and OH- from the base, find the limiting reagent, and then multiply by the enthalpy per mole.

So first, let me find the moles for each component.

Starting with HCl: it's a strong acid, so each mole gives one mole of H+. The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. So moles = 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

Next, H2SO4: sulfuric acid is also a strong acid, but it's diprotic. Since it's a 0.3 M solution, 300 mL is 0.3 L. So moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. Each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+ ions. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Now Ba(OH)2: this is a strong base. The formula is Ba(OH)2, which dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole gives two OH- ions. The volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M, so moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol. So OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem is mixing HCl, H2SO4 (both acids) and Ba(OH)2 (a base). So the acids are contributing H+ and the base is contributing OH-.

So the reaction would be H+ + OH- → H2O. The enthalpy change is per mole of H+ or OH-, I think. So I need to find out how much H+ and OH- are available.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will fully dissociate, providing 0.2 mol OH-.

The acids: HCl and H2SO4. HCl gives 0.1 mol H+. H2SO4, since it's a diprotic strong acid, both H+ ions are released. So 0.09 mol H2SO4 gives 0.18 mol H+.

So total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol. And OH- is 0.2 mol.

So the reaction of H+ and OH- would be limited by the OH- available, because OH- is 0.2 mol and H+ is 0.28. So OH- is the limiting reagent.

So the reaction that occurs is 0.2 mol of H+ reacting with 0.2 mol OH- to form 0.2 mol H2O.

The enthalpy change for each mole of H2O is around -57 kJ (or sometimes given as -57.3 kcal, wait, I'm a bit mixed up here). Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-). Because for strong acids and bases, the reaction releases about 57 kJ per mole of acid or base. So here, 0.2 mol of H+ would react with 0.2 mol of OH-.

So the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 mol * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ. Wait, but let me think about units. Alternatively, sometimes it's given in terms of the reaction per mole of H2O, but it's the same as per mole of H+ or OH-.

Wait, but I've heard that the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-). So if we have 0.2 mol of H+ (or OH-), the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

Looking back at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, and option D is -16.0 kJ. Wait, but in the options, B is in kcal and D is in kJ. Hmm, I might have made a mistake in the units here.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 57.3 kJ is the same as approximately 13.7 kcal. Because 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So 57.3 kJ is about 57.3 / 4.184 ≈ 13.7 kcal.

Wait, that's a key point. So if each mole of H+ contributes about -57.3 kJ, which is about -13.7 kcal.

Wait, but in the options, the choices are in kcal and kJ. So if the calculation is in kJ, I should present it in kJ. Alternatively, if it's in kcal, I need to convert.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether to use kJ or kcal. The options have both. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So the options have both units. So I need to compute which unit applies.

Wait, the reaction is 0.2 mol of H+ and OH- reacting. So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ.

Alternatively, if using kcal per mole, 57.3 kJ is about 13.7 kcal (since 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ; 57.3 /4.184 ≈13.7). So 0.2 * (-13.7 kcal/mol) = -2.74 kcal.

Wait, but that would give me about -2.74 kcal, which is close to option A (-2.72 kcal). Hmm. But wait, this depends on whether the given H is in kJ or kcal.

Hmm, perhaps I need to calculate using the correct unit.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ or OH-.

So using that, 0.2 mol * (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ → approx -11.5 kJ. None of the options in kJ match exactly, but option D is -16.0 kJ. That's not matching.

Alternatively, if I used -57.3 kcal per mole, which is incorrect because 57.3 is in kJ, so that approach would be wrong. Because 1 kJ is about 0.239 kcal. So 57.3 kJ is about 13.7 kcal. So if 13.7 kcal per mole, 0.2 mol gives -2.74 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, in the problem statement, the neutralization reaction typically releases about 57.3 kJ per mole of H+ or OH-.

So if the correct calculation is -11.46 kJ, but none of the options in kJ match exactly. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the limiting reagent.

Let me double-check the moles.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent.

So the amount of H+ that reacts is 0.2 mol.

So the total enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ.

But the options in kJ are option D: -16.0 kJ. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, did I miscalculate the moles?

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate the moles.

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L. 0.5 L *0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL = 0.3 L. 0.3 L *0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL = 0.2 L. 0.2 *0.5 = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 2 *0.1 = 0.2 OH-.

So H+ available: 0.28, OH- available: 0.2. So the OH- will run out first, so 0.2 mol of H+ will react with 0.2 mol OH-.

Thus, enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, the closest kJ option is option D, which is -16.0 kJ. But that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that H2SO4 is only partially dissociated, but wait, no, H2SO4 is a strong acid, so it's fully ionized in solution. So the H+ calculation is correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the Ba(OH)2 is not fully dissociated? No, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and dissociates completely.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the total neutralization, but considering that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, maybe only one H is neutralized by Ba(OH)2?

Wait no, because Ba(OH)2 provides two OH- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 can neutralize two H+ ions. So perhaps the calculation is more complex.

Wait, perhaps I should write the overall reaction.

Wait, the reaction will involve both HCl and H2SO4 (as acids) reacting with Ba(OH)2 (as base).

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total H+ and the total OH- and see which is in excess.

Wait, H+ total is 0.28 mol, OH- is 0.2 mol. So all OH- will react, and 0.08 mol H+ will remain unreacted. So the net H+ after reaction is 0.28 -0.2 =0.08 mol.

But the enthalpy change is calculated based on the moles that reacted, which is 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-.

So 0.2 mol * (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have this exact value. The options are:

A) -2.72 kcal (~ -11.5 kJ)

B) -11.42 kcal (about -48.5 kJ)

C) -3.80 kcal (~-16.1 kJ)

D) -16.0 kJ.

Wait, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -48.5 kJ. Hmm, that's way off.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization per mole is 57.3 kJ per mole of H2O formed. So for each mole of H+ and OH- reacting, one mole of H2O is formed, releasing 57.3 kJ.

Wait, but in that case, the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 mol * (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ. So that's -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: -16.0 kJ, but that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an option that is around -11.46 kJ, but none of the options in kJ match that. There's option B which is -11.42 kcal, which is roughly -48.5 kJ, which is not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization. Maybe 40 kJ per mole? Or perhaps I'm confusing H+ with H2O.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the enthalpy is given per mole of acid or base, not per mole of H+ or OH-.

Wait, for strong acids and bases, the enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.3 kJ per mole of acid (since each mole of acid donates a mole of H+), but wait, wait no: for a diprotic acid, each mole would contribute two moles of H+.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as per mole of H2SO4, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is looking for the sum of the moles and considering the strongest acid or something else. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to convert all H+ and OH- into moles and compute based on that.

Wait, H+ total is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react, producing 0.2 moles of H2O.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ. So this would be approximately -11.46 kJ, which is about -11.5 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, but that's not close. The other options in kcal: option B is -11.42 kcal.

Wait a minute, 11.42 kcal is roughly how much in kJ?

Each kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So 11.42 kcal *4.184 ≈ 47.67 kJ.

But that's not matching our earlier calculation of 11.46 kJ.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization enthalpy in terms of per mole of H2SO4, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another thought. Perhaps the problem is using the formula for enthalpy change as:

q = n * ΔH,

where ΔH is the enthalpy per mole of reaction.

But in this case, the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, with ΔH = -57.3 kJ per mole.

So the moles reacting are 0.2, so q = 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

So the answer would be approximately -11.46 kJ. But none of the options in kJ match exactly. The closest option is D) -16.0 kJ, but that's not close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations.

Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol.

Moles of H+ from H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol. Since H2SO4 is diprotic, it's 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L *0.5 M = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol.

So H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. OH- is limiting.

So the reaction uses 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-.

Enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ.

So the answer should be approximately -11.46 kJ. But looking at the options, none of the kJ options match, but option B is -11.42 kcal.

Wait, 11.46 kJ is approximately 2.74 kcal (since 11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.74). So 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ ≈ -2.74 kcal.

So the correct answer would be approximately -2.74 kcal, which is option A (-2.72 kcal) is the closest.

Wait, but why is there a discrepancy between the kJ and kcal options?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of 57.3 kcal per mole instead of kJ. Oh, but 57.3 kJ is about 13.7 kcal. So if someone mistakenly uses 57.3 kcal per mole, then 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kcal, which is option B. But that would be wrong because 57.3 is in kJ, not kcal.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate in kJ and choose the closest option. But none of the kJ options match. The only kJ option is D: -16.0 kJ. That's way off.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the moles. Let me recalculate.

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L. 0.5 *0.2 = 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL =0.3 L. 0.3 *0.3 =0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL= 0.2 L. 0.2 *0.5 =0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So that's correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the neutralization reaction's enthalpy is considered per mole of H2O, but in that case, since one mole of H2O is formed per mole of H+ and OH-, the calculation remains the same.

So 0.2 moles of H2O → 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the molarity in a different way. Let me make sure.

Wait, the problem says "when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4 and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed."

So the total solution is 500 +300 +200 = 1000 mL = 1 L.

But the concentrations are as given, so the moles are as I calculated before.

Hmmm.

Wait, the only options that are close in any unit are either option B (-11.42 kcal) or option D (-16.0 kJ). But according to the calculation, the correct value is approximately -11.46 kJ.

So since none of the options in kJ match, perhaps the question expects the answer in kJ, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization.

Some sources say that the standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+.

Alternatively, if the problem is using ΔH as -40 kJ per mole, for example, then 0.2 mol would give -8 kJ, which isn't an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy is per mole of acid, not per mole of H+.

Wait, HCl is a monoprotic acid, so 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4 is diprotic, 0.09 mol → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2 is a base providing 0.2 mol OH-.

So the moles of H+ and OH- are as before.

So the reaction is 0.2 mol H+ + 0.2 mol OH- → 0.2 H2O.

The enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) → -11.46 kJ.

So the correct answer in kJ is -11.46 kJ. But that's not an option. So perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal, so 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ → convert to kcal.

11.46 kJ /4.184 ≈ 2.74 kcal.

So -2.74 kcal → the closest option is A: -2.72 kcal.

But the options have option B as -11.42 kcal, which is about -48.5 kJ, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the units in the problem statement. The options have B) -11.42 kcal, which is about -48.5 kJ, and D) -16.0 kJ.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the value of -57.3 kcal per mole. That would be incorrect because 57.3 is in kJ. But let's see: 0.2 * (-57.3 kcal) = -11.46 kcal, which is very close to option B (-11.42 kcal). But that would imply using an incorrect ΔH value of 57.3 kcal/mol, which is way too high.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to use -57.3 kcal per mole, leading to option B.

But that would be incorrect because the standard ΔH for neutralization is about -57.3 kJ, not kcal.

So perhaps the correct approach is to go with the calculation in kJ and the only option in kJ is D: -16.0 kJ, but that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering each mole of H2SO4 to neutralize two moles of OH-.

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe the Ba(OH)2 is a dihydroxide, so each mole can neutralize two H+.

So perhaps instead of looking at individual H+ and OH-, I should consider the neutralization per mole of acid or base.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the equivalents.

HCl: 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 equivalents H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 equivalents H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol → 0.2 equivalents OH-.

So total equivalents H+ = 0.28, OH- = 0.2.

The neutralization will proceed until OH- is consumed. So 0.2 equivalents H+ will react with 0.2 equivalents OH-.

The enthalpy change is 0.2 equivalents * (-57.3 kJ/equivalent) = -11.46 kJ.

So the same conclusion as before.

Given that, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the units are mixed, and the correct answer is expressed in kcal.

So -11.46 kJ is approximately -2.74 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close.

So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the units.

Wait, the problem gives all options in either kcal or kJ. So perhaps the correct answer is option B if using kcal, but that would suggest an enthalpy of 11.42 kcal, which is about 48.5 kJ. But that's way higher than the standard value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to use 57.3 kJ per mole, so the correct answer would be -11.46 kJ, but since that's not an option, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the dilution as well. But no, enthalpy of neutralization is a molar quantity and doesn't depend on the volume.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck because the calculation leads me to -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -2.74 kcal, but the options don't directly match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first place in considering all the H+ from H2SO4. Since H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but when it's in solution, the first H+ is fully ionized, and the second may be weak? Wait, no, I think for the purpose of neutralization, both H+ are available from strong acids.

Wait, perhaps I should only consider the first dissociation of H2SO4. No, that's not correct. H2SO4 is a strong acid and both H+ ions are released.

Given that, I think the initial calculation is correct, leading to a enthalpy change of approximately -11.46 kJ, which is about -2.74 kcal.

But the options don't have exactly that, but option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close.

So I think the correct answer is option A.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we first determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions available:

1. **H⁺ from HCl**:  
   HCl is a strong monoprotic acid.  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **H⁺ from H₂SO₄**:  
   H₂SO₄ is a strong diprotic acid.  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, dissociating into \( \text{Ba}^{2+} \) and \( 2 \, \text{OH}^- \).  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

The total moles of H⁺ available are:  
\[
\text{Total H⁺} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} + 0.18 \, \text{mol} = 0.28 \, \text{mol}.
\]  
The moles of OH⁻ available are:  
\[
\text{Total OH⁻} = 0.2 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, only \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ reacts with \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻ to form water. The enthalpy of neutralization for one mole of H⁺ or OH⁻ is approximately \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \). Thus, the total enthalpy change is:  
\[
q = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ}.
\]

To convert this to kcal (since \( 1 \, \text{kJ} \approx 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \)):  
\[
q = -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \times 0.239 \, \text{kcal/kJ} \approx -2.74 \, \text{kcal}.
\]

Now, comparing the calculated values to the options:

- **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**: This is very close to the calculated value of \( -2.74 \, \text{kcal} \).  
- **Option B (-11.42 kcal)**: This corresponds to approximately \( -48.5 \, \text{kJ} \), which is far from the calculated \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \).  
- **Option C (-3.80 kcal)**: This is much larger than the calculated value.  
- **Option D (-16.0 kJ)**: This is larger than the calculated value of \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \).

The closest match is **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**.  

Answer: A
