Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think through it carefully.

Alright, the question says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So, R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So M1 = 1.5 * M2. Hmm, but wait, I'm not sure how the mass plays into this because the problem is about luminosity, which I think relates more to radius and temperature. Maybe mass isn't directly relevant here? Or perhaps it's a distractor. I'll keep that in mind.

The problem also mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! That's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. I remember from Wien's Law that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature of the blackbody. So, λ_max is proportional to 1/T. If both have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2. Interesting.

Next, the radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Wait, but how does radial velocity affect the observed wavelength? Oh, that's the Doppler effect. So if a star is moving towards us, the light gets blueshifted, and moving away causes redshift. But the question says we're looking at the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest, which is their own emitted peak wavelength. So maybe the problem is considering the rest frame, or perhaps the Doppler shift doesn't affect the calculation because the peak wavelengths in their rest frames are the same, but their observed wavelengths could be different? Hmm, not sure. But the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the observed λ_max is the same. Wait, but if one is moving towards us and the other away, their observed λ_max would differ. But in this case, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so its observed λ_max is the same as its rest frame. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, but how is this affecting the calculation of luminosity?

Wait, the luminosity is the intrinsic brightness, not the observed flux. Oh, but the question says that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So perhaps the Doppler shift is affecting the observed flux, but the computed luminosity is based on their intrinsic properties. Hmm.

Wait, the stars are assumed to radiate as black bodies. So luminosity (L) for a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So the key factors are radius and temperature. Since both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures are the same. So T1 = T2 = T.

So let's write their luminosities. L1 = 4π (R1)^2 σ T^4. Similarly, L2 = 4π (R2)^2 σ T^4. So the ratio L1/L2 would be (R1/R2)^2. Since R1 is 1.5 R2, the ratio is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. But wait, the options include ~2.25 as option A, but I'm not so sure because I might have missed something.

Wait, but what about the Doppler shift affecting the observed flux? Let me think. The observed flux is affected by the Doppler effect because of the velocity. The flux we receive would be affected by the Doppler factor. But the luminosity is the intrinsic property, so when we calculate it, we have to correct for any Doppler shifting?

Wait
