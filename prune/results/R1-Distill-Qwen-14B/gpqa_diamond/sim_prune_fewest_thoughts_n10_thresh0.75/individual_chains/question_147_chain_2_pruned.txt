Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes, and I need to find the velocity of particle A. Hmm, let me try to think this through. I remember that annihilation involves particles and their antiparticles converting into other particles, but the specifics are a bit fuzzy.

The reaction given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So a proton and an antiproton annihilate into two particles of each of A⁺ and A⁻. Wait, but each A must have a certain mass. The problem states that m_A c² is 300 MeV. Oh right, the rest mass energy of each A particle is 300 MeV.

Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe I can approximate things assuming it's not moving at speeds close to c, but wait, the options given are all pretty high fractions of c. So maybe I need to consider relativistic effects here.

Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. Does that mean that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy? So maybe its speed is not too close to c, but the resulting A particles might be moving at significant fractions of c.

Wait, but the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Let me think about the initial and final energies. In annihilation, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. So I need to apply conservation of energy and momentum.

The initial setup: the proton is probably at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly. Wait, wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe
