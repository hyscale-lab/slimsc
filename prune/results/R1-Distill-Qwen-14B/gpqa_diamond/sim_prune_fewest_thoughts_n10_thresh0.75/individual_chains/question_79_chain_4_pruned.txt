Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about identifying the compound X based on its reaction product's NMR spectra. The reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Hmm, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, bulky base, often used in the formation of epoxides, maybe through an elimination reaction. So, perhaps compound X is undergoing an elimination to form an epoxide?

Looking at the options, all of them are epoxides except maybe option D. Wait, let me check: option D is 2-styrylepoxide. So, all options are epoxides except maybe none? Wait, no, all options seem to have 'oxirane' in their names, which is another term for epoxide. So, the reaction is producing an epoxide from compound X. Wait, no, wait. No, the reaction is with the base, so perhaps X is an alkoxide that gets converted into an epoxide. Or maybe X is an epoxide, and the reaction is something else. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the reaction conditions are 1,4-diazabicyclooctane, which is a base, and a nonpolar solvent at high temperature. Oh, wait, I think that when a diene is treated with a strong base, it can undergo an elimination reaction, perhaps forming an epoxide if there's an adjacent leaving group. Or maybe it's a ring-opening or some kind of addition.

Alternatively, I remember that when certain dienes or epoxides are treated with a base, they can undergo ring-opening or rearrangement. Wait, but in this case, compound X is reacting to produce something whose NMR is given. So perhaps X is reacting to form a more substituted epoxide, which is more stable.

Let me think about the product's NMR. The 1H NMR shows several signals. Let's parse them:

1H NMR:
δ 2.28 (3H, s) – a singlet, probably a methyl group attached to something deshielded, maybe a carbonyl or aromatic ring.
δ 2.31 (3H, s) – another singlet, another methyl. So, two methyl groups in total, both as singlets. Where would that happen? Maybe a geminal dimethyl or two separate methyl groups attached in symmetric positions.
Then, aromatic signals:
δ 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

Wait, the aromatic region seems to have a doublet at 6.75, another doublet at 7.08 (2H), then another at 7.68 (1H), and another at 7.71 (2H). This seems like a pattern that could arise from a para-substituted aromatic ring with substituents that cause splitting. Alternatively, it might be a trans-stilbene type of structure, where the protons are in a conjugated diene system.

Wait, looking at the 13C NMR data: Let me list the signals.

13C NMR:
21.3 (1C, s) – maybe a methyl attached to an electronegative atom or a carbonyl. Like a CH3-O or CH3-C=O.
28.4 (1C, s) – another CH3, perhaps something else.
126.9 (2C, s) – two carbons, probably in an aromatic ring, not strongly deshielded.
127.1 (1C, s) – another aromatic carbon.
129.1 (2C, s) – more aromatic carbons.
130.3 (
