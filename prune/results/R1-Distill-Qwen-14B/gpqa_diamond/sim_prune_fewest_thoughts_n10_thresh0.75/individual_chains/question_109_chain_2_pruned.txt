Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. So, the initial state is 1S0. Pauli statistics impose some conditions on the quantum numbers of the final state. The condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. And the final NN state has T(NN)=0. We need to find out which partial wave is not permitted.

Wait, let me break it down. The initial state is 1S0. The term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0, S is 0, because 2S+1=1 → S=0. L is S, so it's S state, which is L=0. J would be the total angular momentum, which in the ground state is usually the sum of orbital and spin, but since S=0 and L=0, J=0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

They emit a particle X. So the process is NN → NN' + X, but wait, no, the problem says the final state is NN after emitting X. Hmm, maybe I misread. Oh, no, the problem says the two nucleons are in a 1S0 state and emit a particle X. So the system is NN plus X. But I think the question is about the state of the two nucleons after emission, but perhaps it's more about the process of emission and whether the partial wave is allowed.

Wait, the problem says that the final NN state has T=0. So the isospin T of the NN is 0. Pauli's condition says T = S + L + 1 mod 2. So T is 0, so 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2. So S and L must add up to odd. So S is the spin of the NN system, L is the orbital angular momentum.

But wait, the initial state is 1S0. What's the S in
