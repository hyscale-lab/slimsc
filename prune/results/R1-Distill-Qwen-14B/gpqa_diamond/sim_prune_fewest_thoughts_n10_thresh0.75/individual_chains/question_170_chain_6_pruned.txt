Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. 

Hmm, the given state is (3i, 4). Wait, I think that's a vector in the spin space. Oh right, spin states are usually represented as two-component vectors since electrons have spin-1/2. So the state is a column vector [3i, 4], but wait, sometimes people write them as row vectors. Oh wait, no, in standard notation, spin states are column vectors. So perhaps it's [3i; 4], but I'm not entirely sure. Either way, I'll proceed with the assumption that the state is a column vector with components (3i, 4), so that's χ = [3i; 4].

The expectation value of an operator is given by the formula <S> = χ† S χ, where χ† is the conjugate transpose of χ. So first, I need to find the operator S_y.

The problem note says that σ_y is the Pauli matrix:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

And since S_y is the spin operator along y, it's given by (ħ/2) * σ_y. Wait, right, because for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operators are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So S_y = (ħ/
