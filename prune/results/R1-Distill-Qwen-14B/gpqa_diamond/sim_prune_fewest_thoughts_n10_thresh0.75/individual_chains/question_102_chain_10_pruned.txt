Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and genetics. Hmm, let's try to break it down. The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and the experiment done to study their interaction's developmental fate.

First, the setup. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets for the binding site. So, the ligand probably binds to the receptor's extracellular part.

Then, the vector is bicistronic, which means it has two coding regions in one construct. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream of it. IRES elements allow internal ribosome entry, which can drive the translation of the downstream gene, often in a different tissue or under different conditions.

There are stop cassettes in between. The ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between its ORF and mCherry. Similarly, the receptor has lox2272-stop-lox2272 before eGFP. I remember that loxP sites are recognition sites for Cre recombinase, which can excise the stop cassette when Cre is present. Lox2272 is a variant of loxP that can be used in combination to prevent recombination in the absence of Cre, or perhaps for directional excision.

Wait, so without Cre, the ligand would have the stop cassette, preventing mCherry from being expressed. Similarly, the receptor's eGFP would be stopped unless Cre recombines the cassette. But the vector is a bicistronic so both ligand and receptor are in the same vector.

The person has made a mouse model homozygous for this construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre would be active in neural crest cells, I think. SOX10-Cre would drive recombination in neural crest-derived cells.

After the offspring are born, they're visualized under a confocal with fluorescent microscopy. They didn't see a green signal, which I assume is from eGFP. So the receptor-eGFP isn't being expressed, or the eGFP isn't functioning.

Possible reasons: looking at the options.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the construct would still allow expression; maybe the ligand is secreted and the receptor expressed on the surface, but I don't see how that would prevent eGFP expression. The question is about the eGFP not showing, so perhaps this option isn't about that.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If the protein is stuck in the Golgi, then it wouldn't be expressed on the cell surface, so you might not see the GFP signal. But why would that happen? Maybe because of a stop cassette not being excised? Or perhaps the eGFP is in the same reading frame.

Option C: Enhancer missing. The construct uses CBA promoter for ligand. CBA is a strong promoter, so probably they're using it for proper expression. If the enhancer is missing, maybe the promoter isn't active. But the ligand was under CBA, which is a constitutive promoter. Hmm. But the vector uses IRES for the receptor, which is a weaker element and perhaps requires something else. Wait, but the question says they expressed the vector in primary astrocytes and tested via Western blot. They used antibodies against overexpressed proteins and saw some signals? Or not? Oh, the question says after transfection, they ran a Western and saw a signal proportional to actin, so the proteins are being expressed. So the problem isn't in the promoter.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh, wait, the vector is set up with the receptor ORF followed by eGFP. If the stop cassette isn't excised, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But in the presence of Cre, which is provided by the SOX10-Cre mice, the lox2272 cassette should be excised, right? Wait, the ligand's stop is loxP, and the receptor's is lox2272. So in the presence of Cre, the loxP sites would be cut, removing the stop, allowing expression of mCherry and eGFP. The problem is that in the offspring, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the vector's setup: the ligand is first, then under
