Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I've studied a bit about spin states and expectation values, but I'm a bit rusty. Let me try to think this through.

First, the problem states that the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, I think that notation means a two-component vector, right? So the spin state is a column vector with the first component 3i and the second component 4. That would be written as:

ψ = [3i; 4]

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually represented as column vectors, so that's correct.

The question is asking for the expectation value of S_y, the spin along the y-direction. I remember that the expectation value is calculated as the bra-ket product of the operator and the state. So the formula should be:

⟨S_y⟩ = ψ† σ_y ħ ψ

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices are the operators for spin components, scaled by ħ/2. Oh right, because the spin operators are S_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, and similarly for S_y and S_z.

So the operator for S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by σ_y. So when calculating the expectation value, I should include that factor.

So the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is given by ψ† (σ_y) ψ multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, let me write that out.

First, σ_y is the Pauli matrix given as:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

So the matrix form is as that. So the operator for S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y.

So to find the expectation value, I take the conjugate transpose of ψ (which is the bra vector), multiply by σ_y, then multiply by ψ, then multiply by ħ/2.

Alternatively, since expectation value is <ψ| S_y |ψ>, which is (ψ†) (S_y) ψ.

So let's compute ψ† σ_y ψ:

ψ is [3i, 4], so ψ† is [ -3 (because (3i)* is -3i?), wait wait, complex conjugate.

Wait, ψ is a column vector [3i;4]. So ψ† is [ (3i)*, 4* ] as a row vector.

So (3i)* is -3i, and 4* is 4, since 4 is real.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the components are 3i and 4. So ψ† is [ -3i  , 4 ].

Wait, I think I might have confused myself earlier. Let me clarify:

ψ = [ a; b ] = [3i; 4 ]

So ψ† is [ a*, b* ] = [ (3i)*, 4* ] = [ -3i, 4 ].

So ψ† is a row vector: [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, we multiply ψ† by σ_y, which is a 2x2 matrix, and then multiply by ψ.

So let me compute step by step.

Compute ψ† σ_y:

= [ -3i, 4 ] * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Matrix multiplication here—each element is the dot product of the row of the first matrix and the column of the second.

But note that σ_y is 2x2, and ψ† is 1x2, so ψ† σ_y would be 1x2.

Let me calculate each element:

First element (1,1) of the product: (-3i)*0 + 4*i → 0 + 4i → 4i.

Wait wait, wait. Let me clarify: ψ† is [a, b], σ_y is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. So when you multiply ψ† * σ_y, each element is a*(first row of σ_y) and b*(second row of σ_y), but wait no, the multiplication is row times column. Or wait, no: when you multiply a 1x2 (row vector) by a 2x2 matrix, each element is the sum of the products of the row elements with the corresponding column elements.

So for the first element of the resulting vector (which will be 1x2), it's:

( -3i ) * 0 + (4) * i → 0 + 4i = 4i.

Second element of the resulting vector is:

( -3i ) * (-i) + (4) * 0 → (3i^2) + 0 → 3*(i^2) is 3*(-1)= -3.

Wait, because i^2 is -1. So ( -3i )*(-i) is 3i^2 which is 3*(-1) = -3.

So ψ† σ_y is [4i, -3].

Now, we multiply this resulting vector by ψ, which is [3i;4]. So:

[4i, -3] * [3i;4] = (4i * 3i) + (-3 * 4) = ?

Compute each term:

4i *3i = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12.

-3 *4 = -12.

So the sum is -12 + (-12) = -24.

So ψ† σ_y ψ is -24.

Multiply by ħ/2, because S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y.

So ⟨S_y⟩ = ( -24 ) * ( ħ / 2 ) = (-24/2) ħ = -12 ħ.

Wait, but wait a second.

Wait, no, no, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the multiplication.

So ψ is [3i;4], ψ† is [-3i,4].

Compute ψ† σ_y:

ψ† is [a, b] = [-3i,4]

σ_y is:

[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

So the product is:

a*0 + b*i = (-3i)*0 + 4*i = 0 +4i =4i → first element.

a*(-i) + b*0 = (-3i)*(-i) +4*0 → 3i^2 + 0 → 3*(-1) =-3 → second element.

So ψ† σ_y = [4i, -3].

Then multiply this with ψ, which is [3i;4].

So (4i)*(3i) + (-3)*(4) = ?

4i *3i = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12.

-3 *4 = -12.

Adding, -12 + (-12) = -24.

So ψ† σ_y ψ is -24.

So the expectation value is ( ħ/2 ) * (-24) = (-24 ħ)/2 = -12 ħ.

But wait, looking at the options provided, option A is -12 hbar/25, and B is 12 hbar/25.

Hmm, that's not matching. Because according to my calculation, it's -12 ħ, but the options have -12 hbar/25 or 12 hbar/25.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the normalization of the state vector? Oh! Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors need to be normalized, right? So I should check if ψ is normalized.

The state ψ is [3i;4]. The norm is the square of the magnitude, so |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) =25. So the norm is 25.

So the state vector isn't normalized. Because the sum of the squares of the magnitudes is 25, which isn't 1. So I think the actual state should be divided by the norm to make it a unit vector.

So the normalized ψ is (1/5)*[3i;4], because sqrt(25) is 5.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the spin state is (3i,4). So perhaps I was wrong to proceed without normalization. Because in quantum mechanics, the expectation value is calculated using the normalized state.

So in that case, I should first normalize ψ.

Given ψ = [3i;4], the norm is sqrt( |3i|^2 + |4|^2 ) = sqrt(9 +16) = sqrt(25)=5.

So the normalized state is ψ_norm = (1/5) [3i;4].

So when I compute the expectation value, I should use this normalized ψ.

So let me recalculate everything with the normalized ψ.

So ψ_norm = [3i/5;4/5].

Now, ψ_norm† is [ -3i/5, 4/5 ]

Compute ψ_norm† σ_y ψ_norm.

So σ_y is the same as before.

Compute ψ_norm† * σ_y:

= [ -3i/5, 4/5 ] * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So each element:

First element: (-3i/5)*0 + (4/5)*i = 0 + (4i/5) → 4i/5.

Second element: (-3i/5)*(-i) + (4/5)*0 → (3i^2)/5 + 0 → 3*(-1)/5 = -3/5.

So ψ_norm† σ_y = [4i/5, -3/5]

Now multiply this by ψ_norm: [3i/5; 4/5]

So first term: (4i/5)*(3i/5) = (12 i^2)/25 = (12*(-1))/25 = -12/25.

Second term: (-3/5)*(4/5) = (-12)/25.

Sum: (-12/25) + (-12/25) = (-24)/25.

Multiply by ħ/2: expectation value is (−24/25) * (ħ/2) = (-12 ħ)/25.

So the expectation value is (-12ħ)/25.

Looking at the options, option A is -12 hbar/25. So that's the answer.


To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Normalization of the State**:  
   The given state \( \psi \) is not normalized. The norm is calculated as:  
   \[
   \|\psi\| = \sqrt{|3i|^2 + |4|^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5.
   \]  
   Thus, the normalized state is:  
   \[
   \psi_{\text{norm}} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Pauli Matrix for \( S_y \)**:  
   The spin operator \( S_y \) is related to the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \) by:  
   \[
   S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y,
   \]  
   where \( \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \).

3. **Expectation Value Formula**:  
   The expectation value of \( S_y \) is given by:  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \psi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger \sigma_y \psi_{\text{norm}} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2}.
   \]

4. **Compute \( \psi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger \sigma_y \psi_{\text{norm}} \)**:  
   - The conjugate transpose of \( \psi_{\text{norm}} \) is:  
     \[
     \psi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3i}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
     \]  
   - Multiply \( \psi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger \) with \( \sigma_y \):  
     \[
     \psi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3i}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{4i}{5} & -\frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
     \]  
   - Multiply the result with \( \psi_{\text{norm}} \):  
     \[
     \psi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger \sigma_y \psi_{\text{norm}} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{4i}{5} & -\frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
     \]  
     Compute each term:  
     \[
     \frac{4i}{5} \cdot \frac{3i}{5} = \frac{12i^2}{25} = \frac{-12}{25}, \quad -\frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{-12}{25}.
     \]  
     Adding these gives:  
     \[
     \psi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger \sigma_y \psi_{\text{norm}} = \frac{-12}{25} + \frac{-12}{25} = \frac{-24}{25}.
     \]

5. **Final Expectation Value**:  
   Multiply by \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \):  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{-24}{25} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{-12\hbar}{25}.
   \]

6. **Answer Selection**:  
   Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:  
   **A) \( -\frac{12\hbar}{25} \)**.
