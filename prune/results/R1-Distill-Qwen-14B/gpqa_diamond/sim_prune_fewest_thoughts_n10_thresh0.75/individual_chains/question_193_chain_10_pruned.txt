Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, so N ∝ 1/parallax^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, involving different powers of r.

Wait, I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Right, the formula is parallax (in parsecs) is equal to 1 over distance (in parsecs). So parallax (plx) = 1/d. Oh wait, no, wait, yeah: plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, that would mean 1/(plx)^5 is (d)^5. Because (1/(plx)) is d, so (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5? Wait, but wait, the question is about how N changes with distance, per unit range. Hmm.

Wait, but when we talk about the number of stars per unit distance, I think we're looking for the differential number of stars with respect to distance. Like, how many stars are there in each small range dr as you go further out.

So N ∝ d^5. If I think of integrating over stars in shells, but wait, the question
