Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and their states after emitting a particle. Hmm, let's try to unpack this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, so I'll need to think carefully.

The question says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Then, Pauli statistics come into play, requiring that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Oh wait, I think that's the condition for the symmetry of the wavefunction. Since nucleons are fermions, their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. So the product of spin, orbital, and isospin parts must be antisymmetric.

The problem states that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So isospin is zero. Let's see what that implies. The initial state is 1S0, which I think has S=0, L=0, and J=0. Because the term symbol is (2S+1)LJ, so 1S0 is (2*0+1)L^0, so S=0, L=0, J=0.

Now, when they emit a particle X, the final state is the NN system plus X. Wait, no, actually, the emission would change the state of the NN system. So the initial state is NN in 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, J=0. After emitting X, the NN system goes into some state with T=0.

Pauli's condition: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Wait, I think the condition is that the product of the spin, orbital, and isospin parts must be antisymmetric. For identical particles, the overall wavefunction must change sign when you swap them. So if the isospin part is symmetric or antisymmetric, and same for spin and orbital parts.

Wait, the formula given is T = S + L +1 mod 2. So if T is even or odd, that relates to the other quantum numbers. Since the final T is 0, which is even (0 mod 2 is 0), then S + L +1 must be even. So S + L +1 ≡ 0 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2. So the sum of S and L must be odd.

Wait, wait, no: T = S + L + 1 mod 2. So for T to be 0, 0 = (S + L +1) mod 2. So S + L +1 must be even, meaning S + L is odd. Because 0 +1 is 1, so S+L+1 = even → S+L must be odd.

So S and L must have opposite parities. So if S is even, L is odd; if S is odd, L is even.

Now, the problem is to find which of the partial waves is not permitted. The options are different transitions, each associated with a certain partial wave (like S, P, D, F). The lowercase letters denote the angular momentum state of X. So for each option, the NN system goes from 1S0 to some state, and X is emitted in a specific angular momentum state.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0, so NN is in S=0, L=0, J=0. After emitting X, the NN system has some new quantum numbers. Let's denote the initial as (S_initial, L_initial, J_initial) = (0,0,0). After emission, the NN's state is (S_final, L_final, J_final). Also, X has some angular momentum l.

In terms of angular momentum conservation, the total angular momentum before and after must be the same. But because the system emits a particle, the total angular momentum is conserved, so NN's J_final plus X's l must equal NN's J_initial, but wait, that's not quite right. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of adding the angular momenta of the NN system and the emitted X to get the initial state.

Wait no, the initial state is the NN system, and when it emits X, the NN system and X have their angular momenta adding up to the initial angular momentum. So initial angular momentum is J_initial = 0, so the final NN's J_final and X's l must satisfy J_final + l = 0? That doesn't make sense because J is a vector quantity. Oh wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the total angular momentum is conserved: the sum of the angular momenta of the NN system and the emitted particle X must equal the initial angular momentum. Since the initial J is 0, the sum must be 0. So the angular momentum quantum numbers must be such that the vector sum is zero. But in quantum terms, the total J must be zero. So the possible ways are when the individual Js combine to zero. So for each option, the NN's J_final and X's l must combine to zero.

Wait, but J_final and l are vectors, so for their sum to be zero, they must have the same magnitude and opposite directions. So J_final must equal l with opposite direction. But J is the total angular momentum, which includes spin and orbital parts. So if X has orbital angular momentum l, then the NN system's J_final must also be l, but with opposite. But wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the initial state is L_initial = 0. So when the NN system emits X, which has orbital angular momentum l, the change in orbital angular momentum is from 0 to L_final. Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the process as the NN system's orbital angular momentum changes by some amount, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider parity as well. The initial state has certain parity, and the final state must have the same parity because parity is conserved in strong interactions (but wait, is this process via strong force or EM? The question says it's about emitting a particle X, which could be a pion or something, but perhaps parity is conserved here.)

The initial state parity is determined by its quantum numbers. For the 1S0 state, S=0, L=0, so the parity is (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1. Because the parity of a state is (-1)^
