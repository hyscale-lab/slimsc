Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diffraction. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and it's creating intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is about finding the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Oh wait, right, when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? So it's essentially a circular aperture. But wait, the options don't include the standard first minima for a single slit. Wait, no, wait, the standard single slit has the first minima at θ where sinθ = λ/a, but wait, that's for a slit of width 'a'. But wait, in this case, the apothem is 'a'. Hmm, I need to get back to the basics.

Wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, right? So for a regular polygon, the apothem 'a' is related to the radius (the distance from center to a vertex). For a regular polygon, the radius R is a / (cos(π/N)), but when N is very large, R is approximately a, right? Because cos(π/N) approaches 1 as N becomes large. So for a very large N, the shape is a circle with radius about a. So the problem reduces to finding the minima for a circular aperture.

Wait,
