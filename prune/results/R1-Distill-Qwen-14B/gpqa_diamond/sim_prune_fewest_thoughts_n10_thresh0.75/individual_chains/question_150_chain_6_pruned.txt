Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data and then determining the final product after a series of reactions. The molecular formula is C8H9NO, and the NMR data is provided. The reagents used are first NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, and finally aqueous KOH with heat. The options are four different compounds, all of which are aldehydes or something similar with phenyl groups.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the starting compound based on the NMR data. Let's look at the NMR signals:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift. Usually, aldehyde protons (RCHO) are around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes these can also be part of an aromatic system or maybe an acidic proton like a phenol. But given that it's a triplet, maybe it's not an aldehyde. Or perhaps it's an aldehyde next to some coupling. Alternatively, it could be an exchange with something else, but I'm not sure yet.

- 6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H. This is in the aromatic region. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. Maybe a para-substituted benzene ring with substituents on adjacent positions?

- 6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H. Another aromatic doublet. Maybe another para-substituted ring or maybe part of a conjugated system like a vinyl group attached to a benzene.

- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlet suggests some kind of exchange or maybe a diol or something with OH groups. Wait, but the molecular formula has an O, so maybe a phenol or something else.

- 3.66 ppm, doublet, 2H. This is probably a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2CH2 or something like that.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has two aromatic rings attached to a chain. Let me think about possible structures.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. For C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees. That could be two rings (benzene accounts for 3, another ring would be another 3, but wait, 5 total. So maybe one benzene ring (3) and a double bond (1) and a ring (another 1), but that's 5. Wait, perhaps another way.

Alternatively, benzene (3), a double bond (1), and a carbonyl group (another 1), but then that would sum to 5. Or maybe a benzene ring, a double bond, and a ring with an oxygen. Hmm.

Looking at the NMR data again. The triplet at 9.72 ppm. If it's a triplet, the coupling is with two equivalent protons. Maybe it's an aldehyde proton next to a CH2 group. So, like RCHO where the R is connected to a CH2, which would split the aldehyde into a triplet. Or maybe it's something else. Wait, but aldehydes are usually singlets unless coupled to something else. So if the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group, then the proton would couple with the two protons on the CH2, giving a triplet. That makes sense.

So perhaps the structure has an aldehyde group attached to a CH2 group. Then, looking at the rest of the NMR, the 3.66 ppm doublet is
