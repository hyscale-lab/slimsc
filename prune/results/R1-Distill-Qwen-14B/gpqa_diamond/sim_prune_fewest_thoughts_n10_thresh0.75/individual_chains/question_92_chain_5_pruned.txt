Okay, so I've got this problem to calculate the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm. The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That's quite a mouthful. Let me write down the structure to visualize it better. Wait, actually, maybe I don't need the structure for this calculation. But knowing the structure might help me count the number of each type of bond.

The question gives me the enthalpy of atomization for carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh right, the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a bond in an element into its constituent atoms. So for carbon, it's the energy to break a C-C bond into two C atoms.

The bond energies provided are:
- H-H: 100 kJ/mol
- C-C: 200 kJ/mol
- C=C: 300 kJ/mol
- C-H: 400 kJ/mol

So the compound given is an alkene with some substituents. Wait, but for calculating enthalpy of formation, I remember that the standard approach is to use bond energies. The enthalpy of formation can be calculated by determining the energy required to break all the bonds in the reactants (elements) to form the products (the compound).

Wait, no, actually, the enthalpy of formation is the energy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements
