Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. 

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the variance formula. The formula is ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). But wait, since the system is in an eigenstate of P_x, what does that mean for P_z? Oh right, if a system is in an eigenstate of one operator, it's not necessarily an eigenstate of another operator that doesn't commute with it. So P_x and P_z probably don't commute, which means the uncertainty might not be zero.

Wait, let me think about the operators. The operators given are P_x, P_y, and P_z. I know that in quantum mechanics, the angular momentum operators (like L_x, L_y, L_z) satisfy certain commutation relations, but I'm not sure if P here is position or momentum. Oh, wait, the components have ħ in them, which is the reduced Planck constant. Oh, right, P here is probably the momentum operator, since momentum operators involve ħ.

So, the state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let's denote this state as |ψ⟩. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which means that the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. So, each component of the vector probably corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z. 

Wait, the eigenvalues of P_z are given by the diagonal elements of its matrix. P_z's matrix is diag(ħ, 0, -ħ). So the basis states are |1⟩, |0⟩, |-1⟩, with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ respectively. 

So the state |ψ⟩ is a linear combination of these basis states. Let me write |ψ⟩ as a sum of these basis states. The components of |ψ⟩ are (-1/2)|1⟩ + (1/sqrt(2))|0⟩ + (-1/2)|-1⟩. 

Wait, but in that case, the expectation value of P_z, ⟨P_z⟩, would be the sum of each component multiplied by their eigenvalue. Let me calculate that. So, ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ is equal to (-1/2)*(ħ) + (1/sqrt(2))*(0) + (-1/2)*(-ħ). Wait, no, because each component is in a different basis state. So the expectation value would be the sum of each amplitude squared multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalue. Wait, no, more accurately, since |ψ⟩ is expressed as a linear combination of |1⟩, |0⟩, and |-1⟩, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum of the coefficients squared multiplied by their eigenvalues.

So, the coefficient for |1⟩ is -1/2, so (-1/2)^2 = 1/4, multiplied by ħ. For |0⟩, coefficient is 1/sqrt(2), so (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2, multiplied by 0, which is 0. For |-1⟩, coefficient is -1/2, so same as |1⟩, (1/4)*(-ħ). So adding them up: (1/4)*ħ + 0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 -1/4)ħ = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Wait, that's interesting. So the average momentum in the z-direction is zero. Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Since P_z is diagonal, its square is just the square of each diagonal element. So the matrix P_z² is diag( (ħ)^2, 0, ( - ħ )^2 ) = diag( ħ², 0, ħ² ). 

So, to find ⟨P_z²⟩, we'll compute |ψ⟩† P_z² |ψ⟩. Let's compute each term. The components of |ψ⟩ are (a, b, c) where a=-1/2, b=1/sqrt(2), c=-1/2.

So, the diagonal matrix P_z² has elements (ħ², 0, ħ²). So the expectation value would be a² * ħ² + b² * 0 + c² * ħ².

So, a² is (1/2)^2 = 1/4, so (1/4)*ħ². b^2 is (1/2), but multiplied by zero gives zero. c² is (1/4)*ħ². Adding them together: (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ². So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/2) ħ².

Now, the variance is ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩². ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, so variance is (1/2) ħ². Therefore, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it using the state's components and the operator matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it by evaluating ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ using the operator matrices. Let me see.

Wait, the state vector is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2 ].

First, compute ⟨P_z⟩: that's the conjugate transpose of |ψ⟩ multiplied by P_z, then multiplied by |ψ⟩. But since P_z is diagonal, this is just the sum of |a|^2 * P_z[i,i] + |b|^2 * P_z[j,j] etc.

Wait, earlier I did this and found it zero. So that part seems correct.

Now for ⟨P_z²⟩, same thing: sum of |a|^2 * (P_z[i,i])² + |b|^2 * (P_z[j,j})² + |c|^2 * (P_z[k,k})².

So, a is -1/2, |a|^2=1/4; P_z[1,1] is ħ, so (ħ)^2. Similarly, c is -1/2, same |c|^2, and P_z[3,3] is -ħ, but squared is same ħ². So again, 1/4 * ħ² + 1/4 * ħ² = 1/2 ħ².

So the calculation holds. Hence, the uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

Wait, but let me check if I correctly applied the state vector. The state is [-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2]^T, right? So each component is the coefficient of the basis eigenstate. So when we compute ⟨P_z⟩, each coefficient squared times the corresponding eigenvalue. So for the first component, |−1/2|^2 * ħ = (1/4) * ħ. For the third component, |−1/2|^2 * (-ħ) = (1/4)(-ħ), but wait, no, wait: ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum of |c_i|^2 multiplied by P_z's eigenvalues. So each term is |c_i|^2 * p_i, where p_i is the eigenvalue for that basis state.

So for the first term, (|−1/2|^2) * (ħ) = (1/4)(ħ). The second term is (1/2) * (0) = 0. The third term is (1/4)(-ħ). So total is (1/4)ħ - (1/4)ħ = 0. That's correct.

Similarly, for ⟨P_z²⟩, each term is |c_i|^2 * (p_i)^2. So first term (1/4)(ħ²), second term (1/2)(0) = 0, third term (1/4)(ħ²). Total is (1/4 +1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So the variance is (1/2 ħ²) - (0)^2 = 1/2 ħ².

Uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ for the first, second, and third basis states, respectively. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \cdot \hbar + \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 \cdot 0 + \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{1}{4} \hbar - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$.

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is diagonal, with elements $(\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2)$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 \cdot 0 + \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Uncertainty $\Delta P_z$
The variance is given by:

\[
\text{Var}(P_z) = \langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

The uncertainty is the square root of the variance:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\text{Var}(P_z)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.
