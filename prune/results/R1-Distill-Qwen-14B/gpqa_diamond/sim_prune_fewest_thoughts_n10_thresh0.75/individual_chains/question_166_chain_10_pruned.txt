Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ through radiative corrections. Hmm, I remember that when you have spontaneous symmetry breaking, the Higgs mechanism comes into play, and some of the Nambu-Goldstone bosons become massive, while others might remain as pseudo-Goldstone bosons, especially if there's a custodial symmetry or something similar.

Looking at the Lagrangian provided, I see that there are singlet fermions N_iR, a scalar doublet S, and a singlet scalar phi. The potential V depends on phi, S, and H. Wait, what's H here? Oh, probably another scalar field, maybe part of the doublet S. Or perhaps H is another component—like after symmetry breaking, the physical Higgs fields.

The vacuum expectation value (VEV) for phi is given as ⟨phi⟩² = x² + v². So phi's VEV is x, and another field's VEV is v. Wait, but which field is that? The given Lagrangian has S as a scalar doublet, so after symmetry breaking, S would have components that get VEVs. But the problem says ⟨phi⟩ is x and ⟨h⟩ is v. Oh, wait, maybe h is part of S. Oh, wait, maybe S is the Higgs doublet, and h is the real part or the CP-even component. So perhaps S has a VEV, but phi has its own VEV.

Wait, the VEVs are given as ⟨phi⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v. So phi is a singlet scalar, and h is another field—I think h is part of S. So S is a scalar doublet, so it's like (S⁺, S⁰) or something. Then the V
