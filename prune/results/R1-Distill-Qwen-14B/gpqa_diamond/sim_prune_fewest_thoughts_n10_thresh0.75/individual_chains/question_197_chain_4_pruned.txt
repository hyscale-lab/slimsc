Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about Compound X, which reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the options given. They provided IR and NMR data, so I'll have to use that to figure out what Compound X is first, and then see what happens when it reacts with those reagents.

Starting with the IR data: the peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm-1. Hmm. The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 might indicate an -OH stretch, like in a carboxylic acid. Wait, but I've heard that sometimes alcohols or maybe even amines could show up there, but more likely, a carboxylic acid because the OH is broad. Also, the peak at 1720 could be a carbonyl group, which fits with a carboxylic acid (like around 1700 cm-1). But wait, sometimes esters or ketones can have similar carbonyl peaks. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are probably aromatic C=C stretches. So maybe the compound has an aromatic ring with substituents.

Looking at the NMR data: 

1H NMR shows:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) – that's a broad singlet. For a carboxylic acid, the proton is usually around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak because of hydrogen bonding. So that suggests a COOH group.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) – this looks like a para-substituted benzene. The doublets suggest two sets of protons, each with two H, which are probably on opposite ends of the ring. So maybe it's a substituent at the para position, like a methyl group or something else.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) – that's a multiplet with one proton. Maybe a CH group adjacent to something else, like an oxygen or another CH2. 

1.7 ppm (m, 2H) – another multiplet, but this time two protons. Perhaps a CH2 group next to a CH or connected to an aromatic ring.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H) – a doublet with three H. That's likely a methyl group attached to something that has two equivalent neighboring protons, like a CH2. Wait, maybe it's a CH(CH3) group? Because if it's a doublet, the two adjacent protons could be on the same carbon, so a geminal coupling? Or maybe it's a CH2 next to a CH3. Hmm.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H) – a triplet, three H. That's a terminal CH3 group, probably attached to a CH2. So maybe an ethyl chain or something similar.

Putting this together, let's think about the structure. From the NMR, the aromatic protons are para, so the substituent is at position 4. The substituent might have a chain attached. The downfield shift at 10.5 ppm suggests a COOH group attached to the benzene ring. Wait, but if it's a COOH, then the IR at 1720 could be the carbonyl. So the substituent is a COOH group on the benzene ring. But wait, the 10.5 ppm is a broad peak, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid proton.

Wait, but wait. The NMR also shows that besides the aromatic protons, there are other signals. So if the benzene ring has a COOH group, and another substituent, perhaps an alkyl chain, that would explain the other signals.

Wait no, the substituent
