Okay, so I have this question about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, interesting. I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both North and South poles; you can't isolate them. So that's a key point.

Maxwell's equations are four in total. Let me think about each one. The first equation is about the divergence of the electric field and relates to charge density. The second is about the curl of the electric field and displacement current, which is related to changing magnetic fields. The third is about the divergence of the magnetic field, which in our universe is always zero because there are no isolated magnetic poles—so that's the one that would change if isolated poles exist. The fourth equation is about the curl of the magnetic field and Ampère's law, involving the current and the displacement current.

Wait, so in our universe, the divergence of B is zero (Gauss's law for magnetism). But in this alternate universe, if you can have isolated poles, then that equation would change. So the divergence of B would not be zero anymore. So the equation ∇·B = 0 becomes ∇·B = something, probably related to the magnetic charge density.

But the question is asking which Maxwell's equations are different. Let's think: Maxwell's equations are:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
3. ∇·B = 0
4. ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

In our universe, equation 3 is zero, but if magnetic monopoles exist, equation 3 would be ∇·B = ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. So equation 3 changes.

What about equation 4? In our universe, Ampère's law without displacement current is ∇×B = μ₀ J. But with displacement current, it's ∇×B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t). I don't think equation 4 changes when you have magnetic monopoles. That equation is about the curl of B and relates to currents and displacement. So equation 4 remains the same.

Wait, but wait. Oh no, wait! Another thought— Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition (equation 4) also relates to the time varying E fields. But when you have magnetic monopoles, do other equations change besides equation 3?

Wait, also, Faraday's law (equation 2) might change? No, equation 2 is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. If there are magnetic charges, does that affect Faraday's law? Hmm, I think equation 2 remains the same because it's about how changing B fields create circulating E fields, regardless of the presence of magnetic charges. So equation 2 is unchanged.

So the only equation that would change is equation 3. But let me think again. Wait, I remember that in the presence of magnetic monopoles, another equation changes. Because Maxwell's equations are symmetric in E and B when you have magnetic charges. So, if equation 3 changes
