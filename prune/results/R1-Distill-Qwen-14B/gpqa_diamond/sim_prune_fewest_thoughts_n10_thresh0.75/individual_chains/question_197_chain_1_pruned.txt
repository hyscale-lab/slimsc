Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, okay. I remember that when red phosphorus and HI are used, it's usually a reaction called the Hunsdiecker reaction, but wait, no, that's for converting alkyl chlorides to alkenes. Oh wait, another possibility: maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation? Or maybe it's an elimination reaction, but wait, red phosphorus is often used in the substitution reactions, like the formation of the ylide in the Wittig reaction. Oh wait, no, the Wittig reagent is made from triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide, but red phosphorus might be involved in something else.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI could be used in the hydrolysis of an ester? Or maybe in the cleavage of a carbon-halogen bond. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination reaction, like removing a halogen. Hmm. Let me think. Oh wait, I think that when alkenyl halides react with red phosphorus and HI, it can result in the formation of alkenes via elimination, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene.

But first, I need to figure out what compound X is
