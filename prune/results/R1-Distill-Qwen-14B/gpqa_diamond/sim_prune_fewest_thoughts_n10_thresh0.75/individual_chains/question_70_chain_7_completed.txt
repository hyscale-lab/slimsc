Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let me read through it again and try to break it down step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions, and I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

First, I'll try to outline what each reaction is telling me. 

Reaction 1: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I remember that when elements react with each other in certain ratios, they form compounds. 8 equivalents of B reacting with 1 of A... Hmm, maybe it's something like sulfur reacting with oxygen or something similar. Wait, bright red product C. Oh! I think I recall that when sulfur (solid) reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid (maybe that's not it), but wait, another thought: maybe it's about the reaction of a metal with a diatomic gas. Alternatively, perhaps A is sodium and B is chlorine? But 8 equivalents of Cl2 with Na would form NaCl. But wait, the product is bright red. Sodium chloride is white. Maybe it's something else.

Wait, bright red products in chemistry... Oh, maybe it's about the formation of a compound like Na2O2. Wait, no, that's not red. Alternatively, maybe it's about the reaction of a metal with another element. Another thought: maybe A is a metal, and B is Cl2. Wait, but 8 equivalents of Cl2 to 1 of A would imply a formula like ACl8? That seems unusual. Alternatively, perhaps A is aluminum and B is fluorine. Aluminum reacts with fluorine in a certain ratio. But what product is bright red?

Wait, another angle: the product C is used in another reaction. When C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Then, C reacting with water gives back A and two acids F and G, where F is strong and G is weak.

So let me think about the possible structures.

If C reacts with water to produce A plus two acids, maybe C is a salt. Let's say, for example, C is a metal sulfide. Wait, but when a sulfide reacts with water, it usually produces the metal hydroxide and H2S, which is a weak acid. But in this case, the two acids are F (strong) and G (weak). So perhaps C is a salt that when hydrolyzed produces a strong acid and a weak acid.

Wait, maybe C is a nitride? For example, if C is Mg3N2, when it reacts with water, it produces Mg(OH)2 (which is a weak base, but in the products, it's giving A and two acids. Wait, maybe A is Mg metal? Wait, then when Mg reacts with water, it's Mg(OH)2 and H2 gas, but that doesn't fit because the product is two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide. Suppose C is a group 1 sulfide. For example, Na2S. When Na2S reacts with water, it would produce NaOH and H2S. But NaOH is a strong base, not an acid. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track here.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a nitride or a phosphide. Let's think about nitrides. For example, when Ca3N2 reacts with water, it produces Ca(OH)2 and NH3. Again, not acids. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a metal chloride. For example, suppose A is Al and B is Cl2. Al reacts with Cl2 in a certain ratio. Wait, but Al is solid and Cl2 is gas. Al + Cl2 → AlCl3. But 8 equivalents of Cl2 to 1 Al would imply AlCl8? That doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe the formula is ACl4? Like SiCl4, which is tetrahedral.

Wait, another approach: when C reacts with D, which is another gas, in a 1:2 ratio, to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Also, D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So, D and B are gases that react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. What are common gas solvents? Maybe D is H2O (but that's a liquid at room temp), or perhaps D is NH3? But NH3 is a gas but not a solvent in the same way as water. Alternatively, D could be O2 or something else. Wait, if H is a solvent, maybe it's something like CH3OH (methanol), but how would that form from D and B?

Wait, maybe D is CO2 and B is O2? No, that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, B is O2, D is another diatomic gas. Wait, if B is O2, then D could be, say, Cl2 or another diatomic gas. But their reaction in 1:1 ratio... Let me think about some reactions. Maybe B is O2 and D is H2, but H2 and O2 in 1:1 would form H2O, which is a solvent. So H would be H2O. That could fit. So D is H2, B is O2. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of H2 to form E. What's C then?

Wait, but earlier, C is the product of A and B. So A reacting with O2 (B) to form C. So if A is a metal, then C would be the oxide. For example, if A is sodium (Na), then reacting with O2 would form Na2O or NaO2? But Na2O is a solid, but I'm not sure about the color. Wait, but the product C is bright red. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a transition metal. For example, copper reacts with O2 to form CuO, which is black, not red. What about Fe? FeO is black, Fe3O4 is black too. Hmm. Maybe a different oxide.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a compound with a red color. For example, some sulfides or chromates. Wait, sodium chromate is yellow. Lead dioxide is dark brown. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitride? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide with a red color. Alternatively, maybe it's not a metal. Let me think about nonmetals. For example, sulfur reacting with something. If A is S (solid), and B is O2 (gas), then they react to form SO2 or SO3. But SO2 is a gas, not solid. Alternatively, maybe solid sulfur reacting with Cl2 (gas B) to form SCl2 or something else. But I'm not sure about the colors.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that reacts with O2 to form a red oxide. I'm not recalling any common red metal oxides. Wait, what about MnO2? No, that's black. Hmm. Maybe it's not metal oxide.

Wait, perhaps C is an oxide of a transition metal with a red color. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide. Let me think: could a sulfide be red? For example, PbS is a dark brown solid, not red. Maybe CuS is black. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. Wait, perhaps it's something like Mg3N2. But that's white.

Wait, maybe the bright red product is something else. Oh! I remember that when iodine (I2) reacts with certain metals, it can form a compound with a bright red color. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction like aluminum and iodine. Al + I2 → AlI3. AlI3 is a white solid, I think. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction that forms something like mercury(I) iodide, which is red, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: considering the reaction C reacting with water to form A and two acids. Suppose C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong acid. So, when C (a salt) is dissolved in water, it hydrolyzes into a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is NaHSO4, which is a salt of H2SO4 (strong acid) and HSO4^- (which can act as a weak acid). Wait, NaHSO4 is a sodium bisulfate. When it dissociates, it gives Na+ and HSO4^-; in water, HSO4^- can act as an acid. So if you have C as NaHSO4, then reacting with water (hydrolysis) would give NaOH (strong base, but wait, the products are A and two acids. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps C is something like MgNH4PO4, which is a precipitate when Mg salts are mixed with ammonium phosphate. But that's probably not it.

Wait, another approach: if C is a metal sulfate, say MgSO4. When MgSO4 reacts with water, it dissociates into Mg^2+ and SO4^2-. But that's just the ions; the products might not form two acids. Alternatively, if C is a metal nitrate, like Al(NO3)3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't produce acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a mixed salt, like a sulfite and something else. Wait, perhaps it's a carbonate. If C is sodium carbonate, Na2CO3, when it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze to produce NaOH (a strong base) and CO2 (a weak acid). But in the question, the products are A (the original solid) and two acids. So perhaps C is something else.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide, and when it reacts with water, it produces a metal hydroxide and H2S. But then the acids would be H2S (weak) and perhaps another acid. Wait, but then where's the strong acid?

Wait, another possibility: C is a nitride. Suppose C is NH4NO3. Wait, no, that's not a nitride. Alternatively, maybe it's a phosphate. Not sure.

Hmm, maybe I should backtrack. Let's consider the reaction where C reacts with D. C + 2 D → E. E is extremely hazardous. What are some extremely hazardous compounds? Maybe something like HCl gas? No, that's not a compound. Alternatively, maybe E is something like phosgene (but that's more of a gas). Alternatively, perhaps E is a nerve agent or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So, B and D are gases reacting to form a solvent. Let's think about common solvents. Water is a solvent, but it's a liquid. Methanol is a solvent but not formed from two gases. Maybe H is something like HCl gas? No, that's not a solvent. Wait, maybe H is NH3, which is a gas but can act as a solvent in some contexts. Alternatively, H could be H2O, which is a solvent. So, if H is H2O, which is formed from B and D in a 1:1 ratio. So, what gases B and D would react in 1:1 ratio to form H2O?

Well, H2O could form from H2 and O2, but that would be a 2:1 ratio (2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O). Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is H2, but their reaction requires 2 moles of H2 for every mole of O2. So that's a 2:1 ratio, but the question says 1:1. Hmm, maybe another reaction.

Wait, another possibility: B is Cl2, D is H2. They don't react, though. Alternatively, B is O2 and D is another diatomic gas. Wait, maybe B is O2 and D is F2. But O2 and F2 react in a 1:1 ratio? No, they react in a 1:1 ratio to form OF2, which is a gas but not a solvent.

Alternatively, maybe H is NH3. Then, B and D could be N2 and H2, which react in a 3:1 ratio (to make NH3), but that's not 1:1. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: H is a solvent. So maybe H is something like ethanol, but how would that form from B and D in a 1:1 ratio. Alternatively, maybe B is CO2 and D is something else. I'm not sure. Maybe I should think of H as a different solvent, like maybe methanol (CH3OH), but how would that form from B and D? That would require CO and H2 maybe, but that's a different ratio.

Alternatively, maybe H is something like HCl, but that's not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the product E as something like phosgene (COCl2), which is extremely hazardous. But how would that form from C and D? Let's say C is CO, and D is Cl2. Then, CO + 2 Cl2 → COCl2 + Cl2? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps E is a carbonyl chloride, which would be dangerous. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe E is a highly toxic gas like HCN. But how would that form from C and D? If C is CN^- and D is HCN, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a diatomic gas, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a cyanide salt. For example, if C is NaCN, and D is H2SO4 (but D is a gas, so that's unlikely). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a chlorinated compound. Let me think about the reactions.

If C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is dangerous. D is a gas. So, maybe D is Cl2, and C is something that when reacts with Cl2 forms a dangerous compound. For example, if C is CH3CH2NH2 (ethylamine), reacting with Cl2 could form something dangerous, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe D is Cl2 and C is a metal sulfide. For example, if C is FeS, and D is Cl2, then FeS + Cl2 → FeCl3 + S. But I don't know if that's dangerous.

Alternatively, thinking about E being extremely hazardous, perhaps E is sarin gas or another nerve agent. But I don't think that's relevant here.

Wait, perhaps E is a highly reactive compound like ozone (O3), but that's formed from O2 and some energy. Alternatively, maybe E is NO2, which is a dangerous gas.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible structures of E. The question is about the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

These are symmetry groups. So E must have a certain structure that gives it one of these symmetry groups.

D∞h is the symmetry group of a linear molecule with infinite twofold axes perpendicular to the main axis and a center of inversion. For example, CO2 is D∞h, but wait, CO2 is linear but has D∞h symmetry. Wait, no, CO2 is linear, but its symmetry group is D∞h. Wait, actually, CO2 has a structure where the two O atoms are symmetric across the central C, so yes, D∞h symmetry.

Another example is HCN, which is linear and has D∞h symmetry. So if E is a linear molecule with multiple twofold axes perpendicular to the main axis, then D∞h is the symmetry group.

Wait, but another possibility: D4h is a point group that includes a four-fold rotation axis, mirror planes, etc. That would be for a molecule like SO4^2- or something with a square planar structure. Alternatively, maybe it's for a molecule like CCl4, which has a tetrahedral structure but with a four-fold axis.

C2 symmetry would be for a molecule with a two-fold axis, like H2O (but wait, H2O has C2v symmetry, not C2). Hmm.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the symmetry groups. Let me think:

- C2: has a single twofold rotation axis. Examples include H2O (but wait, H2O has C2v symmetry because it has a C2 axis and two perpendicular mirror planes.

- C2v: has a C2 axis and two mirror planes perpendicular to the C2 axis. So H2O has C2v symmetry.

- D4h: includes a four-fold rotation axis and several mirror planes and inversion. This is the symmetry group of molecules like SO4^2- (tetrahedral) or perhaps some linear molecules with more symmetry.

- D∞h: as mentioned before, for linear molecules with infinite twofold axes perpendicular to the main axis.

So, if E is a linear molecule, perhaps like CO2 or HCN, it would have D∞h symmetry. Alternatively, if it's a tetrahedral molecule, perhaps D4h.

But to determine which one, I need to figure out what E is.

Wait, let's try to go back through the reactions.

Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red)
Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous)
Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G (F is strong acid, G weak acid)
Reaction 4: B + D → H (solvent, 1:1 ratio)

So, starting with Reaction 4: B and D react in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So, B and D are gases, and their reaction produces H, which is a solvent. So, what solvents are formed from the reaction of two gases? H2O could be a possibility, but it's a liquid. Another possibility is NH3, but that's a gas and a solvent. Alternatively, maybe H is something like HCl, but that's a gas and a strong acid, not a solvent.

Wait, another thought: perhaps H is a gas that's used as a solvent, like liquid nitrogen, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe H is a solution of something.

Wait, perhaps B is H2, D is O2. Then, their reaction would be 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But that's a 2:1 ratio of H2 to O2, which doesn't fit the 1:1 ratio given in the problem. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is another diatomic gas. Wait, maybe D is F2. O2 and F2 react in a 1:1 ratio? No, they react to form OF2, but that's a diatomic molecule.

Wait, another possibility: maybe B is CO2 and D is something else. But I don't think CO2 reacts with another gas in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent.

Wait, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is H2. Cl2 and H2 react in a 1:1 ratio to form 2 HCl. So, H would be HCl gas. But is HCl a solvent? It's a gas, but in solution, it's a strong acid. Not sure if that fits.

Wait, if H is HCl, then D is H2, and B is Cl2. So, in reaction 4, Cl2 + H2 → 2 HCl.

Then, in reaction 1, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of Cl2 to form C. So, A is a metal that reacts with Cl2 in a 8:1 ratio. Wait, 8 equivalents of Cl2 per mole of A. What metal reacts with Cl2 in such a high ratio? Maybe aluminum? Aluminum typically reacts with Cl2 in a 3:4 ratio, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps A is sulfur (S8), which reacts with Cl2 to form SCl2. But SCl2 is a liquid, not solid, I think.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state. For example, if A is iron, reacting with Cl2 in a certain ratio. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about reaction 3: C reacts with water to produce A and two acids F and G. So, C is a salt that when hydrolyzed gives back A (the original metal), a strong acid F, and a weak acid G.

So, let's say C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is NaHSO4, which is sodium bisulfate. When it reacts with water, it would produce NaOH (strong base) and HSO4^- (which can act as an acid). But in the question, the products are A (solid), and two acids. So perhaps C is a metal bisulfate, which when hydrolyzed gives the metal (A), H2SO4 (strong acid), and H2S (weak acid, but H2S is a gas). Wait, but the reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G.

Wait, if C is a metal sulfide, like FeS, then reacting with water would produce Fe(OH)2 and H2S. But Fe(OH)2 is a base, not an acid. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, if C is a metal nitride, like Mg3N2. Mg3N2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, but again, the products are a base and a weak base, not acids. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a carbonate. For example, CaCO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't really react unless there's acid. But in the question, C reacts with water to produce A and two acids. So maybe C is a different kind of salt.

Wait, perhaps C is a phosphate. For example, if C is MgNH4PO4 (a precipitate), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: since F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps F is HCl (strong) and G is H2S (weak). Then, C would be a chloride sulfide? Not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite. For example, Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it would hydrolyze to form NaOH and H2SO3 (which is a weak acid). But again, the products are a base and a weak acid, not two acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a bisulfate, like HSO4^- as part of a salt. For example, if C is NaHSO4, it dissociates into Na+ and HSO4^- in water. HSO4^- can act as an acid (donating H+ to form SO4^2- and H+), but in the presence of water, it might not produce two separate acids. Hmm.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should try to think about the reactions and the possible identities of the compounds.

Let me try to make some assumptions:

Assuming that in Reaction 4, B is Cl2 and D is H2. Then, B + D → 2 HCl (H is HCl). But HCl is a gas, not a solvent, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2. But their reaction requires 2 H2 for each O2, which is a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: B is O2 and D is another O2? No, that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps B is CO2 and D is CH4, but I don't see how that forms a solvent.

Alternatively, maybe B is N2 and D is O2. But their reaction isn't straightforward. Hmm.

Wait, maybe H is NH3. To form NH3 from two gases in 1:1 ratio. So, maybe B is N2 and D is H2. The Haber process is N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3, but that's a 1:3 ratio. Not 1:1. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps B is NO and D is O2. They react in a 4:3 ratio to form NO2, but that's not a solvent.

Wait, perhaps H is something like CH3OH (methanol). How could that form from two gases? Maybe from CO and H2. The reaction would be CO + 2 H2 → CH3OH, but that's a 1:2 ratio. So that doesn't fit the 1:1 ratio.

Hmm. Maybe I'm stuck on reaction 4. Let me try to think differently.

If H is a solvent, maybe it's a liquid formed from gases B and D in a 1:1 ratio. So, perhaps B is CO2 and D is something else. For example, CO2 + H2O → H2CO3 (carbonic acid), which is a weak acid. But that's a 1:1 ratio. Then, H would be H2CO3, but that's a weak acid, not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is SO3 and D is H2O. Then, SO3 + H2O → H2SO4. H2SO4 is a strong acid, not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe B is HCl and D is NaOH. But both are not gases. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is NH3 and D is HCl. They could react in a 1:1 ratio to form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps H is H2O. So, B and D reacting in 1:1 ratio to form H2O. How can that happen? Well, 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But that's a 2:1 ratio. Not 1:1. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe B is H2O and D is something else. No, because B is a gas and D is a gas. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is O2 and D is O2. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is another O2 but in a different form. No, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is F2. They could react to form ClF, but I'm not sure about the ratio.

This is getting a bit too stuck. Let me try to think about another angle. Maybe E is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. So, what's a common extremely hazardous linear molecule with that symmetry? For example, phosgene (O=CCl2) has D∞h symmetry. Phosgene is a dangerous gas.

So, if E is phosgene, what would C and D be?

Phosgene is O=CCl2. So, perhaps C is COCl, and D is Cl2. Then, COCl + Cl2 → COCl2 + Cl2? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is CO and D is Cl2. CO + 2 Cl2 → COCl2 + Cl2? Not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a dichloride, and D is another chloride. Hmm.

Wait, let me think. If E is COCl2 (phosgene), then in reaction 2, C (which is CO) reacts with 2 moles of D (Cl2) to form COCl2 + Cl2. So, the reaction would be CO + 2 Cl2 → COCl2 + Cl2? Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Maybe the reaction is CO + 2 Cl2 → COCl2 + 2 Cl. No, that wouldn't balance.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is C + 2 D → E. So, if E is COCl2, then C could be CO, and D could be Cl2. Then, the reaction would be CO + 2 Cl2 → COCl2 + Cl2? No, that can't be right because Cl2 is on both sides.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is CO + 2 Cl2 → COCl2 + Cl2↑, but that doesn't seem to balance. Alternatively, maybe it's CO + 2 Cl2 → COCl2 + 2 Cl. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is CH3Cl and D is Cl2. Then, CH3Cl + Cl2 → CHCl3 + HCl. But CHCl3 is a liquid, not a gas, and I'm not sure about the hazards.

Wait, maybe E is something like Cl2O, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps E is O3 (ozone), which is a triatomic molecule with a bent structure and D3h symmetry, which isn't one of the options. So that's not helpful.

Another idea: if E is a diatomic molecule, like O2 or O3, but O2 is just O2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps E is a molecule like SO2, which is bent and has C2v symmetry. But SO2 is a gas, and it's toxic, but what about its symmetry group?

Wait, the options include C2v as one of the choices (option D). So, if E has C2v symmetry, what could it be?

C2v symmetry is for a molecule with a C2 axis and two mirror planes. For example, H2O has C2v symmetry. Wait, but H2O is a bent molecule with two mirror planes of symmetry. So, if E is H2O, that would have C2v symmetry. But H2O is not extremely hazardous; it's a common solvent. So that might not fit.

Wait, but maybe E is a different molecule with C2v symmetry, like SO2. SO2 is a toxic gas, so that fits. SO2 has a bent structure with a C2 axis and two mirror planes, so its symmetry group is C2v. So if E is SO2, then the symmetry group is C2v (option D).

So, putting this together, let me see:

E is SO2. Then, reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → SO2.

What is C and D?

If C is a sulfur-containing compound and D is another gas. For example, if C is S (solid), and D is O2 (gas). Then, the reaction would be S + 2 O2 → SO2. But wait, the reaction in the question is C (bright red) reacting with 2 D to form E. If C is S, which is bright yellow, not bright red. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, another possibility: maybe C is a sulfide. Suppose C is CuS. Reacting with O2 (D is O2?), but how would that form SO2.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate and D is a gas. Not sure.

Wait, another approach: if E is SO2, then D would be O2 and C would be S. But C is the product of reaction 1, which is A + 8 B → C (bright red). So, if C is S, then A + 8 B → S. But S is yellow. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide. For example, if A is Fe and B is S, then Fe reacts with S to form FeS, which is black. Not red.

Hmm, maybe C is a different compound. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate or something else.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfate. For example, if A is Na and B is SO3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a different compound that when reacted with O2 (D) forms SO2. But I'm not quite getting there.

Wait, another thought: perhaps E is a different molecule. For example, if E is NH3, which has a trigonal pyramidal structure with C3v symmetry. But that's not an option.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like HCN, which is linear and has D∞h symmetry. HCN is a highly toxic gas. So, if E is HCN, then its symmetry group is D∞h (option B). But earlier, I thought D∞h is for linear molecules with multiple perpendicular twofold axes, so that would fit HCN.

So, if E is HCN, reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → HCN.

What's C and D then?

HCN is formed from, say, CH3Cl and NH3, but that's not with D as a gas. Alternatively, perhaps C is CN^- and D is H2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a cyanide salt, like NaCN, and D is H2O. But D is a gas, so that can't be.

Wait, another approach: if E is HCN, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → HCN. So, D could be a gas like H2, and C would be CN^-. But how is C formed?

In reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. If C is CN^-, then perhaps A is Na (solid) and B is CN gas? But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is CH3CN (acetonitrile), but that's a liquid, not a gas.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the problem in terms of the possible answers and see which one fits.

The options are:

A) C2
B) D4h
C) D∞h
D) C2v

If the answer is D∞h, then E is a linear molecule. If it's C2v, E is a bent molecule like SO2.

Another angle: C reacts with water to form A and two acids. Let's say F is HCl (strong) and G is H2S (weak). Then, C would be a sulfide of a metal which also has a chloride component. For example, perhaps C is CuS, but when it reacts with water, it produces Cu(OH)2 (a base) and H2S. Hmm, but that would give a base and a weak acid.

Wait, maybe C is a bisulfide, like H2S2O6. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal chloride with a hydroxide component. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if C is a nitride, like Mg3N2, when it reacts with water, it forms Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But again, those are a base and a weak base.

Wait, perhaps C is a carbonate. For example, Na2CO3. When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to NaOH and CO2. CO2 is a weak acid, but NaOH is a strong base. So the products would be a base and an acid. But in the question, the products are A (solid) and two acids. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite. For example, Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to NaOH and H2SO3. H2SO3 is a weak acid, but NaOH is a strong base. So again, products are a base and an acid, not two acids.

Hmm. Maybe C is a different kind of salt. Perhaps a salt that when hydrolyzed produces two different acids.

Wait, what about a salt like KHSO4? KHSO4 is a strong acid salt. When it reacts with water, it dissociates into K+ and HSO4^-. HSO4^- can act as an acid (donating H+ to form SO4^2- and H+). So in solution, it can produce H+ and SO4^2-. But the reaction with water wouldn't produce two separate acids; it would just release H+.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfamate, like NH2SO3NH2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a bisulfate, like HSO4^- as part of a salt. When it reacts with water, it can donate two H+ ions, but I'm not sure if that would produce two acids.

Wait, maybe C is a polyatomic salt, like (NH4)2SO4. When it reacts with water, it dissociates into NH4+ and SO4^2-. NH4+ can hydrolyze to produce NH3 (a weak base) and H+. So, the products would be NH3 (weak base) and H+ (from H2SO4, which is strong). But the question states that the products are A and two acids. So, I'm not matching.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think about the possible E and its symmetry group.

If I think E is phosgene (O=CCl2), which has D∞h symmetry, then the answer would be option C. But I'm not sure how C and D would lead to E.

Alternatively, if E is SO2, which has C2v symmetry, then the answer would be option D.

But I'm not entirely confident about the reactions.

Another approach: the reaction of C with H2O gives back A and two acids. So, if C is a salt that when dissolved in water releases H+ ions from two different acids, perhaps F and G are HCl and H2SO4, for example. Then, C would be something like a sulfite or another salt.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. Then, when it reacts with water, it would hydrolyze to NaOH and H2SO3 (which is a weak acid). But that only gives one acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed salt, like NaHSO3. Then, when it reacts with water, it would form NaOH and HSO3^- (which can donate another H+ to form H2SO3). But again, that's just one acid.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps C is a metal carbonate and a metal sulfate. For example, if C is a double salt, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal hydroxide, but that would react with water to form nothing much.

I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should try to make some assumptions based on the possible answers.

Assuming that E is SO2, which has C2v symmetry. Then, the answer would be option D.

But how does that fit the reactions?

Then, reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → SO2.

Assuming D is O2 (as a gas), then C would be S reacting with O2 to form SO2. But what's reaction 1?

Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red). If C is S (yellow), that doesn't fit bright red. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is FeS, which is black, not red.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a different compound. Suppose C is a sulfide of a transition metal that is bright red. For example, maybe Cu2S is black, CdS is yellow. Hmm, I don't recall a bright red sulfide.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, maybe it's a bright red nitride. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a compound of a transition metal with a +3 oxidation state. For example, CoO is black, NiO is black. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a different type of compound. Perhaps a peroxide. For example, Na2O2 is bright white. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chromate. Sodium chromate is orange, not red.

Hmm. I'm not making progress on this. Maybe I should think about E's structure again.

If E is phosgene (O=CCl2), which is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, then the answer would be option C.

But to form phosgene, C would need to be CO (carbon monoxide) and D would be Cl2. So, reaction 2 would be CO + 2 Cl2 → COCl2 + Cl2? No, that doesn't balance. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is CO + 2 Cl2 → COCl2 + 2 Cl. Hmm, not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps reaction 2 is C + 2 D → E, where C is CCl2 and D is O2. Then, CCl2 + O2 → COCl2. But I'm not sure about the reaction conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps C is CHCl3 and D is O2. But that's not leading me anywhere.

Another possibility: perhaps E is Cl2O, which is dichlorine monoxide. Cl2O is a linear molecule and has D∞h symmetry. It's a yellowish gas and can be hazardous. So, if E is Cl2O, then its symmetry group is D∞h (option C).

Then, reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → Cl2O.

What would C and D be?

If D is O2, and C is Cl2, then reaction would be Cl2 + O2 → Cl2O. But that's not balanced. The balanced equation would be 2 Cl2 + O2 → 2 Cl2O. So, that would require 2 equivalents of Cl2 per O2, but reaction 2 uses 2 D per C. So, if D is O2, then C would be Cl2. But in reaction 1, A reacts with 8 B to form C. If C is Cl2, then B would have to be something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is ClO2 and D is Cl2. Then, ClO2 + 2 Cl2 → Cl2O + 2 ClO2? Not sure.

This is getting too tangled. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the information I have.

If E has D∞h symmetry, it's likely a linear molecule. Phosgene is an example, but I'm not entirely sure how the reactions fit. Alternatively, if E is SO2, which has C2v symmetry, then the answer would be option D.

But I'm not confident. Another approach: knowing that D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. If H is H2O, but that requires 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, which is a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. So H can't be H2O.

Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is another diatomic gas that reacts 1:1. Maybe D is F2, and B is O2. Then, O2 + F2 → OF2, which is a gas, but is it a solvent? I don't think so.

Alternatively, maybe B is N2 and D is O2. They react in a 4:3 ratio to form NO, but that's not 1:1.

Hmm. Another approach: maybe H is NH3, formed from N2 and H2 in a 1:1 ratio. But that would require 3 H2 per N2, which is 1:3, not 1:1.

Alternatively, maybe B is NO and D is O2. Then, 4 NO + 3 O2 → 2 N2O5. Not sure.

I'm stuck again. Given the time I've spent, I'll try to proceed with the assumption that E is SO2, which has C2v symmetry. So the answer is option D.


The problem involves a series of reactions leading to the determination of the molecular symmetry group of product E. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The bright red color suggests C could be a compound like sulfur (S), but sulfur is yellow, not red. Other possibilities include sulfides or chromates, but none fit perfectly.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E, an extremely hazardous product. E is likely a toxic gas. Phosgene (COCl₂) and SO₂ were considered. Phosgene is linear and has **D∞h symmetry**, while SO₂ is bent and has **C₂v symmetry**. Both are hazardous, but SO₂ fits better with the given reactions.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to produce A and two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). If C is a sulfide, it would produce a metal hydroxide and H₂S (weak acid). However, this does not align with the formation of two acids. If C is a bisulfate, it could produce a strong acid and a weak acid, but the exact identity remains unclear.

4. **Reaction 4**: B and D react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Possible solvents include H₂O or NH₃, but their formation from B and D in a 1:1 ratio is unclear.

5. **Symmetry Analysis**: The options for the molecular symmetry group of E are:
   - **C₂**: A two-fold rotation axis.
   - **D₄h**: A point group with a four-fold rotation axis and mirror planes.
   - **D∞h**: Symmetry of linear molecules with infinite twofold axes.
   - **C₂v**: A two-fold rotation axis and two mirror planes.

   If E is SO₂, it is a bent molecule with **C₂v symmetry**, fitting the description of a toxic gas. Phosgene, a linear molecule with **D∞h symmetry**, was also considered but did not align as well with the reactions.

Based on the analysis, the most consistent answer is that E has **C₂v symmetry**, corresponding to SO₂. 

Answer: D
