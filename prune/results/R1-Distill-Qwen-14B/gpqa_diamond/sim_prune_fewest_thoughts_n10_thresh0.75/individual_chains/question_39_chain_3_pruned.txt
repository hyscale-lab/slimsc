Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. 

Alright, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. I remember that wave functions must be normalized, which means the integral of the square of the absolute value over all space should equal 1. Oh wait, but in this case, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So the region outside this isn't contributing—so the normalization should be done between 1 and 3.

Wait, but wait. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Because the wave function is a complex number here. So the probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. 

So the absolute square is [ (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 ], right? Because for a complex number z = z1 + iz2, |z|^2 = z1² + z2². So yeah, that makes sense.

But wait, the problem says that when measuring the position, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So that must mean that the probability of finding the particle outside this region is zero. Which suggests that the wave function must be zero outside [1,3]. But wait, the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So if I plug in x values less than 1 or greater than 3, does that give zero? Hmm, no, because sqrt(1+x) is real for x >= -1, which includes x from 1 to 3. Wait, but the wave function is given as non-zero only in the region where the particle exists, which is between 1 and 3. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside that region. But then why is the given wave function defined as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i for all x? Maybe the question is implying that the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But wait, the given function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So how can that be?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The question says the wave function is as given in the part of space where the particle can exist. So, the wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i only between x=1 and x=3. Elsewhere, the wave function is zero. So when we're normalizing, we integrate from 1 to 3.

So the normalization condition is the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

Let me write that down. |ψ(x)|² is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. So the
