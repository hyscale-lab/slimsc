Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says X is a meson resonance. We're supposed to find the mean decay distance. They give the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X as 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in units of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle. Oh right, the formula involves the speed of light, the lifetime, and maybe some other factors. Decay length L is c multiplied by the lifetime τ, right? So L = cτ.

But how do we find τ? I think the particle's width Γ is connected to its lifetime via the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So for a resonance, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy, and the lifetime τ is the uncertainty in time. So Γ * τ ≈ ħ. Therefore, τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but wait, I think the exact formula is τ = ħ / Γ. Let me make sure. Oh yeah, because Γ is the total decay width, which is inversely related to the lifetime. So yes, τ ≈ ħ/(Γ).

But wait, how do we account for the production energy and mass here? Because the particle is produced with some energy, which might relate to its velocity. Oh right, the speed would affect how far it travels before decaying. So the mean decay distance L is c * τ * β, where β is the velocity of the particle divided by the speed of light. Because if the particle is moving, it's lifetime is dilated, but since we already used Γ which is in the rest frame, maybe τ here is the proper time. Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, τ is the proper lifetime, which is measured in the particle's rest frame. So to find the mean decay distance, the particle is moving, so the lifetime from our lab frame is longer by the Lorentz factor gamma. So the lifetime in the lab frame is γτ. So the decay distance is L = v * (γτ), but since v is approximately c for a relativistic particle, and gamma is E/(
