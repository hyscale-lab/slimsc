Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question has two separate reactions, and I need to determine the major products A and B for each, then choose the correct option from the given choices.

Reaction 1: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, KH, and H+. So, the first thing I'm thinking is, what's happening here? THF is a solvent, commonly used in Grignard reactions, but here with KH (which is potassium hydride), maybe it's a strong base. Wait, but wait, what's the role of H+ at the end? Maybe it's a two-step process. Like, deprotonation followed by something else.

The starting material is a spiro compound. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom. The structure is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So, the spiro is between a 3-membered ring and a 5-membered ring? Wait, no. Wait, the spiro notation is [n.m], where n and m are the number of carbons in each ring. So spiro[3.5]non means one ring has 3 carbons, the other has 5, and the bridge is the 9th carbon (since non is 9, but the spiro is at position 1). Hmm, maybe I should draw it mentally.

The structure has a spiro at position 1, so one ring is a 3-membered (like cyclopropane) and the other is a 5-membered, connected at that position. The 1-position has a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂?), wait no, vinyl is CH₂=CH- attached to the oxygen? Wait wait, the compound is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So the spiro is at position 1, which is also a hydroxyl group (since it's 1-ol). And there's a vinyl group attached to that position as well. So it's like, the oxygen is connected to a vinyl group (CH
