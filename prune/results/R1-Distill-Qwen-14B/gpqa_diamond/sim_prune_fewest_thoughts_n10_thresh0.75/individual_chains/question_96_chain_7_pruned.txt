Okay, so I've got this problem about a supermassive black hole and finding the entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the angular size of the event horizon is θ=10^-17 degrees, and the distance is d=10^10 parsecs. I need to find the entropy's order of magnitude. The options are from A to D, with different powers of 10.

Wait, entropy of a black hole relates to its area, right? Oh right, the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. The entropy S is proportional to the area of the event horizon. The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), but I might have the exact terms wrong. Or maybe S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G), something like that. But I think the key is to find the area A of the event horizon.

So first, find the radius of the event horizon. The event horizon radius R is given by the Schwarzschild radius formula R = 2 G M / c². But wait, maybe I can find R from the angular size and the distance.

Angular size θ is approximately equal to the size (like diameter) divided by the distance when θ is small. So θ ≈ (diameter) / d. Since the event horizon is a sphere, the diameter is 2R. So 2R = d * θ. Wait, but θ is in degrees. I need to convert that to radians because the formula usually uses radians.

Right, to convert θ from degrees to radians: θ_rad = θ_deg * (π / 180). So θ_rad = 1e-17 degrees * π / 180 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

So 2R = d * θ_rad. Wait no, wait. The angular size θ is the angular diameter, which is 2R / d. So 2R = d * θ. So R = (d * θ) / 2.

But wait, let me be precise. The angular diameter θ (in radians) is equal to the actual size (say, 2R) divided by the distance d. So θ ≈ 2R / d. So R ≈ (d * θ) / 2.

So d is
