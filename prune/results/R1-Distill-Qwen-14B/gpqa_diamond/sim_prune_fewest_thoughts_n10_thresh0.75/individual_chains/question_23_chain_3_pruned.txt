Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about reacting ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). After some time, TLC showed the reactant spot decreased and two new spots formed. I need to figure out which products are possible.

First, I should draw the structure of the starting material. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So, the benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether is connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl is CH2-CH-C(CH3)2? Wait, no. Let me think. But-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, wait. No, butenyl is four carbons. But-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH=CH-? No, maybe I should write it.

But-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond starting at carbon 3. Wait no, but-3-en is four carbons with double bond between C3 and C4. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, but numbering is done from the end closest to the double bond. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH2CH2 with double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, that doesn't make sense because but only has four carbons. Oh wait, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C2 and C3. Because the longest chain is four carbons, so starting from the substituent, the numbering goes 1, 2, 3, 4. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, that's but-2-en-1-yl. Wait, maybe I should correct this.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the structure CH2CH2CH2CH2, but with the double bond between C3 and C
