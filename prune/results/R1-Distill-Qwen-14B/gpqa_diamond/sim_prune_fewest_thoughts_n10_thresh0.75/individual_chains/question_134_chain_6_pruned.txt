Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, let's see... I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is about the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. Usually, the reaction is exothermic, so the enthalpy change would be negative. The formula I think is ΔH = -n (H+ + OH-) × 57.3 kJ/mol or something like that? Wait, I might be mixing up some details.

The problem gives me three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find out how much heat is released when these are mixed. 

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. HCl is a strong acid, and H2SO4 is a strong acid too. So when they mix, they should neutralize each other. But I need to figure out the moles of H+ and OH- from each solution and see which is the limiting reactant.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, calculate the moles of H+ from HCl. HCl is a monoprotic acid, so each mole gives one H+.

Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters)
HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles of HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

Next, H2SO4. It's a diprotic acid, so each mole gives 2 H+.

Molarity is 0.3 M, volume 0.3 L. So moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 moles H+.

Now Ba(OH)2. It's a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions because it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-.

Molarity is 0.5 M, volume 0.2 L. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles OH-.

Wait, but when acid and base neutralize, H+ and OH- combine in a 1:1 ratio. So I need to find which is in excess.

Total H+ from acids: 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles H+.

OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.
