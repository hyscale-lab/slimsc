Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because these types of problems can get tricky. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, let's read the problem again. We have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. The total weight is 7.20 grams. They heated this mixture to 200Â°C without air. So, probably in a closed container or something because it says without air. Then, a mixture of gases was formed. Without cooling, this gas was passed through three tubes.

Tube 1 is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant and can absorb water vapor. So, when a gas passes through it, any moisture in the gas would be absorbed here. So, tube 1's weight increased by 3.60 grams. That suggests that the gas had some water in it.

Then, tube 2 is a Ca(OH)2 solution. Ca(OH)2 is slaked lime, which is used to absorb CO2 gas. If the gas mixture contains CO2, the solution would react with it, producing CaCO3 and water. But the problem says the weight of tube 2 didn't change. Hmm, that means the gas mixture didn't have any CO2. Because if it did, the solution would have absorbed it and gained weight. So, no CO2 in the gases.

Next, tube 3 has red-hot copper. The gas passed through this, and the tube's weight increased by 0.80 grams. Red-hot copper probably reacts with certain gases. From what I remember, CO would react with copper(II) oxide at high temperatures, but wait, I think I'm mixing things up. Oh wait, maybe it's water vapor? No, wait, copper in the presence of water doesn't really react unless it's in steam and maybe under certain conditions. Or perhaps it's carbon monoxide reacting. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, another thought: when a gas passes through hot copper, maybe it's reacting with sulfur dioxide or something. Or perhaps it's a reaction where hydrogen is involved. Alternatively, maybe the gas is H2S? No, I'm not sure. Let me think again. Oh wait, if the gas is water vapor, when it passes through hot copper, maybe it doesn't react. Hmm, but the tube's weight increased. So some product formed. Or perhaps the gas is something like CO, which when reacted with hot copper might form something. Wait, another angle: perhaps the gas is reacting with oxygen or something else. Alternatively, maybe the gas is H2, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, let's think about the reactions. If the gas passed through tube 3 and caused the copper to increase in weight, perhaps the gas was CO. Because CO can react with copper oxide. Let me
