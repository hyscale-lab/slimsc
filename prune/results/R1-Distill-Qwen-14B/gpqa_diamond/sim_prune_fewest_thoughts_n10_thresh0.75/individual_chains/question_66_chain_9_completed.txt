Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that encompasses the Standard Model (SM) plus higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension, so like dimension 6, 8, etc. The question is about which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT.

Wait, let me think. I think Lorentz symmetry is one of the fundamental symmetries of the SM, so any effective theory built upon it should respect Lorentz symmetry. So all SMEFT operators must be Lorentz-invariant. That makes sense because they're just higher-dimension terms of the SM, which itself is Lorentz symmetric.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like shifting space and time). Oh wait, Poincare symmetry is actually a bigger symmetry group that includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. So if a theory has Poincare symmetry, it automatically has Lorentz symmetry. But does SMEFT require Poincare symmetry? Well, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, and effective theories generally do respect the same symmetries as the original theory. The Standard Model has Poincare symmetry because it's a relativistic theory. So SMEFT operators must be Poincare-invariant as well. So options 1 and 2 are both correct.

Now, what about CP and CPT symmetries? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. The Standard Model is supposed to respect CP symmetry, except for the CKM CP violation, which is a bit more subtle. But wait, in the effective theory, are the higher-dimension operators allowed to violate CP? Or do they have to respect it?

Wait, no, actually, I think that the SMEFT operators are typically organized in a way that they don't explicitly break CP unless there's a reason. But wait, isn't the SM itself CP symmetric? Or does it have some CP violation? The SM does have CP violation, like in the CKM matrix. So operators in SMEFT can have terms that violate CP if they're higher-dimension. Wait, but the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the SM doesn't respect CP, but some SMEFT operators might, but not all. Or perhaps, wait, no. Wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if an operator in SMEFT breaks CP, then the symmetry isn't necessarily required. So maybe CP isn't one that must be respected.

Wait, but wait. The question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if any operator doesn't respect a symmetry, then that symmetry isn't a must. So for example, if some SMEFT operators break CP, then CP isn't a symmetry that's necessarily respected by all. So which of the options must be respected by every operator?

Hmm, but I think that the effective theory must respect certain symmetries. Wait, no. Effective theories can have operators that break some symmetries, but perhaps some symmetries are more foundational. For example, Lorentz and Poincare symmetry are part of the structure of the theory. Effective theories can't really violate those because the terms are constructed as Lorentz scalars. So all operators must be Lorentz and Poincare symmetric.

But what about CPT? The Standard Model is CPT symmetric, I believe. Because all the particles have their antiparticles, etc. So any operator in SMEFT must be CPT invariant. Because if they weren't, that would imply that the effective theory isn't CPT symmetric, which is a big deal. So operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.

What about CP? The Standard Model itself has CP violation, so SMEFT operators can include terms that violate CP. But wait, in the SMEFT framework, operators are classified and can have different chiral structures. For example, dimension-6 operators in SMEFT include terms like (S) and (T) parameters, which are related to oblique corrections, but I'm not sure if they violate CP. Alternatively, some higher-dimension operators could involve terms that are CP-odd. So not all operators in SMEFT respect CP. Therefore, the symmetry that must be respected by all operators is CPT, but not necessarily CP.

So putting it all together, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4. So the correct answer would be option C.


In the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), operators are organized as higher-dimensional corrections to the Standard Model (SM). These operators must respect certain symmetries. 

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is a fundamental symmetry of the SM and is automatically respected by all SMEFT operators because they are constructed as Lorentz scalars. Thus, Lorentz symmetry must be preserved.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: This includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT is a relativistic effective theory, all operators must respect Poincaré symmetry as well.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM already contains CP-violating terms, such as those arising from the CKM matrix. SMEFT operators can also include terms that violate CP, meaning CP symmetry is not necessarily preserved by all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM is CPT-symmetric, and SMEFT operators must respect this symmetry as well, as breaking CPT would have profound implications for the theory's consistency.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
