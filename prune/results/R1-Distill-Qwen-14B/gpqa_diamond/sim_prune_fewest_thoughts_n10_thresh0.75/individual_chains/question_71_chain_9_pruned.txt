Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that there are five exoplanets in a system with circular orbits, discovered using the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. All the planets have the same albedo, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... right, that's the temperature a planet would have if it were a perfect black body, right? The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ)) )^(1/4) * ( (R_planet) / (a) )^(1/2), but wait, no, more accurately, the formula is T = T_earth * ( (P_planet / P_earth) )^(-1/4), assuming the star is like the Sun. Or wait, more precisely, the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star. Because the further out, the cooler.

Oh, right, the equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) * (1 / sqrt(a)) ), where a is the semi-major axis. But since all planets have the same albedo, that factor cancels out when taking the ratio. So I only need to worry about the distance from the star.

But wait, the orbital periods are given in ratios. So how do I relate the orbital periods to the semi-major axis? Well, according to Kepler's third law, the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So (P)^2 ∝ a^3. Or a ∝ P^(2/3).

So for each planet, a_i = k * P_i^(2/3), where k is a constant for the system (since all planets orbit the same star, right? So the same k applies to all).

So the ratio a_i / a_j = (P_i / P_j )^(2/3).

Wait, so the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet 4 and Planet 2 is T4 / T2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2), because T is inversely proportional to the square root of a. Because T ∝ 1/sqrt(a).

Wait, let me think again. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * ( (1 - a)^(1/4) ) * ( (1/ (sqrt(a))) ), but since a (albedo) is the same for all planets, the ratio T4/T2 is (a2/a4)^(1/2).

Wait, no, because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So if a is larger, T is smaller. So T is proportional to (1/sqrt(a)).

So T4 / T2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2) ?

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. T ∝ (1/sqrt(a)). So T4 = T2 * (a2/a4)^(1/2). So the ratio T4/T2 is (a2/a4)^(1/2).

Alternatively, that's the
