Okay, let's try to solve this problem. Hmm, it's about organic chemistry reactions and HPLC chromatography. I remember that HPLC can separate compounds based on their polarity, and chiral columns are used for separating enantiomers. 

So, the question describes two reactions and then combines the products, running them on both normal-phase and chiral HPLC columns. The task is to find out how many peaks each run would show.

First, I'll look at Reaction I. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The reagent is LAH, which is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce ketones. LAH would reduce the ketone (3-ketone) to a secondary alcohol. So the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but wait. Wait, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral center at the 5 position because it's methoxy attached to the 5th carbon. When you reduce the ketone (at C3) to an alcohol, does that create a new chiral center? Let me think. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3? No, wait. Structure is: CH3CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH2OMe)-CH2CH2? Wait, no. Let me draw it. The structure is: CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH2OCH3)-CH2-CH3. But wait, wait. Hexan-3-one is O=C at position 3. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-... Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the molecule is hexan-3-one, which is (CH2)2-C(O)-(something). The 5 position is on the adjacent carbon to the ketone. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH2OCH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, maybe it's CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH2OCH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C(=O)-(CH2)3, but with a methoxy at the 5
