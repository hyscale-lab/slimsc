Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem states that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a specific matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, right. The eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, I can write it out. Let me compute Ay first. Let's see, c is h/(4π), so Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

So S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So, multiplying each element by c: Ay is [[0, -i*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]. So the matrix looks like:

[ [0, -i (h/(4π)) ],
  [i (h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues of Ay, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

The matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ [-a, -i (h/(4π)) ],
  [i (h/(4π)), -a ] ]

The determinant of this is (-a)(-a) - [(-i (h/(4π)))(i (h/(4π)))] = a² - [ (-i)(i) * (h/(4π))^2 ]

Wait, let's compute the product of the off-diagonal elements. (-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant is a² - (1) (h^2/(16 π²)) ) = a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

So the equation is a² = h²/(16 π²). Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are plus and minus h/(4π). Wait, but wait a second—this is a 2x2 matrix, so it's got two eigenvalues. Oh, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the components of angular momentum are related. Like, for spin-1/2 particles, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. Wait, ħ is h/(2π). So let's see: h/(4π) is (h/(2π)) * (1/2) )= ħ * (1/2). So that aligns with the spin-1/2 case.

So the eigenvalues are a = ± ħ/2, because ħ is h/(2π). Wait, let me compute that. h/(4π) is (h/(2π)) * 1/2. So yeah, that's ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, but that doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues should be real. Wait, no, wait. The options are a bit confusing. Let me check each option.

Option A: The imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ± h/(4π). That can't be right because the eigenvalues are real, so imaginary parts are zero.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, that would imply the eigenvalues are complex, which they're not. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm. Let's think: A² is the square of the angular momentum component. For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenfunctions of any component are eigenfunctions of A² as well. Because A² = ( (Ax)^2 + (Ay)^2 + (Az)^2 ) ? Or wait, no, in quantum mechanics, the square of the total angular momentum is J², but here we're talking about a component, A. So, A² would be the square of the component, but whether it commutes with other components?

Wait, but in the case of spin, any component squared commutes with the square of the total, so eigenfunctions of Ay would be eigenfunctions of A². So C's first part is correct. The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Is that true? In quantum mechanics, the components of angular momentum don't commute. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So C's statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay. Hmm, not sure what that means. Basis functions would be like the eigenvectors of the operator. So yes, each eigenvector is a basis function, but I'm not sure if D is correct. Let me think more.

Wait, so the eigenvalues are real, ± ħ/2. So options A and B are wrong because they're talking about complex eigenvalues. Option A's real parts are h/(4pi) or -h/(4pi), which matches the eigenvalues I found. But the imaginary parts are ±2 pi h, which isn't right because our eigenvalues are real. So option A is incorrect.

So the correct eigenvalues are real: ± ħ/2, which is ± h/(4π). So let me look back at the options. Looking at option A, it's talking about the imaginary parts, which are zero. So the statements in options A and B are about the eigenvalues having imaginary parts, which is incorrect. So the correct eigenvalues are real, ± h/(4π).

Looking at the options again, none of the options directly mention the correct eigenvalues as real. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me check each option again.

Option A: The eigenvalue's imaginary parts are ±
