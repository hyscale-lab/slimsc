Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem is about a star with certain parameters, and how the presence of spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm. So, the star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and it has 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

When looking at the photosphere, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. Also, LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) is assumed.

Alright, so I need to find the ratio N1/N2 when there are no spots compared to when there are spots. Let's think about what affects this ratio.

In LTE, the number of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Where:
- g1 and g2 are the statistical weights of the levels.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels (E2 > E1).
- k is the Boltzmann constant.
- T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff decreases. But the spots themselves are cooler regions. So, does the presence of spots change the effective temperature of the entire photosphere? Or is the photosphere's temperature effectively lower because a significant portion is covered by cooler spots?

Wait, the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So, this is the effective temperature of the star as a whole. But wait, the spots themselves are cooler, but the rest is at 6000 K. So, the overall Teff is a combination of the two areas.

But wait, the problem says that when the surface isn't covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels. But wait, if the photosphere's effective temperature has decreased, then the temperature of the photosphere (the region where the Ti is) is now lower, right?

Wait, but maybe the photosphere's temperature is not uniform. The spots are cooler regions, and the rest is hotter. But when the star has spots, the overall observed Teff is lower. So, the average temperature has gone down. But when considering the photosphere as a sum of different regions, but from the problem statement, it's unclear whether the photospheric temperature is now at 5500 K everywhere or just that the Teff of the star is 5500 K, but the photosphere's own temperature varies.

Wait, the question specifies that the stellar photosphere is in LTE. So, perhaps when the star has spots, the photosphere's overall temperature is lower. Or maybe the presence of spots affects the observed flux, but the local temperature in the photosphere (the regions not covered by spots) is still 6000 K. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, the problem says, "when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K." So, the photospheric Teff is 5500 K when spots are present. So, the entire photosphere's temperature is lower when spots are present. That might not be accurate, but perhaps the star's photosphere as a whole is at 5500 K when spots are present.

Alternatively, maybe the effective temperature is an average, but the individual regions (spots and non-spots) have their own temperatures. But the problem says the Teff is 5500 K when 40% is covered by spots. That might imply that the entire photosphere's average temperature is lower.

Wait, perhaps the star emits as a blackbody with Teff 5500 K when 40% spots are present. But each region (spot and non-spot) has its own temperature. The spots would be cooler, say T_spot, and the rest would be at T_non_spot. Then, the total flux would be the sum of the flux from each region, weighted by their areas.

But the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So, perhaps the entire photosphere is emitting with an average Teff of 5500 K. Alternatively, maybe the presence of spots lowers the overall temperature in the photosphere, but that doesn't seem physically accurate because the spots are cooler regions, not the entire photosphere.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to think again.

The problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the star's observed Teff is lower because a significant portion of the surface is cooler. But the effective temperature is an average, calculated based on the total emitted flux. So, the star's photosphere is a mix of hotter and cooler regions.

However, when the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, perhaps we should model each region (spots and non-spots) as being in LTE, but with different temperatures. But the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels in the photosphere.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star's surface is not covered by spots, the Teff is 6000 K. So, the entire photosphere is at 6000 K. When spots are present, 40% is cooler, but the rest is same? Or perhaps the rest is at a higher temperature? No, that would complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of spots doesn't change the temperature of the non-spots; the non-spots are still at 6000 K, but the spots are at a lower temperature, say T_spot.

But the problem is about the ratio of Ti atoms in the photosphere. The Ti atoms are in the photosphere, which includes both the spotted and non-spotted regions. So, perhaps the average ratio is somewhere between the two regions.

Wait, but the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. That suggests that the average photosphere is cooler. But that's tricky because the photosphere isn't a uniform blackbody; it's a combination of regions. But perhaps the problem is simplifying it, treating the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present.

If that's the case, then when the star has spots, the photosphere's temperature is lower, so the LTE conditions are at 5500 K.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of spots doesn't change the temperature of the photosphere in the non-spotted regions. So, the non-spots are at 6000 K, and the spots are at a lower temperature, say T_spot.

But the problem says that when 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the calculation should be done using the average flux.

Wait, maybe the photosphere's effective temperature is a blackbody emitting at 5500 K when 40% is covered. So, the problem is treating the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K. So, the Ti atoms are in a photosphere that's at 5500 K when spots are present.

But that seems a bit odd because the spots are just a part of the surface. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of spots affects the overall emission, but the actual temperature of the photosphere where the Ti is present is 6000 K in the non-spots and lower in the spots.

Wait, but the problem mentions that when the star has spots, the ratio of Ti levels decreases. So, the ratio changes because the temperature in the regions where Ti is present has changed.

But if the spots are cooler, then the regions where the Ti is in the photosphere may have a lower temperature when spots are present.

Wait, but the problem says that the photosphere is in LTE. So, the regions not covered by spots are in LTE at 5500 K? No, that can't be because the non-spots were at 6000 K before. Or perhaps the presence of spots leads the entire photosphere to cool down to 5500 K.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying and considering the photosphere as a blackbody with effective temperature T_eff, meaning that the average emission is from a blackbody at T_eff, but each region's temperature is as it is. So, in this case, when there are spots, the average T_eff is 5500 K, but the actual temperatures are in two regions: 60% at 6000 K and 40% at a cooler T_spot.

Wait, that might be the correct approach. Let me model this.

The star's total flux is a combination of the flux from the spotted and non-spotted regions.

The flux from a blackbody is sigma * T^4.

So, the total flux F_total is F_non_spot * (0.6) + F_spot * (0.4).

But F_total is the flux of a blackbody at 5500 K.

So, sigma * (5500)^4 = 0.6 * sigma * (6000)^4 + 0.4 * sigma * (T_spot)^4.

We can divide both sides by sigma:

(5500)^4 = 0.6 (6000)^4 + 0.4 (T_spot)^4.

We can solve for T_spot.

Let me compute the numerical values.

Compute each term:

5500^4: Let me calculate 5500^4.

Wait, maybe I can compute each term as a ratio. Let me compute each term in terms of (6000)^4.

But let me compute each term:

5500^4 = (5.5e3)^4 = 5.5^4 * 1e12.

5.5^4: 5.5 *5.5=30.25, 30.25*5.5=166.375, 166.375*5.5≈915.0625. So 5.5^4 ≈915.06. So 915.06e12.

Similarly, 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 =6^4 * 1e12. 6^4 is 1296. So 1296e12.

So,

915.06e12 = 0.6 * 1296e12 + 0.4 * (T_spot)^4.

Compute 0.6 *1296e12=777.6e12.

So,

915.06e12 = 777.6e12 + 0.4*(T_spot)^4.

Subtract 777.6e12:

(915.06 -777.6) e12 = 0.4 (T_spot)^4.

137.46e12 = 0.4 (T_spot)^4.

So,

(T_spot)^4 = (137.46e12) / 0.4 = 343.65e12.

So, T_spot^4 =343.65e12 → T_spot = (343.65e12)^(1/4).

Let me compute 343.65^(1/4) * (1e12)^(1/4) → (1e12)^(1/4)=1e3.

343.65^(1/4)= approx cube root of 343 is 7, but 343.65^(1/4) is a bit less than 4.3, perhaps? Let me compute 4^4=256, 4.3^4=?

4.3^2=18.49, 4.3^4= (18.49)^2 ≈ 341.88. So, 4.3^4≈341.88, which is close to 343.65.

So, T_spot ≈4.3e3 K → approx 4300 K.

Wait, but let me double-check:

4.3^4=4.3*4.3=18.49, then 18.49 *4.3 ≈ 79.507, then 79.507 *4.3≈341.88.

So, 4.3^4=341.88, and we have T_spot^4=343.65, which is a bit higher. So, let's calculate 4.31^4.

4.31^2= (4.3)^2 + 2*4.3*0.01 + (0.01)^2 → 18.49 + 0.086 + 0.0001 =18.5761.

Then 4.31^4 = (18.5761)^2 ≈ let's compute 18^2=324, 18.5761^2 = (18 + 0.5761)^2 = 18² + 2*18*0.5761 + (0.5761)^2 = 324 + 20.7396 + 0.3318 ≈ 324+21.0714=345.0714.

But our target is 343.65, which is just a bit lower than 345.07, so T_spot would be slightly less than 4.31e3 K. Let's say approximately 4290 K. But for the purposes of this problem, maybe 4300 K is acceptable.

So, the spotted regions are at about 4300 K, and the non-spotted regions are at 6000 K.

But now, the problem is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So, considering that the photosphere has both regions, but what determines the ratio observed?

Wait, the question says that when the star has spots, the observed ratio N1/N2 decreases. So, when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than when it doesn't. Therefore, the factor is (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_spots.

In LTE, the ratio depends on the temperature. The Boltzmann factor depends exponentially on 1/T.

But wait, because the photosphere now has two regions: 60% at 6000 K and 40% at 4300 K. So, the effective ratio would be a weighted average of the ratios from each region.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when the spots are present, and at 6000 K when they're not. That would make the calculation simpler, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So, perhaps the average Teff is 5500 K, but that's the effective temperature of the star, not necessarily the temperature of the photosphere in the regions.

But the photosphere itself is in LTE, so each region is in LTE at its own temperature. So, the observed ratio of Ti atoms would be a combination of the ratios from the two regions.

Wait, but the problem is about the ratio of the number of atoms in two levels in the stellar photosphere. If the photosphere is a mix of two temperatures, the overall ratio would be a flux-weighted average? Or an area-weighted average?

Wait, the number of atoms is proportional to the area. So, if 40% is at 4300 K and 60% at 6000 K, the total number of Ti atoms in each level would be the sum of Ti atoms from each region. So, the ratio N1/N2 would be a weighted average based on the areas.

So, let me model this. Let the area of each region be A. The non-spots have area 0.6A, spots 0.4A.

In each region, the ratio N1/N2 is given by the Boltzmann equation.

For non-spots, T=6000 K:

N1_non/N2_non = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T_non) )

Similarly, for spots, T=4300 K:

N1_spot/N2_spot = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T_spot) )

But wait, the problem states that the ratio N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the overall N1/N2 is lower. That suggests that the presence of cooler regions (spots) causes the ratio to be lower.

Wait, but let's think about how the ratio behaves with temperature. The ratio N1/N2 is proportional to exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ) / (g2/g1). Wait, no, because N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

If E2 > E1, then the exponent is positive. So, as T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases. So, the exponent is smaller, so exp of a smaller number is larger. Wait, wait, no: let me see.

Wait, E2 - E1 is positive, so (E2-E1)/(k T) is positive. So, exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) increases as T decreases. Because as T decreases, the denominator becomes smaller, making the overall fraction bigger. So, for lower T, the exponent is larger, so exp is larger.

So, N1/N2 is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ), which is larger when T is smaller.

So, when the star has spots (so some regions are cooler, T=4300 K), the N1/N2 in those regions is higher than when T=6000 K.

But when the star doesn't have spots, all photosphere regions are at 6000 K, so N1/N2_non = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k*6000) )

When spots are present, the overall N1/N2 is a weighted average of N1/N2_non and N1/N2_spot.

So, the overall ratio with spots would be:

(N1_total) / (N2_total) = [0.6*(N1_non) + 0.4*(N1_spot)] / [0.6*(N2_non) + 0.4*(N2_spot)]

But N1_non / N2_non = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k*6000) )

Similarly, N1_spot / N2_spot = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k*4300) )

Let me denote (E2-E1)/(k) as Delta E. So, Delta E is a constant.

Let me compute the ratio when no spots are present: R_no = (g1/g2) exp( Delta E / (k * 6000) )

When spots are present, the ratio is:

R_spots = [0.6 R_no + 0.4 R_spot ] / [0.6 (1) + 0.4 (R_spot / R_no) ]

Wait, perhaps that's getting complicated. Let me think in terms of R_no and R_spot.

Wait, R_spot = (g1/g2) exp( Delta E / (k * 4300) )

So, R_spot = R_no * exp( Delta E * (1/4300 - 1/6000) )

Wait, because:

exp( Delta E/(k*4300) ) = exp( Delta E/(k*6000) ) * exp( Delta E/(k) (1/4300 - 1/6000) )

So, R_spot = R_no * exp( Delta E/(k) (1/4300 - 1/6000) )

Let me compute (1/4300 - 1/6000):

Compute 1/4300 ≈ 0.00023256,

1/6000 ≈ 0.00016667.

So, 0.00023256 - 0.00016667 = 0.00006589.

So, (1/4300 - 1/6000) ≈ 6.589e-5.

So, Delta E/(k) is (E2-E1)/(k). Let me compute this value.

E2 - E1 corresponds to wavelength 1448 Å. The energy of a photon is E = hc/lambda.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

lambda = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 meters.

So, E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1448e-10) ) = approx 1.372e-18 J.

But Delta E is E2 - E1 = 1.372e-18 J per photon.

Wait, but in terms of k T, where k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38e-23 J/K.

So, Delta E/(k) = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) ≈ 9945 K.

Wait, so Delta E/(k) ≈ 9945 K.

So, the term (Delta E/(k)) * (1/4300 - 1/6000) = 9945 * 6.589e-5.

Compute 9945 * 6.589e-5.

Let me compute 9945 * 6.589e-5.

Compute 9945 *6.589 = ?

Well, 10000 *6.589 =65,890, so 9945 is 55 less. So, 9945 *6.589 ≈ 65,890 - (55 *6.589) =65890 - 362.395 ≈65527.6.

So, 65527.6e-5 = 6.55276.

So, this term is approximately 6.55.

So, R_spot = R_no * exp(6.55).

Wait, exp(6.55) is a large number. Let me compute it.

exp(6) is about 403.4288. exp(6.5)= approx 665.14, exp(7)=1096.633.

But 6.55 is 6.5 +0.05. So, exp(6.5)=665.14, exp(0.05)=1.05127.

So, exp(6.55)=665.14 * 1.05127 ≈ 665.14 *1.05 ≈700. So, approximately 700.

So, R_spot = R_no * 700.

So, R_spot ≈700 R_no.

Now, the overall ratio when spots are present is R_spots = [0.6 R_no + 0.4 R_spot ] / [0.6 (1) + 0.4 (R_spot / R_no) ]

Wait, wait, let me think again. The overall N1_total/N2_total is:

(0.6 * N1_non + 0.4 * N1_spot) / (0.6 * N2_non + 0.4 * N2_spot )

But N1_non/N2_non = R_no, so N1_non = R_no * N2_non.

Similarly, N1_spot = R_spot * N2_spot.

So,

Numerator: 0.6 R_no N2_non + 0.4 R_spot N2_spot.

Denominator: 0.6 N2_non + 0.4 N2_spot.

So, N1_total/N2_total = [0.6 R_no N2_non + 0.4 R_spot N2_spot ] / [0.6 N2_non + 0.4 N2_spot ]

We can factor out N2_non and N2_spot in the numerator and denominator. Let me write N2_non = x, N2_spot = y.

Then,

Numerator: 0.6 R_no x + 0.4 R_spot y.

Denominator: 0.6 x + 0.4 y.

So, the ratio becomes [0.6 R_no x + 0.4 R_spot y ] / [0.6 x + 0.4 y ]

But since x and y are the number of atoms in level 2 in non-spots and spots respectively, and the total area is 100%, perhaps x and y are proportional to the areas, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps x and y are the same per unit area, but that's unclear.

But perhaps the problem assumes that the number of Ti atoms in each region scales with the area. So, x = 0.6 A * n_non, y=0.4 A *n_spot, where n_non and n_spot are the number densities in each region.

But this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that the ratio (N1/N2) observed is a weighted average of the two regions based on their contribution to the flux, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the problem states that the overall ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than when it doesn't. 

Wait, when the star has no spots, the entire photosphere is at 6000 K, so R_no = (g1/g2) exp(Delta E/(k*6000)).

When the star has spots, the photosphere consists of 60% at 6000 K and 40% at 4300 K.

In the 4300 K regions, the ratio R_spot is much higher than R_no, as we saw earlier (about 700 times higher).

So, the overall ratio when spots are present would be:

R_spots = [0.6 R_no + 0.4 (700 R_no)] / [0.6 + 0.4 (700 / (g1/g2 )) ]

Wait, no, that approach might not be correct. Let me think again.

Wait, no, because R_spot is (g1/g2) exp(Delta E/(k T_spot)).

But earlier, I think I modeled R_spot as 700 R_no, which might not be correct because (g1/g2) might not be the same.

Wait, actually, the Boltzmann factor is (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ).

So, R = N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, when T changes, R changes based on the exponential term multiplied by (g1/g2), which is a constant.

So, I think in this problem, (g1/g2) is the same for both regions, so R_spot = R_no * exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/4300 - 1/6000) )

Which, as calculated earlier, is about 700 times R_no.

So, R_spot ≈700 R_no.

So, when the star has spots, the ratio R_spots is:

R_spots = [0.6 R_no + 0.4 R_spot ] / [0.6 (1) + 0.4 (R_spot / R_no ) ]

Wait, let me think about the denominator. The denominator is the sum of N2_non and N2_spot. Since N2_non = N2_non, and N2_spot = N2_spot.

But R_no = N1_non / N2_non → N1_non = R_no N2_non.

Similarly, R_spot = N1_spot / N2_spot → N1_spot = R_spot N2_spot.

So, the numerator is N1_total = 0.6 N1_non + 0.4 N1_spot = 0.6 R_no N2_non + 0.4 R_spot N2_spot.

The denominator is N2_total = 0.6 N2_non + 0.4 N2_spot.

So, the ratio R_spots = [0.6 R_no N2_non + 0.4 R_spot N2_spot ] / [0.6 N2_non + 0.4 N2_spot ]

But unless we know the ratio of N2_non to N2_spot, we can't simplify further. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the problem assumes that the majority of the Ti is in the non-spotted regions, but the spots contribute a small amount.

Wait, but 40% is a significant portion. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present, so the entire photosphere is at 5500 K. Then, the ratio R would be based on 5500 K.

So, let's consider that scenario.

In that case, when no spots: T=6000 K → R_no = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k*6000) )

When spots: T=5500 K → R_spots = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k*5500) )

The ratio of R_no / R_spots = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Compute (1/6000 -1/5500) = (5500 - 6000) / (6000*5500) ) = (-500) / (33,000,000) ) = -500/(3.3e7) )= approx -1.515e-5.

So, the exponent is (Delta E/k) * (-1.515e-5) → (9945 K) * (-1.515e-5) ≈ -0.1505.

So, exp(-0.1505) ≈ 0.861.

So, R_no / R_spots ≈ 0.861.

Wait, but wait. Because R_spots is (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k *5500) ) → so R_spots = R_no * exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Which is the same as R_spots = R_no * exp( (9945 K) * (1/5500 -1/6000) )

Compute (1/5500 -1/6000) = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) )= 500/(33,000,000)=500/3.3e7 = approx 1.515e-5.

So, (9945) * 1.515e-5 ≈ 0.1505.

So, exp(0.1505) ≈1.162.

So, R_spots = R_no * 1.162.

So, R_no / R_spots = 1/1.162 ≈0.861 → R_no is 0.861 times R_spots.

But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, R_spots should be lower than R_no. But according to this, R_spots is higher than R_no (since 1.162 >1).

Wait, that's a contradiction. So, perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, if the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present, then the ratio would be higher than when it's at 6000 K.

Because as T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) increases → exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) increases → R increases.

So, when T decreases, R increases.

So, when the star has spots, T_eff is lower, so R increases.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases.

Hmm, that suggests that my initial assumption is wrong. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the presence of spots affects the flux, but the actual photosphere's temperature isn't lower. Instead, the regions not covered by spots remain at 6000 K, and the spots are at a lower temperature.

But then, the overall ratio in the photosphere would be a combination of the ratios from the two regions.

Earlier calculation showed that R_spot is about 700 times R_no. So, the ratio when spots are present would be dominated by the spotted regions because R_spot is much higher.

Wait, but the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the observed ratio is lower than when it doesn't.

So, in the no-spot scenario, the entire photosphere is at 6000 K → R_no.

In the spot scenario, photosphere has 60% at 6000 K and 40% at 4300 K.

Wait, but N1/N2 is higher in cooler regions, as we saw.

So, the overall R_spots would be a weighted average of the two. Let me compute it.

R_spots = (0.6 * R_no + 0.4 * R_spot) / (0.6 + 0.4 * (R_spot / R_no) )

Wait, perhaps that's the correct approach.

Earlier, R_spot ≈700 R_no.

So,

Numerator: 0.6 R_no + 0.4 *700 R_no = R_no (0.6 + 280 )= R_no (280.6)

Denominator: 0.6 + 0.4 * (700 R_no / R_no ) → 0.6 + 0.4 *700 =0.6 + 280 =280.6

So, R_spots = (280.6 R_no) / (280.6) ) = R_no.

Wait, that can't be right. Because then R_spots = R_no, which would mean the ratio doesn't change, but the problem says it decreases.

Hmm, something's wrong here. Let me re-express the ratio.

Wait, the denominator is 0.6 N2_non + 0.4 N2_spot.

But N2_non is the number of atoms in level 2 in the non-spots, and N2_spot is the number in the spots.

But since the non-spots are 60% of the area, and spots 40%, and assuming uniform density, perhaps N2_non = 0.6 * A * n_non, and N2_spot = 0.4 * A * n_spot.

But without knowing the density in each region, we can't proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the number of atoms in each level is additive across regions.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is dominated by the cooler regions because R_spot is much larger than R_no.

In that case, the overall ratio would be approximately R_spot, which is higher than R_no. But the problem says the ratio decreases, which is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is incorrectly modeled and the entire photosphere's temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. But that would make the ratio increase, which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me recompute the (E2-E1)/(k) term.

E2-E1 is hc/lambda.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

c=3e8 m/s.

lambda=1448 Å =1448e-10 m.

So, E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) )= approx 1.373e-18 J.

Then, E/(k) = (1.373e-18 J ) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) ≈ 995e3 K → approx 995,000 K.

Wait, earlier I had 9945 K, but that's wrong. It should be 995,000 K.

Wait, let's recompute that.

E/(k) = (1.373e-18) / (1.38e-23) = (1.373 / 1.38 ) * 1e5 → approx 0.995e5 → 99500 K.

Wait, 1e5 is 100,000. So, 0.995e5 is 99,500 K.

So, E/(k) ≈99,500 K.

So, the term (E2-E1)/(k) = 99,500 K.

So, when I computed (1/4300 -1/6000) earlier, I had 6.589e-5.

So, 99,500 K * 6.589e-5 ≈ 99,500 * 0.00006589 ≈6.589 * (99,500 * 1e-5) )

Wait, 99,500 * 1e-5=99,500 / 1e5= 0.995.

So, 6.589 * 0.995 ≈6.56.

So, the exponent is 6.56.

So, R_spot = R_no * exp(6.56).

Exp(6.56) is about 672. So, R_spot ≈672 * R_no.

Hmm, that's a big difference.

So, going back to the earlier ratio:

R_spots = [0.6 R_no + 0.4 *672 R_no ] / [0.6 + 0.4 *672 ]

Compute numerator: 0.6 R_no + 0.4 *672 R_no = R_no (0.6 + 268.8 )= R_no (269.4).

Denominator: 0.6 + 0.4 *672 =0.6 +268.8 =269.4.

So, R_spots= (269.4 R_no) / 269.4 → R_spots = R_no.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the ratio R_spots would be the same as R_no, which contradicts the problem statement.

But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, perhaps the model is incorrect. Maybe the actual temperature of the non-spots remains at 6000 K, and the spots are at a lower temperature, say T_spot, but the overall effect is that the average ratio is dominated by the non-spots.

Wait, but the non-spots are 60% of the area, and the spots are 40%. If the ratio in the non-spots is R_no, and in the spots is R_spot = 672 R_no, then the overall ratio would be:

[0.6 R_no + 0.4 * 672 R_no ] / [0.6 + 0.4 *672 ]

Which is R_no * (0.6 + 268.8 ) / (0.6 +268.8 ) → R_no.

So, the ratio remains the same? That can't be.

Unless I made a mistake in the model.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the entire photosphere is at the same temperature, but the presence of spots doesn't change the temperature of the photosphere, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the effective temperature of the star is 5500 K, but each region is at its own temperature, and the overall flux is the sum of the fluxes from each region.

In that case, the photosphere's temperature in each region is as before: 60% at 6000 K, 40% at 4300 K.

But the ratio of Ti atoms in the photosphere would be a combination of the two regions.

Wait, but when you have more area in the cooler regions, but the ratio in those regions is much higher, so the overall ratio increases, which is the opposite of what the problem states.

So, the problem states that the ratio decreases, which suggests that when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than when it doesn't.

But according to the calculations, the ratio increases, which contradicts the problem.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I set up the ratio.

Wait, let's think again. The ratio R = N1/N2.

In the no-spots case, R_no = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k*6000) )

In the spot case, R_spots = [0.6 R_no + 0.4 R_spot ] / [0.6 + 0.4 (R_spot / R_no) ]

Wait, but R_spot = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k*4300) )

Which, as E2-E1 is positive, and 4300 <6000, so (E2-E1)/(k*4300) > (E2-E1)/(k*6000), so exp is larger, so R_spot > R_no.

So, the numerator and denominator in R_spots would both be dominated by the spot regions, leading to R_spots ≈ R_spot, which is higher than R_no.

Thus, when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 increases, which contradicts the problem statement that the ratio decreases.

Wait, this is confusing. The problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, R_spots < R_no.

But according to calculations, R_spots is much higher than R_no.

So, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the spots are hotter regions? No, that wouldn't make sense because spots are cooler.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is reversed: when the star has spots, the effective temperature is higher. But the problem says it's lower.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spots are not part of the photosphere but are a different layer, but that's not likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of spots affects the overall spectrum in a way that changes the observed ratio despite the temperature.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is wrong.

Wait, another approach: using the Boltzmann equation.

The ratio N1/N2 is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, when the star has no spots, T=6000 K → ratio R_no = exp( 99500 / (6000 * 1.38) )

Wait, wait, no: (E2-E1)/(k T) = (hc/lambda) / (k T) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * T)

Which is (1.373e-18) / (1.38e-23 * T ) = (1.373 / 1.38 ) * 1e5 / T → approx (0.995) * 1e5 / T.

So, (E2-E1)/(k T) ≈ 99500 / T.

So, for T=6000 K, this is 99500 /6000 ≈16.58.

For T=5500 K, 99500 /5500 ≈18.09.

So, the exponential factor is exp(16.58) and exp(18.09), respectively.

But wait, that's a huge number, which would make the ratio N1/N2 extremely large, which isn't physical because most atoms would be in the lower energy level.

Wait, this suggests that my approach is incorrect. Because for such high energies, the exponent is very large, leading to very small probabilities, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute (E2-E1)/(k T).

E = hc/lambda.

h=6.626e-34 J.s, c=3e8 m/s, lambda=1448e-10 m.

E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25 J m) / (1.448e-7 m) = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.373e-18 J.

Then, E/(k T) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * T )

= (1.373e-18) / (1.38e-23 * T) ) → (1.373 /1.38 ) * 1e5 / T → approx 0.995 * 1e5 / T → 99500 / T.

So, for T=6000 K: 99500/6000 ≈16.58.

So, exp(16.58) is a gigantic number, which can't be right.

But that would imply that N2 is negligible compared to N1, which isn't possible. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference E2-E1 is in ergs, not joules. Because 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, but perhaps the calculation should be done in terms of eV.

Wait, let me compute E in eV.

E = hc/lambda.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

c=3e8 m/s.

lambda =1448 Å =1448e-10 m.

E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 =1.373e-18 J.

To convert J to eV: 1 eV =1.602e-19 J.

So, E =1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈8.57 eV.

So, E2-E1 =8.57 eV.

So, (E2-E1)/(k T) = (8.57 eV) / (k T in eV/K * T )

Wait, k=8.617e-5 eV/K.

So, (8.57) / (8.617e-5 * T ) → 8.57 / (8.617e-5 T ) → approx 99450 / T.

So, same as before, (E2-E1)/(k T) ≈99450 / T.

Ah, so for T=6000 K, this is 99450/6000 ≈16.575.

Which is the same as before.

So, the exponent is 16.575, which is way too high. So, exp(16.575) is a huge number, which implies that N2 is almost zero, which can't be the case.

So, perhaps the problem is not using the actual energy difference, but assuming that the transition is in the visible spectrum, and the temperature is such that the exponent is manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps instead of using the entire E2-E1, the problem is considering the ionization potential or something else. Or perhaps the transition is in the infrared, so the energy is lower.

Wait, 1448 Å is in the near-ultraviolet. So, the energy is about 8.57 eV, which is quite high.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is using a simplified model where the ratio is (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)), which is the Boltzmann factor.

But regardless, the calculation seems to suggest that when the star has spots, the ratio increases, which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the problem is reversed. Maybe when the star has spots, the Teff is 6000 K and without spots it's 5500 K. But that's not what the problem says.

The problem says without spots, Teff is 6000 K. With 40% spots, Teff is 5500 K.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the spots are hotter, which would lower the ratio. But that doesn't make physical sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the Saha equation, but I don't think so because the question is about neutral atoms.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the inverse. Because when T increases, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. Because exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) increases as T decreases. So, if the temperature of the photosphere is lower when spots are present, the ratio N1/N2 increases. But the problem says the ratio decreases.

Wait, that would only happen if the exponent is negative. So, perhaps the energy levels are inverted, with E1 > E2.

Wait, in the problem statement, it's the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). So, perhaps E1 is higher than E2. No, usually, level 2 is higher.

But if E1 > E2, then (E2-E1) would be negative, leading to a negative exponent.

So, let me re-express.

If E1 > E2, then (E2-E1) is negative. So, (E2-E1)/(k T) is negative.

So, the Boltzmann factor is exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) → exp(-|E2-E1|/(k T) )

So, when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp becomes larger, so N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) → (g1/g2) * exp(-|E2-E1|/(k T) )

So, as T increases, the ratio N1/N2 decreases.

Ah! Now that makes sense. So, if the star's temperature increases, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. Because the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio is smaller.

So, in the problem, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K, which is lower than 6000 K.

So, when the star has no spots, T=6000 K → ratio R_no.

When spots are present, T=5500 K → ratio R_spots.

So, R_spots = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k *5500) )

But since E2 < E1, (E2-E1) is negative.

So, (E2-E1)/(k T) = - (E1-E2)/(k T) → which is negative.

So, R_spots = (g1/g2) exp( - (E1-E2)/(k *5500) )

Similarly, R_no = (g1/g2) exp( - (E1-E2)/(k *6000) )

So, the ratio R_no / R_spots = exp( (E1-E2)/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Compute (1/6000 -1/5500 ) = (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) )= (-500)/(33,000,000) )= -500/(3.3e7) )≈-1.515e-5.

So, (E1-E2)/(k) * (1/6000 -1/5500 ) ≈ (99,500 K) * (-1.515e-5) ≈-1.505.

So, exp(-1.505) ≈0.221.

So, R_no / R_spots ≈0.221 → R_no =0.221 * R_spots → R_spots = R_no /0.221 ≈4.52 R_no.

Wait, but the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, R_spots is lower than R_no. But according to this calculation, R_spots is higher.

Wait, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I got the energy levels reversed. Let me think again.

If E1 is lower than E2, then (E2-E1) is positive, and the Boltzmann equation becomes N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

But if E2 > E1, then for higher T, (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller, so exp is larger → N1/N2 is larger.

So, when T increases, N1/N2 increases.

But in the problem, when the star has spots, T decreases → N1/N2 decreases.

Which is what the problem states. So, this makes sense.

So, the earlier calculation where spots cause R_spots to be higher than R_no is correct, but this contradicts the problem statement.

So, I'm getting conflicting results.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the ionization ratio, but the question specifies neutral atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio R is N2/N1, not N1/N2.

Wait, the question says: the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2).

So, it's N1/N2.

So, when the star has spots, Teff is lower, so T is lower.

If E2 > E1, then (E2-E1)/(k T) is positive.

So, when T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases → exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) increases → R increases.

Thus, when the star has spots, R increases.

But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots.

This is a contradiction.

So, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm making a wrong assumption.

But according to the problem statement, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the ratio when T=6000 K and T=5500 K, and find the factor by which R decreases.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, higher T leads to lower R (if E2 < E1), but in our case, E2 >E1, so higher T reduces R.

Wait, no, if E2 >E1, higher T would make (E2-E1)/(k T) smaller, so exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) is smaller, so R = (g1/g2) * exp(...) is smaller.

Ah! So, when T increases, R decreases.

So, when the star has no spots, T=6000 K → R_no.

When the star has spots, T=5500 K → R_spots.

As R decreases with increasing T, when T increases from 5500 to 6000, R decreases.

Wait, no: higher T leads to lower R.

So, R_spots (T=5500 K) is higher than R_no (T=6000 K).

So, when the star has spots, R increases, which contradicts the problem statement.

But the problem says R decreases.

So, perhaps the problem is incorrectly assuming that E2 < E1.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy levels are inverted.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio considered is N2/N1, not N1/N2.

If the ratio is N2/N1, then:

N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative → exp is larger → N2/N1 increases.

But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. So, if the ratio is N2/N1, then when T decreases, N2/N1 decreases.

Wait, let me clarify.

If the ratio is N2/N1:

- At higher T, N2/N1 increases.

- So, when the star has no spots (higher T), N2/N1 is higher.

When the star has spots (lower T), N2/N1 is lower.

But the problem states that the ratio N1/N2 decreases when spots are present. So, if N1/N2 = 1/(N2/N1), then when N2/N1 decreases, N1/N2 increases.

Which would again contradict the problem statement.

This is getting very confusing.

Perhaps a better approach is to compute the ratio R_no and R_spots, assuming E2>E1, and see by what factor R decreases.

Wait, but according to the problem, R decreases when the star has spots. So, R_spots < R_no.

Which would imply that when T decreases, R increases, which is the case when E2 < E1.

But that contradicts the energy level assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the inverse ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the number of atoms in level 2 relative to level 1, i.e., N2/N1.

In that case, when T increases, N2/N1 increases if E2 > E1.

Thus, when the star has spots (lower T), N2/N1 decreases.

Which aligns with the problem statement.

So, perhaps the question is about N2/N1, not N1/N2.

If that's the case, then the factor would be R_no / R_spots, where R_no is N2/N1 at 6000 K, and R_spots is N2/N1 at 5500 K.

So, let's compute that.

R = N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, R_no = (g2/g1) exp( - (99500)/6000 )

R_spots = (g2/g1) exp( - (99500)/5500 )

The ratio R_no / R_spots = exp( (99500)/6000 - (99500)/5500 )

Compute the exponent:

99500*(1/6000 -1/5500 ) = 99500*( (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) )

= 99500*(-500)/(33,000,000 )

= 99500 * (-500) / (3.3e7 )

= 99500 * (-5e2) / (3.3e7 )

= (-4.975e7) / (3.3e7 ) → approx -1.507.

So, exp(-1.507) ≈0.220.

So, R_no / R_spots ≈0.220 → R_spots = R_no / 0.220 ≈4.545 R_no.

So, the ratio N2/N1 increases when the star has spots, which would mean N1/N2 decreases, as observed.

So, the factor by which the ratio N1/N2 changes is R1 = N1/N2 = 1/(N2/N1).

So, R1_no = 1/R_no, R1_spots=1/R_spots.

So, the factor is R1_no / R1_spots = (1/R_no) / (1/R_spots ) )= R_spots / R_no ≈4.545.

So, the ratio N1/N2 decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star has spots.

So, the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (N1/N2) changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right)
\]

where:
- \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels,
- \( E_2 - E_1 \) is the energy difference between the levels,
- \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant,
- \( T \) is the temperature.

The problem specifies that the star's effective temperature (\( T_{\text{eff}} \)) is 6000 K without spots and 5500 K with spots. The energy difference corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, so:

\[
E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

Substituting \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \):

\[
E_2 - E_1 = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}
\]

Converting to electronvolts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
E_2 - E_1 \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}
\]

The ratio \( N_1/N_2 \) is the inverse of \( N_2/N_1 \), so:

\[
\frac{N_1}{N_2} = \frac{1}{\frac{N_2}{N_1}} = \frac{1}{\frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right)}
\]

The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{N_1}{N_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{N_1}{N_2}\right)_{\text{spots}}}
\]

Substituting the temperatures \( T = 6000 \, \text{K} \) (no spots) and \( T = 5500 \, \text{K} \) (spots), and using \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \):

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT_{\text{no spots}}}\right)}{\exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT_{\text{spots}}}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}}\right)\right)
\]

Substituting \( E_2 - E_1 = 8.57 \, \text{eV} \), \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \), \( T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} = \frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99500 \, \text{K}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} = \frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} = \frac{5500 - 6000}{6000 \times 5500} = -\frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx -1.515 \times 10^{-5}
\]

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(99500 \times -1.515 \times 10^{-5}\right) = \exp(-1.505) \approx 0.221
\]

Since the problem asks for the factor by which the ratio decreases, the inverse is taken:

\[
\text{Factor} \approx \frac{1}{0.221} \approx 4.5
\]

Thus, the ratio \( N_1/N_2 \) decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star has spots compared to when it does not.
