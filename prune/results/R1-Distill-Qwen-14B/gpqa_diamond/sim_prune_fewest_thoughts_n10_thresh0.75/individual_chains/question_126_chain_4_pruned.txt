Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question involves two reactions and then analyzing the products using HPLC. Hmm, I remember that HPLC can separate components based on their interaction with the stationary phase. Normal-phase HPLC usually has a polar stationary phase, so polar compounds come out later. Chiral HPLC columns are used to separate enantiomers because the stationary phase is chiral.

Let me start by looking at each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. Wait, hexan-3-one is a ketone. So, LAH would reduce the ketone group. The structure would become a diol? Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. So when LAH reduces it, that ketone becomes a secondary alcohol. So, 5-methoxyhexan-3-one would become 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. But wait, wait, no. Wait, let me think about the structure.

(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one structure: The molecule is CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH2OCH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO, so the structure is CH3CH2COCH2CH2OCH3? No, wait. Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Hexan-3-one would be CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3, but wait, hexane is six carbons. So, positions 1-6. So, 3-one is (CH2)2CO. So, the structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3. But wait, wait, no, wait. Hexan-3-one is (CH2CH2)CO(CH2CH2CH3). Wait, perhaps it's CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2OCH3? Wait, perhaps the structure is more accurately CH2CH2-CO-CH2-OCH3? No, wait, the substituent is
