Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives a density matrix rho, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. Pure states are when it's a single ket vector, and mixed states are statistical ensembles of pure states.

Wait, the given rho looks like it's a mixture of |0> and |1>, each with equal probability. Because when you expand it, each term is multiplied by 1/2. So this is a classical mixture, right? So it's a mixed state, not a pure state.

But the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. Oh, right, in the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. For a pure state |ψ>, it can be written as a vector pointing from the origin to a point on the unit sphere.

For a pure state |0>, the Bloch vector would be (0,0,1), because |0> corresponds to the north pole. Similarly, |1> would be (0,0,-1). But wait, our state isn't a pure state; it's a mixed state of these two.

Hmm, how do mixed states look on the Bloch sphere? I recall that the density matrix can be represented in terms of a Bloch vector r. The general form is rho = (I + r · σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and I is the identity matrix.

Let me write that out: rho = (I + xσx + yσy + zσz)/2. So if I compare that with the given rho, which is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let's compute |0><0| and |1><1|.

Wait, |0><0| is a diagonal matrix with [1,0; 0,0], and |1><1| is [0,0;0,1]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So rho is (I)/2. So comparing to rho = (I + r · σ)/2, that would mean r · σ is zero. Which implies r is (0,0,0).

Because if r is zero, then the identity is the only term. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which is the origin in the Bloch sphere. That makes sense because a completely mixed state is at the center of the sphere. So the state is maximally mixed, like being in a completely random state with no preference.

Looking at the options: option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, as it is a statistical ensemble of the pure states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability \(1/2\). To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a general density matrix, the Bloch vector \(r = (x, y, z)\) is related to the density matrix by:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + r \cdot \sigma}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix and \(\sigma = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. Expanding the given \(\rho\), we find:

\[
|0\rangle \langle 0| = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad |1\rangle \langle 1| = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix},
\]

so

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right) = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

Comparing this to \(\rho = \frac{I + r \cdot \sigma}{2}\), it follows that \(r \cdot \sigma = 0\), which implies \(r = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere, representing a maximally mixed state. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).**

Answer: C
