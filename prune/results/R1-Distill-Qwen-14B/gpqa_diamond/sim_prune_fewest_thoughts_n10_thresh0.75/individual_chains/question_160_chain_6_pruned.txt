Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light diffraction through an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon. Hmm, all the apothems are the same length a. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and in the far field, we get these intensity maxima and minima. The question is about finding the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large.

Wait, when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, the polygon approaches a circle. So, I think this problem is actually about the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

I remember that for single-slit diffraction, the minima occur at certain angles. Oh wait, but here it's a circular aperture, so the diffraction pattern is the Airy disk. The positions of the minima in the Airy disk are at angles where the Bessel functions are zero. The first minima must be the first zeros of the Bessel function.

The formula I remember is that the angular position θ of the m-th minimum for a circular aperture is given by θ = (x_m * λ) / (π * a), where x_m is the m-th zero of the Bessel function J1. The first minimum (the first dark ring) occurs at x_1 ≈ 3.8317. Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, for circular apertures, the central maximum is surrounded by rings of intensity. The first minimum occurs at an angle where J1(θ * π a / λ) = 0. The zeros of J1 are at approximately 3.8317, 7.0156, etc. So the first minimum is at x ≈ 3.8317.

Wait, but wait, the formula for the angle is θ = (x_m * λ) / (π a), right? So for the first minimum, m=1, so θ1 = (3.8317 * λ) / (π a). Similarly, the second minimum would be at θ2 = (7.0156 * λ)/(π a). So the angular distance between the first two minima would be θ2 - θ1.

Wait, but when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. So in that case, the diffraction pattern is the same as a circular aperture. So the first minimum is at θ1 = 1.22 λ/(a), because 3.8317/(π) is approximately 1.22. Let me check that: 3.8317 divided by π is about 3.8317/3.1416 ≈ 1.220. So yes, that's right.

Wait, but the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So the first minimum is at θ1 = 1.22 λ/(a), the second is at θ2 = 2.45 λ/(a) approximately, because 7.0156/π is around 2.23, wait wait wait. Let me compute 7.0156 / π. 7.0156 divided by 3.1416 is approximately 2.2
