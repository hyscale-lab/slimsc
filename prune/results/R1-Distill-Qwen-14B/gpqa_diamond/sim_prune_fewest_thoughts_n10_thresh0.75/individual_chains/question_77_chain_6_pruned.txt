Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement and some other reactions. Hmm, I need to figure out the major products A and B from the given reactions. Let me read through the question again carefully.

The first part says that the starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Then it reacts with BuLi followed by H+ to give product A. The second reaction involves a complex structure with heat leading to product B, which is a result of the Cope rearrangement.

Wait, I remember that the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of a 1,5-diene. So, for part B, the starting material must be a 1,5-diene, and when heated, it undergoes the Cope rearrangement.

But wait, the first reaction isn't a Cope rearrangement. Let's think about that. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. That structure has an ether group attached to a benzene ring. So the benzene is connected to a CH2-O- group, where the O is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Let me draw this structure.

So the substituent on the benzene is OCH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2. Hmm, wait. Wait, no. The group is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. Let's break that down. But-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-, right? But with a methyl branch at the 3 position. So but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but the 3 position is the third carbon from the end. Wait, wait. The substituents are numbered from the point of attachment. So 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be: the chain is 1 (point of attachment), 2 (double bond), 3 (methyl branch), 4 (end). So the structure is CH2-O-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, perhaps I got that wrong.
