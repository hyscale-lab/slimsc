Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and the hints.

The question is about identifying compound E in a reaction scheme. The steps are: A reacts with HCN to form B, then B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. Then C reacts with HNO2 to form D, which upon elimination of an inert gas gives E.

Hmm, I remember that HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups. So maybe A is a ketone or aldehyde. Oh wait, the IR spectrum of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, which is typical for a carbonyl group (like a ketone or maybe an ester, but esters are higher sometimes? Or maybe another group). Then, E has a peak around 1715, which is a bit lower, maybe a ketone as well. Wait, or maybe a different carbonyl group.

Looking at the hints, hint a) says that when compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. I remember that ylides are used in the Wittig reaction. The Wittig reagent adds to carbonyl groups to form alkenes. So compound A must have a carbonyl group, and the Wittig reaction forms an alkene.

The product from the Wittig is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw that structure. So cyclopentane ring, with substituents at positions 1 and 2. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is like a CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or wait, propan-2-ylidene is (CH3)2C= group. So the structure would have a double bond attached to the cyclopentane at position 4.

So the starting material A, after a Wittig reaction, gives that. So A would have a carbonyl group adjacent to a ring. Let me think: the Wittig reaction takes a carbonyl (like ketone, aldehyde) and converts it into an alkene. So in the product, the alkene is where the carbonyl was. So in A, perhaps the carbonyl is at position 4 of cyclopentane. Wait, but the product has a substituent at position 4. So maybe the original structure is cyclopentanone with substituents.

Alternatively, maybe A is cyclopentanone with some substituents. Let me try to imagine. The product after Wittig has a ring with a substituent that's a propenyl group (something like that). So if the starting material is a cyclopentanone, the Wittig would replace the ketone (O) with a CH2 group attached to a double bond. Wait, no. The Wittig adds a double bond. So if A is, say, a cyclopentan
