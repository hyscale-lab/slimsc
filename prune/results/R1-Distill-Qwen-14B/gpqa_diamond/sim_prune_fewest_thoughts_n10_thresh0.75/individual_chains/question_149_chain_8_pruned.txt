Okay, so I have this NMR and LC-MS question in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think through it.

The question describes a small peptidic compound that was chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both have similar chemical shifts and about equal integrals, adding up to 1H. The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, so it's not like one is splitting the other. Hmm, what else could cause this?

Then the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum as the expected molecule. So, the masses are the same, which probably means the molecular formula is identical. But why two peaks then?

Looking at the options:

A) Contaminated with a precursor. That would mean the extra peak is a different compound, like a starting material or a byproduct. But LC-MS shows the same mass, so probably not a precursor which would have a lower mass. So A might not fit.

B) Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular formula and same mass, so LC-MS would show one peak if the column is achiral. Wait, but if the LC uses a chiral column, then enantiomers would separate. But the question says the LC-MS shows two peaks at elevated temperature. Wait, maybe I don't know. Also, if it's a chiral column, you can get two peaks. But for NMR, enantiomers would look identical, right? Because the environment is the same. But in the NMR, the same alpha-proton is appearing as two peaks. So if they were enantiomers, the NMR should be the same, so same number of peaks. So this might not explain the NMR observation. So B is maybe not the answer.

C) Double coupling during amide bond formation. Double coupling occurs when a proton is coupled to two different sets of protons, but I'm not exactly sure. Wait, maybe it's when a proton is coupled to two different protons, like in a situation where two different coupling constants apply. But the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, so maybe it's not that. Or perhaps it's about whether
