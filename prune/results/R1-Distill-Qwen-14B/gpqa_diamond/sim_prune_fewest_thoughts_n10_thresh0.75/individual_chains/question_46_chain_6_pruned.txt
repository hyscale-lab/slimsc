Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my olefin metathesis reactions, but let me think this through.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis, which is a reaction where alkenes (olefins) exchange their carbons. It's like breaking and reforming the double bonds. So the starting material here is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Oh wait, but it's racemic, which means it has both E and Z isomers in equal amounts. Or wait, noâ€”racemic refers to a mixture of enantiomers, right? So for a double bond, that would imply that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, so maybe it's a meso compound or something. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Racemic would be 50:50 of the two enantiomers. But in this case, the molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me think about its structure more carefully.

The structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)? No, wait. Wait, pent means five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that would be six carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Oh wait, wait. Let's count: pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, 3-methyl would be on the third carbon from the end. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2? No, that can't be right. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3). No, that can't be. Wait, let me try again. The formula for pent-1-ene is C5H10. 3-methyl would add a methyl group on the third carbon. So the structure is CH
