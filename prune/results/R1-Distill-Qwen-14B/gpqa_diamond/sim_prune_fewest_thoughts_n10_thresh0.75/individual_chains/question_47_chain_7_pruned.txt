Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. Hmm, that's a molecular formula. I remember that calculating the degree of unsaturation can help determine the structure. Let me calculate that real quick. The formula is C9H11NO2.

The degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0, so it's (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2. Let's see: 20 -11 is 9, plus 1 is 10. Divided by 2 is 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean one ring and four double bonds, but that's probably not right. Or maybe one ring and two double bonds or something like that. More likely, maybe a benzene ring and some substituents. Benzene has three double bonds, so that would account for three of the five. Then we have two more, which could be a carbonyl group (like an amide or ester) and maybe an ether. Or maybe a ring and some substituents with double bonds.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those look like N-H stretches. Amide NH usually has strong peaks around 3300-3500. So maybe an amide is present. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. For amides, the carbonyl is usually around 1680-1720, so that fits. Maybe it's an amide or an ester. Let's keep that in mind.

Now the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet, likely from a CH3 group attached to something, maybe an ethyl group (like OCH2CH3 or something). The triplet suggests two neighboring groups, so probably adjacent to a CH2.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for two protons. Could be adjacent to an electronegative atom or a group where splitting is not observed, like maybe an N in an amide. Or perhaps it's a methylene group next to oxygen, but the broadness suggests maybe exchange or something deshielded. Maybe an NH group, but wait, in the IR we saw the N-H signals. But in NMR, if it's a broad singlet, maybe it's an NH group. Alternatively, could be an OCH2 group but with coupling that's broad.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quadruplet with 2H. Quadruplet often comes from a CH2 group next to another CH2, perhaps as in an ethyl group. For example, an ethyl ester (like OCH2CH3), but the ethyl group in esters usually has a triplet around 1.2 and a quartet around 4.1. Wait, but here we have a quartet at 4.5. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, but in a different position.

Then at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Those are doublets, each with two protons. This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. The downfield shift at 8 ppm could be due to electron-withdrawing groups. Since we have a carbonyl, maybe it's an amide or an ester attached to the benzene ring.

Putting this together: The aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene, which is common in many substituted benzoic acid derivatives. The carbonyl in the IR suggests either an ester or an amide. The NMR also has a broad singlet which might be an amide NH. Let's think about the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at the 3 position. Benzamide is CONH2 attached to benzene. Wait, but the molecular formula here is C9H11NO2. Benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding ethoxy (C2H5O) would make it C9H10NO2. Hmm, but the given formula is C9H11NO2. Wait, that doesn't match. Maybe I'm miscalculating. Wait, 3-ethoxybenz
