Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me think through this.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices given are combinations of these.

Wait, what's the deal with these symmetries? I remember that the Standard Model (SM) respects certain symmetries, and SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting those symmetries.

First off, Lorentz symmetryâ€”oh right, that's the symmetry of spacetime under Lorentz transformations, like rotations and boosts. All terms in the SM Lagrangian are Lorentz-invariant, so operators in SMEFT must also be Lorentz scalars. Otherwise, the physics wouldn't make sense under different inertial frames. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must. That means option 1 is correct.

Then there's Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like shifting position in space and time). So Poincare implies momentum conservation, energy conservation, etc. But wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory. Do effective theories automatically respect Poincare? I think yes because the underlying SM does. So operators in SMEFT should also respect Poincare. But wait, is that a separate symmetry from Lorentz? Because Poincare includes both. Oh, but the question lists them as separate options. So if 1 is correct, does that mean 2 is also correct?

Wait, no, maybe. Because Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations. So if the operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But could SMEFT operators possibly violate Poincare? Hmm. But I think all terms in SMEFT are Poincare-invariant because they're built from the SM fields which respect that. So 2 is correct too.

Now about CP symmetry. CP is charge conjugation (switching particles with their antiparticles) and parity (mirror reflection). The SM doesn't respect CP in some cases, like in the CKM mechanism for CP violation. So wait, can SMEFT operators violate CP? Because in the SM, certain operators lead to CP violation. So in SMEFT, operators that cause CP violation are allowed. But the question is, must all operators respect CP symmetry? No, because SMEFT allows for terms that can break it. So CP isn't a symmetry that must be respected by all operators. So option 3 is incorrect.

What about CPT symmetry? CPT is the combination of charge, parity, and time reversal. I remember that the SM respects CPT symmetry. And in fact, all Lorentz-invariant theories must respect CPT. Because the structure of spacetime under Lorentz transformations enforces CPT symmetry. So any operators in SMEFT, being Lorentz-invariant, must automatically respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.

So putting it together: which of the options are correct?

1. Lorentz yes.

2. Poincare: yes, because all operators are built from SM fields that respect Poincare. So 2 is correct.

4. CPT yes.

So the
