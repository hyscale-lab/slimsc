Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let's see. The reaction is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino, I think. The pion is at rest initially. The masses given are Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, neutrino is also a product, but I don't think its mass is given. Oh, right, neutrinos are usually considered massless in these types of problems, especially in beta decay. So, I'll proceed with that.

I remember that in such decay processes, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. That means the muon and neutrino move in exactly opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude.

The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, each product will have their rest energy plus kinetic energy. But wait, the neutrino being massless means its energy is just its kinetic energy, right? Because E = pc for massless particles.

So, let me write down the conservation equations. 

First, energy conservation:
E_pi = E_mu + E_nu
E_pi is 139.6 MeV. E_mu is sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2, but units-wise, maybe it's easier to work in MeV and set c=1. So E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), and E_nu = p, since m_nu is zero.

So equation 1:
139.6 = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p

Hmm, that looks a bit tricky. Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root. Let me rearrange the equation first:

Let me denote sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) as A. So,

A + p = 139.6
A = 139.6 - p

Now square both sides:

A^2 = (139.6 - p)^2
p^2 + m_mu^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * p + p^2

Oh, wait, the p^2 terms cancel out. So,

m_mu^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * p

Let's plug in the numbers. m_mu is 105.7 MeV.

So,

105.7^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * p

Calculate 139.6 squared. Let's see, 140 squared is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16. But wait, 139.6 is 1396/10, so 139.6^2 = (1396)^2 / 100. Let me compute 1396 *1396. Hmm, perhaps I should just calculate it numerically.

Alternatively, maybe compute 139.6^2:

139.6 * 139.6. Let me compute 140 *140 = 19600, subtract 0.4 * (2*140 - 0.4) because (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b². So, (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 1
