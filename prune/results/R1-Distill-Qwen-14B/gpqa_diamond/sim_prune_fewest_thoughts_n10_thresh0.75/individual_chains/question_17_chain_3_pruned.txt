Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also give me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant (K) is a measure of the stability of the complex. So in this case, Ca²+ is chelated by EDTA, forming the Ca-EDTA complex.

Wait, the formation constant equation. Right, for the complex formation reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−. The formation constant K is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

But wait, in the solution, we have the Ca-EDTA complex, which is the product. So the concentration of the complex is given as 0.02 M. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

I think I can model this using the formation constant expression. Let me denote [CaEDTA^2-] as 0.02 M.

But wait, when the complex dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So the dissociation of the complex would be:

CaEDTA²− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−

The formation constant K is given by the equation K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = 5x10^10.

But wait, in solution, the total concentration of the complex and its dissociated forms should add up. But wait, in this problem, the solution only contains the complex. Because the question says it's a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So I think we can assume that the only species present are the complex and the dissociated Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. But wait, is the solution in excess of EDTA? Or is the initial concentration of the complex 0.02 M, and nothing else?

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the solution has only the complex and nothing else. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and as it dissociates, it produces Ca²+ and EDTA^4−.

So, let me set up the variables. Let’s let s be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate from the complex. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4− will also be s, because one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4− are produced per complex.

So, the concentration of the complex will be 0.02 - s. But wait, is s negligible compared to 0.02? Because K is very large (5e10), the complex is very stable. So the dissociation is minimal. That means s will be very small compared to
