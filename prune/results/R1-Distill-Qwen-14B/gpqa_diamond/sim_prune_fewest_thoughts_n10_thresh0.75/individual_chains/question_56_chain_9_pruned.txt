Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom and dipole transitions. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the state |3,0,0⟩ decaying to |1,0,0⟩ through two dipole transitions. I remember that in hydrogen, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by selection rules.

Wait, what are the selection rules again? Oh right, for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δn = ±1, ±2, etc., but more specifically, Δn can be ±1, ±2. But wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, wait. The main selection rules I remember are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So the orbital angular momentum quantum number l changes by ±1, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0 or ±1.

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. It needs to go to |1,0,0⟩ via two steps. So each step is a dipole transition. Let's break it down.

First, the initial state has n=3, l=0 (s orbital), m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. Since the initial l is 0, the first transition must go to a state with l=1, because Δl = ±1. So after the first transition, the electron must be in a state with l=1.

So the first transition would be from l=0 to l=1. So the state after the first transition would be |2,1, something⟩, since n must decrease by 1 (from 3 to 2) in the first step. Because I think that the most probable transitions are Δn=±1, but sometimes larger changes can happen, but here it's two steps, so probably Δn=±1 each.

Wait, but the selection rule for n isn't strictly Δn=±1. But in hydrogen, transitions can have Δn up to certain values, but for dipole transitions, the main thing is Δl=±1. So the first step must go from l=0 to l=1, so the next state is l=1. Therefore, n could be 2 or 4 if l was changing from something else, but since initial n is 3, l=0, the next n after transition could be 2
