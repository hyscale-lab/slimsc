Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. I'm a bit rusty on my pericyclic reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

The molecule given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Hmm, let me visualize that structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has two rings, right? So it's a norbornane structure. The substituents are at positions 2, and it's a bicyclic system. The 2-vinyl group means there's a vinyl substituent on the second carbon. And it's a hept-5-ene, so the double bond is between carbons 5 and 6 maybe? Wait, I might need to draw that.

Wait, the numbering for bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane: the bridgeheads are positions 1 and 4, I think. So the structure is a seven-membered ring with two bridges, each of two carbons, and one bridge of one carbon. So positions 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., arranged in a way that 1 and 4 are bridgeheads.

The compound is 2-vinyl, so there's a CH₂-CH₂ group attached to carbon 2. And the double bond is hept-5-ene, so the double bond is between carbons 5 and 6 perhaps. Or wait, maybe between 4 and 5? I'm not entirely sure about the numbering here.

Wait, the structure is 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Azabicyclo means that one of the bridgehead carbons is replaced by a nitrogen. So in norbornane, which is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, replacing one bridgehead with N gives a structure where N is at position 1 or 4. The substituents are at position 2: a vinyl group. So the molecule is a bicyclic amine with a double bond and a vinyl group.

The question is about the Cope rearrangement. The Cope rearrangement is a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement, right? It typically occurs in 1,5-dienes to form another 1,5-diene
