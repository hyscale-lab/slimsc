Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's read it carefully and figure out what's going on. 

The question says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to find out which reagent (A) and catalyst (B) were used.

Hmm. So, looking at the starting material and the product. The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, which is a cyclic secondary amine. The product is a more complex molecule. Let me visualize the structures.

3-methylpyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with four carbons and one nitrogen. The substituent is a methyl group on the third carbon. The product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached to the pyrrolidine. Cyclohexylidenemethyl would be a cyclohexyl group connected via a methylene bridge (CH₂–) but with a double bond, making it a substituted cyclohexene. So, the substituent is like CH₂–Cyclohexene.

Wait, so the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So, the substituent is on the first carbon of the pyrrolidine ring. That suggests some kind of ring expansion or addition.

The reaction is acid-catalyzed. Common acid-catalyzed reactions involving amines might be alkylation or some kind of addition. Wait, but pyrrolidine is a tertiary amine, but 3-methylpyrrolidine is actually a secondary amine because the nitrogen has two carbon substituents (the ring is five-membered, so the structure is CH2CH2CH(CH3)N, so two CH2 groups and one CH(CH3)).

Wait, no. Let me think again. Pyrrolidine is a five-membered amine ring with four carbons and one nitrogen. For 3-methylpyrrolidine, the substituent is on the third carbon. So, the structure is a pyrrolidine ring where the nitrogen is attached to two CH2 groups and one CH(CH3) group. Wait, that would make it a secondary amine because the nitrogen has two carbons attached (but I'm not entirely sure, maybe I should draw it mentally).

So, the reaction is acid-catalyzed. What kind of reactions occur between amines and carbonyl compounds under acidic conditions? Oh, that's the Michaelis-Arbuzov reaction, but that's for phosphites and alkyl halides. Alternatively, acid catalyzed reactions could be alkylation, perhaps via a carbocation intermediate.

Wait, but the product looks like it's formed by the addition of a carbonyl compound. Wait, no, the product has a cyclohexylidene group, which is like a cyclohexene attached via a methylene group. So, perhaps it's an enamine formation?

Enamine formation typically involves the reaction of a secondary amine with a carbonyl compound. The steps are: first, the amine reacts with a ketone or aldehyde to form a Schiff base (imine), then the imine is proton
