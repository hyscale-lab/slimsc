Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right, with a Lorentz factor of 2. Then they collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and one is moving upper-right while the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Hmm, right. So first, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. Since the electron and positron are moving towards each other, their combined energy and momentum will determine the properties of the emitted photons.

Wait, annihilation. Electron-positron annihilation produces two photons because of conservation laws. So, conservation of energy and momentum must hold here.

Let me think about the setup. The electron is moving left to right, the positron right to left. Both are along the horizontal (x-axis). So, their momenta are in opposite directions.

I think I should first compute the total energy and momentum before the annihilation. Then, after annihilation, the two photons must carry away energy and momentum such that the total is the same.

So, the initial particles are an electron and a positron. Both have rest mass energy equal to the electron's rest mass, which is about 0.511 MeV each. But their kinetic energies are given via the Lorentz factors.

Wait, Lorentz factor gamma is defined as gamma = total energy / rest energy. So the total energy of each particle is gamma multiplied by m c squared. Since for an electron and a positron, their rest mass is same.

So the electron's Lorentz factor is 4. So its total energy is 4 m_e c². Similarly, positron's gamma is 2, so its total energy is 2 m_e c².

Wait, but wait. The positron is moving towards the electron, so their momenta would be in opposite directions.

I think I should calculate the total energy and momentum of the system before annihilation.

Let me denote the electron as particle 1 and positron as particle 2.
