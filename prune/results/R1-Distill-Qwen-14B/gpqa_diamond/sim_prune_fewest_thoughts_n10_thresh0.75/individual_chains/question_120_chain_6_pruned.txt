Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about the distribution of stars in the sky, assuming they are uniformly distributed. It asks how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each involving inverse powers of plx.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax in astronomy is the apparent shift in the position of a star caused by the Earth's movement around the Sun. The formula I recall is that the distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of the parallax (plx), so d = 1/plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So, if I imagine a range of parallaxes, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars would be in that range? Since stars are uniformly distributed, I think it's about the volume of space at a certain distance that corresponds to a specific range of parallaxes.

Wait, wait. Uniform distribution in the sky—does that mean uniformly distributed in space? Or just on the celestial sphere? Hmm, the problem says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, so maybe it's a uniform distribution over the celestial sphere, but possibly also considering distance. I think for this problem, we can assume that the stars are uniformly distributed in space, so their number density is the same everywhere.

If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars in a given volume depends on the volume. But how does parallax relate to the volume? Let's think about a shell at a certain distance d with thickness dd. The volume of that shell would be the surface area of the sphere (4πr²) multiplied by the thickness (dr). 

Since plx is 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Because as plx increases, d decreases. So, the volume of a shell at distance d with thickness dr is 4π d² dr.

But since dr is - (1/plx²) dplx, and plx is 1/d, then dr = -(d²) dplx. So, substituting, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx^2) dplx ). Wait, but I think I might be mixing up the variables here. Let me approach it differently.

The number of stars per unit volume is constant because they are uniformly distributed. Let's denote the number density as n (stars per cubic parsec). Then, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr is n * 4π d² dr.

But since d = 1/plx, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting, the number of stars in a shell is n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (- (1/plx²) dplx )

Wait, but we need the number per unit plx, so we're looking at the number of stars in a range dplx. So, the number of stars per unit plx is the number of stars in that shell divided by dplx.

Wait, no—dN is the number of stars
