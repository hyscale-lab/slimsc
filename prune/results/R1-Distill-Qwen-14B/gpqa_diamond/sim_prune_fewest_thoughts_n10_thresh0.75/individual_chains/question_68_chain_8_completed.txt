Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says there's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu, which is equal to gamma times Sz. So mu = γ S_z. The magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction, and the particle's moment is aligned with it. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, so initially, the magnetic field was along +Z. Since the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with B, that means the spin is along +Z. So the initial state must be the eigenstate of S_z, right? So the spin is up in the z-direction.

Then, the magnetic field is switched to +Y. So now the magnetic field is along y. I think this changes the Hamiltonian of the system. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -μ·B. Oh wait, wait, wait. Wait, mu is given as gamma S_z initially. But when the field changes direction, mu would be along the field direction, so mu would be in the y-direction? Or does mu remain as gamma S_z regardless of the field direction?

Wait, no. Oh, wait, the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin, but the direction depends on the field. Or wait, no. Wait, the magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma S_z. Initially, when the field is along +Z, this makes sense because the magnetic moment is aligned along the field. But when the field changes to the Y direction, the magnetic moment would tend to align with the new field. Hmm, but maybe the magnetic moment is still mu = gamma S_z, but the Hamiltonian changes because the field is now along Y.

Wait, maybe I should think about the Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is H = -γ S · B. So if B is along Y direction, then H = -γ B S_y.

Wait, but the initial magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, but when the field is along Y, the magnetic moment would want to point along Y. But wait, perhaps the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z regardless of the field direction. Or is mu the intrinsic magnetic moment which is aligned with spin, and the direction of the magnetic field determines the effective Hamiltonian.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the problem using the Hamiltonian. Initially, the field is along Z, so H_initial = -γ B S_z. But when the field is turned off and turned along Y, the new Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -γ B S_y.

Wait no, wait. The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma S_z. So when the field is along Y, the interaction energy is H = -mu · B, so H = - (gamma S_z) · B_y. Since B is along Y, B = B_0 \hat{y}, so S_z and B are perpendicular. So the dot product would be zero. That can't be right.

Wait, that can't be right because then the Hamiltonian would be zero, but that's not the case. Hmm, perhaps I got the mu wrong. Wait, maybe mu is a vector that's aligned with the spin, so when the field is along Y, mu would be in the Y direction. Wait no, the problem says mu = gamma S_z. So the magnetic moment is along the z-component of spin. So regardless of the field direction, mu is along Z. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Let me read the problem again. "mu = gamma * S_z." So the magnetic moment is proportional to the z-component of spin. So the magnetic moment is a vector along the z-axis, regardless of the direction of the applied field. That seems a bit odd, but perhaps that's how the problem is set up.

Wait, but in reality, the magnetic moment is given by mu = gamma * S, where S is the spin vector. So maybe the problem has a typo or maybe it's that mu is along the z-direction only. Hmm, perhaps the problem states that the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, implying that it's only the z-component that contributes. That would complicate things because when the field is along Y, the interaction would be between mu and B, but since mu is along Z and B is along Y, their dot product would be zero. That would mean the Hamiltonian is zero, but that can't be the case because then there's no time evolution, and the average wouldn't oscillate.

Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should re-express the problem. Wait, perhaps the magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma S, the vector. Then, when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian would be H = -mu · B = -gamma (S · B). If B is along Y, then H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, that makes more sense. So the initial magnetic field is along Z, so H_initial is proportional to S_z. Then, when the field is turned off and turned on along Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y.

So let me restate. The initial state is the eigenstate of S_z, say with eigenvalue +ħ/2. When the field is turned on in Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma B S_y. So the system's energy levels are now determined by S_y. The eigenstates of S_y are the eigenstates of S^2 and S_y. So the energy levels for spin-1/2 are E = ± (gamma B ħ/2) / 2? Wait, let me think. S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the energy E = -gamma B (S_y) would be E = ± (-gamma B)(ħ/2) ?

Wait, more accurately, since H = -gamma B S_y. So the eigenvalues of H are E_+ = (-gamma B)(+ħ/2) = -gamma B ħ/2, and E_- = (-gamma B)(-ħ/2) = +gamma B ħ/2.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think about the time evolution.

The initial state is |+z>. When the Hamiltonian changes to H = -gamma B S_y, the state will evolve over time according to this new Hamiltonian. The time evolution is given by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, but since the Hamiltonian is time-independent after the switch, we can use the time evolution operator.

The state at time t is |ψ(t)> = e^(-i H t / ħ) |+z>.

The expectation value of S_z in this state would be <S_z> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

We're told that this expectation value oscillates, and we have to find the frequency of oscillation.

Hmm, so to find the oscillation frequency, I can find the time dependence of <S_z> and determine how fast it oscillates.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the energy difference between the eigenstates, which would give the oscillation frequency via the Bohr frequency formula.

Wait, the Bohr frequency is (E_m - E_n)/ħ. So the transition frequency between two states would be proportional to (E_m - E_n)/ħ.

In this case, the initial state |+z> is not an eigenstate of H, so it will evolve into a superposition of the eigenstates of H, which are |+y> and |-y> (or some other eigenstates of S_y).

The time evolution will cause interference between these states, leading to oscillations in observable quantities, like the expectation value of S_z.

So the expectation value of S_z will oscillate with a frequency related to the energy difference between the states.

Wait, let's get into more detail.

The initial state |+z> can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenstates of H, which are the eigenstates of S_y.

The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively.

So, |+z> can be written in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

The spin matrices: for spin-1/2, the eigenvectors can be found.

The eigenstates of S_y are (|+y> and |-y>). S_y has eigenvectors:

|+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/√2,

|-y> = (|+z> − |−z>)/√2.

Wait, no, wait. The eigenstates of S_y are actually |+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/√2 and |-y> = (|+z> − |−z>)/√2 multiplied by a phase factor. Let me check that.

The spin operator S_y in the S_z basis is represented by the matrix (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So the eigenstates are the eigenvectors of that matrix.

The eigenvectors are (1, 1) and (1, -1), normalized. So,

|+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/√2,

|-y> = (|+z> − |−z>)/(√2).

So, the initial state |+z> can be expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y> as:

|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/√2.

Wait, let me verify that.

If I take |+y> = (|+z> + |−z>)/√2,

and |-y> = (|+z> − |−z>)/√2,

then |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/√2 ?

Yes, because adding |+y> and |-y> gives (|+z> + |−z> + |+z> − |−z>)/√2 ) = (2 |+z>)/√2 = √2 |+z>.

So to get |+z>, it's (|+y> + |-y>)/√2.

So, the initial state |+z> is a superposition of |+y> and |-y>.

Now, the time evolution under H = -gamma B S_y.

The eigenstates of H are |+y> and |-y> with energies E_+ = (-gamma B)(+ħ/2) = - (gamma B ħ)/2,

and E_- = (-gamma B)(-ħ/2) = (+ gamma B ħ)/2.

Wait, because H = -gamma B S_y.

So, the time evolution of |+y> is e^(-i E_+ t / ħ) |+y>,

and time evolution of |-y> is e^(-i E_- t / ħ) |-y>.

So, the state |ψ(t)> is e^(-i H t / ħ) |+z>.

Which is e^(-i H t / ħ) [ (|+y> + |-y>)/√2 ]

= [ e^(-i E_+ t / ħ) |+y> + e^(-i E_- t / ħ) |-y> ] / √2.

Now, to compute <S_z>, let's calculate <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

But let me think about S_z in the |+y> and |-y> basis.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value by expanding S_z in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

Wait, perhaps a smarter approach is to note that S_z is an operator, and using the time evolution, the expectation value can be found.

Alternatively, perhaps the expectation value <S_z> can be expressed as a function involving cos and sin terms, leading to oscillations.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute the time dependence of the expectation value.

Let me proceed step by step.

The state |ψ(t)> is (e^{-i E_+ t/ħ} |+y> + e^{-i E_- t/ ħ} |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

The expectation value of S_z is:

<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>

Since S_z |+y> and S_z |-y> can be calculated.

Wait, what is S_z in the |y> basis? Let me think.

We know that S_z |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z>,

and S_z |−z> = (-ħ/2) |−z>.

But in terms of |+y> and |-y>, what is S_z?

We can express S_z as a matrix in the |+y>, |-y> basis.

Since S_z |+y> = S_z (|+z> + |−z>)/√2 = [S_z |+z> + S_z |−z> ] / √2 = ( (ħ/2)|+z> + (-ħ/2)|−z> ) / √2.

Which is [ (|+z> - |−z> ) ħ/2 ] / √2.

But |−y> = (|+z> - |−z>)/√2.

So S_z |+y> = (ħ/2) ( |−y> ).

Similarly, S_z |-y> = S_z (|+z> - |−z>)/√2 = [ (ħ/2)|+z> - (-ħ/2)|−z> ] / √2 = ( (|+z> + |−z> ) ħ/2 ) / √2 = (ħ/2)|+y>.

Wait, wait.

Wait, let me compute S_z |+y>.

|+y> = (|+z> + |−z> )/√2.

So S_z |+y> = (S_z |+z> + S_z |−z> ) /√2.

S_z |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z>,

S_z |−z> = (-ħ/2) |−z>.

So,

S_z |+y> = ( (ħ/2)|+z> + (-ħ/2)|−z> ) /√2.

Factor out ħ/2:

= (ħ/2) [ |+z> - |−z> ] /√2.

Which is (ħ/2) [ (|+z> - |−z> ) /√2 ] = (ħ/2) |−y>,

since |−y> is (|+z> - |−z> ) /√2.

Similarly, S_z |-y> = (S_z |+z> - S_z |−z> ) /√2.

= ( (ħ/2)|+z> - ( - ħ/2 |−z> ) ) /√2.

= ( (ħ/2)( |+z> + |−z> ) ) /√2.

Which is (ħ/2) [ ( |+z> + |−z> ) /√2 ] = (ħ/2) |+y>.

So, in the |y> basis, the matrix of S_z is:

|+y> row: < +y | S_z | +y > = (ħ/2) < +y | -y > = 0,

< +y | S_z | -y > = (ħ/2) < +y | +y > = ħ/2.

Similarly, |-y> row: < -y | S_z | +y > = (ħ/2) < -y | -y > = ħ/2,

< -y | S_z | -y > = (ħ/2) < -y | +y > = 0.

Wait, no, perhaps I should write the matrix elements.

Wait, S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis:

When acting on |+y>, S_z gives (ħ/2) |−y>,

and when acting on |-y>, S_z gives (ħ/2) |+y>.

So,

[S_z]_{y} =

[ 0        (ħ/2) ]

[ (ħ/2)    0 ]

Because,

S_z |+y> = 0 |+y> + (ħ/2) |-y>,

S_z |-y> = (ħ/2) |+y> + 0 |-y>.

So the matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

Now, the state |ψ(t)> is (e^{-i E_+ t/ħ} |+y> + e^{-i E_- t/ ħ} |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

So, let's compute <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

Expanding this:

= [ (e^{i E_+ t / ħ} < +y| + e^{i E_- t / ħ} < -y| ) / sqrt(2) ) ]

* S_z

* [ (e^{-i E_+ t/ ħ} |+y> + e^{-i E_- t/ ħ} |-y> ) / sqrt(2) ]

Multiplying the terms:

= 1/2 [ e^{i E_+ t} < +y| S_z e^{-i E_+ t} |+y> + e^{i E_+ t} < +y| S_z e^{-i E_- t} |-y> 

+ e^{i E_- t} < -y| S_z e^{-i E_+ t} |+y> 

+ e^{i E_- t} < -y| S_z e^{-i E_- t} |-y> ]

Wait, let me compute each term.

First, considering the matrix elements of S_z:

< +y | S_z | +y > = 0,

< +y | S_z | -y > = ħ/2,

< -y | S_z | +y > = ħ/2,

< -y | S_z | -y > = 0.

So each term becomes:

Term 1: e^{i E_+ t} * (1/2) * < +y | S_z | +y > * e^{-i E_+ t } 

= (1/2) * e^{i E_+ t} * 0 * e^{-i E_+ t} = 0.

Term 2: e^{i E_+ t} * (1/2) * < +y | S_z | -y > * e^{-i E_- t} 

= (1/2) * e^{i E_+ t} * (ħ/2) * e^{-i E_- t}.

Term 3: e^{i E_- t} * (1/2) * < -y | S_z | +y > * e^{-i E_+ t} 

= (1/2) * e^{i E_- t} * (ħ/2) * e^{-i E_+ t}.

Term4: e^{i E_- t} * (1/2) * < -y | S_z | -y > * e^{-i E_- t} 

= (1/2) * e^{i E_- t} * 0 * e^{-i E_- t} = 0.

So, the expectation value is the sum of terms 2 and 3.

So <S_z> = (1/2)( ħ/2 ) [ e^{i (E_+ - E_-) t / ħ} + e^{i (E_- - E_+) t / ħ} ].

Wait, let's compute E_+ and E_-.

Earlier, I had E_+ = - (gamma B ħ ) / 2,

E_- = + (gamma B ħ ) / 2.

So E_+ - E_- = [ - (gamma B ħ)/2 ] - [ (gamma B ħ)/2 ] = - gamma B ħ.

Similarly, E_- - E_+ = gamma B ħ.

So,

e^{i (E_+ - E_-) t / ħ } = e^{i (- gamma B ħ ) t / ħ } = e^{-i gamma B t}.

And e^{i (E_- - E_+) t / ħ } = e^{i gamma B t}.

So, putting it all together:

<S_z> = (1/2)( ħ/2 ) [ e^{-i gamma B t} + e^{i gamma B t} ]

= (ħ/4) * 2 cos(gamma B t )

= (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t )

Wait, but wait. The problem says that mu = gamma S_z. Wait, but earlier I thought that mu is proportional to S_z, but perhaps I should correct that.

Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, so the Hamiltonian when the field is along Y would be H = - mu · B.

So B is along Y, so H = - mu · B = - (gamma S_z) B_y.

Since B is along Y, B_y = B, and S_z and B are perpendicular, so their dot product would be zero. Wait, that can't be right because that would make the Hamiltonian zero, which would mean no time evolution. But that contradicts the problem statement which says that the average z-component of the moment starts oscillating.

So perhaps I got the magnetic moment wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, the vector, not just the z-component.

Wait, but the problem says mu = gamma S_z. So, perhaps the Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B = - (gamma S_z) (B_y) because B is along Y. But since S_z and B_y are perpendicular, the dot product is zero. Which would imply no interaction, so no time evolution. Hmm, that's a problem because the question says the average oscillates.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma S, not just the z-component. So mu is a vector, and when the field is along Y, the interaction energy is H = - mu · B = - gamma S · B.

Because B is along Y, this becomes H = - gamma B S_y.

That makes more sense.

So, in this case, the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z.

When H becomes -gamma B S_y, the state |+z> is not an eigenstate of H, so it evolves over time.

So the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

The energies are E_+ = (-gamma B)(ħ/2),

E_- = (-gamma B)(-ħ/2) = gamma B ħ/2.

Wait, no: H = - gamma B S_y.

S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, so H's eigenvalues are E = - gamma B (± ħ/2).

So E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2), E_- = + gamma B (ħ/2).

So the energy difference between the two states is E_- - E_+ = gamma B ħ.

So the oscillation frequency in the expectation value would be proportional to (E_- - E_+)/ ħ = gamma B.

Wait, but let's compute the expectation value of S_z again.

The state |ψ(t)> is:

( e^{-i E_+ t / ħ} |+y> + e^{-i E_- t / ħ} |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

The expectation value of S_z is:

(1/2) [ e^{i E_+ t} < +y | S_z | +y > e^{-i E_+ t} 

+ e^{i E_+ t} < +y | S_z | -y > e^{-i E_- t} 

+ e^{i E_- t} < -y | S_z | +y > e^{-i E_+ t} 

+ e^{i E_- t} < -y | S_z | -y > e^{-i E_- t} ]

As before, most terms are zero except the cross terms:

So,

= (1/2) [ e^{i E_+ t} (0) e^{-i E_+ t} 

+ e^{i E_+ t} (ħ/2) e^{-i E_- t}

+ e^{i E_- t} (ħ/2) e^{-i E_+ t}

+ e^{i E_- t} (0) e^{-i E_- t} ]

= (1/2) [ (ħ/2) e^{i E_+ t} e^{-i E_- t} + (ħ/2) e^{i E_- t} e^{-i E_+ t} ]

Factor out (ħ/2):

= (ħ/4) [ e^{i (E_+ - E_-) t} + e^{i (E_- - E_+) t} ]

= (ħ/4) [ 2 cos( (E_- - E_+) t / ħ ) ]

Wait, because (E_+ - E_-) = (-gamma B ħ/2) - (gamma B ħ/2) ) = - gamma B ħ.

So,

= (ħ/4) * 2 cos( (gamma B ħ) t / ħ )

= (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

So, the expectation value <S_z> oscillates with frequency gamma B.

But wait, the problem says mu = gamma S_z. So if mu is along the z-direction, and the field is along Y, then mu · B would be zero. That can't be, because then there would be no Hamiltonian, and the state wouldn't change. So I must have made a mistake in the initial assumption about mu.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that mu = gamma S, the vector, but aligned along the field direction. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps the magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma S, and the field is along Y, making the Hamiltonian H = -gamma B S_y.

In that case, the analysis above holds, and the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the average z-component of the moment oscillates with frequency gamma B.

But wait, the options given are:

A) gamma*B/2

B) gamma*B

C) sqrt(2)*gamma*B

D) gamma*B/sqrt(2)

So according to our calculation, the frequency is gamma B, which is option B.

But wait, wait. Let me double-check the time evolution.

The time dependence in the exponentials came from the energy differences. The energy difference between E_- and E_+ is (gamma B ħ/2) - ( - gamma B ħ/2 ) ) = gamma B ħ.

So the oscillation frequency is (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which matches option B.

So the correct answer would be option B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to point along the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian changes to $H = -\gamma B S_y$. The task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  
   The initial state is $|+z\rangle$, the eigenstate of $S_z$. When the magnetic field is switched to the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\gamma B S_y$. The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\pm \hbar/2$. Thus, the energy eigenvalues of $H$ are $E_+ = -\gamma B (\hbar/2)$ and $E_- = \gamma B (\hbar/2)$.

2. **Time Evolution**:  
   The initial state $|+z\rangle$ can be expressed as a superposition of the eigenstates of $H$:  
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle).
   \]  
   Under time evolution, the state becomes:  
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(e^{-iE_+t/\hbar}|+y\rangle + e^{-iE_-t/\hbar}|-y\rangle\right).
   \]

3. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  
   The expectation value of $S_z$ is given by:  
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \langle \psi(t) | S_z | \psi(t) \rangle.
   \]  
   Substituting the expressions for $|\psi(t)\rangle$ and $S_z$ in the $|+y\rangle, |-y\rangle$ basis, the cross terms dominate, leading to:  
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]  
   This shows that the average $z$-component of the magnetic moment oscillates with a frequency proportional to $\gamma B$.

4. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   The oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference between the two eigenstates of $H$:  
   \[
   \Delta E = E_- - E_+ = \gamma B \hbar.
   \]  
   Dividing by $\hbar$, the oscillation frequency is:  
   \[
   f = \frac{\Delta E}{\hbar} = \gamma B.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment is $\gamma B$. This corresponds to option **B**.

**Answer: B**
