Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these NMR problems. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, and O is 1. So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-9-1+1)/2 = 7/2 =3.5? Wait, no, wait. Wait, maybe I did the formula wrong. I think the correct formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Oh wait, wait, no, maybe it's (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2? Let me double-check. Yeah, for each X (halogen), it's considered as a -1 in valence, but in degree of unsaturation, each X contributes as 0.5. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's stick to the standard formula: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. So, for C8H9NO, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1 (but O doesn't count in this formula). X is zero here. So, substituting in: (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 → (18-9 +1)/2 → (10)/2 =5. So DoU is 5. That could mean maybe a ring and some double bonds. 5 is a lot, so perhaps a benzene ring (which is 3 DoU) plus two double bonds, or a ring and an aromatic ring with some substituents.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H-NMR (ppm):
9.72 (t, 1H) → A triplet around 9.7, which is upfield but for an aromatic proton? Wait, no, 9.7 is more like an aldehyde proton. Aldehyde protons typically appear around 9-10 ppm as a singlet, but here it's a triplet. Hmm, maybe it's something else. Or perhaps it's an acidic proton, like an -OH, but that's usually broader. Wait, but aldehyde is a strong deshielded proton. So maybe the triplet is part of an aldehyde group coupled with something else. Or maybe it's a vinylogous proton... not sure yet.

6.98 (d, 2H) → A doublet, likely aromatic protons. Maybe in a para-substituted benzene ring? Or perhaps in a meta position with coupling.

6.51 (d, 2H) → Another doublet, maybe adjacent to the first set. So perhaps two doublets of 2H each: maybe a para-substituted ring with coupling between adjacent protons? Or maybe a substituent in the ortho position.

6.27 (bs, 2H) → Broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests maybe an -OH group, but 2H? That's a bit confusing because -OH is usually a singlet, but maybe it's two -OH groups? Or maybe it's a conjugated diene or a vinyl group. Wait, but 6.27 is a bit low for vinyl; usually vinyl protons are around 5-6 ppm.

3.66 (d, 2H) → A doublet, 2H. That's probably a CH2 group attached to something electronegative, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group or part of an ether.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has a benzene ring with substituents, maybe a substituent with an aldehyde group, and an OCH2 group.

Wait, let's think about the reagents. The reaction steps are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl → This is typically used for diazotization. So the starting compound must have an aromatic amine, like an aniline. Because diazotization usually occurs with aryl amines under cold conditions (like 0-5°C).

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. If the starting material has an amine group (NH2), then after diazotization, it would form a diazonium salt. Then, when treated with H2O (second step), perhaps it undergoes hydrolysis, like a Sandmeyer reaction, but without Cu, maybe it's just a simple decomposition. Diazonium salts can undergo various reactions upon heating or other conditions.

Wait, the second step is H2O. So maybe the diazonium salt is hydrolyzed. Let me recall: Diazonium salts can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. Under acidic conditions, they typically form nitro compounds or phenols, depending on the substituents. Alternatively, in aqueous conditions, perhaps it's a simple decomposition to form a phenol.

Wait, but the third step is aqueous KOH and heat. That sounds like a hydrolysis reaction, maybe a saponification or elimination. Alternatively, it could be a Hofmann elimination or some kind of elimination reaction, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, let's think about the structure based on the NMR.

The strong singlet at 9.72 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton. But wait, it's a triplet. Hmm, maybe something else. Let me think: An aldehyde proton is usually a singlet because it's attached to a carbonyl which doesn't have adjacent protons. So a triplet might suggest coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, maybe it's part of a conjugated system, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde. The aldehyde proton could be coupling with the adjacent vinyl protons, which is possible. For example, in cinnamaldehyde, the aldehyde proton is a singlet, but maybe in some other arrangement, it could be a triplet.

Looking at the other peaks:

The 6.98 and 6.51 doublets each have 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents in the ortho positions. Wait, or maybe a ring with two substituents, and the protons are in positions that couple with adjacent protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene where the two doublets are from two sets of equivalent protons.

Wait, another possibility is that the molecule has two aromatic rings attached. For example, if it's a diphenyl compound, each ring having their own protons. But let me look at the integration: the aromatic signals are 2H each except for the 6.27 which is 2H as a broad singlet. Hmm.

Wait, let's try to assemble the structure. Suppose we have a benzene ring with substituents. Let's say at position 4 (para) there's a substituent, and maybe another substituent at position 2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is something like 4-(aminophenyl)butanal. But wait, the molecular formula has an N, so that's possible.

Wait, the NMR shows peaks at 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d,2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because the two doublets each have 2H and are coupled. So if you have a para-substituted ring, the two adjacent protons would each be doublets. For example, if you have a substituent at position 4, then the adjacent positions (3 and 5) would have protons that are deshielded and split as doublets.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like 4-(substituted)phenyl with another substituent. Let me think about the substituents. We have an aldehyde group, as indicated by the 9.72 ppm triplet. Then, the 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H suggests an OCH2 group. Like an ether or an ester. OCH2 would appear around 3-4 ppm, so that fits.

Putting this together. Maybe the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative. Like, perhaps, 4-(something)phenylbutanal or something similar.

Wait, maybe the structure is a diphenyl compound. For example, two benzene rings connected by a chain that includes an aldehyde and an OCH2 group.

Alternatively, maybe the starting compound has an aniline group (since we're adding NaNO2 and HCl, which is for diazotization). So the starting material has an amino group attached to a benzene ring, perhaps something like 4-aminobenzaldehyde with some substituents.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So let's count the atoms. Let's see: Benzene rings are C6H5, so if we have two benzene rings, that's 12 C, but the formula is C8, so maybe one benzene ring and another substituent with 2 C's. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe two benzene rings connected via a chain. For example, a diphenyl compound with a chain like CH2-O-CH2 or something.

Wait, the NMR has a triplet at 9.72, which I'm still not entirely sure about. Alternative thought: Maybe it's not an aldehyde. Another possibility for a triplet around 9.7 ppm is an acidic proton, like maybe a phenol, but that's usually broader. Or perhaps it's an enol proton, but that's more around 5-6 ppm. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde with some substituents. Because we have an O in the formula, which could be from a phenol group. So, if the starting material is 4-aminobenzaldehyde, then after diazotization and hydrolysis, the amine group would become a hydroxyl group.

Wait, let me think about the reaction steps again. The first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl, which is for diazotization. That's typically done with an aromatic amine, like aniline, under cold conditions. Then, the second step is H2O, which might be a hydrolysis step where the diazonium salt is decomposed. For example, in the presence of water, especially under acidic conditions, the diazonium salt can undergo hydrolysis to form a phenol. So the amino group (NH2) would become a hydroxyl group (OH).

Wait, but the third step is aqueous KOH and heat. That sounds like a saponification or perhaps elimination. Wait, but if we have a diazonium salt, maybe it's undergoing a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps after the hydrolysis, the compound undergoes some elimination or substitution.

Let me try to piece it all together. The starting compound has an aromatic amine (NH2), which is converted to a diazonium salt. Then, in aqueous conditions, perhaps it's hydrolyzed to a phenol group. So, the NH2 becomes OH.

But wait, the starting NMR includes a peak at 9.72, which is possibly an aldehyde. So the starting compound might have both an NH2 and an aldehyde group. Thus, the structure could be something like 4-aminobenzaldehyde with another substituent.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Adding an amino group would make it C7H7NO. But our starting formula is C8H9NO, which is one carbon and two hydrogens more. Hmm, perhaps another substituent.

Wait, maybe the structure is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a substituent that adds one carbon and two hydrogens. So perhaps a CH2 group attached somewhere. Looking at the NMR, we have a 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H, which suggests an OCH2 group. So perhaps the starting material is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a methylene group attached via an oxygen.

Wait, so maybe the structure is something like 4-aminophenyl acetaldehyde? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a CH2-O- group attached.

Wait, perhaps it's 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a CH2-O-CH2- group, but that would require more carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm not thinking correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 4-aminobenzyl aldehyde. Wait, benzyl aldehyde is Ph-CH2-CHO. But that would be C8H8O. Our formula is C8H9NO, which is more by one N and one O. Wait, but wait, 4-aminobenzyl aldehyde would be Ph-CH2-CHO with NH2 on the benzene. So C8H8N O, but our starting formula is C8H9NO. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like 4-amino-2-phenylpropanal? Not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let me look at the options.

Options are all aliphatic aldehydes with substituents, mostly phenyl groups.

Option A: 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal. Structure: Ph-CH2-CH=CH-CHO.

Option B: 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal. Structure: Ph(OH)-CH2-CH=CH-CHO, but with the substituents on the butenyl chain.

Option C: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. So, the aldehyde is at position 4, with two hydroxyphenyl groups and a hydroxyl group on the butanal chain.

Option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. Structure: Ph(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH=CHO.

Wait, but wait, the starting material has an -NH2 group? Because the first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl, which suggests an aromatic amine.

So the starting compound is likely a di-substituted benzene with an amino group and another substituent, like an aldehyde.

But the options don't directly show this. Wait, but the reactions would change the amine into a hydroxyl group.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminobenzaldehyde, but with another substituent, like a CH2-O-R group.

Hmm, but the NMR shows a doublet at 3.66 ppm for 2H. That's probably an OCH2 group. So maybe the starting material is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a CH2-O-R group attached. Or perhaps it's a benzaldehyde with a substituent that includes a CH2-O-.

Wait, maybe the starting structure is something like 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a CH2-O-CH2 group attached, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diphenyl compound with an aldehyde and an amine group. But that seems a bit complicated.

Another approach: Let's think about the NMR data. The triplet at 9.72 ppm (1H) could be an aldehyde proton. The 6.98 and 6.51 doublets each have 2H, which suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. The 6.27 (bs, 2H) might be two protons from a vinyl group or a di-substituted aromatic ring with substituents causing them to couple.

Wait, perhaps the 6.27 is a conjugated diene or an allylic system. The 3.66 (d, 2H) could be an OCH2 group attached to something, like an ether.

Putting it together, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with substituents that include a CH2-O- group and another benzene ring.

Wait, maybe the starting compound is 4-(aminophenyl)-3-butenal. But with the OCH2 group? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting structure is 4-aminobenzyl aldehyde with a substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a substituent that includes a CH2-O-CH2- group attached to the benzene ring. But I'm not getting a clear picture.

Alternatively, let's think about the reagents again. The first step is diazotization, which converts the amine to a diazonium salt. Then, in the second step, the diazonium salt is hydrolyzed with water. Diazonium salts can undergo hydrolysis to form phenols, especially under acidic conditions. Then the third step is aqueous KOH and heat, which could be a hydrolysis of an ester or elimination.

Wait, but if the starting material has an ester group, the KOH would saponify it. But the third step is after the diazonium salt hydrolysis, so perhaps the structure after step two is a phenol with some other functional groups.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try mapping the reaction steps.

Suppose the starting compound is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a substituent that includes an OCH2 group. Let's say it's something like 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a CH2-O-R group attached, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a CH2OCH3 group. But that would make the OCH3 appear around 3.3 ppm as a triplet, but the NMR shows 3.66 d (2H), which would be more like a CH2 attached to O, perhaps part of an ether or ester.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde. So, Ph-CH2-CHO with an NH2 group on the benzene. Then, the OCH2 group might come from another substituent, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminophenylpropenal, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: The NMR shows a triplet at 9.72 ppm. That's a very strong shift, so probably an aldehyde proton. The triplet suggests coupling with two other protons. So perhaps the aldehyde is conjugated to a CH2 group. For example, R-CH2-CHO. The aldehyde proton would be next to the CH2, which has two protons. Hence, the aldehyde proton would be a triplet due to coupling with the two CH2 protons. That makes sense. So, the aldehyde is at the end of a CH2 group, which is attached to something else.

Looking at the NMR data, the 3.66 ppm doublet of 2H would then be the CH2 group adjacent to the aldehyde. So, perhaps the structure is R-CH2-CHO, where R is a benzene ring with substituents.

So, the structure would be something like Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO. But wait, that's a two-carbon chain, but the triplet at 9.72 would be the aldehyde proton, which is coupled to the two protons on the adjacent CH2. So, that would be a triplet. Yes, that fits.

But then, where does the other substituents come in? The aromatic part must account for the other signals.

So, the benzene ring would have substituents, perhaps in the para position. Let's say the benzene has an NH2 group and a CH2-CHO group. Because the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count: Benzene is 6C, NH2 is 1N, CH2-CHO is 3C (CH2-CHO is 2C in the chain: CH2-CHO is actually CH2CHO, which is 3 carbons, but in this case, the chain is CH2-CHO, which is two carbons. Wait, perhaps it's better to count the formula.

If the structure is Ph-CH2-CHO with an NH2 on the benzene, then:

Ph is C6H5, CH2-CHO is CH2CHO (which is 3 atoms: CH2 and CHO. So, the molecule would be C6H5-CH2-CHO with an NH2 on the benzene.

Wait, but that would be C6H5: that's 6C, CH2CHO is 3C (CH2 and CHO), but wait, CHO is an aldehyde group, which is one C. So, the benzene is 6C, CH2 is 2C, CHO is 1C? No, wait, the structure is benzene ring (6C) connected to a CH2 group (2C) and then a CHO (1C), but that would be 6+2+1=9C, but the formula is C8H9NO. So, that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. So, 8 carbons.

If the structure is benzaldehyde (C7H6O) plus an NH2 group, that would make it C7H7NO, but we have C8H9NO. So, we need an extra carbon. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a methyl group attached. But that would make the formula C8H8NO, but our formula is C8H9NO, which is one more H. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a CH2O group attached. Like a methoxy group. So, the formula would be C8H7NO2, but the given formula is C8H9NO. So that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me think about the reaction steps and their implications.

1. Diazotization: Converts an aromatic amine (-NH2) to a diazonium salt (-N2+ Cl-).

2. Hydrolysis with water: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed. For example, in acidic conditions, it forms a nitro compound, but in aqueous conditions, especially under heat, it might form a phenol.

3. Aqueous KOH and heat: This is likely a strong base and heat, which might cause elimination or hydrolysis of certain groups, like esters or nitriles. Alternatively, it could be a Hofmann elimination if there's a quaternary ammonium salt, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps after the hydrolysis, the diazonium salt becomes a phenol group. So, the starting material's amino group becomes a hydroxyl group.

So, the starting material has an NH2 group which becomes an OH after the first two steps.

But what's the overall transformation? Let's say the starting material is a diphenyl compound with an amine and an aldehyde. After treatment, the amine becomes a hydroxyl group.

So, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with another substituent, and after the reactions, the NH2 becomes OH, and other groups are modified.

Wait, but the options given are all aldehydes with phenyl groups. So the aldehyde group remains, but the amino group becomes hydroxyl.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. So, the structure would have a phenyl ring with a hydroxyl group at position 4, and a but-3-enal group attached.

But how does that come from the starting material?

Maybe the starting material is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a CH2-CH2-CHO group attached. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde with an amino group and a vinyl group.

Wait, maybe the starting structure is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a CH2-CH2-CHO substituent on the benzene. So, after the reactions, the NH2 becomes OH, and the CH2-CH2-CHO becomes CH2-CHO, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a substituent that includes a vinyl group, like CH2=CH-CHO.

Wait, perhaps the starting structure is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a CH2=CH2 group attached. But that doesn't add up.

I think I'm not making progress here. Let me think about the NMR again.

The triplet at 9.72 ppm (1H) suggests an aldehyde proton coupled to two neighboring protons. So, the aldehyde is part of a CH2-CHO group. So, the structure would have R-CH2-CHO, where R is some group that gives the other NMR signals.

The aromatic signals: 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d,2H) → likely a para-substituted benzene with two substituents causing the coupling. The 6.27 (bs, 2H) could be a vinyl group, perhaps part of a conjugated system.

So, maybe the structure is something like Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's Ph-CH2-CH=CHO.

Wait, if the aldehyde is conjugated to a double bond, like in cinnamaldehyde, the aldehyde proton would be a singlet because it's not adjacent to other protons. But in our case, the aldehyde is a triplet, which suggests it is adjacent to two protons, so perhaps it's R-CH2-CHO.

So, putting this together, the structure might be Ph-CH2-CHO, where the benzene has substituents. But the NMR has more aromatic signals, so perhaps the benzene has other substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzene is connected to a chain that includes an aldehyde and a substituent with an OCH2 group.

Wait, looking at the 3.66 ppm doublet of 2H, that's probably an OCH2 group. So, perhaps the structure is Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO. But that would mean the benzene is connected via an oxygen, making it a phenyl ether. But then the aldehyde is at the end.

But the starting material's formula is C8H9NO. Let's see: Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO would be C6H5-O-CH2-CH2-CHO. That's 6 (Ph) + 3 (O, CH2, CH2, CHO) → wait, the formula would be C10H10O2, which is way more than C8. So that can't be right.

Hmm. Maybe the OCH2 is part of an ester group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's consider the degrees of unsaturation again, which is 5. That can be achieved by a benzene ring (3 DoU), a double bond (1 DoU), and perhaps an aldehyde group (which is a double bond as well, but maybe it's already accounted for).

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a benzene ring (3 DoU), an aldehyde (1 DoU), and another double bond (1 DoU), totaling 5. So, maybe there's a conjugated system.

Putting it all together, perhaps the starting structure is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a double bond somewhere else.

Wait, but the reaction steps: after diazotization and hydrolysis, the NH2 becomes OH. Then, the third step is KOH and heat, which might cause elimination if there's a suitable leaving group or a β-hydroxy group.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has an ester group which, under basic conditions, undergoes saponification, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a nitro group which is reduced, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the starting structure is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a vinyl group attached. So, something like Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but with an NH2 on the benzene. Then, after the reactions, the NH2 becomes OH, and perhaps the CH2 groups are modified.

But the NMR shows a 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H, which would be a CH2 group attached to something else, perhaps an oxygen.

Alternatively, maybe the starting structure is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a substituent that includes an OCH2 group attached to another benzene ring. So, perhaps diphenyl ether with an aldehyde group. But I'm not certain.

I think I'm stuck, so perhaps I should think about the options and see which one fits the NMR data and the reaction steps.

Option A: 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal → Structure: Ph-CH2-CH=CH-CHO. The NMR would have aromatic protons from two benzene rings. Let's see: Each benzene would have protons, but in this structure, each benzene is attached to a CH2 or CH group. The aldehyde proton would be at the end, maybe as a triplet if coupled with the CH.

Option B: 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal → Structure: Ph(OH)-CH2-CH=CH-CHO. The aldehyde would be a triplet if coupled with the adjacent CH2. The aromatic protons would be from two 4-hydroxyphenyl groups.

Option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal → Structure: Ph(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH=CHO.

But the starting material would have an NH2 group, which after reaction becomes OH.

Wait, the starting material is likely to have an NH2 group, which is then converted to OH.

Looking at the reaction steps, the first step converts NH2 to N2+Cl-, then step 2 hydrolyzes it to OH. So, the final product would have an OH group where the NH2 was.

So, the starting material's NH2 would become OH in the product.

Now, considering the options, which one has an OH group attached to a benzene ring?

Options B and C have OH groups. Option D has a phenol group (PhOH). Option A doesn't have an OH; it's just two phenyl groups.

So, the starting material's NH2 is on a benzene ring, which after reaction becomes OH on that ring. So, the product would have a phenol group.

Looking at the options:

Option B: 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal → two phenol groups.

Option C: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal → two phenol groups and another OH.

Option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal → one phenol group.

So, which one is more likely?

The starting material's NMR shows aromatic protons. If the starting material has a para-substituted benzene ring with NH2 and another substituent, after reaction, it would become a para-hydroxyphenyl group.

Looking back at the NMR of the starting material:

The aromatic signals are 6.98 (d,2H) and 6.51 (d,2H), which suggests a para-substituted benzene with two sets of equivalent protons. So, the starting material's benzene would have substituents in para positions, making the adjacent protons as d (each 2H). So, perhaps the starting material has a benzene ring with NH2 and another substituent in para positions.

After reaction, the NH2 becomes OH, so the product would have a 4-hydroxyphenyl group.

Looking at the options, option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. So the phenyl group is attached to the butenyl chain at position 4, and has a hydroxyl group in the para position.

But how would the NMR look for the product?

The product would have an aldehyde group, which in option D is part of the butenyl group. The aldehyde proton would be around 9.72 ppm, perhaps as a triplet if coupled with adjacent protons.

The 4-hydroxyphenyl group would have aromatic protons. The 4-hydroxyphenyl group typically has protons at around 6.8-7 ppm, perhaps as a doublet for the two ortho protons.

But the starting material's NMR has 6.98 (d,2H) and 6.51 (d,2H), which suggests a para-substituted benzene. So, the product would have a 4-hydroxyphenyl group attached to the chain.

In option D, the structure is Ph(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH=CHO. The aldehyde is at the end, and the phenyl is at position 4.

But wait, the 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal would be Ph(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH=CHO. Wait, no, but-3-enal would be CH2=CH-CHO as part of the chain.

Wait, let me correct that. But-3-enal would be CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because but has four carbons. So but-3-enal would be CH2=CH-CH2-CHO.

Wait, no, but-3-enal: the aldehyde is at position 1, double bond between 3 and 4. Wait, but but has four carbons, so but-3-enal would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, that's not possible. Wait, but-3-enal would have a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. So, structure: CH2-CH2-CH2-CHO. No, that's not correct. Alternatively, but-3-enal would have the structure CH2=CH-CH2-CHO, but that's but-3-enal? Wait, the numbering would be 1 (CHO), 2, 3, 4. So the double bond is between 3 and 4: CH2-CH2-CH2-CHO → but that's a single bond. Wait, no, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH2-CHO, which would be but-3-enal. Wait, but that's actually but-2-enal, because the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: Aldehydes are numbered starting from the aldehyde group as position 1. So but-3-enal would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CHO, but that doesn't have a double bond. Hmm, maybe I'm not on the right track.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure in option D is Ph(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH=CHO. So, the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, making it but-3-enal. But that structure would have the aldehyde at position 4. Wait, but that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph(OH)-CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond somewhere else. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Another approach: Let's think about the reaction steps leading to the product.

The starting material has an aromatic amine. After diazotization and hydrolysis, it becomes a phenol. Then, under aqueous KOH and heat, perhaps an elimination occurs, forming a double bond.

So, if the starting material is something like 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a CH2-O-R group, the hydrolysis would convert the amine to OH, and the KOH might eliminate a group, forming a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a CH2-O-CH2-CHO group. No, that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a CH2-CH2-CHO group, and the KOH step causes elimination, forming a double bond.

Wait, let me think. Suppose the starting material is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a CH2-CH2-CHO group, making the structure Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO with an NH2 on the benzene. After diazotization and hydrolysis, the NH2 becomes OH, giving Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO with OH on the benzene. Then, in KOH and heat, perhaps the CH2-CH2-CHO group undergoes elimination, forming a double bond and losing a water molecule, resulting in Ph-CH2-CH=CHO.

Wait, but that would require the presence of a β-hydroxy group, which isn't present. Alternatively, maybe the KOH step is a simple elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a nitro group, but I don't think so because the reagent is NaNO2 and HCl, which is for diazotization of amines.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with a substituent that includes a hydroxyl group, which after reaction becomes something else. But I'm not sure.

At this point, perhaps the best approach is to match the options with the NMR data.

Looking at option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. Its structure would be Ph(OH)-CH2-CH=CH-CHO. Wait, no, but-3-enal would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4, so the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH=CHO. No, but I think I'm not getting the structure right.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is Ph(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH=CHO. Wait, but that would be but-3-enal.

The aldehyde proton in option D would be at the end of the chain, so it's a triplet if coupled with two adjacent protons (like in CH2). So, if the aldehyde is at position 4, the structure would be Ph(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CHO, which doesn't have a double bond. But option D says but-3-enal, so there's a double bond between C3 and C4.

Wait, but but-3-enal would have the structure: CH2-CH2-CH=CHO. That can't be, as butenals have four carbons. Let me correct: but-3-enal would be CH2=CH-CH2-CHO. So, the double bond is between C2 and C3, making it but-2-enal. Wait, that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps but-3-enal isn't a standard name, but regardless, the important point is whether the aldehyde proton is a triplet, as in the NMR.

In any case, the aldehyde at the end of a chain would be a triplet if adjacent to a CH2 group. So, the product after reaction would have that.

The aromatic protons in option D would be from the 4-hydroxyphenyl group. The H NMR of 4-hydroxyphenyl has protons typically at around 6.8-7 ppm, as doublets because of the para substitution.

In the starting material's NMR, the aromatic protons are 6.98 (d,2H) and 6.51 (d,2H), which fits a para-substituted benzene. So, after reaction, the product would have a 4-hydroxyphenyl group, which would have protons around 6.8-7 ppm.

Looking at option D's structure: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. The aromatic protons would be in the 6.8-7 range, perhaps as doublets. The aldehyde proton would be a triplet around 9.7 ppm, which matches the starting NMR. The 3.66 ppm doublet would be for any remaining CH2 groups, but I'm not sure where that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the 3.66 ppm is from a CH2 group in the chain, like CH2-CHO.

In any case, given the reaction steps and the NMR data, I think the correct answer is option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.


The compound has the molecular formula **C8H9NO**, with a degree of unsaturation (DoU) of 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (3 DoU), an aldehyde group (1 DoU), and possibly a double bond (1 DoU). The **1H-NMR data** provides the following key information:

- **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** A triplet, likely an aldehyde proton (CHO) coupled to two adjacent protons.
- **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets, each integrating to 2H, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet, possibly from a vinyl proton or a conjugated system.
- **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet, likely from a CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom (e.g., oxygen).

The reaction sequence involves:
1. **NaNO2 + HCl:** Diazotization of an aromatic amine (-NH2) to form a diazonium salt.
2. **H2O:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol (-OH).
3. **Aqueous KOH, Heat:** Likely causes elimination or rearrangement, forming a double bond.

The starting material is inferred to have an **aromatic amine** and an **aldehyde group**, with additional substituents consistent with the molecular formula and NMR data. After the reaction sequence, the amine group is converted to a hydroxyl group, and the aldehyde group remains intact.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal):** This structure lacks a hydroxyl group, which is inconsistent with the reaction sequence converting an amine to a hydroxyl group.
- **Option B (2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal):** This structure has two hydroxyl groups, but the NMR data does not support the presence of two para-substituted benzene rings.
- **Option C (3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal):** This structure also has two hydroxyl groups, which is inconsistent with the NMR data.
- **Option D (4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal):** This structure has a single hydroxyl group on a para-substituted benzene ring, consistent with the reaction sequence. The aldehyde proton (9.72 ppm, triplet) and the aromatic protons (6.98 ppm and 6.51 ppm, doublets) match the NMR data.

### Conclusion:
The reaction sequence converts the aromatic amine to a hydroxyl group, and the NMR data aligns with **Option D (4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal)**. This structure has a para-substituted benzene ring with a hydroxyl group, an aldehyde group, and a double bond in the chain.
