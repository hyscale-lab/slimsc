Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about an NMR and LC-MS analysis of a synthesized compound. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step.

The question says the 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound looks mostly like what's expected, except there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar shifts and integrate to 1H together. So, they're probably not splitting each other because the coupling is ruled out. Also, in the LC-MS analysis, there are two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. Interesting.

Wait, so the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. Since coupling is ruled out, maybe it's something else causing the splitting. One possibility I've heard of is if the compound is a mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so each would have the same physical properties except in chiral environments. But wait, would that cause two separate peaks in NMR? Because for each enantiomer, the environment is the same, so the chemical shift should be identical. Oh wait, but if the compound is a racemic mixture, the NMR usually shows a single peak because the environments for each enantiomer are identical. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, what if the compound is a mixture of diastereomers? Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different peaks. But wait, the question says the NMR integrates to 1H together, and the shifts are similar. If it's diastereomers, then each would have their own set of peaks. But in this case, each diastereomer might split the same alpha-proton differently, leading to two separate peaks. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Looking back at the options. Option B is enantiomers, D is diastereomers. So, the NMR would show a single peak if it's enantiomers because the chemical environment is same. But if it's diastereomers, the same proton might have different shifts in each isomer, leading to two separate peaks. So that's a possibility.

But wait, the question says the two peaks have similar chemical shifts. Enantiomers would have the same shift, but diastereomers could have similar but not exactly the same shifts. But the problem states that the integrals together add to 1H, which suggests each peak is 0.5H. So perhaps each isomer has one of the two alpha protons.

Wait, but no. The same alpha-proton. So in each isomer, the same proton is present. Hmm, that's confusing. So why would the same proton split into two? Unless the proton's environment is different in each isomer.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the compound is a racemic mixture, but the NMR is showing both enantiomers. But usually, in NMR, racemic mixtures don't split peaks because the environments are the same. Unless, for some reason, the coupling is happening. But the question rules out coupling. So maybe not.

What about the LC-MS part. The LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass, same intensity. So each peak is the same molecule? Or different molecules with same mass?

Wait, but same mass and same intensity? So, two different compounds with same molecular formula but different structures. So, same molecular weight, so same mass in LC-MS. The same mass could mean same molecular formula, but different structures. So, perhaps the compound is a mixture of diastereomers. Because diastereomers have same molecular weight, different properties, so could elute at different times on LC and give two peaks.

So, putting it together: the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton, but the shifts are similar. The LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass. So, the compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers. Because diastereomers have same molecular weight but different physical properties (like NMR shifts), so their peaks would split.

Other options: Option A is a precursor. If it was a precursor, the mass would be different. But the mass is same as expected, so it's probably not a precursor. So that leaves D as the likely answer. What about option C, 'double coupling' during amide bond formation? I'm not too familiar with that. Maybe if during the reaction, another bond formed which caused some coupling, but the question says coupling is ruled out, so probably not.

So, the most likely is D, a mixture of diastereoisomers.


The question involves analyzing the NMR and LC-MS data of a chemically synthesized compound. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals (together integrating to 1H). Coupling is ruled out as the cause of the duplicate peaks. The LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity, both with the same mass spectrum consistent with the expected molecule.

To evaluate the options:

- **Option A (Contamination with a precursor):** A precursor would have a different molecular weight, leading to a distinct mass in LC-MS. Since the LC-MS shows the same mass as the expected molecule, this is unlikely.

- **Option B (Mixture of enantiomers):** Enantiomers have identical physical properties, so their NMR peaks would overlap, and the LC-MS would show a single peak. This does not match the observations of two distinct peaks in NMR and LC-MS.

- **Option C ('Double coupling' during amide-bond formation):** The question explicitly rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause of the duplicate peaks, making this explanation unlikely.

- **Option D (Mixture of diastereoisomers):** Diastereoisomers have different physical properties, including NMR chemical shifts, and can elute at different times in LC-MS. The two peaks in NMR could arise from the same alpha-proton in different diastereomeric environments, while the LC-MS peaks correspond to the two diastereomers with the same molecular weight. This explanation aligns with the observations.

Given the data and reasoning, the most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.

Answer: D
