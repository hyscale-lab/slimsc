Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation reactions, especially in aromatic chemistry. 

Wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-dâ€”I think this is a notation I'm not too familiar with. Oh wait, maybe it's a typo? Like, it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene or something like that. Oh wait, no. Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? No, wait, the question says 2-d. Maybe it's a substituent, like a deuterium or something else? Hmm, wait another thought. Oh, wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d could be 1-bromo-2-(dimethylamino)benzene? Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. Oh, I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the "d" stands for something else, like a substituent. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring with a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2? Or maybe an amino group? Wait, I'm not getting it. Let me think again. 

Wait, perhaps the structure is benzene with a bromine in position 1 and a methyl group in position 2? No, because the 'd' is
