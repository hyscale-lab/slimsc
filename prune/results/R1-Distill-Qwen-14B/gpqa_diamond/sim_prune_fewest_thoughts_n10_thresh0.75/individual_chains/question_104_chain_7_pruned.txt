Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two stars with the same mass as each other and similar to our Sun. Each star has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

The key data points given are the shifts in the spectral lines. For Planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for Planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift relates to the star's velocity towards and away from us. The formula I think is something like velocity semi-amplitude K equals ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) )) ) * (1/( (P * (24*3600)^2 )^(1/3) )) ) ) but wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, the RV method equation, right. The semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) / (P * (2Ï€/G)^(1/3) )

Wait, that might not be right. Alternatively, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:

K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K relates to the mass of the planet, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the inclination angle i. But since we're comparing two planets, perhaps some terms can be canceled out.

Wait, maybe
