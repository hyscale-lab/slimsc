Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details right. 

The question is about finding the probability of getting specific outcomes for measurements of two observables, P and Q, made in sequence. The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait—hold on, column matrices are usually vectors, so this is a 3x1 vector since there are three elements. 

The operators for P and Q are given as 3x3 matrices. Let me write them out as I understand them.

Operator P has the matrix:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Operator Q has the matrix:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

So the problem is: if we measure P first and then measure Q, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Hmm. Wait, no. The question says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P"—so the order is measure P first, then Q. But the probabilities are for getting 0 in P and -1 in Q. So, we need the joint probability of these two outcomes in that order.

Wait, but when you measure P, the system collapses into an eigenstate of P, right? Then when you measure Q, it's the state after the collapse due to P's measurement. So the process is:

1. Measure P, get outcome 0. The state collapses to the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.
2. Then, measure Q on this new state, and find the probability of getting -1.

Wait, but the system's initial state is given. We have to find the probability that P is 0, then Q is -1.

Alternatively, perhaps it's more accurate to think about the process as the state first being projected onto the eigenspace of P for eigenvalue 0, then the state is in that subspace and we measure Q on it.

So the approach is:

a) Find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.
b) Project the initial state onto each of these eigenvectors. Since the state is a column vector, we can compute the inner product.
c) The probability of getting 0 in P's measurement is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of these inner products (i.e., the square of the norm of the projected state).
d) Once the state is collapsed into the eigenspace of P=0, then measure Q. The probability of getting Q=-1 is computed by projecting this new state onto the eigenvectors of Q corresponding to eigenvalue -1.

Wait, but perhaps I should do this step by step.

First, let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

Operator P matrix:
Row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Let me write it as:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

To find eigenvalues, we need to solve det(P - λ I) = 0.

So the matrix P - λ I is:

[
[-λ, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, -λ]
]

Calculating determinant:

The determinant for a 3x3 matrix can be a bit involved, but let's try.

The determinant expansion along the first row:

-λ * det( [ [-λ,
