Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem here about nuclear decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So the question is about a decay process where two nucleons of flavor A convert into two of flavor B, and emit two particles E and V. The reaction is written as 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. The important point is that the E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with some maximum value Q.

Now, there's a variant where instead of two V particles, they emit one exotic, massless particle M. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. The question is, how does the energy spectrum of E change in this variant?

I remember that in beta decay, when a nucleus emits a beta particle (electron or positron), the emitted particles have a continuous spectrum. The reason is that the decay process involves the conservation of energy and momentum, but there's a distribution because the emitted particles share the energy in various ways.

Wait, but in the original scenario, they're emitting two E and two V particles. If the E's have a continuous spectrum, that suggests that their energies vary, which probably means that the particles (maybe like electrons and antineutrinos in beta decay) share the energy released in the decay.

In the variant, it's emitting one M instead of two V. M is massless, so it's probably like a photon or a neutrino. Since it's a single particle, perhaps this changes how the energy is distributed.

In the original decay, the E particles could have a range of energies because the other emitted particles (V) carry away some energy. The maximum energy (endpoint) Q would be when all the energy goes into the E particles, but since there are other particles, the maximum possible energy for each E is less than the total Q. But wait, no, the total energy available is Q, so each E would have up to Q? Or is it split between the Es and Vs?

Wait, in a typical decay, when multiple particles are emitted, their energies are shared. For example, in alpha decay, the emitted alpha particle has a discrete energy because it's a single particle. But in beta decay, the emitted electron has a continuous spectrum because it shares energy with the antineutrino.

So in the original case, 2E and 2V are emitted. Since both E and V are particles, each pair must share the energy. So the E's would have a continuous spectrum because their energies can vary depending on how the energy is split between E and V. The endpoint is the maximum energy any E can have, which occurs when the other particles (V and others) take the minimal possible energy.

In the variant, the decay emits M, which is massless. So M would carry away energy and momentum. Since M is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum (E = pc). But how does this affect the E particles?

In the original reaction, the Es and Vs share the energy. So each E's energy would depend on the distribution of energy in the decay. In the variant, perhaps M takes a different amount of energy,
