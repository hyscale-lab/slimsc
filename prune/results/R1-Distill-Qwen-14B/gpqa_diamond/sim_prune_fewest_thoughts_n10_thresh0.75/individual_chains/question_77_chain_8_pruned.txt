Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, let's see. The question has two parts, A and B, each involving a different reaction. I need to figure out the major products for each and choose the correct option among A, B, C, or D.

Starting with part A. The reactant is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me draw the structure. So benzene ring attached to a methylene group (OCH2Ph), but wait, no. Wait, ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl benzene. So the structure is benzene connected to a CH2-O- group, and the O is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Let me break that down. The 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-C(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH=CH-CH2? No, wait, the numbering: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, no. Wait, the substituent is but-2-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH-CH2, but with a double bond. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH=CH-CH2, but wait, the substituent is on the first carbon. So the group is CH2-CH=CH-CH2- but wait, actually, the substituent would be (1-yl), so the structure is CH2-CH=CH-CH2-, but in the substituent, the double bond is between C2 and C3
