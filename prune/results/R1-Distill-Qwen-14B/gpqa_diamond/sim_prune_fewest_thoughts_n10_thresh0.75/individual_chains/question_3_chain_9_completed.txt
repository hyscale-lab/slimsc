Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again. 

The question is about a spin-half particle in a specific superposition state. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of the σz operator. The task is to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The options are A to D, each a decimal number.

Hmm, expectation values. Right, the expectation value of an operator is the average outcome if you measure that observable many times on identically prepared systems. For a state ψ, the expectation value ⟨O⟩ is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩.

So the operator here is 10σz +5σx. Since expectation is linear, I can compute each term separately and add them. So ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

I need to calculate ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ for the given state.

First, let me write down the state. The state is a linear combination:

ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩.

I should check if this is normalized. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. Squaring them: 0.25 and 0.75. Adding 0.25 +0.75 =1, so yes, it's normalized. Good.

Now, σz is the Pauli z-matrix. Its eigenstates are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively. So when I measure σz on |↑⟩, I get +1; on |↓⟩, -1.

The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is calculated as the probability of |↑⟩ times +1 plus the probability of |↓⟩ times -1.

The probability of |↑⟩ is |0.5|^2 =0.25. The probability of |↓⟩ is |sqrt(3)/2|^2 = 3/4 =0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

So 10⟨σz⟩ = 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, the harder part is calculating ⟨σx⟩. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think. σx is the Pauli x-matrix, which isn't diagonal in the z-basis. The eigenstates of σx are the |+x⟩ and |−x⟩ states, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

The matrix representation of σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when you apply σx to |↑⟩, you get |↓⟩, and applying to |↓⟩ gives |↑⟩.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Let me compute this. ψ is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So the conjugate transpose (bra) is 0.5 ⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2)*⟨↓|.

So when I apply σx to |ψ⟩, I get:

σx |ψ⟩ = 0.5 σx |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) σx |↓⟩.

Which is 0.5 |↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↑⟩.

Then, ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is [0.5 ⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2 ⟨↓| ] [0.5 |↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2 |↑⟩ ) ]

Multiplying these out, I'll get four terms:

0.5 * 0.5 ⟨↑|↓⟩ → which is zero because |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are orthogonal.

0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↑|↑⟩ → 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2)*1 = (sqrt(3)/4).

Similarly, (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 ⟨↓|↓⟩ → (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5)*1 = sqrt(3)/4.

And (sqrt(3)/2) * (sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↓|↑⟩ → which is zero.

So adding the non-zero terms: (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = (2*sqrt(3))/4 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, another method is to write ψ as a column vector. Let me see:

|↑⟩ is [1; 0], |↓⟩ is [0; 1].

So ψ is 0.5 [1; 0] + (sqrt(3)/2) [0; 1] → [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So σx |ψ⟩ is [ (0)(0.5) + (1)(sqrt(3)/2) ; (1)(0.5) + 0*(sqrt(3)/2) ] → [ sqrt(3)/2 ; 0.5 ].

Then, ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is ψ† σx ψ.

ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2 ].

So multiply ψ† with σx |ψ⟩: 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5).

Which is (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 ) + (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 ) = sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So correct, ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So now, putting it all together.

10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩ = 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).

Calculating each term:

10*(-0.5) = -5.

5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (5 * 1.732)/2 ≈ (8.66)/2 ≈4.33.

Adding them: -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute sqrt(3) accurately. sqrt(3) is about 1.73205.

So 5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (5 *1.73205)/2 = (8.66025)/2=4.330125.

So -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875.

Up to one decimal place, that is -0.7 because 0.669 is closer to 0.7 when rounded to one decimal? Wait, 0.669 is 0.67 when rounded to two decimals, but to one decimal place: 0.67 is 0.7 (since the second decimal is 6, which is ≥5, so the first decimal rounds up). So -0.7 is the expectation value.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Another approach: maybe I made a mistake in the order of addition.

Wait, the operator is 10σz +5σx. So, let me recompute:

10⟨σz⟩ =10*(-0.5) =-5.

5⟨σx⟩=5*(sqrt(3)/2)= (5 * 1.732)/2≈4.33.

So sum is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Ah, but to one decimal place, -0.7.

Yes, because -0.67 is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal.

So the expectation value is approximately -0.7.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7. So the answer should be C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is linear, so we compute the contributions from \( \sigma_z \) and \( \sigma_x \) separately.

### Step 1: Expectation value of \( \sigma_z \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) of \( \sigma_z \) have eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The probabilities of measuring \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) are the squared magnitudes of the coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) in \( \psi \), which are:
\[
P(|\uparrow\rangle) = |0.5|^2 = 0.25, \quad P(|\downarrow\rangle) = \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = 0.75.
\]
Thus, the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25(1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of \( \sigma_x \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) is represented by the matrix:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The state \( \psi \) can be written as a column vector:
\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Applying \( \sigma_x \) to \( \psi \), we get:
\[
\sigma_x \psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The bra vector \( \langle \psi | \) is:
\[
\langle \psi | = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Multiplying these vectors:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Using \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), we find:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx \frac{1.732}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Combine results
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]
Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is approximately \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer:
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is \( -0.7 \), which corresponds to option **C**.
