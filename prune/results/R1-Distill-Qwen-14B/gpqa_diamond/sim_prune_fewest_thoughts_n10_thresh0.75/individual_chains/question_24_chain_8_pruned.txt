Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit complex. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question involves mixtures X and Y, and a substance Z. I'll need to figure out what each of these is based on the given information.

First, the problem says that mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. I remember that decolorizing bromine water usually indicates the presence of double bonds, like alkenes or alkynes, because they can undergo addition reactions with bromine. So, the liquids in X might be alkenes or maybe something else that reacts with bromine, like aromatic compounds? But wait, aromatics usually don't decolorize bromine quickly unless it's a very reactive position, but let's not jump to conclusions yet.

Next, when X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids. This reaction is a disproportionation, meaning one substance is both oxidized and reduced. So, the starting material must have the ability to undergo such a reaction. Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids. Hmm, maybe each component of X undergoes a different reaction? Or perhaps only one component is undergoing the disproportionation?

Wait, no, since X is a mixture of two liquids, and after reaction, Y is a mixture of two other liquids. So perhaps each component of X is undergoing a reaction. But the reaction is a disproportionation. That's a bit tricky. Let me think. Disproportionation reactions involve a single species undergoing oxidation and reduction. So maybe only one of the components in X is undergoing this. For example, maybe one component is a compound that can be oxidized and reduced. Like, for instance, maybe ethene and something else? Or perhaps one of the components is something like ethane, but that doesn't make sense because ethane is saturated. Alternatively, maybe one component is a di-substituted alkene, which upon hydrogenation can break into smaller alkanes.

Wait, wait. The problem says that when X is treated with Pt and heated, it forms Y via disproportionation. So perhaps each substance in X is undergoing a reaction. But since Y is formed as a result of the disproportionation, perhaps each component in X is a single substance that can undergo such a reaction. Hmm, maybe each component in X is a diene or something else that can split into smaller parts.

Wait, but let's think about the next part. When X is hydrogenated, it gives only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen 14.28%. Let me calculate what that hydrogen percentage implies. The mass fraction of hydrogen is (mass of H)/(molar mass) * 100%. Let's see, 14.28% is roughly 1/7. Because 14.28 is approximately 14.2857, which is 1/7. So 14.28% H.

So H is 14.28% of the molar mass. Let's say the molecule has a formula CnH2n,
