Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit overwhelmed, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with a compound called 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then it's combined with two equivalents of another compound, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, along with sodium iodide at elevated temperature to form product 1. After that, product 1 undergoes several treatments: aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2, then SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3, and finally heating at 150Â°C to get product 4. The question is, how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on product 4? The options are A) 8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

Hmm, okay. I'll need to figure out the structure of each product step by step. Let me start by drawing the structures or at least visualizing them.

First, the starting material: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So, norbornane has bridged rings, and the substituent is on one of the bridgehead carbons.

Next, the other reactant is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So, cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two double bonds (but wait, no, 1,3-diene would have a conjugated diene, but cyclohexa-1,3-diene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4 positions. The molecule has two substituents: each being a dibromomethyl group at positions 5 and 6. So, each of those positions has a -CH2Br2 group.

Reaction with sodium iodide under elevated temperature. I think this is an elimination reaction, perhaps dehydrohalogenation. Since there are two equivalents of the dibromomethyl compound, and each has two Br atoms, maybe this is a di-elimination.

Wait, but what's the context here? The starting material has a bicyclo structure with an ether group. When I look at the other reactant, the dibromomethyl groups, I think they might be involved in a Diels-Alder reaction. Because norbornene (or norbornadiene) is a common diene in Diels-Alder reactions, but wait the starting material is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene which is norbornadiene. So, norbornadiene has two double bonds? No, wait, norbornadiene is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which has two double bonds, 2,3 and 5,6, making it a conjugated diene.

Wait, no, actually, the structure of norbornadiene is a bicyclic compound with two double bonds: positions 2,3 and 5,6. So, it's a conjugated diene in the ring.

So, when you have norbornadiene and react it with a dienophile, you get a Diels-Alder adduct. But our reactant here is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Wait, cyclohexa-1,3-diene is actually 1,3-cyclohexadiene. Now, 1,3-cyclohexadiene is a conjugated diene as well. So,
