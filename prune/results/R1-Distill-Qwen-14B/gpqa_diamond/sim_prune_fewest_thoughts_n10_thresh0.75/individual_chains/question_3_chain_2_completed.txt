Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see, the problem is about finding the expectation value of an operator involving σz and σx for a given spin-half particle's state.

The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz. So, the expectation value of σz should be straightforward to compute. But wait, the operator here is 10σz + 5σx. Hmm, so I'll need to find the expectation of each part and add them together.

First, expectation values. The expectation value of an operator is the inner product of the state with the operator acting on the state. So, ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩.

Let me break down the operator into two parts: 10σz and 5σx. I can compute each expectation separately and then add them.

Starting with 10σz.

The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So, to find ⟨σz⟩, I can compute ψ† σz ψ.

Since σz |↑⟩ = +1 |↑⟩ and σz |↓⟩ = -1 |↓⟩, because |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. So, the matrix for σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. 

So, the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is |0.5|^2 * (1) + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 * (-1). Let me compute that. 

|0.5|^2 is 0.25. |sqrt(3)/2|^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. So 0.25 *1 + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. 

So, ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5. Then 10σz's expectation is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now onto the σx part. 5σx, so I need to find ⟨σx⟩.

σx is the Pauli X matrix. Its matrix form is [[0,1],[1,0]]. The expectation of σx is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Let me write ψ as a vector. |↑⟩ is (1,0) and |↓⟩ is (0,1). So ψ is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2). 

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is calculated as ψ† σx ψ. Alternatively, since σx swaps the states, the expectation might be calculated as the inner product.

Wait, another way: the expectation of σx is the sum over the components. Let me compute ψ† σx ψ.

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when we multiply σx by ψ, which is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], we get [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. Then, the inner product with ψ is 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5).

Wait, let me be precise. So, ψ is [a; b], then ψ† σx ψ is a*b* + b*a*? No, wait, no. Because σx is applied to |ψ⟩, which gives [b, a], then we take the inner product with ψ.

Wait, ψ† is [a*, b*], so ψ† σx ψ = a* * b + b* * a, because σx |ψ⟩ is [b; a], so the inner product is a* b + b* a.

Wait, wait, let me think again. The state is ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. σx ψ is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. Then ψ† σx ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. Wait, no, that's when you have a row vector times a column vector.

Wait, another approach: The expectation of σx is the real part of ψ† σx ψ. Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute it as:

⟨σx⟩ = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) ?

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because σx is hermitian, and ⟨σx⟩ is given by the sum of the probabilities. Let me think more carefully.

The general expression for ⟨σx⟩ is the sum over each component: a*b' + a'*b, where a and b are the components of ψ.

So, ψ is [a, b] = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. So a = 0.5, b = sqrt(3)/2.

Then, σx |ψ⟩ = [b, a]. So, the inner product ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is a*b + b*a.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it as:

⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = (a)(b) + (b)(a) ?

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me compute it as the matrix product. So, ψ is a column vector [a; b]. σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx ψ is [b, a]^T.

Then ψ† is [a*, b*], so when you multiply, you get a* * b + b* * a.

Since a and b are real numbers in this case (because 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2 are real), it's a*b + b*a = 2ab.

Wait, that makes sense. So for a state (a, b), the expectation of σx is 2ab.

So, in our case, a=0.5, b=sqrt(3)/2.

So, 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = (0.5 * sqrt(3)) ) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, wait, let me compute it again. 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = 2 * (0.5) * (sqrt(3)/2) = (1) * (sqrt(3)/2) )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So the expectation value of σx is sqrt(3)/2, approximately 0.8660.

So, 5σx has an expectation of 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5 * 0.8660 ≈ 4.3301.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again about the calculation. Because another approach I could take is using the definition of expectation value.

The state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So, the σx operator flips the spin. So, applying σx to |↑⟩ gives |↓⟩ and vice versa. 

So, the expectation value is the probability of |↑⟩ multiplied by the expectation from σx when in |↑⟩, plus the probability of |↓⟩ multiplied by the expectation when in |↓⟩. Wait, no, that's not right because σx is an observable, but |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, not σx. So, I can't directly compute it that way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express σx in terms of the basis |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Since σx is a linear combination of |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|.

So, σx = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|.

So, the expectation value is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2)^* ⟨↑| ↓ ⟩ + (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↑| ↑ ⟩ ?

Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let's compute it as:

⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↑|↓⟩ + (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↓|↑⟩.

Wait, no. Because when you apply σx to |ψ⟩, which is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩, you get 0.5 σx |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) σx |↓⟩.

But σx |↑⟩ is |↓⟩, and σx |↓⟩ is |↑⟩.

So, σx |ψ⟩ = 0.5 |↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↑⟩.

Then, ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is the inner product of (0.5 ⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↓| ) with (0.5 |↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↑⟩ ).

So, when we compute this, the inner product is 0.5 * 0.5 ⟨↑|↓⟩ + 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↑|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 ⟨↓|↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) * (sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↓|↑⟩.

But ⟨↑|↓⟩ is zero, and ⟨↓|↑⟩ is also zero. So, the cross terms disappear.

So, what remains is 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) * ⟨↑|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 * ⟨↓|↓⟩.

⟨↑|↑⟩ is 1, and ⟨↓|↓⟩ is also 1. So, this becomes 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 = 0.5*sqrt(3)/2 + 0.5*sqrt(3)/2 = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So, that confirms the earlier calculation. So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2.

So, the expectation value of 5σx is 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈5 * 0.8660 ≈4.3301.

Now, the overall expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx is the sum of the two expectations: (-5) + (4.3301) = -0.6699. Wait, wait, that's about -0.6699.

Wait, but the options are given to one decimal place. So, let's see:

-0.6699 rounds to -0.7 (since 0.6699 is closer to 0.7 than 0.6? Wait, no, 0.6699 is 0.67 when rounded to two decimal places, but when rounding to one decimal place, 0.6699 is approximately 0.7? Wait, no.

Wait, 0.6699 is 0.67, which would round to 0.7 when to one decimal place? Wait, no. Because 0.6699 is less than 0.65? No, 0.6699 is more than 0.65, as 0.65 is 0.65. So, when rounding to one decimal place, look at the second decimal. The number is 0.6699.

So, 0.6699 is approximately 0.67 when rounded to two decimals, but for one decimal, the first digit after the decimal is 6, and the next is 6. So, 0.6699 is approximately 0.7 when rounded to one decimal place? Wait, no. Wait, to round to one decimal place, the number is 0.6... So, 0.6 is 0.6, but 0.6699 is closer to 0.7 than 0.6? Let me think. 

Wait, 0.6 is 0.60, and 0.7 is 0.70. 0.6699 is 0.67, which is 0.07 away from 0.70 and 0.0699 away from 0.60. So, it's closer to 0.7. So, 0.6699 rounds to 0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.

Wait, but wait. 0.6699 is 0.67 when rounded to two decimals. So, to one decimal, does it round up?

I think yes. Because the first digit after the decimal is 6, and the next is 6, which is >=5, so the 6 becomes 7. So, 0.6699 rounds to 0.7 in one decimal place.

But wait, my calculation was -0.6699. So that's approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because the options are A) -1.4, B) 1.65, C) -0.7, D) 0.85.

Wait, so the expectation value I found is approximately -0.6699, which is about -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. So option C is -0.7.

But wait, hold on. Let me double-check the calculation of the expectation for σz. Did I do that correctly?

The state is ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩.

The probability of |↑⟩ is |0.5|^2 = 0.25, and |↓⟩ is |sqrt(3)/2|^2 = 3/4 = 0.75.

So, ⟨σz⟩ is (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. That's correct. So 10σz's expectation is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

For σx, calculation was 2ab, where a=0.5, b=sqrt(3)/2. So, 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = (0.5 * sqrt(3)) ) ≈ 0.866. So 5σx gives 5 * 0.866 ≈ 4.33.

Adding -5 and 4.33 gives -0.67, which rounds to -0.7, so option C.

Wait, but I just thought another way. Maybe I should compute the entire operator's expectation, not just split into σz and σx.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute ψ† (10σz +5σx) ψ.

Let me compute 10σz +5σx. The matrices are:

σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]], so 10σz is [[10,0],[0,-10]].

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so 5σx is [[0,5],[5,0]].

Adding them together, 10σz +5σx is [[10,5],[5,-10]].

So, the operator is [[10,5],[5,-10]].

The state ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [0.5; approx 0.866].

So, to compute the expectation, which is ψ† (10σz +5σx) ψ.

So, compute [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by [[10,5],[5,-10]] multiplied by [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Wait, no, it's [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * (matrix) * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Wait, let's compute the matrix multiplied by the vector first. Let me compute M|ψ⟩, where M is [[10,5],[5,-10]].

M|ψ⟩ = [10*(0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2), 5*(0.5) + (-10)*(sqrt(3)/2)].

Calculating each component:

First component: 5 + (5 sqrt(3))/2 ≈5 + (5 *1.732)/2 ≈5 + (8.66)/2 ≈5 +4.33=9.33.

Second component: 2.5 + (-10 * 1.732/2 )= 2.5 - (17.32/2)= 2.5 -8.66= -6.16.

Wait, perhaps I should do exact calculations instead of approximations to avoid errors.

Wait, let's calculate it more precisely. So,

M|ψ⟩ = [10*(0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2), 5*(0.5) + (-10)*(sqrt(3)/2)].

Which is [5 + (5 sqrt(3)/2), 2.5 - (10 sqrt(3)/2)].

Simplify:

First component: 5 + (5√3)/2.

Second component: 2.5 -5√3.

Then, the inner product with ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by [5 + (5√3)/2, 2.5 -5√3].

So, the expectation is 0.5*(5 + (5√3)/2 ) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(2.5 -5√3).

Let me compute each term:

First term: 0.5*(5) + 0.5*(5√3/2 ) = 2.5 + (5√3)/4.

Second term: (sqrt(3)/2)*2.5 + (sqrt(3)/2)*(-5√3).

Compute each part:

Second term: (2.5 sqrt(3))/2 + (-5 * 3 )/(2).

Wait, because sqrt(3)*sqrt(3)=3. So,

Second term is (2.5 sqrt(3)/2) ) + (-15/2).

Now, let's sum first and second terms.

First term: 2.5 + (5√3/4).

Second term: (2.5 sqrt(3)/2) - 7.5.

So, adding all four components:

2.5 + (5√3/4) + (2.5 sqrt(3)/2) -7.5.

Combine like terms.

Real parts: 2.5 -7.5 = -5.

sqrt(3) terms: (5√3/4) + (2.5√3/2) = let's get a common denominator. 2.5 is 5/2, so (5√3/4) + (5√3/2 * 2/2) )= (5√3/4) + (5√3/4 * 2) )= 5√3/4 +5√3/4 * 2? Wait, no.

Wait, 2.5 sqrt(3)/2 is the same as (5/2) sqrt(3)/2 = 5 sqrt(3)/4.

So, the sqrt(3) terms are 5√3/4 +5√3/4 = 10√3/4 =5√3/2 ≈5 * 1.732/2 ≈4.33.

So, total expectation value is (-5) + (5√3/2) ≈-5 +4.33= -0.67, which aligns with the earlier result.

So, the expectation is approximately -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. So, option C is the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle O \rangle = \langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \) with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The state \( \psi \) is given as \( 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The probabilities of measuring \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are:

\[
|0.5|^2 = 0.25 \quad \text{and} \quad \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = 0.75
\]

Thus, the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
\]

The contribution of \( 10\sigma_z \) to the expectation value is:

\[
10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10(-0.5) = -5
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) operator flips the spin states, i.e., \( \sigma_x|\uparrow\rangle = |\downarrow\rangle \) and \( \sigma_x|\downarrow\rangle = |\uparrow\rangle \). The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle
\]

Expanding \( \psi \) as \( 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \), we compute:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = (0.5)(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) + (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})(0.5) = 2 \cdot (0.5)(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
\]

The contribution of \( 5\sigma_x \) to the expectation value is:

\[
5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5 \cdot 0.866 \approx 4.33
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The total expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle O \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is:

\[
\langle O \rangle \approx -0.7
\]

### Final Answer
The correct option is:

**Answer: C**
