Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution and the radiation it emits. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism classes that oscillating charges can radiate energy as electromagnetic waves. The question talks about a spheroidal charge distribution with the symmetry along the z-axis, so I guess it's symmetric around that axis.

The problem mentions that the charge distribution oscillates, which means it's an accelerating charge. I remember that accelerating charges emit radiation, and the power radiated depends on certain factors. The question is asking about the fraction of the maximum power radiated at a specific angle theta, which is 30 degrees in this case.

Wait, the problem says the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta. So, f is the power per unit solid angle, right? And the maximum power A is the total maximum power radiated.

I think the radiation pattern for such an oscillating charge would have a certain angular dependence. For a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is not isotropic. For example, an oscillating dipole's radiation is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the axis of oscillation. So, for a dipole along the z-axis, the radiation is strongest in the equatorial plane (theta = 90 degrees) and decreases as you go towards the poles (theta = 0 or 180 degrees). But wait, I'm not sure about the exact dependence. I think the intensity (or power per unit solid angle) for a dipole varies as sin^2(theta), but wait, maybe it's proportional to sin^2(theta) or something else.

Wait, no, wait. For a dipole, the electric field in the far zone (radiation zone) varies as (sin theta)/(r) times the exponential of i(kr - wt). The intensity, which is proportional to E squared, would then be proportional to sin^2(theta)/r^2. But wait, that's the dependence on theta and r. But in terms of power per unit solid angle, we have to consider that solid angle is dOmega = sin(theta) dtheta dphi.

So the power per unit solid angle would be the intensity multiplied by the area element. Wait, no, wait. Power is energy per time. The intensity is power per unit area. So the power in a solid angle dOmega would be intensity * dA, where
