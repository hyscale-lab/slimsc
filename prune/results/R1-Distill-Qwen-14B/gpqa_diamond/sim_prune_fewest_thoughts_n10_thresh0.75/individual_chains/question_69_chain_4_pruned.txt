Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. It's about particle decay and the resolution needed in a Bubble Chamber at CERN. Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, when particles decay, their lifetime affects how far they travel before decaying. The question is asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. 

Let me read the problem again. The decay is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻. The proper lifetime τ₀ is 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are various lengths, so I think this has to do with the distance the particle travels before decaying, and how well the detector can resolve that.

Wait, proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime is longer due to time dilation. So I should calculate the lifetime in the lab frame. The gamma factor for time dilation is gamma = E/mc². Oh wait, E is given as 27 GeV, but the mass is 3.41 GeV. So gamma = E/(m c²) but since E is in GeV and m c² is 3.41 GeV, E is 27 GeV. So gamma is 27 / 3.41. Let me compute that. 27 divided by 3.41... approximately 7.91, since 3.41 * 8 is 27.28, which is just a bit more than 27. So gamma ≈ 7.91.

Then, the lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma * tau_0. So tau = 7.91 * 8e-16 s. Let's calculate that. 7.91 *8 is about 63.28, so tau ≈ 63.28e-16 seconds. 

Now, the particle is moving at a relativistic speed. The distance it travels before decaying is L = v * tau. But v is approximately c for particles with high gamma. So L ≈ c * tau. Let's compute that. c is about 3e8 m/s. So L = 3e8 m/s * 63.28e-16
