Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism, also known as enantiomerism, occurs when a molecule has a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. If a molecule has such a center, it can have an enantiomer, which would result in optical activity—like being able to rotate plane-polarized light.

The question lists four different compounds, and I need to determine which of them exhibit optical isomerism. The options are given as combinations of these four, and I have to pick the correct combination.

Let's go through each one by one.

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**

Hmm, this looks a bit complex. So, it's a biphenyl structure where the two benzene rings are connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring, and also 6 and 6' with nitro groups. Each of those positions has a carboxylate group (as it's the 2,2' positions) and nitro groups at 6,6'.

Wait, but biphenyls can have a kind of isomerism called geometric isomerism if there are groups on each benzene ring that are on the same side or opposite. Oh wait, no—geometric isomerism is about substituents on a double bond or in a ring where their positions around a central point affect the structure. But in biphenyls, the substituents can be on the same side (ortho) or opposite (para), but that's more about the conformation rather than isomerism. Or wait, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that are across from each other, could that cause some kind of symmetry?

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the molecule might not be chiral. Let me think: the substituents are 2 and 2' on each ring, same positions. And the nitro groups are at 6 and 6', which are mirror images of each other. So perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry or a plane that makes it achiral. So, if the molecule is symmetric, it can't have optical isomerism. So this one
