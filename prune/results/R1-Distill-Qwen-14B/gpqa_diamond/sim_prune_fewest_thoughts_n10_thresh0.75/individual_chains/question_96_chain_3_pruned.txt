Okay, so I've got this problem about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think.

The question gives me the angular size of the event horizon, θ, and the distance d to the galaxy. I guess I need to find the radius of the event horizon first. Oh right, the event horizon radius R is related to the angular size θ using some trigonometric formula. Since θ is really small, I can probably approximate sinθ ≈ θ in radians.

So, θ in radians would be θ_rad = (θ_degrees) * (π/180). Wait, θ is given as 1e-17 degrees. So converting that to radians: 1e-17 * π/(180) is approximately 1.745e-19 radians. But wait, maybe I can keep it as θ in radians directly for the approximation.

The formula for angular size is θ ≈ R / d, assuming R << d, which I think is valid here because d is 1e10 parsecs, which is a huge distance. So R ≈ θ * d.

Wait, but let me make sure. The formula for angular size is θ (in radians) = R / (d * 1 pc) if R and d are in parsecs. Or wait, let me get the units right. The distance d is given in parsecs, so if R is in parsecs, then θ (rad) is R / d. But I need to convert θ into radians first.

Wait, let's compute R. θ is 1e-17 degrees. To convert to radians: multiply by π/180. So θ_rad = 1e-17 * π/180 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

So R = θ_rad * d. But d is 1e10 parsecs. So R = 1.745e-19 rad * 1e10 pc = 1.745e-9 parsecs.

Wait, but I need R in meters to find the area because entropy uses units in meters squared. So let's convert R from parsecs to meters.

I remember that 1 parsec is approximately
