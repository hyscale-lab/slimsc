Okay, so I have this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars would be detectable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the VLT (Very Large Telescope) in Paranal. It's known for its high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), which is crucial for detecting stars. The question says a star is detectable if the S/N is at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.

The stars to consider are options a to f. Each has different properties. Let's list them again:

a) Canopus – I think Canopus is a bright star, maybe one of the brightest. So it's probably detectable even from far, but I'm not sure.

b) Polaris – Also a bright star, but wait, it's a variable star and the pole star. Brightness is important, but I'll need to check its magnitude.

c) Star with RA=0, DEC=0 (so it's at the celestial equator, which the VLT can observe), Absolute V magnitude of 15, located at 10 pc. Absolute magnitude is how bright it would appear at 10 pc. So apparent magnitude would be 15 + (distance modulus). The distance modulus is 5 log10(d/10), where d is in parsecs. So for 10 pc, it's 5*(1) = 5. So apparent magnitude is 15 +5 = 20 mag. Wait, but wait, no: the absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc. So if the star is at 10 pc, its apparent magnitude would be 15. But wait no, that's not right. Wait, no: Absolute magnitude (M) is the apparent magnitude (m) at 10 pc. So if a star is at 10 pc, its m = M. So for option c, the star's m is 15. So it's magnitude is 15. That's quite faint. Because lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So m=15 is very faint.

d) Same star as c, but at 200 pc. So M=15, so m = M +5 log(d/10) → 15 +5 log(200/10) → log(20)=approx 1.301, so 5*1.301≈6.505. So m ≈ 15 +6.505 =21.5. That's even fainter.

e) Same star as c, but at 5 pc. So m = M +5 log(5/10) → log(0.5)= -0.301, so 5*(-0.301)= -1.505. So m≈15-1.5=13.5.

f) Same star, but at 50 pc. m=15 +5 log(50/10)=15 +5*(1.69897)=15 +8.495≈23.495.

Wait, so the apparent magnitudes are:

a) Canopus: I think it's a very bright star. Let me recall. Canopus is the second brightest star in the sky, after Sirius. So its apparent magnitude is about -0.74. That's super bright.

b) Polaris: I remember it's around magnitude 2, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a bit dimmer. Let me think, I think it's about 2.0, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe it's magnitude 1.9. Either way, it's much brighter than the others except Canopus and possibly others.

So the stars' magnitudes:

a) m ~ -0.74

b
