Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the options given. Let's break them down.

First reaction: Butan-2-one (which is methylacetone) reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So the structure is (CH3)2C=O. When it reacts with NaCN, that's sodium cyanide. I think this is a nucleophilic substitution or addition reaction.

But wait, butan-2-one is a ketone. Oh right, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion (CN-), it's a nucleophilic addition. So the mechanism is probably the cyanide attacking the carbonyl carbon. But wait, in the product, I see a hydroxyl group and a nitrile. So, maybe it's like a substitution. Or perhaps it's an addition followed by elimination? Or maybe a different kind of reaction.

Wait, but I recall that the formation of cyanohydrins involves the addition of CN- to a ketone. A cyanohydrin is an alcohol adjacent to a nitrile group. So, for example, when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. But in this case, the reagent is NaCN, which is a source of CN-.

Wait, but using NaCN might not be enough for the reaction. Because ketones typically react with HCN in the presence of an acid catalyst. So perhaps reagent A is an acid. Because the reaction conditions for forming cyanohydrins usually involve an acid, like H2SO4 or H3O+.

In the first reaction, butan-2-one plus NaCN and A produces 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the ketone (O) is replaced by an OH and a CN group on the same carbon. That makes sense for a cyanohydrin formation.

So the reaction is:

(CH3)2CO + HCN â†’ (CH3)2C(OH)CN.

But wait, the reagent is NaCN, which is a source of CN- ions. So perhaps the acid (A) is needed to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, which helps the CN- attack. So A is probably an acid, like H3O+ or H2SO4.

Looking at the options, the possible A reagents are H3O+, NaHSO3, etc. Options A and B have A as H3O+, options C and D have A as NaHSO3.

So the first reagent A is likely H3O+ (option A or B), but let me not jump to conclusions yet.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B in H2O to form
