Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule transitioning between energy states. Hmm, the question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the setup. The molecule is made of atoms X and Y. The given masses are Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we're supposed to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, wait. The fundamental state... I think that refers to the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. So the molecule is in the ground state, and we're looking for the photon that would take it to the next state with the lowest possible energy. But what's the next state? Oh, in quantum mechanics, the next state would be the first excited state.

But wait, the model combines rotation and vibration. So the energy states are a combination of rotational and vibrational energy. But the question is about a transition when a photon is absorbed. So the photon's energy has to match the difference between these states.

Wait a second, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The question might be referring to a transition that involves both vibrational and rotational changes. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's only about the vibrational state, because the next state with the lowest energy could be the first vibrational excited state, assuming that rotation is in the lowest possible state (like the ground rotational state).

Wait, in the quantum harmonic oscillator model for vibrations, the energy levels are quantized as E_vibrational = (v + 1/2) ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number. So the ground state is v=0, and the first excited state is v=1. The energy difference between these is ħω.

But if the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state overall, it's probably in v=0 and the rotational ground state (J=0). So the next state with
