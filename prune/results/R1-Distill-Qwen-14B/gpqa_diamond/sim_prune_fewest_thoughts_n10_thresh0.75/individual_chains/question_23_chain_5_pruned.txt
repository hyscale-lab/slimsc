Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me break it down. The question is about a reaction involving a specific compound reacting with hydrogen bromide (HBr). The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to write it out.

So, the structure of the compound: the benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether is connected to a butenyl group. Specifically, the substituent is a 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl group. Let me draw that. The butenyl chain is four carbons long, with a double bond starting at the third carbon (but-3-en-yl). So, the structure would be: the benzene ring-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but starting from the first carbon. Wait, but the substituent is 2,2-dimethyl, so the structure is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH=CH? Wait, no, butenyl is four carbons with a double bond. Oh wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The butenyl group is four carbons. The numbering is from the point of attachment. So, 1-yl means the substituent is attached at the first carbon. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-, but that can't be right. Wait, no. Let me number the butenyl group from the oxygen. So, the oxygen is attached to carbon 1. Then, carbon 2 is CH2, but wait, no. Let's think. The substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, which is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that's not right. Wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- as
