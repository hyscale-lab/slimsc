Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let's try to work through this step by step.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices and n is a unit vector. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, each being 2x2 matrices. And n is any unit vector, so it's like pointing in some direction in space.

Wait, I remember that the eigenvalues of a spin operator depend on the magnitude of the operator and the direction. For a spin-1/2 system, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2 times some factor. But wait, in this case, the Hamiltonian is proportional to the Pauli matrices, so maybe the structure is similar.

Let me think about the general form. The Pauli matrices σ · n would be a matrix like n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz. Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² =1. But regardless of the direction, the magnitude of σ · n would be the same as any component because the vector is normalized. Wait, no, the magnitude of σ · n is the same as the magnitude of any Pauli matrix component because n is a unit vector. So σ · n would be a matrix whose square is I (identity matrix?) multiplied by some factors.

Wait, no. Let me compute (σ · n)². Because (σ · n
