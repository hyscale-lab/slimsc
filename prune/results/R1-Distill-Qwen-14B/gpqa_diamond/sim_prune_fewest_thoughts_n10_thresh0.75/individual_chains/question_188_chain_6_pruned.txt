Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. 

Wait, rhombohedral crystal structure. Oh right, a rhombohedral system is a type of hexagonal crystal system, but wait, no, I think it's actually a separate system. Oh wait, I'm getting confused. No, rhombohedral is a type of cubic system with all edges equal and all angles equal, but not 90 degrees. Oh, right, in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedral or trigonal system, I think.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance in a crystal is the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice vectors, right? So the edge length 'a' is 10 Angstrom here.

We need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Oh, right, the formula for interplanar distance d in a crystal is given by d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) ) ) ... Wait, no, wait. I think the formula is a bit different. Wait,
