Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what the correct answer is. Let's see. The question is about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The options are different organic compounds. Hmm.

Alright, let's break down the information given. The mass spec shows a molecular ion peak at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. There's a peak at 158 with 32%. Wait, that 158 is probably a fragment. But what's the molecular formula here? Let me think. Molecular weight is 156, so the molecular formula must add up to that. Let me see the options.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let me calculate its molecular weight. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. If we substitute with Cl and add another OH, so it's C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: 12*7=84, 1*5=5, 35.5 for Cl, 16*2=32. Total is 84+5=89, plus 35.5 is 124.5, plus 32 is 156.5. Oh wait, but the molecular ion is 156. That's a problem because 156.5 is close but the molecular ion is 156. Maybe it's possible because sometimes the molecular ion can be a little off due to isotopes or something, but let me check other options.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. If we replace a hydrogen with Cl, the formula becomes C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: same calculation as before, 156.5. Hmm, so the molecular weight is about 156.5, but the given molecular ion is 156. So maybe this is a problem. Unless perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate. Carbon is 12, hydrogen 1, Cl is about 35.5, and oxygen 16. So for benzoic acid, it's 7 carbons, 5 H (if 4-Cl), because benzoic acid is C6H5COOH. Wait, no. 4-chlorobenzoic acid would be C6H4ClCOOH? Let me get the formula right. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. If 4-chloro, then one H is replaced by Cl. So formula is C7H5ClO2. So molecular weight is (7*12) + (5*1) + (35.5) + (2*16) = 84 +5 +35.5 +32= 156.5. So the molecular ion would be at 156.5, but the observed is 156. That's a 0.5 difference. Maybe it's possible as the M+1 peak is at 158 (
