Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method looks for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity making the star wobble. 

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits, so that's good. 

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom periodic shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but how does that relate to the orbital period? Oh right, the RV method depends on the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the semi-amplitude of the RV is K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ] * (1/(2π)) * (P/( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) )) ). Wait, maybe I should think of it in terms of the Doppler shift formula.

Wait, another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula: 

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since the planet masses are much smaller than the star (Neptune is about 1/7th Earth's mass, and the star is Sun-like), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So maybe M_p << M_star, so we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, since both stars have the same mass, and planets have same mass, I can probably ignore M_p compared to M_star.

So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) * (2π G / c )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe more accurately, K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

Wait, let me think again. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p
