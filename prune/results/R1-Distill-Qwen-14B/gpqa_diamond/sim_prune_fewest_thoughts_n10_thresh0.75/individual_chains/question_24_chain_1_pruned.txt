Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem involves mixtures X and Y, and a substance Z. From the description, X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that can decolorize bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heated, X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y, which is also an equimolar mixture of two other liquids. Y doesn't decolorize bromine water.

Hydrogenation of both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon. Z's mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, and it's part of Y. Z is a solvent and doesn't react further with hydrogen. Also, X has no conjugated double bonds.

Hmm, so let's break this down. X is a mixture that decolorizes bromine water. What does that mean? Well, substances that decolorize bromine water typically have unsaturated bonds, like alkenes or maybe even conjugated systems. But wait, the problem says there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. So X must have non-conjugated double bonds, maybe two alkenes or something else.

Then, when X is treated with platinum and heated, a disproportionation occurs to form Y. Disproportionation usually involves a single substance being both oxidized and reduced. Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids. Oh, maybe each component in X undergoes a disproportionation? Or perhaps they are in some kind of equilibrium that changes upon heating.

Wait, the product Y is also a mixture of two liquids. So perhaps each of the two components in X undergoes a reaction to form different products, but that sounds more like a simple reaction than a disproportionation. Alternatively, maybe one of the substances in X is a diene or something that can undergo some kind of addition, but I'm not sure.

Now, hydrogenation of X and Y gives Z. So both X and Y, when hydrogenated with Pt under severe conditions, produce the same Z. Let's think about hydrogenation. When you hydrogenate alkenes, you add H2 and get alkanes. So if X has alkenes, after hydrogenation, they become alkanes. But since
