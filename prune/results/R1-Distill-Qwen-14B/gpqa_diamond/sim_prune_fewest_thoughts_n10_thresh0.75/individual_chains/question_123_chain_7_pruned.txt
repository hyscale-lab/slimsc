Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question says that the ejecta part and the Galaxy are both inertial frames. So, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, right, in inertial frames, the laws of physics are the same, so I can probably use classical mechanics here? Or do I have to consider relativity because the speed is a significant fraction of light speed?

Wait, 60,000 km/s. Let me think, the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 1/5th of that, or 0.2c. Hmm, that's not super high, but it's enough that maybe classical mechanics won't be accurate. However, the problem doesn't mention acceleration or other relativistic effects, so maybe it's just a simple relative velocity problem.

Wait, the question is asking what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta frame. So, in the ejecta's frame, their own time is 50 seconds. But in the Galaxy's frame, the time would be different due to time dilation, right? Or wait, maybe I should think about the relative velocity and how much distance is covered from each frame.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the concept of length contraction or time
