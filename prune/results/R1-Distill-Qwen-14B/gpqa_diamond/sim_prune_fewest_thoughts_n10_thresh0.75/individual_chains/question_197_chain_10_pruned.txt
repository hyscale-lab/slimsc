Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of an ester, especially under acidic conditions. Wait, no, wait. Red phosphorus and HI is used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines, or maybe it's for eliminating certain groups... Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up reactions. Another thought: maybe it's for the hydrolysis of an epoxide? No, that's usually with acid or base. Oh wait, red phosphorus with HI is a reagent used in the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, especially in the dehydrohalogenation or maybe for the formation of alkenes via elimination. Or wait, maybe it's for the hydrolysis of nitriles into amides or something else. Wait, perhaps I should focus on the spectral data first to figure out what Compound X is, and then think about the reaction.

Looking at the IR data: peaks at 3400â€“2500 cm-1. That broad region suggests either O-H stretch (like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid) or maybe N-H. The strong peak around 1720 cm-1 is likely a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The peaks at
