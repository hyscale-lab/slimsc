Okay, so I have this astronomy problem to solve. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets. The setup is that there are five exoplanets in a system, all with circular orbits. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for Transit Timing Variation. But I don't think that part is too relevant for the temperature calculation. The key points are that they're in orbital resonance and their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, then Planet_2 is double that, and so on up to Planet_5.

The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So I need to find T4 divided by T2, I think. Oh wait, no, the question says the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Wait, does it mean T4 over T2 or the other way around? Hmm, the way it's phrased, "ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2"—so maybe T4 : T2? Or T2 : T4? Well, the options are given as decimal numbers, so I think the ratio would be T4 over T2, because 0.57 is less than 1, and if Planet_4 is farther out, it would be colder, so lower temperature. But let me think about the factors involved.

We also know that all the planets have the same albedo. Albedo (a) affects the energy absorbed, so the formula for equilibrium temperature includes (1 - a)^(1/4), but since all have the same albedo, that factor cancels out when taking the ratio. So I don't need to worry about albedo for this problem.

The formula for the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the blackbody radiation equation. The formula is:

T = [ (L * (1 - a)) / (16 * π * σ * d^2) ) ]^(1/4)

Where:
- L is the star's luminosity,
- a is the planet's albedo,
- σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant,
- d is the distance from the star.

But wait, another version I remember is that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period, assuming a circular orbit and same star. Because Kepler's third law relates the period to the semi-major axis (which is the radius for circular orbits). So the formula can be simplified as T ∝ ( (P) )^(-1/2) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4). But since a is the same for all planets, the ratio of their temperatures depends only on the square root of their periods.

Wait, no, let me think again. Kepler's third law says that P^2 ∝ a^3. So a = (P^(2/3)) * (some constant). So the distance d is proportional to P^(2/3). The flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance, so the flux F is proportional to 1/d². Substituting d from Kepler's law, F ∝ 1/(a^2) → since a ∝ P^(
