Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, binary stars, eclipsing systems, radial velocities. Right, I remember that binary stars orbit around a common center of mass. The problem is asking about the mass of each system and how much more massive system_1 is compared to system_2.

The question gives me the periods of the eclipses for each system: system_1 has a period of 2 years, and system_2 has a period of 1 year. Oh wait, the periods are the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. So each system's period is the orbital period of the binary stars around each other.

Then there's the radial velocity data. For system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. I think radial velocity amplitudes are related to the masses of the stars. Because in a binary system, the more massive star would have a smaller orbit, hence a smaller velocity variation, right? Or wait, no, maybe the opposite. Because the less massive star would have to move faster to maintain the balance.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The center of mass is the balance point. So, if one star is more massive, it's closer to the center. So the less massive star has to orbit a larger circle, so higher velocity. So the radial velocity amplitude (which is the maximum speed you see in the Doppler shift) of each star is inversely proportional to its mass. Because the more massive star has a smaller orbit (so lower velocity) and the less massive has a larger orbit (higher velocity). So if star A has mass M_A and velocity V_A, and star B has mass M_B and velocity V_B, then M_A / M_B = V_B / V_A.

So for system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5. So M1a / M1b = 5 /10 = 0.5. So the mass ratio is 0.5. So M1a = 0.5 * M1b. The total mass of system_1 is M1a + M1b = 0.5 M1b + M1b = 1.5 M1b.

Wait, but wait, when
