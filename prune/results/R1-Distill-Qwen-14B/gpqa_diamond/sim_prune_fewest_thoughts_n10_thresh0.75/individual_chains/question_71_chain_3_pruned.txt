Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to how much light a planet absorbs and how much it emits. The formula, I think, is something like T = T_star * ( ( L / (16*pi*sigma) )^(1/4) ) * ( (R_planet) / (d^2) ) ), but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature for a planet is given by the formula T = T_star * ( ( R_star / (2 d) ) )^(1/2 ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that the formula is T = T_effective of the star multiplied by sqrt( R_star / (2d) ), where d is the distance from the star.

Wait, no, maybe it's better to think in terms of the inverse square law. The flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance. So the equilibrium temperature would depend on the square root of the ratio of the star's luminosity to the planet's distance.

Oh right! The formula is T = T_star * sqrt( L / (16 pi sigma d^2) ) )? Wait, no, maybe it's more like T = T_star * ( ( L ) / (16 pi sigma d^2) )^(1/4) ), but I'm getting myself confused.

Wait, let's step back. The equilibrium temperature (T) of a planet is determined by the balance between the incoming stellar radiation and the outgoing thermal radiation. The formula is derived from the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

So the incoming power per unit area is the stellar flux at that distance, which is L / (4 pi d^2), where L is the star's luminosity and d is the orbital distance. The planet reflects some of this (albedo) and absorbs the rest. The absorbed power is then (1 - A) * (L / (4 pi d^2)) * pi R^2, where R is the planet's radius. The planet then emits this as thermal radiation, which is (4 pi R^2) * sigma T^4, where sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Setting them equal: (1 - A) * (L/(4 pi d^2)) * pi R² = 4 pi R² sigma T^4

Simplify: (1 - A) * L/(4 pi d^2) * pi R² = 4 pi R² sigma T^4

Cancel R^2 and pi terms: (1 - A) * L/(4 d^2) ) = 4 sigma T^4

Wait, maybe I should rearrange it. Let me try again.

Incoming flux: F = L/(4 pi d²)
Absorbed: F * (1 - A) * pi R² (since cross-section is pi R²)
Emitted: 4 pi R² sigma T^4 (all area emits)
So,

F*(1-A)*pi R² = 4 pi R² sigma T^4

Divide both sides by pi R²:

F (1 - A) = 4 sigma T^4

But F is L/(4 pi d^2), so:

(L/(4 pi d²)) (1 - A) =
