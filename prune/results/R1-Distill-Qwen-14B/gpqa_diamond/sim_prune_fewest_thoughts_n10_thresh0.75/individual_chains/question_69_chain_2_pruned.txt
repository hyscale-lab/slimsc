Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem about particle decay and the resolution needed in a bubble chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, so I remember that in particle physics, the lifetime of a moving particle as observed in the lab frame isn't the same as its proper lifetime. Because of time dilation. Oh right, the formula is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

The Lorentz factor γ is given by γ = E / m, where E is the total energy of the particle and m is its rest mass. So here, E is 27 GeV and m is 3.41 GeV. So γ would be 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that.

27 divided by 3.41 is approximately 7.91. Let me double-check: 3.41 * 7 is 23.87, 3.41 * 7.9 is about 27 (since 3.41 * 7.91 is about 27). So γ is about 7.91.

So the lifetime τ in the lab frame is γ * τ₀. So τ = 7.91 * 8e-16 s. Let me calculate that. 7.91 *8 is about 63.28, so τ ≈ 63.28e-16 s, which is 6.328e-15 seconds.

But wait, how does this relate to the resolution? Oh right, the resolution has to do with the length over which the decay is observed. The particles travel some distance before decaying, and the resolution determines how well we can see that.

The distance the particle travels before decaying is L = v * t, where v is the velocity and t is the lifetime. But wait, for relativistic particles, v is approximately equal to the speed of light c. So L ≈ c * τ
