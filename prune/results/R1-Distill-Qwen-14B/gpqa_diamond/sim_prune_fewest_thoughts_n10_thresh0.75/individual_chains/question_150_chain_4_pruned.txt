Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR and reaction mechanisms can get tricky. But I'll take it step by step.

The problem says: A compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO has the given NMR data. It's reacted with a series of reagents, and I need to find the final product from the options provided.

Let me start by looking at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The 1H NMR shows:

- 9.72 ppm: a triplet integrating to 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift, so maybe an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. Since it's a triplet, perhaps it's adjacent to two equivalent protons, maybe from a CH2 group or part of a coupling.

- 6.98 ppm: a doublet of 2H. That could be aromatic protons. The doublet suggests maybe two equivalent protons next to another set, perhaps in a para-substituted benzene ring? Or maybe an ortho substitution.

- 6.51 ppm: another doublet of 2H. Hmm, same number of protons, doublet. Maybe adjacent to something else. Wait, in an aromatic ring, if there are substituents in para positions, the neighboring H's might couple with each other. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a conjugated system, like a vinyl group.

- 6.27 ppm: a broad singlet (bs) of 2H. Broad usually means exchange or maybe it's in a conjugated system. Two protons as a singlet could be part of an aromatic ring with substituents or maybe an enol structure?

- 3.66 ppm: a doublet of 2H. This is around the region for CH2 groups, especially if they're adjacent to something electronegative. Maybe an OCH2 group? Or perhaps a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like in an ether or ester.

Putting this together. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H -X + N)/2. So, 2*8 +2 =18, minus 9 H, 0 X, plus 1 N. So 18-9+1=10. 10/2=5. So 5 DoU. That could be from a benzene ring (3 DoU), a double bond (1 DoU), and maybe an aldehyde (which is a double bond, but wait, aldehyde is already a double bond between C and O. Wait, no, the aldehyde is a carbonyl, which is a DoU of 1. So 3 (benzene) + 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (maybe another double bond, like an enal?) + another 0 maybe? Hmm, perhaps I need a better approach.

Wait, the NMR suggests several things. The 9.72 ppm is probably an aldehyde. The 3.66 ppm could be a CH2 connected to an oxygen, perhaps
