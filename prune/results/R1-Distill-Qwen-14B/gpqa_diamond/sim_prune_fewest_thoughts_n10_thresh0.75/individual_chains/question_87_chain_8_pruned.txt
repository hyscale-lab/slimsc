Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. So, wait, a six-membered ring with two substituents, and the total carbons are 8. Hmm. Let's break that down.

A benzene ring is six carbons, right? If it's di-substituted, that means two substituents attached. So the total carbons would be 6 (from benzene) plus the carbons in the substituents. So substituents must add up to 2 carbons because 6 + 2 = 8.

Wait, but wait, wait. Another possibility: maybe one substituent is a group that has more than one carbon. Oh wait, but the sum is 8. The benzene is six, so substituents must be two carbons in total. So each substituent can be one carbon each, or maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is none? No, because di-substituted means two substituents attached to the ring. So for example, two substituents each with one carbon, or maybe one substituent has two carbons and another has none? No, that's not possible because di-substituted implies two substituents, both attached to the ring.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's recalculate. The compound has 8 carbons. The benzene ring is six, so substituents must contribute 2 carbons in total. So each substituent is one carbon, or maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is... wait, that would make 6 + 2 + 0=8? No, but di-substituted requires two substituents. So each substituent must have one carbon each, perhaps. Or maybe one substituent is a two-carbon group and the other is a single carbon. Wait, but 6 + (2 +1) =9, which is more than 8. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe I got the initial statement wrong. The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, so the ring is six carbons. The substituents are two groups attached to
