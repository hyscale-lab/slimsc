Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The FTIR shows ester groups, so that means there's an ester functional group somewhere. Esters have carbonyl groups, so that's a clue. The 1H NMR has six signals. Let's break down the NMR info.

The NMR has:
- Two aromatic H signals. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents could be in positions that lead to different splitting. Maybe the two substituents are para, which would create two equivalent H environments, but wait, wait. Wait, wait, di-substituted can be ortho, meta, or para. If it's para, the aromatic protons would be all equivalent in two setsâ€”like two doublets perhaps. Or maybe each substituent leads to different coupling. Hmm, but the question says two signals, so maybe the substituents are in such a way that each ring position has a distinct H.

Wait, no. For a di-substituted benzene, depending on substitution, the number of signals can vary. If it's para, then you might have two sets of Hs: the two Hs adjacent to each substituent (ortho positions) and the two Hs opposite them (para positions). Wait, but that would give two signals. Because, let's see. If the substituents are para, each substituent would have two ortho H and one meta H. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when substituents are para, the ring becomes symmetric. So the Hs on the ring would be in two equivalent pairs. So for example, if the substituents are in positions 1 and 3 (wait, no, para is 1 and 4). Oh right, wait, in a benzene ring, para substitution is 1 and 4, so then the Hs at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and the Hs at 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So that would give two signals in the aromatic region.

So that's two aromatic H
