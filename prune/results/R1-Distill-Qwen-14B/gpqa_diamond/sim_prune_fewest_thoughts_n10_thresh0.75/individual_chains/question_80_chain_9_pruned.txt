Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out what value the algorithm gives for the input ACAGTGACC. The examples given are AGG gives 115 and TGCTGA gives 176. Hmm, let's think about this.

First, I should look for a pattern or a rule that the algorithm is applying. Let me write down the examples:

AGG → 115
TGCTGA → 176
ACAGTGACC → ?

Maybe each nucleotide (A, T, C, G) is being converted into a number, and then summed up. Let's check that.

Looking at AGG: A, G, G. So A is 1, G is 7, G is 7. Adding them up: 1 + 7 +7 = 15. But the output is 115. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe it's not just a simple sum of each nucleotide's position in the alphabet.

Wait, another thought: perhaps each pair of bases is being considered. Or maybe it's the product of their numerical values. Let's try that.

For AGG (A=1, G=7, G=7):

If it's the product, 1 * 7 *7 =49. But the output is 115, so that's not it. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the algorithm counts the number of each nucleotide and then does some calculation. AGG has 1 A, 2 Gs. So 1*(1) + 2*(7) =1 +14=15. Still not 115.

Wait, another approach: perhaps each nucleotide is converted to a digit and treated as a number in base 10, then the entire string is read as a number, and then processed. For AGG, that would be 1, 7, 7 → 177. But 177 is more than 115, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe each nucleotide is assigned a value and then multiplied in some way. Let me think. Or perhaps it's the sum of each base's value multiplied by their position.

Wait, for AGG: positions are 1, 2,3. So A is 1, G is7, G is7.

So 1*1 + 7*2 +7*3 =1 +14 +21=36. Still not 115.

Hmm, maybe another approach. Let me check the outputs again. 115 and 176. Are these numbers related to the number of letters? AGG has 3 letters, so 3 digits. 115 is a 3-digit number. TGCTGA has 6 letters, output is 176. So maybe each nucleotide contributes a digit which is then part of a number, but perhaps it's a different base.

Wait, trying base 8 or something. Let's see. For AGG, 1,7,7. In base 8, 1*64 +7*8 +7 =64+56+7=127. Not 115.

Wait, but
