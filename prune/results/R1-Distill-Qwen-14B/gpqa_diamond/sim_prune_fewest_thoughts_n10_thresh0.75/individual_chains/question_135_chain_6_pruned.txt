Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about the decay of a boson X. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f̄ (y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, from what I remember, the Lagrangian describes the interaction between fields. So X is a bosonic field interacting with fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to find the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different fermion pairs.

Wait, okay, in particle physics, when a boson decays into fermions, it usually pairs into a particle-antiparticle pair. So for example, a photon can decay into e+ e- if it has enough energy, but wait, photons are massless, so their decay is different. But X here has a mass, so it can decay into fermions.

So the first thing I need to figure out is what fermions have a mass less than or equal to half the mass of X. Because in a decay, the rest mass of each particle in the pair must be less than or equal to half the parent's mass. Because if the fermion has mass m, each would require m ≤ M_X / 2.

So M_X is 6 GeV. So each fermion must have a mass ≤ 3 GeV. Let's list the known fermion masses.

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top.

Up and down are light, like around a few MeV. Strange is about 100 MeV, charm around 1.5 GeV, bottom around 4.5 GeV, top is way too heavy, like 173 GeV.

Leptons: electrons are ~0.0005 GeV, muons ~0.1 GeV, taus ~1.78 GeV. The others like neutrinos are nearly massless, but I think they are negligible here.

So for each possible fermion pair, their mass must be ≤3 GeV. So let's see:

b quark is around 4.5 GeV. So each b quark is 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar because 4.5 is bigger than 3.

Similarly, top quark is way too heavy, so no decay into t tbar.

Tau lepton is about 1.78 GeV. So each tau is under 3, so X can decay into tau+ tau-.

Other leptons like mu, e are way lighter, so their decays are allowed.

Now, let's check each quark:

u and d are super light, like a few MeV. So their masses are way under 3 GeV. So X can decay into u ū and d d̄.

s quark is about 100 MeV, so also allowed.

c quark is around 1.5 GeV, which is under 3. So X can decay into c cbar.

But b quark as we saw is too heavy.

So the possible fermion pairs are:

u, d, s, c, tau, mu, e.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure about the masses. Maybe I should check exact values.

Wait, the mass of the bottom quark is approximately 4.1 to 4.7 GeV. So in any case, it's above 3 GeV. So b quark is out.

Charm quark is about 1.2-1.5 GeV, so yes, under 3.

So the possible quarks are u, d, s, c.

And for leptons: e, mu, tau.

So the decay products would be pairs of these fermions and their antiparticles.

So looking at the options:

Option A: X→ b bbar, s sbar, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but b quark is too heavy. So option A is wrong because it includes b.

Option B: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

That includes c, which is allowed. So this looks good.

Option C includes t tbar, which is impossible because top is way too heavy. So C is out.

Option D includes b bbar, which is not allowed. So D is wrong.

Wait, but wait, another thing: in the Lagrangian, which fermions are involved? The interaction is with ψ_f, which probably refers to some specific fermion type. But the Lag
