Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of relativity and nuclear physics. Let's take it step by step.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then, it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. The fragments have a mass ratio where one is twice as massive as the other. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So, the initial nucleus is at rest, and after fission, the two fragments move. 

The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. We need to find the difference between the correct relativistic T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are given in MeV, which is much smaller than GeV, so relativistic effects might be significant here.

First, let's parse the given data:

1. Initial rest energy: 300 GeV (since E=mc², this implies M is the rest mass, so M c² = 300 GeV).
2. After fission, the two fragments have rest masses m1 and m2, where m1 = 2 * m2.
3. m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

So, let's find m1 and m2. Since m1 = 2 m2, substituting into m1 + m2 = 0.99 M gives 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = (0.99/3) M = 0.33 M. Then m1 is 0.66 M.

Now, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments will move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. So, their momenta must be equal and opposite.

Let’s denote the velocities of the fragments as v1 (more massive, m1=0.66M) and v2 (less massive, m2=0.33M). Since momentum is conserved, m1 v1 = m2 v2 → (0.66M) v1 = (0.33M) v2 → v2 = 2 v1.

Wait, no, that's if in non-relativistic speeds. Hmm, but since we're dealing with relativistic speeds, perhaps that's not the case. Wait, no, because we're comparing the relativistic and non-relativistic approaches. So, perhaps in the non-relativistic case, we can use classical momentum, but the actual calculation would require relativistic momentum.

Wait, the question is about the difference between the correct T1 and the non-relativistic T1. So, perhaps I should compute T1 in both cases and find the difference.

But let's think about energy and momentum. The initial energy is just the rest energy, 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies plus the kinetic energies of the two fragments.

So, the initial energy is 300 GeV. The final energy is (m1 c² + K1) + (m2 c² + K2).

But wait, the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M, so m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. So the total rest energy after fission is 0.99 M c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.

Therefore, the total kinetic energy (K1 + K2) is the initial rest energy minus the final rest energy: 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV. So, K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

Now, since the nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission is zero. So, the relativistic momentum of the two fragments must cancel each other.
