Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read through it carefully and figure out what's going on. So, the question is about two planets orbiting a star, and we need to find the maximum orbital period of the second planet such that both transit and occultation events occur. Hmm.

Alright, let's break down the given information. We have a primary planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius. It's in a circular orbit with a transit impact parameter of 0.2. The star it's orbiting has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. The orbital period of this first planet is 3 days. Now, there's a second planet with a radius 2.5 times Earth's radius. We need to find its maximum orbital period so that it also transits and is occulted.

Wait, what's an impact parameter? Oh right, the impact parameter is the distance (in units of the star's radius) that the planet's path misses the center of the star during transit. A lower impact parameter means the planet passes closer to the star's center. So for a transit to happen, the planet's path must pass within the star's disk. But more on that later.

So both planets are in the same orbital plane, and their orbits are circular. The key here is probably about their orbital periods and the conditions for transit and occultation. Oh, occultation is when one object passes behind another from our point of view. So for the second planet to occult the first, the second must be further out so that sometimes it's behind the star, blocking the first planet. Wait, no, wait: occultation would mean that the second planet passes behind the star, blocking our view of it. But wait, no, actually, occultation is when a planet is hidden behind the star, so the star would eclipse the planet. So for the second planet to be occulted, it would need to be in a position where the star passes in front of it, blocking us from seeing it. So that means the second planet has to be closer to the star than the first planet? Or farther? Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the relative positions. If the first planet is closer to the star, its orbital period is shorter. The second planet has a longer period if it's further out. So for both to transit, their orbital planes must be aligned. But what
