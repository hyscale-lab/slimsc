Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think through this step by step.

The question says: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Wait, relative speed in relativity doesn't just add up like in classical mechanics. Right, because of the velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). But wait, which frame are we considering? Oh, right, the relative speed would be the speed of one as seen from the other's frame. So, for example, if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, from A's frame, B's speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Or wait, no: wait, I think I might have that reversed. Let me think: if A is moving at u=0.6c in the positive direction, and B is moving at v=0.5c in the same direction, then from A's frame, B's speed would be (v - u)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Wait, no, wait: Actually, the formula for the relative speed
