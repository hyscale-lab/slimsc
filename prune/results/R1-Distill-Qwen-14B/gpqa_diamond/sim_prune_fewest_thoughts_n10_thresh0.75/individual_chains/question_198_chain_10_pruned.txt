Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to it, but let's try to work through it. The question is about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in solution, and we're supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. Hmm, okay.

So the given data: the concentration of Co(II) is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, I think stability constants are for the formation of complexes. So each β corresponds to a different complex.

I remember that the stability constant (formation constant) tells us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. The complexes form stepwise, right? So the first complex would be [Co(SCN)]^+, the second [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, and so on up to the fourth complex.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the blue one is probably the [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} complex. So that's the second complex, which would have two thiocyanate ligands. So we're looking for the fraction of all Co species that are in the form of [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}.

Wait, but I need to make sure. I've heard that different Co-SCN complexes have different colors. The blue one is usually the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}. So yeah, that's the one we're focusing on.

Now, to find the percentage of this complex among all cobalt species. So I think I need to calculate the fraction of each possible complex (from 0 to 4 SCN ligands) and then sum them up, and find the proportion of the second one.

But wait, the complexes are [Co], [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, [Co(SCN)_3]^{3+}, and [Co(SCN)_4]^{4+}, assuming each SCN adds a charge of -1, so the charge of Co is +2. So the complexes have
