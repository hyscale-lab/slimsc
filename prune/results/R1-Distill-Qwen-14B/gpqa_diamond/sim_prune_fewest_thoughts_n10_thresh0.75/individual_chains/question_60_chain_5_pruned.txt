Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the relativity concepts, but I'll try to think it out.

The question is about time dilation in special relativity, right? So, we have an alien spacecraft traveling at a speed very close to the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old and wants to know how long the trip will take from their perspective.

Wait, wait. Let me read the question again. The spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987*c. That's super close to the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 solar years. So, the astronaut is 22, and we need to find out how old they'll be when they reach Earth. Or wait, the question is asking how long the trip takes from the astronaut's perspective. So, from their frame of reference, how much time passes.

Hmm, right. So, when you're moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, time dilation occurs. Time moves slower for the traveler compared to someone on Earth. So, if the trip takes a certain amount of time from Earth's frame, the astronaut's clock will show less time.

Wait, but wait. The problem says Earth is the destination. So, the aliens are departing from the Large Magellanic Cloud and heading to Earth. How far away is Earth from the LMC? Oh, wait, the problem doesn't give any specific distance. Hmm, that's a problem. Because without knowing the distance, how can I calculate the time?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The question is about the time experienced by the astronaut, which depends on the proper time. Proper time is the shortest time between two events in the frame where those events happen at the same place, which in this case would be the astronaut's frame.

But wait, without knowing the distance, perhaps the problem implies that the time from Earth's frame is so long that the astronaut wouldn't survive, but from their frame, the time is shorter. Let's think again.

Wait, the problem mentions the average lifetime of the aliens is roughly 150 solar years. The astronaut is 22 years old, so if the trip takes, say, 100 years from Earth's frame, the astronaut's own frame would experience less time. But if the trip takes, say, 150
