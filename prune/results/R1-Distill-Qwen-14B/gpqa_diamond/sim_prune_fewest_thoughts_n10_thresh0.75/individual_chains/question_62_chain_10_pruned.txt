Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. The question is about identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, the target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. That sounds a bit complicated, but let's break it down.

First, I'll try to visualize the target molecule. The main structure seems to have a cyclohexane ring attached to a methyl group, which in turn is connected to a hydroxyl group and another cyclohexane. Also, there's a formyl group (carbaldehyde) somewhere. So the structure is something like a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that has a methyl connected to both a hydroxyl group and another cyclohexane, and then a formyl group on the same carbon.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (triple bond attached), so it's like a sp-hybridized carbon attached to the ring. 

Now, I need to figure out the synthetic steps from ethynylcyclohexane to the target. Let's think about possible reactions.

Step 1: Ethynylcyclohexane. Let me think about possible functional group transformations. The triple bond is a good starting point. One common reaction is to hydrogenate it. So maybe hydrogenation could add hydrogens across the triple bond. Alternatively, triple bonds can be used in other reactions, but perhaps adding H2 would make it a cis or trans double bond, but wait, sometimes triple bonds are hydrogenated to single bonds.

Wait, but another thought: maybe the triple bond is converted into something else first. For example, using NaNH2 and methyl chloride... Oh, wait, that's a possibility. NaNH2 is a strong base and methyl chloride is a methylating agent. Maybe it's a deprotonation and alkylation. But wait, ethynylcyclohexane has acidic protons on the triple bond. So, perhaps the first step is to deprotonate the ethynyl group using a strong base like NaNH2, making it a strong base to abstract a proton, generating an acetylide.

So step 1: using NaNH2 and methyl chloride would form the acetylide. Wait, but methyl chloride (CH3Cl) as a methylating agent? So the acetylide (which is a strong base) would react with methyl chloride. So the reaction would be alkylation of the acetylide. That would add a methyl group to the sp-hybridized carbon. So, ethynylcyclohexane treated with NaNH2 and CH3Cl would give methylcyclohexene? Or wait, no, the ethynylcyclohexane after deprotonation is the acetylide ion. When it reacts with methyl chloride, it would form a new carbon-carbon bond. So, the triple bond would become a single bond with a methyl group attached. So, the product would be a cyclohexane ring with a -C(CH3)2 group? Let me think. No, wait, the acetylide is HC≡C-Cyclohexane. Deprotonate to form Cyclohexyl-C≡^- Na^+. Then CH3Cl would methylate it, giving Cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Wait, but that's propargyl group? No, wait, if the original is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane-CC≡CH. Reacting with NaNH2 would deprotonate the terminal H, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C^− Na^+. Then, methyl chloride would provide CH3^+ Cl^−, leading to alkylation: the acetylide would attack the methyl chloride, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So the product would be (cyclohexyl)prop-1-ynyl methyl? Wait, maybe it's (cyclohexyl)ethynyl methyl? So after step 1, we have a compound where the ethynyl group is now a propynyl group attached to a methyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexyl-C≡CH. Deprotonation with NaNH2 gives cyclohexyl-C≡C^- Na^+. Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would methylate it, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So the triple bond becomes a single bond with a methyl attached. So the structure would be cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, no, the alkylation would add a methyl to the acetylide. So the product would be CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane. Or wait, perhaps I should draw this out mentally. The ethynyl group is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane? Wait no, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group.

So after deprotonation, the structure is cyclohexyl-C≡C^- Na^+. Then, adding methyl chloride would give cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So the triple bond becomes a single bond, with a methyl group attached. So, I think it becomes a propyl group? Wait, no, the triple bond is converted into a single bond with a methyl, so the structure is cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3? No, wait, no, the alkylation adds a methyl to the acetylide.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the product. The acetylide is a strong nucleophile.
