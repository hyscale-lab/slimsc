Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I remember that binary stars orbit around a common center of mass, and their motion affects the radial velocity measurements. 

The question says there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses, and their periods are 2 years and 1 year respectively. Wait, the period is the time between two primary eclipses. I think the period here is the orbital period of the binary system, right? So the orbital period is the same as the eclipse period because they're orbiting each other, so when one passes in front, that's when the eclipse happens.

Then, the spectroscopic observations give radial velocity amplitudes. For system_1, the stars have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2's stars have 15 and 10. I need to find by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2.

Wait, I remember that in a binary system, the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the mass of the companion. Oh, right, the more massive star would have a smaller velocity amplitude because it's closer to the center of mass. So the less massive star moves more, hence higher velocity.

The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is K = (v) = (2Ï€G / (P)) * (M2 / (M1 + M2)) )^(1/3) / c, but I think I might be getting that wrong. Alternatively, there's another approach using the ratio of the velocities.

Wait, in a binary system, the two stars orbit the common center of mass. So their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So if M1 is the mass of star 1 and M2 the mass of star 2, then M1/M2 = v2/v1, where v1 and v2 are their velocities. Because the more massive star moves slower.

So in system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. Let's say the primary star (maybe the more massive one) has a smaller velocity. So the primary would have 10 km/s? Wait, no, wait. If one has higher velocity, it's less massive. So if the velocities are 10 and 5, then the star with 1
