Okay, so I've got this physics problem here and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium, right?

So the setup is: there's a glass with an index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. And this movement is towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking, what's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab? And the options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is given by v_medium = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's the speed of light in the medium when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But in this case, the glass is moving. So how does that affect the speed of light as observed?

Oh, wait, I think I need to consider this as a problem involving relative motion. Since the glass is moving, it's like the medium is moving relative to the observer. I'm trying to recall if this is a case for using the relativistic velocity addition formula or if it's something simpler.

Wait, the speed of light is always c in a vacuum, but here it's in a medium. Oh right, the speed of light in the medium is c/n when the medium is stationary. But when the medium is moving, how does that change the observed speed?

Wait, maybe I shouldn't be thinking in terms of Galilean addition because that's for non-relativistic speeds. But since
