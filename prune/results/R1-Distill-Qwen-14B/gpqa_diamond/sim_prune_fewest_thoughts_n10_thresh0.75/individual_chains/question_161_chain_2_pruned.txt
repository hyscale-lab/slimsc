Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths. Hmm, I need to figure it out step by step. Let me think.

So, the setup is Mike is using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope at 1000 kV. He's using vacuum pumps to get ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to have as few gas molecules as possible in the sample compartment because that reduces electron scattering, right? So the gas molecules are supposed to be minimal, but some still remain, as detected by the mass spec.

Mike determined the mean free path of these gas molecules under the vacuum conditions as λ1. Mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the compartment. Oh wait, the formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2)*π*d²*P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T temperature, d the diameter of the gas molecules, and P pressure. So, lower pressure would mean longer mean free path because the molecules don't collide as often.

But then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes. It's now λ2 instead of λ1. But the temperature remains the same, so T didn't change. So why would λ change?

Wait, the electron beam. Oh, right, when you have a high-energy electron beam, it can cause various effects. One thing I remember is that electrons can cause gas molecules to ionize. So if the gas is present, the electron beam hitting them could ionize the gas, creating charged particles. Or maybe even knock gas molecules out of the system because of the high energy.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam heats the sample, but wait, the question says the temperature remained the same, so thermal effects from the beam aren't the issue here.

So, when he starts the electron beam, perhaps the presence of the beam affects the gas molecules, causing them to move or change their distribution. Oh, but wait, another possibility: electron scattering. When the electron beam is on, the electrons are more likely to interact with the gas molecules, causing scattering. But how does that affect the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the factors affecting the mean free path. The main factors are pressure (
