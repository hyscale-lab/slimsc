Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

Alright, the problem gives me the angular size θ of the event horizon and the distance d to the galaxy. The question is asking for the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. Entropy of a black hole, right? I remember that the entropy (S) of a black hole is related to its area. Something like S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, c is the speed of light, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, G is the gravitational constant, and k_B is the Boltzmann constant.

Wait, right, the formula for entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). So I need to find the area A of the event horizon. The event horizon is a sphere, so A = 4π R^2, where R is the radius of the event horizon.

But how do I find R? Oh, angular size! The angular size θ is given as 10^-17 degrees. The formula for angular size is θ (in radians) ≈ R / d, since for small angles, θ ≈ tan(θ) ≈ R/d. So R ≈ θ * d.

Wait, but θ is given in degrees, so I need to convert that to radians first. Right, 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ (in radians) = 1e-17 degrees * (π radians / 180 degrees) = 1e-17 * π / 180 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

So R ≈ θ * d. The distance d is 1e10 parsecs. Oh, wait, I need to convert parsecs into meters because all the constants are in SI units. 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs * 3.086e16 m/parsec = 3.086e26 meters.

So R ≈ (1.745e-19 radians) * (3.086e26 m) ≈ let's calculate that. 1.7
