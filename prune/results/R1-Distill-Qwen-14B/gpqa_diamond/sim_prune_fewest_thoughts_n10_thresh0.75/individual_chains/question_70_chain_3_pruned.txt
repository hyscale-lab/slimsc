Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let's try to walk through it step by step.

First, I'll read the problem again. It's a series of reactions, and I need to deduce what E is. Once I know E's structure, I can determine its molecular symmetry.

The first reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, A + 8B → C. What could that be? Bright red product... Maybe something like sulfur or... wait, another thought. Oh, maybe it's a transition metal sulfide. Wait, another possibility: when sodium sulfide reacts with something? Or maybe A is an oxide reacting with something else. Alternatively, thinking about metals reacting with gases. Oh! Maybe it's a reaction forming a metal carbonyl? No, but the color might be a hint.

Wait, bright red products. I remember that mercury(II) nitrate is red, but maybe that's not relevant here. Oh! Wait, another thought. Copper sulfate is blue, but maybe copper sulfide is black. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitro compound. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction involving sulfur. Oh! Wait, when a metal reacts with sulfur, it forms a sulfide. But the product is bright red. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction involving aluminum and something else. Wait, aluminum reacts with chlorine gas, for example. 2Al + 3Cl2 → 2AlCl3. But that's white, I think. Not red.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the second reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E. E is extremely hazardous. Hmm, what reactions produce dangerous substances? Like phosgene or something else? Or maybe it's a reaction that produces something explosive or toxic.

Wait, the third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So, when C (which is a product of A and B) reacts with water, it breaks down into A, F, and G. So, C is likely a salt of some sort, perhaps a sulfide or something that hydrolyzes into acids.

Wait, if C is a sulfide, then when it reacts with water, it would produce the metal hydroxide (which would be A) and sulfurous acid (H2SO3, which is a weak acid) or sulfuric acid (H2SO4, which is strong). But wait, F is a strong acid and G is weak. So if F is H2SO4, which is strong, and G is H2S or another weak acid. But wait, sulfide might not be the right path.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride. Nitride reacting with water would produce NH3 and a strong acid. Wait, no, ammonia is a weak base. Hmm.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about the reaction of A with B. If B is a gas, maybe it's a halogen. Let's say A is an oxide, and B is a halogen. Wait, but 8 equivalents is a lot. Alternatively, perhaps B is hydrogen gas. But 8 H2 molecules reacting with A to form C? Not sure.

Wait, let's think about D. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So, D + B → H. H is a solvent. Common solvents are water, ethanol, acetone, etc. If B is a gas, perhaps D is another gas, and their reaction forms something like H2O (if B is H2 and D is O2, but that would be 2:1 ratio, not 1:1). Or maybe B is Cl2 and D is something else.

Wait, maybe B is Cl2 and D is O2. But then H would be ClO2 or something else? Not sure.

Alternatively, if H is a common solvent like ethanol, then maybe B is H2 and D is CO (carbon monoxide)? No, but CO is a gas, and H2 is a gas. But reacting 1:1, what would that produce?

Alternatively, D and B could be H2 and O2, but their ratio is 2:1 for H2O. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe H is something else. What about H being NH3? No, that's a gas. Or maybe something like HCl, but that's a gas too. Alternatively, perhaps H is a liquid like phenol or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, going back to the first reaction. If C is a bright red product, perhaps it's mercury(II) sulfide, which is red. So, HgS is bright red. So, if C is HgS, then A would be Hg (mercury metal) and B would be S (sulfur). But the reaction would be Hg + S → HgS. But the problem states that A reacts with 8 equivalents of B. So 1 mole of A reacts with 8 moles of B. So, HgS would be 1:1, which doesn't fit. So that can't be.

Another possibility: Maybe C is a metal oxide. For example, copper(II) oxide is black, not red. Alternatively, perhaps vanadium compounds? Vanadium(III) oxide is green. Wait, perhaps it's a nitro compound. Nitrobenzene is a red-brown liquid, but that's more of a solvent.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a coordination compound. Like a metal carbonyl. For example, Ni(CO)4 is a liquid, but I'm not sure about the color.

Wait, maybe C is sodium sulfide (Na2S). When sodium sulfide reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to produce NaOH (strong base, but the question says acids F and G. Hmm, but maybe the reaction is Na2S + H2O → 2NaOH + H2S↑. But H2S is a weak acid, as it's a weak acid in water. So in that case, F would be NaOH (but that's a strong base, not acid) which doesn't fit. So perhaps that's not the right path.

Wait, another approach: when C reacts with water, it produces two different acids. So, C must be a salt that yields two different anions when hydrolyzed. For example, if C is a sulfite (like Na2SO3), then it would react with water to produce H2SO3 (weak acid, so G) and another acid. Wait, but Na2SO3 + H2O ↔ 2NaOH + H2SO3. No, that's not two different acids. Or maybe if it's a different salt, like ammonium sulfide, which upon hydrolysis would produce NH4OH (a weak
