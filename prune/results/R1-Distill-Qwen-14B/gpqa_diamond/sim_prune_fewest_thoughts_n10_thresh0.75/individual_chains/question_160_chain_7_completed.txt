Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is hitting it vertically, and we're supposed to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field. Hmm, and N is infinitely large, which probably means it's approximating a circle or something smooth.

Wait, when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because a polygon with infinite sides is a circle. So maybe I can model this as a circular aperture instead of a polygon. That might simplify things.

I remember that for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a central bright spot and then rings of minima and maxima. The first minima occur at certain angles relative to the central maximum. The formula for the angle of the first minimum in single-slit diffraction is something like sinθ = λ/(a), but wait, no, that's for a single slit. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, single-slit diffraction: the minima occur at a sinθ = mλ, where m is the order. For the first minimum, m=1, so θ is arcsin(λ/a). But wait, in this case, the aperture is circular, so the formula is a bit different.

Wait, for a circular aperture, the minima are given by the zeros of the Bessel functions. The first minimum is when the argument of the Bessel function is the first zero. I think that for a circular aperture, the first minimum occurs at an angle θ where sinθ ≈ 1.22λ/(π a), but wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the condition for minima in circular diffraction is that the Bessel function J1 has a zero. The first zero of J1 is at approximately 3.8317, but wait, no. Wait, no, the zeros of J_m are at specific points. The first minimum beyond the central maximum is when the radius of the aperture in the far field corresponds to the first zero of J1, which is around 3.8317, but wait, maybe I'm mixing this up.

Alternatively, I remember that the formula for the minima in a circular aperture is when a sinθ = (m - 0.5) * λ, but I might be getting that wrong. Wait, no, I think the minima occur at θ where J1(a sinθ) = 0, and for the first minimum, the zero is at about 1.8412 times λ/(a) approximately. Wait, no, the zeros of J1 are at 3.8317, 7.0156, etc. Wait, but how does that relate to the angle?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach this differently. Oh, wait, the problem says to assume that the angles are small, so tanθ ≈ θ. That approximation will probably be useful.

In that case, for small angles, the condition for minima can be approximated. So for a circular aperture, the diffraction minima occur when a sinθ = mλ, where m is 1, 2, etc. Wait, but that's the same as the single-slit formula. But no, because for a circular aperture, the formula is a bit different.

Wait, no. Wait, the single-slit formula is a sinθ = mλ for minima. For a circular aperture, the condition is a bit more complicated because it's two-dimensional. The minima occur at a sinθ = (m)λ, but for each m, it's a ring. The first minimum would be when m=1. So the angle would be θ ≈ λ/(a). But wait, that would give the same as the single-slit, but for a circular aperture, the first minimum is actually at a larger angle than that.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up single-slit and circular apertures. For a circular aperture, the first minimum (the first dark ring) occurs at an angle θ where a sinθ ≈ 1.22 λ. So θ ≈ 1.22 λ/(a). But wait, the options don't have that. Looking at the options, option C is 1.220 λ/a, which would fit that. But the problem says N is infinitely large, so the polygon becomes a circle, so the answer should be C.

Wait, but the options are given as angular distances between the first two minima. Wait, does the question ask for the distance between the first and second minima? Because the first minimum is m=1 and the second is m=2, then the angular separation would be (2.44 λ/a) minus (1.22 λ/a) gives 1.22 λ/a? But wait, no, because for m=1 and m=2, the angles are 1.22 λ/(a) and 2.44 λ/(a). So the angular distance between the first and second minima is 2.44 -1.22=1.22 λ/a. So the separation is 1.22 λ/a. But looking at the options, option C is 1.220 λ/a. So that's the answer.

Wait, but the question says "the angular distance between the first two minima". So that's the first minimum (m=1) and the second minimum (m=2). So the separation would be (m=2 angle) - (m=1 angle) = (2.44 -1.22) * λ/(a) = 1.22 λ/a. So that's option C.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Oh, wait, the problem says 'the first two minima'—so the two minima adjacent to the central maximum. So the first minimum is the first one, and the second is the next one. So their positions are 1.22 λ/a and 2.44 λ/a. The angular separation between them is 1.22, which is option C.

Wait, but another way to think about it: the problem states that when N is infinitely large, which makes it a circle, so the diffraction pattern is the same as a circular aperture. So the formula for the minima in the far field is when a sinθ = 1.22 λ, so θ is about 1.22 λ/(a). But wait, that's the first minimum. The second minimum would be at 2.44 λ/(a). So the angular distance between the first and second minima is 2.44 - 1.22 = 1.22 lambda/a. So the answer is 1.220 λ/a, which is option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If the first minimum is at m=1, the angle is theta1 = (1.22 λ)/(a). The second minimum is at m=2, theta2 = (2.44 λ)/(a). So the angular separation is theta2 - theta1 = 1.22 λ/a. So yes, the correct answer is C.


When the aperture is shaped like an N-sided polygon with all apothems of length \(a\), and \(N \to \infty\), the aperture approximates a circle. For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern consists of intensity minima determined by the zeros of the Bessel function \(J_1\). The first minimum occurs at an angle \(\theta_1\) where \(a \sin\theta_1 = 1.22 \lambda\), and the second minimum occurs at \(\theta_2\) where \(a \sin\theta_2 = 2.44 \lambda\). 

The angular distance between the first and second minima is given by:

\[
\Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{2.44 \lambda}{a} - \frac{1.22 \lambda}{a} = \frac{1.22 \lambda}{a}.
\]

This matches option C. Therefore, the angular distance between the first two minima is \(1.22 \lambda / a\).

Answer: C
