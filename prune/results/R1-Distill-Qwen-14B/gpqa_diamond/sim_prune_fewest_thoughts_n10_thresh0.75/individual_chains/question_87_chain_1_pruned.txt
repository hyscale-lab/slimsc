Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that we have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. Wait, di-substituted means there are two substituents on the ring, right? And the total number of carbon atoms is 8. Hmm, wait, a benzene ring (which is 6 carbons) plus two substituents. So each substituent would add a certain number of carbons. Let me think: benzene has 6, so substituents contribute 2 more. That could mean each substituent is a single carbon, like two methyl groups, but wait, the substituents are probably different because it's di-substituted with two different groups.

Wait, the problem also mentions the FTIR spectrum has peaks indicating a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Ar-X, where X is Cl, Br, etc.). So the substituents on the aromatic ring must include a carbonyl group and a halogen.

Wait, but substituents can be anything. So if the aromatic ring has two groups attached: one is a carbonyl-containing group, the other is a halogen. Or maybe one substituent includes both a carbonyl and a halogen? That seems less likely because that would complicate the structure more.

Wait, the aromatic ring is di-substituted, so two different groups. Let's think about possible structures. Maybe one substituent is a -COOR group (like an ester) and the other is a halogen (like Cl). Alternatively, one could be a ketone (like a carbonyl) and the other a halogen. Or maybe one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, and the other is a halogen attached directly.

But wait, the aromatic ring has 6 carbons. The substituents add two carbons to make the compound have 8 in total. So each substituent must add one carbon each. Because 6 (ring) + 2 substituents (each adding one C) = 8. So each substituent is a single carbon group.

So substituent 1: perhaps a carbonyl group, which can be -COOH, but that would add two carbons (the COOH is O and two carbons?), wait no, COOH is a substituent with one
