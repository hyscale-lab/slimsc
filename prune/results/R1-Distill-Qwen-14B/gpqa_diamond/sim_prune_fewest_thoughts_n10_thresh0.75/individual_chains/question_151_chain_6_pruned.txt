Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a particular value of an observable. I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by matrices, and the probabilities are calculated using eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but I think quantum states are usually represented as column vectors, and they should be normalized. Oh wait, right, I should check if this state is normalized. To normalize, I need to calculate the inner product of the vector with itself.

So the state vector is ψ = [-1, 2, 1]^T. So the inner product would be (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6), which means the state isn't normalized. That's a problem because probabilities should sum to 1. So I think I need to normalize this state first.

Wait, but the problem statement probably assumes that the state is already normalized, or did I miss something? Let me think again. The elements are (-1, 2, 1), which sum squares to 6. So the actual state vector would be ψ = 1/sqrt(6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T. Because the norm is sqrt(6), so to normalize, each component is multiplied by 1/sqrt(6).

But wait, the question says the state is given by that matrix. Maybe I should proceed without normalizing, but then the probabilities might not sum to 1. Hmm, maybe the problem expects me to proceed with the given vector as is. Alternatively, perhaps the vectors are considered as unnormalized, but the probabilities are calculated correctly.

Wait, no, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors must be normalized because the probabilities must sum to 1. So perhaps the state in the problem is normalized, but maybe I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me check again: (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, and 1^2 is 1. 1+4+1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state's length is sqrt(6
