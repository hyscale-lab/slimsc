Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about quantum field theory and Feynman diagrams. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that a colleague has a Feynman diagram with a note next to it. The note has an expression involving some constants and ratios. The expression is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. The task is to find out how many loops the diagram has based on this.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the order in perturbation theory and the superficial degree of divergence, but wait, maybe more directly, each loop contributes a certain factor to the amplitude.

Wait, another thought: the superficial degree of divergence (SDD) formula tells us the power counting for loops. The formula is D = 4 - L*( (m + n) ), where L is the number of loops, m and n are something else. Wait, no, I think the correct formula is D = 4L - 2I + V, but that's getting complicated. Maybe I should think in terms of Feynman diagram scaling.

Each loop typically contributes a factor of (some constant) * (momentum integral), which when evaluated, gives a factor involving 1/(16 pi^2), since that's from the loop integral in 4 dimensions. Wait, actually, the loop integral in four dimensions for a scalar loop would give something like 1/( (4 pi)^2 ) each loop. So each loop adds a 1/(4 pi)^2 factor.

Looking at the expression given: the factors are alpha^3, g^2, sqrt(2), 8, 1/(4pi)^6, and (Q/M)^2. Let me break this down. The 1/(4pi)^6 part seems crucial because it's a product of factors each from loops.

Each loop contributes (4 pi)^(-2n) where n is the number of loops, right? Because each loop brings in a 1/(4 pi)^2. So 1/(4 pi)^6 would suggest 3 loops, because 2 * 3 =6 in the denominator's exponent.

Wait, but wait, the expression is 1/(4 pi)^6. So that would suggest 3 loops, each contributing a 1/(4 pi)^2 term. So 3 loops, which would be option D.

But wait, are there any other factors that contribute to the denominator? For example, sometimes you have factors from vertices or propagators that could add to the count. Or perhaps the other constants like sqrt(2) or 8 might influence the loop count.

Let me think about the overall scaling. Feynman diagrams have their amplitudes scaling with the number of loops. Each loop generally brings a factor proportional to (momentum cutoff)^{something}, but in dimensional regularization, it's more about the number of loops and the integral dimensions.

But in terms of the 4 pi factors, each loop in a Feynman diagram in 4 dimensions contributes a 1/(4 pi)^2. So for a one-loop diagram, you get 1/(4 pi)^2. Two loops would be 1/(
