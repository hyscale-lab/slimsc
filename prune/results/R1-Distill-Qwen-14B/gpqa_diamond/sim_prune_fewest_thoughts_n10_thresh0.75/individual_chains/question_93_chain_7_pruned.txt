Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this qPCR question. Let me start by recalling what I know about qPCR and calibration curves.

The scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran three technical replicates for each concentration. The efficiency was 100%, which means the reaction is perfect—each cycle doubles the DNA. The R² is 1, so the data fits the curve perfectly, meaning a good correlation between concentration and Ct values.

The slope given is -3.3. Hmm, I remember that the slope in a qPCR calibration curve relates to the efficiency. The formula for the slope is slope = log10(efficiency) / log10(2), but wait, wait. Wait, no. The standard formula for the slope is - (1 / efficiency) * ln(10), but I might be mixing things up. Wait, another approach: when efficiency is 100% (which is 1 in decimal), the slope is usually around -3.322 because ln(10)/ln(2) is approximately 3.3219. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh, right, the expected slope for a 100% efficient reaction is -3.322. Because the equation for the standard curve is Ct = slope * log10(initial copies) + intercept. So, the slope is - (1 / (1 - efficiency)) * log10(efficiency) or something like that? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the calculation. 

At 100% efficiency (efficiency =1), the formula for the slope is -log10(2)/log10(efficiency). Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the standard equation for qPCR is Ct = Ct0 - log10(initial conc) / slope, but I think the slope is usually around -3.32, which for 100% efficiency. So in this case, the slope is -3.3, which is very close to the expected value. So that part looks correct.

Now, looking at the data: The Ct values for each concentration are as follows.

At 100,000 copies: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5 → average around 34.2.

At 10,000: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2 → average ~30.9.

At 1000: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9 → ~27.6.

At 100: 24, 24.3, 24.6 → ~24.3.

At 10: 20.7, 21, 21.3 → ~21.

Wait, but wait, the Ct values should be inversely proportional to the copy number—lower Ct means more copies. So higher concentrations should have lower Ct values. Let me check:

100,000 → Ct ~34.2

10,000 → ~30.9 → which is lower, but wait, 10,000 is 10 times less than 100,000. So a 10-fold dilution. Each dilution should lead to an increase in Ct by about 3.3 cycles because of the 100% efficiency. Because with 100% efficiency, each dilution (10x) would cause a 3.3 cycle increase (since log2(10) is ~3.32). So each 10x dilution would add ~3.3 to the Ct.

Looking at the data:

From 100,000 to 10,000 is a 10x dilution. Ct goes from ~34.2 to ~30.9. The difference is about 3.3 cycles. So that's perfect. 

From 10,000 to 1000 → another 10x dilution. Ct goes from ~30.9 to ~27.6 → difference is 3.3 again. Good.

From 1000 to 100 → 10x, Ct from ~27.6 to ~24.3 → 3.3 again. Perfect.

From 100 to 10 → 10x, Ct from ~24.3 to ~21 → that's a difference of 3.3. So all these steps are consistent with a 10x dilution causing a 3.3 cycle increase, which fits with 100% efficiency.

But wait, the question is about discrepancies in the results. The options are suggesting something is wrong.

Wait, the question says: "Which of the following explains the discrepancies in his results?" But according to the data, the Ct values are in a perfect 3.3 cycle difference between each 10x dilution. So the data are consistent.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me read the question again. The scientist's results are as given. He made a calibration curve using known concentrations, and the options are about why there's a discrepancy. But according to the data, there's no discrepancy. All the Ct's are as expected. So why is the question asking about discrepancies?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the data. Wait, looking at the individual data points. For each concentration, he has three technical replicates. Let's calculate the standard deviation or the range.

At 100,000: 33.9,34.2,34.5 → range is 0.6. Average is 34.2.

At 10,000: 30.6,30.9,31.2 → range 0.6, average 30.9.

At 1000: 27.3,27.6,27.9 → range 0.6, average 27.6.

At 100: 24,24.3,24.6 → range 0.6, average 24.3.

At 10: 20.7,21,21.3 → range 0.6, average 21.

So each set of
