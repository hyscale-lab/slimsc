Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to tackle. Let me see what I can figure out. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are between different propenyl and butenyl acetates, specifically cis and trans isomers.

First, I should recall what these compounds look like. Acetates are esters, so the structure would be something like R-O-CO-OCH3, wait no, wait, wait. Wait, acetate esters are usually like R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait. Acetate is from acetic acid, so the ester would be R-O-CO-CH3. Oh right, because acetic acid is CH3COOH; when it forms an ester, it's R-O-CO-CH3.

So the compounds given are propenyl and butenyl acetates. Let's think about their structures. Propenyl would have three carbons in the R group. Propenyl is CH2CH2CH2? Wait, no. Wait, propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2- but wait, that's propenyl. Wait, maybe I should clarify.

Wait, propenyl groups are either CH2=CHCH2- or CH2CH2CH- with a double bond. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- but that might vary. Wait, propenyl is an allyl group, so it's CH2=CHCH2- attached to the ester oxygen. Similarly, butenyl would have four carbons with a double bond.

Wait, but butenyl is four carbons. So if it's propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait. Wait, the ester is R-O-CO-OCH3, but wait, acetate esters are R-O-CO-CH3. So for propenyl acetate, R is CH2CH2CH2? No, wait. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. But wait, wait, but the position of the double bond matters. Because for cis or trans, the substituents on the double bond would vary.

Wait, but the question is about whether the substituents on the double bond are on the same side (cis) or opposite (trans). So when the propenyl or butenyl group is attached to the oxygen, the double bond's configuration will affect the NMR.

Looking at the NMR data: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), 1.6 (3H, d).

Let me break this down. The 2.1 ppm singlet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to something deshielded, maybe an ester. Because in acetate esters, the CH3 of the acetyl group is around 2.1-2.2 ppm as a singlet. So that fits.

Then, the 1.6 ppm (3H, d) is a doublet of a methyl group. That's probably a CH3 attached to a CH2, which is adjacent to a double bond. Because in allylic positions, the CH2 groups next to double bonds can split the methyl protons. So the structure might have a CH2CH2CH2 group but with a double bond.

Wait, the 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) is a doublet of quadruplets or a doublet with coupling. That suggests a proton that's near other protons with different coupling constants. Maybe it's a vinylic proton (on a double bond), but perhaps part of a trans
