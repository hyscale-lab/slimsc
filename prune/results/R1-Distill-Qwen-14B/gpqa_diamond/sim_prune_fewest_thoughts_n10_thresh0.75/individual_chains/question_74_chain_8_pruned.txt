Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but let's try to think it through. The question is about an atom that hasn't decayed after 50 minutes and we need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The key point is that the decay process is independent of the time that has already passed. Oh wait, no, wait. No, the probability depends on the time that passes. But each atom's decay is a random event, so knowing it hasn't decayed for a certain time doesn't change its probability in the future. So maybe the probability is the same as if it was a fresh atom.

Wait, but the question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So in 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance it has decayed. That means the half-life isn't directly given, but I can probably find the decay constant from that information.

The decay formula is N(t) = N0 * e^(-位t). The probability of decay is 1 - e^(-位t). So in this case, after 100 minutes, the probability is 32% or 0.32.

So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-位 * 100). Let me rearrange that. e^(-位 *100 ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.

Taking the natural log of
