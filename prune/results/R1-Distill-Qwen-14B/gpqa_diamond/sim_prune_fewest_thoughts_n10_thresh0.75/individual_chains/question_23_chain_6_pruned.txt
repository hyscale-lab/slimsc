Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about reacting (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. Then, the TLC shows the reactant spot is smaller, and two new spots have formed. I need to figure out which products are formed from the given options.

First, let's understand the structure of the starting material. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Breaking it down: the benzene ring has an ether group (O-) attached. The other part is a butenyl group. Butenyl means four carbons with a double bond. The substituents are at position 2 and 2 (so two methyl groups on the second carbon), and the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. So the structure is like benzene-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, the but-3-en-1-yl group would have the double bond between C3 and C4 when counting from the O. So the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but wait, that doesn't make sense because butenyl is four carbons with a double bond. Let me draw it out.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl: the chain is four carbons, with the double bond starting at the third carbon. So numbering from the O, which is on the first carbon? No, wait, the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl. So the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth? No, wait, but 3-en would mean between C3 and C4, but that's not possible for a four-carbon chain. Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl: the substituent is attached at position 1 (the first carbon), and the double bond is between 3 and 4. So the structure would be:

O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between carbons 3
