Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about a diatomic molecule made of atoms X and Y. They're in their fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state.

First, let's parse the given data. The masses are Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the ground state. So it's the lowest energy state for both rotation and vibration. But wait, the question is about moving to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, right, so that would be the next higher state, which could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state.

But wait, the non-rigid rotor model is being used here. Oh, wait, I remember that the non-rigid rotor model is for molecules where the bond length isn't fixed, so it can stretch and compress. But I might be mixing that up with the vibration part. The rotation-vibration model probably considers both rotational and vibrational energy levels.

In the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized. For a diatomic molecule, the energy levels are given by something like E_rot = B * J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as well, with E_vib = (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is the vibrational quantum number.

So the total energy of the molecule would be the sum of vibrational and rotational energies. So when the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, I think that means the ground state where both n and J are at their lowest values.

Wait, the fundamental state, I think, is the lowest vibrational state (n=0) with the lowest rotational state (J=0). But sometimes, the ground state is considered as the state of lowest energy, which might have J
