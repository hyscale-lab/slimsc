Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's going on.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). Then, after some time, they checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot was smaller, and two new spots appeared. We're supposed to choose which products are formed from the options given.

Hmm, let me break this down. The starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. I think I should draw the structure to visualize it better. So the benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether is O attached to a butenyl group, which is four carbons long. The substituents on the butenyl group are: at position 2, two methyl groups, and the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, no, wait. Let's number correctly. The butenyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-O-? Wait, no, the structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So the butenyl group is four carbons: the first carbon (1) is the one attached to oxygen, then at carbon 2, two methyl groups, and the double bond is between 3 and 4. So structure is CH2-O-benzene, then the rest is CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but wait, wait: No, but-3-en-1-yl means the double bond is between C3 and C4. Wait, but butenyl is four carbons. So 1 is the one attached to O. Then 2 is the next. So the structure is:

O

O-benzene

CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2?

Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, wait, but for butenyl, four carbons. The numbering would be 1,2,3,4. So
