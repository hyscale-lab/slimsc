Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let me start by understanding the information given.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations. The key point here is their brightness limits. From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, while HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So, the star's apparent magnitude has to be less than or equal to 16 to be seen by HIRES, and less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO. But wait, the question says "brighter than," so I think that means apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 16 for HIRES and less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO because stars with lower (brighter) magnitudes are more easily observed.

Wait, no, the wording is a bit tricky. The question states that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. Brighter means lower magnitude. So if a star is brighter (lower V mag) than 17, which would be V < 17, it can be observed. Similarly, with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 mag can be observed, so V <16 mag.

So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V mag must be less than 16 (since HIRES requires V <16). Wait, but wait: The question is which stars can be detected by both. So they must be visible to both spectrographs, which implies their apparent V magnitude must be <=16 (for HIRES) and <=17 (for ESPRESSO). Therefore, the star must be brighter than 17 would be too faint for ESPRESSO, but for both, it must be brighter than 17? Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17, which means V ≤17. Because a star with V=17 is the limit, so anything brighter (V <17) is acceptable. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, meaning V ≤16. So a star must have V ≤16 to be seen by both. Because for both to see it, it must be bright enough for both. So HIRES is more sensitive (or has a lower limit) than ESPRESSO. So any star with apparent V mag ≤16 can be seen by both.

But wait, let me check each star's apparent magnitude.

Let me go through each star one by one.

Star1: absolute V mag is 15.5, distance 10 pc. So using the distance modulus formula: m = M +5 log10(d/10). So d is 10 pc, so log(1)=0. So m =15.5 + 0 =15.5. So apparent V mag is 15.5. Which is less than 16, so it can be seen by both. But wait, I need to check if
