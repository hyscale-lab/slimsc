Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, I need to figure out the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame over a certain time as measured in the ejecta's frame. Let me try to break it down.

Okay, the problem says the supernova's ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames, so I don't have to worry about acceleration or changing frames abruptly. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, so in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s? Or is it the other way around? Hmm, no, in the problem statement, it says the ejecta part is moving towards the center in the Galaxy's frame. But from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them. Oh right, because if one frame is moving towards another, the other frame sees the first approaching as well, but in opposite direction.

Wait, so if in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at velocity v towards the center, then from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is approaching at the same speed v, but in the opposite direction. So the problem says that from the ejecta's frame, the center is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center, right? I think that's correct because velocities are relative between frames. So if the ejecta is moving towards the center at v, the center would appear to move towards the ejecta at v in the ejecta's frame.

Now, the question is asking: what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, time is measured in the ejecta's frame. But wait, time intervals in different frames can be different due to time dilation if the frames are moving relative to each other at a significant fraction of the speed of light. Oh, wait, but 60,000 km/s is a big speed. Let me calculate the speed as a fraction of the speed of light. The speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 0.2
