Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mouse model. Let's think through this step by step.

The question says that the researcher introduced a coding sequence for GADD45G with a single influenza hemagglutinin determinant at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed as expected.

Looking at the given DNA sequence, it's the plus strand. I'm thinking about the structure of a typical gene construct. The construct should have a promoter, the coding sequence (CDS) with the hemagglutinin tag, and possibly a terminator or other elements.

Wait, the given sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon (methionine). Then it goes through various codons. Let me check if the sequence is correct. Oh wait, maybe there's an issue with the reading frame or the presence of a stop codon somewhere.

Hmm, looking at the sequence, I should scan for any stop codons (TAA, TAG, or TGA). Let's go through it. The first few codons: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA... Oh wait, hold on. TGA is a stop codon. Oh, so here's the problem. The sequence has a TGA in the middle of the coding region, which would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early.

Wait, let me see. The construct includes the coding sequence for GADD45G with the HA tag. The HA tag is a short peptide, so it's at the N-terminus. So the sequence starts with ATG, which is correct. But looking at the sequence provided, I see a TGA later on. Let me count the letters. The sequence is:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ... rest of the sequence.

Wait, in the sequence, after ATG (which is +1 to +3), the next codons are TAC (tyrosine), CCA (proline), TAC (tyrosine), GAT (aspartic acid), Gtt (valine), etc. Then comes CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA... So TGA is at position ... let me see, each codon is 3 bases. Let's count: ATG (1-3), TAC (4-6), CCA (7-9), TAC (10-12), GAT (13-15), Gtt (16-18), CCA (19-21), GAT (22-24), TAC (25-27), GCC (28-30), AAA (31-33), TGA (34-36). So the TGA is at positions 34-36, which is a stop codon for the first frame.

If the construct includes this TGA in the coding sequence, then the ribosome would stop translating at that point, producing a truncated protein. That's probably why the protein isn't overexpressedâ€”it's being cut off early.

Looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated the translation early. That fits. Because the TGA is present in the coding sequence, the ribosome would stop there, so the full-length protein isn't made.

Another option to consider is option D: the tRNA for the UAA codon doesn't exist in the mouse. Wait, but the construct is in a plasmid transfected into CHO cells, not mouse cells. CHO cells are mammalian, so similar to mouse in terms of tRNA availability. Also, the presence of the TGA is a stop codon, so that's more likely the issue.

Option A: HA sequence has a mutation. The HA is at the N-terminus, but the problem here is the presence of a stop codon, so A might not be the main
