Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on my stereochemistry, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the question gives seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many of them exhibit optical activity. The options are A) 5, B) 3, C) 2, D) 4.

First, I remember that a compound exhibits optical activity if it has chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. If there are any such centers, the compound could be chiral and thus optically active. Except in cases where there's a plane of symmetry or some other form of internal compensation, but I'll get back to that.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.
I need to draw the structure. The double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl, a CH2CH3 (since it's 2-methyl), and a double bond to C2. Wait, wait. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but it's but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-C double bond to CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Butene is four carbons. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, and a methyl on C2. So the structure is Cl-C double bond to CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, butene is four carbons: positions 1, 2, 3, 4. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1. 2-methyl would be a methyl on C2.
