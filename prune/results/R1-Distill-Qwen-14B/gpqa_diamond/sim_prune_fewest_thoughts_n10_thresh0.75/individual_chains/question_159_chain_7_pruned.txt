Alright, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology, and I need to figure it out. Hmm. Okay, let me start breaking it down.

The question says that observations of a quasar are made in the near infrared and optical spectrum. There's a peak at about 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that. So, I think this is referring to the Lyman-alpha forest or something related to emission lines. Wait, the Lyman-alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet, right? But if the quasar's emission is observed in the infrared, that must mean it's redshifted. Oh right, because as the universe expands, wavelengths stretch.

Wait, wait. The peak is at 790 nm. So I'm trying to remember, what is the rest wavelength of certain emission lines. Lyman-alpha is at about 121 nm, which is in the UV. So if the observed wavelength is longer, that's due to redshift. So the observed wavelength λ_obs = 790 nm. The rest wavelength λ_rest is 121 nm. So the redshift z is (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1. Let me compute that: 790 / 121 is approximately 6.5289. So z ≈ 5.5289, right? Or wait, is that correct? Because 121 * 6.5289 is around 790? Let me check: 121 *6 is 726, 0.5289 *121 is about 64, so 726+64=790. Yeah, so z is 5.5289.

Wait, but wait. Could this be the Lyman-alpha emission? Or maybe another line? Alternatively, sometimes quasars exhibit emission lines in the optical or infrared, but I'm pretty sure Lyman-alpha is a prominent one. So assuming it's Lyman-alpha, that gives a redshift of about 5.5.

Now the question is about the comoving distance to the quasar. The comoving distance is a way to measure distance in cosmology, considering the expansion of the universe. The formula for comoving distance depends on the cosmological parameters given.

The parameters given are: H0 (Hubble constant) is 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ω
