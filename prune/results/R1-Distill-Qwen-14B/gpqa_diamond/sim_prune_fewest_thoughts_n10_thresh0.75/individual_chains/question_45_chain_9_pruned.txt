Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with quantum mechanics yet. But let's give it a shot.

The question says we've got four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. We need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system, expressed in terms of E, where E is given as pi²ħ²/(2mL²). The options are A to D, each giving different combinations.

Wait, so E is the ground state energy for a single particle in this well. Right, because for a 1D infinite well, the energy levels are E_n = (n² pi² ħ²)/(2mL²), so each particle's energy depends on its quantum number n.

But wait, these are four identical fermions. So, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning no two can have the same set of quantum numbers. Since they're spin-1/2, each can have two possible spin states (up and down). So, each spatial state can hold two particles.

Hmm, the particles are in the same potential well, so their wavefunctions will be in the same spatial part but with different quantum numbers or spins. So, we have to figure out the lowest possible energy states by filling up the available quantum states according to the Pauli exclusion.

Let me think: the ground state would have the lowest possible energies for all four particles. Since each energy level can hold two particles (because of spin up and down), the first level (n=1) can take two, the second level (n=2) can take two. But wait, we have four particles. So, in the ground state, two particles go to n=1, and two to n=2. Because n=1 is the lowest, then n=2 is next.

Wait, but wait. Each particle's state is determined by both n and spin. So for each n, there are two possible states (spin up and spin down). So, for n=1, we can have two particles: one spin up and one spin down. Similarly for n=2, another two particles.

So, the ground state would have the four particles filling the lowest two available n levels with both spin states filled.

So the energies would be 2 particles at n=1 and 2 at n=2. Each particle's energy is E_n = n² E, since E is
