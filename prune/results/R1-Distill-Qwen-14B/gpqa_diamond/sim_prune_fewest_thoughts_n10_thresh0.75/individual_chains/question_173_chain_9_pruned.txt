Okay, so I have this physics problem about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember from my studies that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. Let me think. The principle states that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. 

The question gives me the uncertainty in position, Δx, which is 0.1 nanometers. Wait, nanometers are 10^-9 meters, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters. Got that. And the electron is moving at v=2e8 m/s. Oh wait, but do I need that velocity for the calculation? Hmm, maybe not directly, because the uncertainty principle relates position and momentum, not velocity. But perhaps I can relate them.

So, I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. I think that's linked to the uncertainty in momentum through the kinetic energy formula. Because the kinetic energy E is (p²)/(2m), where p is momentum and m is mass. So the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be related to the uncertainty in p, Δp.

Wait, but first, let's calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum. From Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So solving for Δp gives Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx). Since ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Let me plug in the numbers.

Δx is 0.1 nm = 1e-10 m. So 2Δx is 2e-10 m. So Δp ≥ (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-10). Let me compute that. 1.0545718e-34 divided by 2e-10 is approximately 5.27e-25 kg·m/s. So Δp is about 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

Now, the energy uncertainty ΔE is related to the momentum uncertainty. Since E = p²/(2m), the uncertainty ΔE would be (Δp)^2/(2m). Wait, but wait. That's if Δp is the uncertainty in the momentum. So plugging in the numbers:

m is the mass of the electron, which is about 9.1
