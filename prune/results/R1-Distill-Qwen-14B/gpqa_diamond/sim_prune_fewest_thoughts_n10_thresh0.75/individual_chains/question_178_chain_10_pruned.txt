Okay, so I have this Lagrangian given, and I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable. Hmm. Let me start by recalling what I know about Lagrangians and renormalizability.

The Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. So σ is an antisymmetric tensor made from the gamma matrices. And F is the field strength tensor, probably from a gauge field since it's antisymmetric too.

Wait, but wait, the variables here—what fields are involved? The ψ is a spinor, probably a fermion. So F^{mu nu} must come from a gauge field A_mu, since F is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism or non-abelian gauge theories. But the exact type might not matter right now.

To find the mass dimension of κ, I need to know the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has mass dimension 4 in 4 spacetime dimensions because the action is dimensionless, and the integral over d^4x (which has mass dimension -4) requires the integrand (the Lagrangian) to have dimension 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So L_int = κ (ψ̄ σ ψ F) must have dimension 4. Let's find the dimensions of each part.

First, ψ is a spinor. In four dimensions, a Dirac spinor has mass dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ (which is the adjoint spinor) also has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ ψ would be (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. But wait, in this case, it's ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ. Hmm, sigma is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, right? Because gamma matrices are just matrices, not operators with dimensions. So σ_{mu nu} is dimensionless.

So ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ has the same dimension as ψ̄ ψ, which is 3. Then F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor. For a gauge field, like in electromagnetism, F is ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu. So each A_mu is a vector potential. What's the mass dimension of A_mu? In four dimensions, the gauge field A_mu has dimension 1. Because the field strength F has dimension 2: since F is ∂A, and ∂ has dimension 1, so F is 1 (A) + 1 (from derivative) = 2.

So F^{mu nu} has dimension 2.

Putting it all together: the term ψ̄ σ Fψ has dimension (3) [from ψ̄ ψ] + (2) [from F] = 5. Wait, but the entire Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So the product of terms is [κ] [ψ̄ σ F
