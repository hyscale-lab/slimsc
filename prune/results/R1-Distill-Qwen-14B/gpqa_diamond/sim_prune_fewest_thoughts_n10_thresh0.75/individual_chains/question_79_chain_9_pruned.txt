Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I need to figure out which compound X is. Let me start by reading the question carefully. 

The reaction is between compound X (with the formula C11H12O) and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and I need to match them to the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the formation of epoxides. Wait, no, actually, I think that's for the ring-opening of epoxides. Oh wait, wait. No, wait. I think the reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is typically used in the epoxidation of alkenes. Oh right, that's the thing. The reagent, also known as DABCO, is used to catalyze the oxidation of alkenes with peracids to form epoxides. But wait, wait. No, wait. DABCO is a base, isn't it used in ring-opening of epoxides? Or in other reactions? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, another possibility is that the reaction forms an epoxide from a diene or something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a acid catalyzed ring-opening? Or maybe it's a different kind of reaction. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the product structure.

Looking at the product's NMR: the 1H NMR shows several signals. Let me list them:

1H NMR:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s): A singlet, so three equivalent protons, probably on a carbon with no neighboring Hs. Maybe a methyl group attached to something that doesn't split the signal, like an electronegative atom or a ring.
- δ 2.31 (3H, s): Another singlet, same as above. So two singlets around 2.3 ppm, each 3H. Could be two methyl groups attached somewhere, maybe to an oxygen or a carbonyl group.
- Then there are some aromatic signals: 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). So a total of 6 aromatic protons, which suggests maybe a para-substituted benzene ring or something similar. Wait, but let's think about this.

Wait, aromatic signals usually come in certain patterns based on substitution. For example, a para-substituted benzene would have two doublets, each integrating to 2H each, but here we have 1H, 2H, 1H, 2H. Hmm, maybe it's not a benzene ring but a substituted styryl group or some kind of vinyl group attached to a benzene.

Looking at the 13C NMR data:

13C NMR:
- 21.3 (1C, s): Probably a methyl group attached to something, like CH3-O or such.
- 28.4 (1C, s): Another CH3, perhaps attached to a carbon adjacent to something else.
- 126.9 (2C, s): Two carbons with similar shifts, maybe in a conjugated system.
- 127.1 (1C, s): Another aromatic or conjugated carbon.
- 129.1 (2C, s): More aromatic carbons.
- 130.3 (1C, s): Another aromatic.
- 141.5 (1C, s): A quaternary carbon, maybe a carbonyl or an oxygen-bearing carbon.
- 144.1 (1C, s): Another quaternary, perhaps part of a ring.
- 197.7 (1C,
