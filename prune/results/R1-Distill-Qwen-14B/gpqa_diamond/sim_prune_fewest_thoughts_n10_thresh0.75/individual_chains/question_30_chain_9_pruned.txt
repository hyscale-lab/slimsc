Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the color of light absorbed by a textile dye. Hmm, the question says that the dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. I remember that when a substance absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it emits others, right? So maybe the emitted light is what's called the complementary color of what's absorbed.

Wait, energy and wavelength are related. Oh right, the energy of a photon is given by E = hc/Î», where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. So higher energy means shorter wavelength. I think visible light goes from violet (shorter wavelength, higher energy) to red (longer wavelength, lower energy).

Let me see, what's the energy range for visible light? I remember that red is around 1.8 to 2.1 eV, maybe. Violet is higher, like around 2.3 to 3 eV. Wait, that might be the energy for violet. So if the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, that's in the violet range. But wait, wait. No, wait, when a substance emits light, that emission is usually due to electrons dropping from a higher energy state to a lower one. The energy of the emitted photon would correspond to the difference in energy levels. But the question is about the absorbed light. Oh, right! The absorbed light is the one that causes the electrons to get excited. So the energy of the absorbed photon would be higher than the emitted one.

Wait no, the energy of the absorbed light is what's used to excite the electrons. So the
