Okay, so I have this question about quasars and their observations in the near infrared and optical spectrum. Hmm, let me read it again. So, the observations show a peak at about 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that. I'm supposed to figure out the comoving distance of this quasar from Earth based on the Lambda-CDM model parameters given.

Wait, the question mentions the comoving distance at scale factor a=1, which I think is the current universe, so that's the comoving distance to the quasar when the light we see was emitted. Or wait, no, comoving distance is a way to describe distances in an expanding universe. For a=1, that's the present time, so the comoving distance would be the distance now. But quasars are very far away, so this must relate to their luminosity or something else.

Wait, the peak at 790 nm in the near infrared. Oh, I remember that quasars can have emission lines, like Lyman-alpha, which is around 121 nm in the ultraviolet. So if the peak is at 790 nm, that might be due to some kind of redshift. Because the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted wavelength, so redshifted.

So if the emitted wavelength is, say, 121 nm (Lyman-alpha), and the observed is ~790 nm. So the redshift z would be (790 / 121) -1, right? Let me calculate that. 790 divided by 121 is about 6.529, so z is about 5.529. Wait, but sometimes the peak might not be Lyman-alpha. Alternatively, maybe it's the Balmer series, like H-alpha at 656 nm. So if observed 790 is longer than that, so z would be (790 / 656) -1, which is about 1.82. Hmm, but I'm not sure what line it is. The problem says it's a peak in the near infrared and flux drops below that. So maybe it's a broad emission line, but which one?

Alternatively, perhaps the peak corresponds to the Lyman limit or Lyman-alpha. Let me think. The Lyman-alpha line is at 121.6 nm. If observed at 790 nm, that would imply
