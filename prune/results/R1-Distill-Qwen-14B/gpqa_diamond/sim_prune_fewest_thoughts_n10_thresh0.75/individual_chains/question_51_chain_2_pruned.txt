Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the net potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says: a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to calculate the net potential energy of this system. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Wait, potential energy in electrostatics... right, potential energy between charges. But wait, the sphere is conducting and grounded. Oh, that's important. Grounded means the sphere is connected to the earth, so any excess charge would go into the ground, right? Or wait, no, wait. Wait, when a conductor is grounded, it means that its potential is fixed at the earth's potential, which is zero. So the sphere's potential is zero.

Wait, but how does that affect the charge on the sphere? If the sphere is conducting, charges will reside on its surface. But since it's grounded, any charge added to it can just flow away. So when we place a charge near it, how does the sphere respond?

Hmm. Let me think about the image method or induced charges. When a charge is placed near a conductor, it induces charges on the conductor's surface. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges can flow to the ground. So, maybe the sphere will have no net charge because any induced charges can leave to ground. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the charge q is outside the sphere, the induced charges would
