Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and then asks about the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are different symmetry groups, like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. I'm a bit rusty on my molecular symmetry, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let me list out all the reactions given:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

Hmm. So, I need to figure out what E is, then determine its molecular symmetry.

Let me start by trying to identify the compounds involved. Solvents are often common ones like water, ethanol, etc., but H is a solvent formed from D and B in a 1:1 ratio. Let's think about possible reactions.

Looking at reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). If B is a gas, maybe something like HCl, NH3, or another gas. Wait, but D is also a gas. Let me think about possible gases for D and B that would form a common solvent when reacting 1:1.

Wait, if B is a gas, and D is another gas, perhaps they're both halogens? No, probably not. Another thought: maybe B is NH3 and D is HCl. Then H would be NH4Cl, which is a solid, not really a solvent. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Wait, if D and B are H2O and something else? No, H2O is a liquid. Maybe H is something like ethanol or methanol? Or perhaps it's something like H2O when B is O2 and D is H2, but that seems unlikely since H2 and O2 would form H2O under certain conditions, but that's a combustion reaction. Alternatively, maybe H is NH3? No, because both B and D would have to be in a 1:1 ratio to form NH3, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe B is H2 and D is Cl2? Then H would be HCl, but that's a gas, not a solvent. Hmm, that's not right.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about reaction 3: C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is strong acid, G is weak. So, maybe C is something that when reacted with water, produces a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is a sulfate salt, then reacting with water could yield a strong acid (like H2SO4) and a weak acid (like HSO3^- or something). Alternatively, wait, another possibility: if C is a nitrate salt, but that might not fit.

Wait, another thought: if C is a sulfide, then reacting with water might form H2S (a weak acid) and possibly another acid. Wait, but H2S is a weak acid, but the other product would be something else. Alternatively, if C is a nitrate, like NaNO3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide? For example, if C is a metal sulfide, like CuS, then reacting with water might not produce acids, unless it's a basic sulfide. Alternatively, if C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak base, perhaps like NaHSO4. When NaHSO4 reacts with water, maybe it doesn't form two acids. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the first reaction: A + 8 B → C. If B is a gas, perhaps it's O2, or maybe a halogen. 8 equivalents is a lot. So, perhaps A is a metal reacting with O2 to form an oxide. But 8 equivalents would imply that each A atom reacts with 8 B molecules. For example, perhaps A is Fe and B is O2, but FeO would require 1 O2 per Fe, so
