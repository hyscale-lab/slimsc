Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the answer step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane has a diamondoid structure, like a cage structure with multiple bridgehead carbons. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two of the bridgehead carbons that are across from each other.

The first reaction is heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C, resulting in a light yellow solid product 1. Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). Also, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I think is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, maybe an elimination reaction happened here.

When I think about dibromides reacting with KOH, it's likely an E2 elimination because the conditions are high temperature and a strong base. Since we have two bromines on adjacent bridgehead carbons (1,3-dibromo), the elimination would form an alkene. Wait, but adamantane is a cage structure, so elimination could form an exo-methylene group, which would be an isolated double bond. So product 1 is probably adamantane with a double bond between two bridgeheads, making it 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate to form 1,3-adamantadiene, but I'm not sure about the exact structure.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbonyl group, not an alkene. Oh, wait no, another possibility. Maybe it's an epoxide, but epoxides have different IR regions. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether. Or wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by some kind of ring-opening. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, KOH could cause a substitution reaction. Wait, but substitution would require a good leaving group and a possible nucleophilic attack. But in a dibromide, elimination is more likely under such conditions. Wait, wait: when two adjacent bromines are present, elimination would form a double bond. But if the structure is such that the two bromines are not adjacent, but 1 and 3 positions on the adamantane structure, maybe elimination isn't feasible. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong about the structure. Let me think again.

Wait, adamantane has a structure where each bridgehead is connected to three other carbons. So the 1 and 3 positions are on opposite ends. So when both are brominated, perhaps elimination isn't possible because the H's needed for E2 aren't on adjacent carbons. Then, maybe the reaction is a substitution. But with KOH, which is a strong base, maybe it's an elimination, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, the product 1's NMR shows a signal at 4.79 ppm integrating for 2H. That seems like a CH2 group near an electronegative group. 4.79 is about where an epoxide's protons resonate. But wait, epoxides are ethers with two adjacent CH2 groups, but in the case of adamantane, perhaps it's a bridgehead epoxide. Alternatively, maybe the product is a diol, but the IR doesn't show an O-H stretch, so that's probably not it.

Wait, another thought: when a dihalide is treated with a strong base like KOH, it can undergo an elimination to form an alkene, but sometimes, especially if the dihalide is vicinal (on adjacent carbons), but in this case, the dihalide is on 1 and 3 positions. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation forming a ketone? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that's for amines. Hmm.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. Maybe the product is a ketone. How could that happen? Oh, wait! When a dihalide undergoes a double elimination. Two molecules of HBr are eliminated, and a double bond is formed. But wait, the IR doesn't show a peak for a C=C, but it shows a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mechanism is different. Maybe the KOH is causing a ring-opening of the adamantane structure, forming a carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some kind of rearrangement.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, where two bromines leave, and two hydroxide ions abstract protons, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. The 4.79 ppm would fit for two protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in an epoxide. But then, how does that happen from a dihalide?

Wait, when a dihalide reacts with a base, it can form an epoxide via an elimination, but that usually requires vicinal dihalides. Wait, in vicinal dihalides (adjacent), elimination can form an epoxide. But in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the bromines are not adjacent. So perhaps that's not the case.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm is for 2H. If it's an epoxide, perhaps it's a bridgehead epoxide. The other signals are multiple sets of protons in the 2-2.5 ppm region, which are typical for CH2 and CH groups in a carbon framework. The 1.94 ppm is for 2H, maybe a methylene group near a carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is a diketone. But how would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Let me think about possible reactions. Maybe elimination of two HBr molecules and forming a conjugated diene. But that would give an alkene. Alternatively, maybe an oxidation step? But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent.

Wait, another possibility: the base could deprotonate something and cause elimination. But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should move to the next step and see if it helps.

Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. Alternatively, it can also be used as a catalyst in certain eliminations or ring-forming reactions. So if product 1 has a carbonyl group, maybe it undergoes some kind of cyclization or forms an enol ether or something.

Wait, product 1's NMR has 2H at 4.79, which might be an OCH2 group, like an epoxide. So product 1 could be an epoxide. Then, heating with aluminum isopropoxide might lead to ring-opening or some kind of rearrangement.

Wait, aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid. In the presence of an epoxide, it can catalyze the opening of the epoxide. But what's the structure here? Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, heating with Al(i-Pr)3 might cause some kind of acylation or alkylation, but without a benzene ring, Friedel-Crafts may not apply.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a cyclohexenone derivative. Then, product 2 could be some kind of cyclization product. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an enol ether, which upon treatment with Al(i-Pr)3 could form a more stable structure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the ozonolysis part. Ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis usually cleaves double bonds, breaking them into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into smaller fragments.

But wait, the first reaction's IR showed a carbonyl, so product 1 has a carbonyl. Then product 2 may have a double bond, which ozonolysis would cleave. So perhaps product 2 is an enone (conjugated dienone) or something with a double bond adjacent to a carbonyl.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to outline the possible structures.

Product 1: After KOH, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → probably a dehydrohalogenation leading to a carbonyl. Wait, no, elimination would form a double bond, but perhaps in this case, it's a ring-opening elimination.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → when treated with KOH, two HBr molecules are eliminated, and a double bond forms. But since the bridgehead is a bridgehead, maybe the double bond is in a bridge, which would make it a bridgehead double bond. But then, IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternative approach: Maybe the product is an acetylene? No, the IR wouldn't fit. Wait, another thought: Maybe the KOH is causing a substitution, but I can't see how.

Wait, let me think about the IR again. 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. That suggests a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. But in the context of the starting material, it's more likely a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone.

But how does 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a ketone upon treatment with KOH? Hmm, perhaps via a dehydrohalogenation and formation of a carbonyl. Wait, for example, if a vicinal dihalide undergoes dehydrohalogenation, it forms an alkene. But for a geminal dihalide (same carbon), elimination would form a carbonyl. But in this case, the bromines are on different carbons (1 and 3), so maybe it's a different mechanism.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps an intramolecular E2 elimination. If the base abstracts a proton that's anti to the bromine on an adjacent carbon, allowing the formation of a double bond. But with the positions being 1 and 3, perhaps it's not adjacent. So maybe this isn't possible.

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a cyclopropane ring. No, that would require another structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing the formation of a ketone via a different mechanism. Maybe the base causes an oxidation, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that requires a peracid, not KOH.

Wait, maybe it's a Fittig reaction, but that's for aryl halides and forms biphenyls. Doesn't fit here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon treatment with KOH, it undergoes two dehydrohalogenation steps, leading to the loss of two HBr molecules and the formation of a carbonyl group. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to each bromine, leading to the formation of a double bond, but I'm stuck.

Maybe I should move on to the next step and see if that helps. Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess Al(i-Pr)3. Let's assume product 1 is a ketone. So, for example, if product 1 is adamantane with a ketone group. Then, when treated with Al(i-Pr)3, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of acylation or alkylation. But without an aromatic ring, Friedel-Crafts doesn't work.

Alternatively, Al(i-Pr)3 could catalyze a ring-opening of an epoxide. If product 1 is an epoxide, then Al(i-Pr)3 would protonate the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group, and then a nucleophile (maybe another molecule of product 1) would attack, leading to ring-opening and possibly forming a larger structure.

Wait, but the product 2 is then subjected to ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, so product 2 must have a double bond. So perhaps product 2 is a diene or an enol ether.

Alternatively, if product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is a ring-opened product with a double bond, maybe via a hemiacetal or some other structure. Then, ozonolysis would break the double bond.

But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis of a double bond typically forms carbonyl groups. So if product 3 is formed after ozonolysis and workup with dimethyl sulfide (which is a reductive workup, not oxidative), the ozonides would break into carbonyl compounds.

But wait, the question is about the NMR of product 3. The question asks about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange with deuterated solvent.

So, the most deshielded proton would be near an electronegative group, perhaps a carbonyl. The coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring protons.

Wait, let me think about the possible structure. Suppose product 2 is a diene, such as 1,3-pentadiene. Ozonolysis of 1,3-pentadiene would form two aldehydes, but that's a simple case. However, if the diene is part of a bicyclic structure, the ozonolysis would form a diketone or two carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a cyclic enol ether, ozonolysis might break the double bond into two carbonyls.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to outline all the steps again.

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → heated with KOH → product 1 (carbonyl IR peak)
2. Product 1 → heated with Al(i-Pr)3 → product 2 (which has a double bond)
3. Product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3

So, in step 1, product 1 has a carbonyl group, likely a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by treating this ketone with Al(i-Pr)3, which is a Lewis acid. This could lead to enolization, but without a carbonyl adjacent to an aromatic ring, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is a ring-opened product with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Then, when treated with Al(i-Pr)3, it could undergo ring-opening via nucleophilic attack. For example, the epoxide oxygen could be protonated, making it a better leaving group, then a nucleophile (maybe another molecule) attacks, leading to ring-opening and possibly forming a carbonyl group or a double bond.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, treating with Al(i-Pr)3 might not do much, unless it's part of an enolate formation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the initial reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Since KOH is a strong base, it's likely to cause elimination. The product would have a double bond. But the IR shows a carbonyl, so perhaps the double bond is conjugated to a carbonyl group, making it an enone. So product 1 is an enone (a conjugated dienone?).

Then, when product 1 is treated with Al(i-Pr)3, which is a Lewis acid, it might catalyze a Diels-Alder reaction, but that requires a diene and a dienophile. Alternatively, perhaps the enone undergoes some kind of rearrangement under Lewis acid conditions.

Wait, maybe the enone structure is such that the Lewis acid helps in the formation of a more stable carbonyl structure. Alternatively, perhaps the enone is cyclized further.

But if product 2 has a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. So in product 3, perhaps each fragment has a carbonyl group, and the NMR would show protons adjacent to these groups.

Wait, the most deshielded proton would be next to a carbonyl. Let's say, in product 3, each fragment is a ketone or aldehyde. The protons adjacent to these would be deshielded and appear upfield or downfield, depending on the structure.

But let's think about the coupling. Suppose after ozonolysis, each fragment has a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl. Each of these CH2 groups would have neighboring protons that they couple with.

Wait, but the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding those that exchange). Let me think of a simple example. Ozonolysis of a diene like 1,3-pentadiene would give two aldehydes. The aldehyde protons are deshielded but usually are in a triplet or other pattern. However, aldehyde protons are usually sharp singlets because they don't have neighboring protons.

Wait, no, in aldehydes, the proton is only attached to the carbonyl carbon, so it's a triplet if adjacent to a CH2, but if it's a CH3, etc. No, wait, aldehyde protons are usually singlets because they're on a sp² carbon and don't have neighboring protons. Wait, but if the structure is different, perhaps the proton is next to other protons.

Alternatively, if the ozonolysis creates a diketone or a ketone and another group, the adjacent protons would be split based on their neighboring groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis breaks the double bond into two ketones, each with adjacent CH2 groups. Then, the protons on these CH2 groups would couple with each other and perhaps other nearby groups.

Wait, but I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should think about the structure after step 3.

Let me try to imagine product 3. Suppose the ozonolysis of product 2 (a diene) leads to two carbonyl groups. Each carbonyl would be adjacent to some CH groups or CH2 groups. The most deshielded proton would be the one closest to the carbonyl.

If, for example, product 3 has a structure where a CH2 group is next to a carbonyl, the protons on that CH2 would couple with neighboring protons.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. Let's say that the structure is something like (CH2)nCO. The CH2 groups near the carbonyl would have neighboring protons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each end after ozonolysis has a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl. Each CH2 would have two neighboring protons (the adjacent CH2 group), leading to a triplet.

Wait, another possibility: After ozonolysis, each fragment is a carbonyl group attached to a single CH group. Then, the CH group would have one neighboring proton (from the adjacent group). But that would lead to a doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more complex. Let me think about coupling patterns. A triplet of triplets would imply coupling with two different sets of protons. A triplet would be from coupling with two equivalent protons.

Wait, the options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

Let me think about a scenario where a proton is coupled with two sets of neighboring protons. For example, if a CH2 group is next to another CH2 group, each proton in the first CH2 would couple with two protons from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But if each CH2 is next to another group as well, like a CH or another CH2, the coupling could become more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded proton is adjacent to two different sets of two protons each. So the proton would be split by both sets, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the proton is next to a CH2 group (two protons) and another CH group (one proton), the coupling would be a triplet (from the two protons) and a doublet (from the one proton), which would combine into a triplet of triplets or something else.

Wait, perhaps the coupling is with two different neighboring groups. For example, a CH2 adjacent to a CH2 and a CH.

Wait, maybe the structure is a conjugated diene. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. Each carbonyl would be adjacent to a CH2 group. The CH2 groups would each have two neighboring protons. So each of their protons would be a triplet.

Wait, but then why would the most deshielded be a triplet? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and also adjacent to another CH group. So that proton would couple with the two protons from the adjacent CH2 and the one proton from the CH group. That would result in a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the possible structures again.

Going back to product 1, perhaps it's an epoxide. The NMR shows 2H at 4.79, which could fit an epoxide. Then, product 2 is formed by treating the epoxide with Al(i-Pr)3, which could catalyze ring-opening. The ring-opening could form a carbonyl group. For example, if the epoxide opens to form a ketone.

Then, product 2 would have a ketone group. Ozonolysis would not act on a ketone; it acts on double bonds. So this doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I should try to think of product 2 as a diene. So product 1 is an epoxide, product 2 is a diene, which is then ozonolyzed.

But how does an epoxide turn into a diene upon treatment with Al(i-Pr)3? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, product 2 is a conjugated dienone, and product 3 is the ozonolysis product, which would be two carbonyl groups.

Wait, let me think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis of a dienone could cleave both double bonds, but I'm not certain.

Another thought: the IR of product 1 shows a carbonyl, so product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by treating this ketone with Al(i-Pr)3. Al(i-Pr)3 can sometimes induce elimination, perhaps forming a double bond. So product 2 would be an enone (a conjugated dienone). Then, ozonolysis of the double bond would form two carbonyl groups.

So, product 3 would have two new carbonyl groups where the double bond was. The protons adjacent to these carbonyls would be deshielded.

So, the most deshielded proton would be on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say the structure is something like CH2-CO. The CH2 would be next to the carbonyl. Each proton in the CH2 would have coupling with the adjacent CH2 group's protons and perhaps another set.

Wait, but if the CH2 is next to another CH2 group, each proton would be coupled with two neighbors, leading to a triplet. If there's another neighboring group, like a CH, then the coupling would split into a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 group is next to a single proton, leading to a doublet. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the most deshielded proton is in a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and also next to another CH2 group that's part of a ring. For example, in a cyclohexenone derivative, the protons on the double bond would be deshielded, but after ozonolysis, they might become adjacent to carbonyls.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that after ozonolysis, each fragment has a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. The protons on these CH2 groups would couple with each other, leading to a triplet.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the options are about the coupling pattern. The most deshielded proton is likely near a carbonyl group. Let's think about a scenario where this proton is next to two different groups of protons.

Option B is triplet of triplets. That would happen if the proton is coupled with two different sets of protons, each of which has two protons. For example, if the proton is adjacent to a CH2 group (two protons) and another CH2 group (another two protons), but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, if the proton is next to a CH2 group and another CH group, each with two and one proton respectively, the coupling would be a triplet (from the CH2) and a doublet (from the CH), leading to a triplet of doublets, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, if the proton is next to two different CH groups, each with one proton, that would lead to a doublet of doublets, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded proton is part of a cyclopropane ring adjacent to a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure after ozonolysis is such that the most deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and also adjacent to another CH2 group. So, each of the two protons on the CH2 would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

But that would make each of those protons a triplet, which is option A.

But then, why would the most deshielded be a triplet?

Alternatively, perhaps the proton is next to a CH2 group (two protons) and also a CH group (one proton), leading to a triplet (from the CH2) and a doublet (from the CH), resulting in a triplet of doublets. But that's not an option.

Hmm. Another possibility: The structure has a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and also adjacent to another CH2 group. So, each of these protons would see two neighboring protons from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But in that case, the coupling would be a triplet.

Wait, but the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen. Maybe it's a CH group next to the carbonyl. For example, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-X, the CH2 groups would each have neighboring protons, leading to triplet coupling. But if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-X, the coupling patterns would be more complex.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that the most deshielded proton is part of a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl and a CH3 group. Then, each of the CH2 protons would couple with the two protons of the adjacent CH2 and the three protons of the CH3. But that would lead to a more complex splitting, perhaps a quintet or a septet.

But I'm not getting closer. Let me think about the possible answer options again.

The options are:

A) triplet
B) triplet of triplets
C) doublet of triplets
D) pentet

In the context of ozonolysis, the product would have carbonyl groups. The protons adjacent to these carbonyls would be deshielded. Let's say we have a structure like CH2-CO-R. The protons on the CH2 would be next to the carbonyl and perhaps other groups.

If the CH2 is next to another CH2 group, then each of these protons would be split into a triplet (each coupling with the two protons of the adjacent CH2). That would give a triplet.

But if the CH2 is next to a CH group (one proton), then each of the CH2 protons would be split into a doublet (coupling with the one proton). But that's a simpler case.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to another CH2 that's part of a larger chain, perhaps each CH2 proton is coupled with two protons from one side and two from another, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, another scenario: The ozonolysis product forms a diketone, where each ketone is adjacent to a CH2 group. The CH2 groups are each next to two other CH2 groups. So each CH2 proton would be coupled with two protons from each adjacent group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: in the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded proton's coupling would depend on its neighbors. If it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH2 group, each proton would see two neighbors, leading to a triplet.

But if it's adjacent to another group that has two protons, maybe leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the proton is part of a cyclopropane ring adjacent to a carbonyl, leading to more complex coupling.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone with a bridge structure. The most deshielded protons would be on a CH2 group next to the carbonyl and perhaps adjacent to another CH group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the structure is a cyclopropane ring with a carbonyl group nearby, the coupling could be more complex.

I think I'm going in circles here. Based on the options, perhaps the correct answer is a triplet of triplets (option B), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it could be a triplet (option A).

Wait, another thought: In ozonolysis, the breaking of the double bond would form carbonyl groups. Suppose the original double bond was between two CH2 groups. After ozonolysis, each CH2 would become adjacent to a carbonyl group. The CH2 groups would each have two neighboring protons from their own group and perhaps no other coupling, leading to a triplet.

But wait, if the CH2 groups are adjacent to each other, each CH2's protons would couple with the other, leading to a triplet.

But I think the most likely scenario is that the most deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Given the options, I think the correct answer is B) triplet of triplets, but I'm not certain.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning behind the final answer:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH at 240°C likely results in a double elimination reaction, leading to the formation of a carbonyl-containing product (product 1). The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, consistent with a carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR data (4.79 ppm for 2H, 2.41-2.23 ppm for 10H, and 1.94 ppm for 2H) suggests that product 1 is likely a ketone, as the carbonyl group aligns with the observed IR and NMR data.

2. **Reaction with Al(i-Pr)₃**:  
   Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This step likely induces further structural changes, potentially forming a conjugated enone (product 2). The formation of a double bond conjugated to the carbonyl group is plausible, as this would set up the molecule for subsequent ozonolysis.

3. **Ozonolysis and Workup**:  
   Ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C cleaves the double bond, forming product 3. The reaction with dimethyl sulfide ensures a reductive workup, breaking the ozonide into carbonyl-containing fragments. The most deshielded proton in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group, making it highly deshielded in the NMR spectrum.

4. **Coupling Pattern Analysis**:  
   The coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton depends on its neighboring groups. If the proton is adjacent to two different sets of protons (e.g., a CH₂ group and another CH₂ group), it would exhibit a triplet of triplets due to coupling with two distinct sets of neighboring protons. This matches the description of the most deshielded proton in product 3.

Given the reasoning above, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is best described as a **triplet of triplets**.

**Answer: B**
