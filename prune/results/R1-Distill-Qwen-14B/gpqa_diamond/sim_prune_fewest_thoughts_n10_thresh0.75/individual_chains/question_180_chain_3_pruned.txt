Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about electric potential energy in an isolated system of charges. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. So, each has a charge of 2 times the elementary charge, which is 2 * 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. That makes each charge 3.204 x 10^-19 C. 

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system. Wait, energy... Oh right, electric potential energy. So the system's potential energy is due to the arrangement of these charges.

Wait, but how is the system isolated? Oh, right, an isolated system means no external electric fields affect them, so the potential energy is just from the interactions between these charges themselves.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So, the 12 charges are each 2 meters away from P, and each has a charge of 2e. The 13th is at P with charge 2e as well.

So, the setup is like this: one charge at the center, and 12 charges arranged around it on a sphere of radius 2 meters. Or maybe they're all fixed in place, so the potential energy is the sum of the interactions between each pair.

Wait, electric potential energy for a system of point charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. But since all but one are at fixed points, perhaps I need to calculate the potential energy between each pair.

Wait, but since the system is isolated, the total energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair. But how many pairs are there?

Wait, I think the formula for electric potential energy between two point charges is U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

In this case, all the charges are the same, so each pair contributes a certain amount. Let me think, how many pairs
