Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this science question about rotavirus and some immune response processes. Let's break it down step by step.

Alright, the setup: They tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then they saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some entangled in intestinal mucus. But eventually, they found fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated proliferating cells. They sequenced the variable heavy chain genes and saw high variability.

Hmm, so what's going on here. Rotavirus is a virus that causes gastroenteritis, right? The inner capsid proteins are probably the ones that help the virus infect the host cells. They're using GFP to track them, which is a common method to see where proteins go.

When they gave it to mice via oral gavage, the first thing that happens is that the rotavirus particles encounter the stomach. Stomach acid can break things down, so some GFP was destroyed there. But others made it through the stomach and into the intestines, getting stuck in the mucus. So the ones that reached the secondary lymphoid organs must have gotten past these barriers.

Peyer patches are a type of secondary lymphoid organ located in the small intestine. They're part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are key in immune responses to enteric pathogens. So when the fluorescent proteins reached the Peyer patches, that suggests the immune system is responding to them.

They isolated the proliferating cell population from these patches. Proliferating cells in an immune context are likely B cells or T cells. Since they're looking at the variable heavy chain gene, which is specific to B cells, it must be B cells they're looking at.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene sequences suggests that a process that creates diversity in these genes has occurred. The options given are about different processes in B cell development and immune response.

Option A: Somatic hypermutation. This is a process where B cells undergo mutation in their variable regions during the immune response, increasing diversity of antibodies. This happens after the initial immune response, particularly during the germinal center reactions. It's a way to fine-tune the antibody specificity.

Option B: Complement activation. That's part of the innate immune response, involves the complement system leading to lysis of pathogens or opsonization. Not directly related to the gene variability in B cells.

Option C: Class switching recombination. This is when B cells change the class of antibody they produce (like from IgM to IgG), which involves changing the constant region. But the question is about the variable heavy chain, which is the V region. So this probably isn't it.

Option D: VDJ recombination. This is the process during B cell development in the bone marrow where variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments are combined to form the heavy chain. This occurs during the maturation of B cells before they encounter an antigen. So this process happens earlier, in the bone marrow, not after antigen exposure.

So in this case, the rotavirus is acting as an antigen, right? The B cells in the Peyer patches are responding to it. The initial VDJ recombination happens before, but the high variability in the variable regions after exposure suggests that it's after the initial antigen encounter. Somatic hypermutation is the process where B cells in germinal centers mutate their variable regions to increase the diversity and affinity of their antibodies.

Therefore, the process taking place is somatic hypermutation. That fits because the cells are proliferating, probably in the germinal centers, and their variable regions are diversifying.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, while other tagged proteins reach the Peyer patches, a type of secondary lymphoid organ in the small intestine. Fluorescent cells isolated from these patches show high variability in their variable heavy chain gene sequences.

Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and play a key role in immune responses to enteric pathogens. The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene sequences suggests a process that generates diversity in B cell receptors. Among the options:

- **Somatic hypermutation (A):** This process occurs during the immune response, particularly in germinal centers, where B cells mutate their variable regions to increase antibody diversity and affinity. This aligns with the observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **Complement activation (B):** This is part of the innate immune response and does not involve changes to the variable heavy chain genes.
- **Class switching recombination (C):** This changes the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variable region of the heavy chain.
- **VDJ recombination (D):** This process occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are combined to form the heavy chain. However, this happens before antigen exposure and is not relevant to the observed variability after antigen encounter.

The observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs in response to antigen exposure and drives diversity in B cell receptors. 

Answer: A
