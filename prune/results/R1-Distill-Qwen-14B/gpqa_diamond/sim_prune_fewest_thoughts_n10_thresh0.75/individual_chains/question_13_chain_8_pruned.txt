Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step.

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember that limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. Oh wait, no, actually, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, but more specifically, it's a cyclic monoterpene with a structure that's a substituted cyclohexene. So, the structure of limonene is a bicyclic structure, right? Wait, no, I think limonene is a single ring, a cyclohexene with a methyl group and some other substituents. Let me think: (R)-limonene has a structure where there's a cyclohexene ring, with a methyl group on carbon 2, and a hydrogen on carbon 1. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with another compound. Alternatively, limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene with a specific configuration.

Wait, no, I think limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a substituted cyclohexene. So, the structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond. Let me draw this in my mind. (R)-limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene, right? Wait, no, limonene is a bicyclic compound. Oh wait, maybe it's not. Let me think again: limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene with a structure that has a double bond. Yes, that's right. So, the structure is a bridged bicyclic compound, specifically a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene or something like that. Wait, no, perhaps it's a monocyclic compound. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but maybe I should proceed.

So the reaction steps:

1. Methanol solution of (R)-limonene is stirred with Pd/C under H2. After 1 equivalent of H2 consumed, product 1 is isolated.

So, hydrogenation. Pd/C is a catalyst for hydrogenation. Limonene has a double bond, so this reaction is likely hydrogenating the double bond.
