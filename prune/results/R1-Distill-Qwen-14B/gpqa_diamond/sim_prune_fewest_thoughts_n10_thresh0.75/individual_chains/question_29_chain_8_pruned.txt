Okay, so I've got this question about genetics and plant breeding. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, it's about a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. The goal is to get rid of that compound by mutating the gene responsible for it. 

The intact gene sequence is provided, along with four mutants. I need to figure out which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. I think the idea is that changing the gene structure might disrupt the production of the compound. So, which of these mutations would likely cause a nonfunctional gene product, like a protein that doesn't work or isn't made at all.

Looking at the question, all the mutations are in the first exon area. Exons are the coding regions, so changes here might affect the protein. But wait, introns are non-coding, but since they're in the first exon, maybe the changes are in the coding regions.

Let me look at each mutant's sequence compared to the intact gene.

The intact gene starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact, the third and fourth nucleotides change. The third is TTT to TCT. Wait, wait, the first part is ATGTTT... in the intact, and in mutant 1, it's ATGTTCT. So the third T is changed to C. Wait, let me look at the exact letters. Oh, the intact is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT..., and Mutant1 is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT... So in position 3 and 4, the intact is TT, and mutant is CT. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Alternatively, looking at the part where the first few nucleotides differ.

Wait, maybe I should look for where the changes are. Let me see:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...
Mutant1: ATG
