Okay, so I've got this question about an algorithm that transforms DNA sequences into numbers. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to figure it out.

The question gives two examples: AGG becomes 115, and TGCTGA becomes 176. Then, it asks what ACAGTGACC would give. The options are A) 315, B) 185, C) 333, D) 351.

First, I need to figure out what kind of encoding is happening here. DNA sequences are made up of nucleotides: A, T, C, G. Each of these could be assigned a number. Maybe each nucleotide has a value, and the algorithm sums them or does something else.

Looking at the first example, AGG. Let's break it down. A, G, G. So if each letter is a number: A=1, G= something else. Wait, but AGG is 115. Let's see: A is 1, G is 7 (since A is 1, C is 3, T is 2, G is 7? Or maybe it's based on their positions in the alphabet. A is 1, G is 7, so each letter's position is their value.

Wait, but 1 + 7 +7 would be 15. But the output is 115. That doesn't add up. So maybe it's not just adding the individual letters. Maybe each letter's value is multiplied by a certain weight, or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps each nucleotide is converted into a digit, and then the entire sequence is treated as a number in a certain base. Let's think about that. For example, each nucleotide is assigned a digit in base 4 or base 5. But let's check.

Wait, DNA has four nucleotides, so maybe base 4? Let's see. Assign A=0, T=1, C=2, G=3. Then, each digit represents a base-4 number. But let's test the first example.

AGG: A=0, G=3, G=3. So in base 4, that's 0*4^2 + 3*4^1 +3*4^0 = 0 + 12 +3 =
