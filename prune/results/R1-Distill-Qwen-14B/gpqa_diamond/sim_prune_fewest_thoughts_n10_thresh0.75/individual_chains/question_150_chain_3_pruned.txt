Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and after reacting with certain reagents, we need to find the final product from the options provided.

First, let me break down the NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows several signals:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet (t), 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift, so maybe an aldehyde proton? Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm as sharp singlets or triplets if coupled with another proton.

- 6.98 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. This could be aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted on a benzene ring. Because in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are equivalent and typically split into a doublet due to coupling with adjacent protons.

- 6.51 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. Another set of aromatic protons. So maybe two different aromatic rings. If the first set is at 6.98 as a doublet, perhaps that's from one ring, and the 6.51 is another ring, perhaps substituted differently.

- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad signals can be due to exchange effects, like -OH protons but in this case, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, it could be protons adjacent to an electronegative atom or part of a conjugated system. Hmm. Wait, the molecule has a NO group, so maybe it's nitro or something else. Oh, wait, the molecular formula has an N and O, so perhaps an amide or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol? Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Where C=8, H=9, N=1, X=0 (assuming no halogens). So DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9 +1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be from, say, a benzene ring (3 DoU), a double bond (1 DoU), and a ring (another DoU), but wait, benzene is 3 DoU (three double bonds in ring), so maybe the other two DoU come from a double bond or ring. Alternatively, maybe a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and an amide group (which is a ring? No, an amide is a double bond, so maybe that's another DoU. Wait, perhaps the structure has a benzene ring, a conjugated double bond (like in an enal), and another ring or double bond.

Wait, the NMR data includes a triplet at 9.72 ppm, which is likely an aldehyde proton. So the molecule probably has an aldehyde group, -CHO. Aldehydes are at the end of a chain, so perhaps the molecule is something like a substituted butenal.

Looking at the other signals: the 6.27 ppm as a broad singlet for 2H. Maybe that's a pair of protons adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps in a conjugated system. Alternatively, maybe they are part of a vinyl group or part of an enol structure. Or perhaps they are on a benzene ring that's ortho to another substituent.

Wait, let me think about the structure. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's think about possible structures. Maybe it's a nitro group attached to a benzene ring? Or an amine? Alternatively, maybe an amide? Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any peaks that would suggest NH protons, but
