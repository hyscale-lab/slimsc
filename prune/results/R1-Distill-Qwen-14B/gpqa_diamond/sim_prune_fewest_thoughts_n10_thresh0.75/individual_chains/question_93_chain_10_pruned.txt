Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and calibration curves. Hmm, I remember that qPCR is used to quantify the amount of DNA or RNA in a sample. The scientist here is trying to make a calibration curve, which I think is like a standard curve to help quantify unknown samples based on known concentrations.

He used a positive control with known copy numbers and diluted it in a series of concentrations. Each concentration was run in three technical replicates. The efficiency was 100%, which probably means the reaction is perfect—so each cycle increases the DNA by exactly double. The R² is 1, so the data points fit the curve perfectly, which is ideal. The slope was -3.3. Wait, what's the typical slope for qPCR standard curves?

I recall that the slope of the standard curve is used in the equation Ct = slope * log(n) + intercept. Oh right, the slope is usually around -3.3 for a 100% efficient PCR because each ten-fold increase in target copies should result in a decrease of about 3.3 cycles. Because each cycle doubles the DNA, so 10x more DNA would take log2(10) ≈ 3.32 cycles.

Looking at the data, the concentrations are 100,000; 10,000; 1,000; 100; 10 copies per microliter. The Ct values are decreasing as the concentration increases, which makes sense because higher starting amounts would reach the threshold sooner, giving lower Ct values.

The technical replicates for each concentration are pretty close. For example, at 100000, the Ct values are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5—so a range of 0.6. Similarly, the other concentrations have similar tight ranges. So the replicates are consistent, which is good.

The question is about the discrepancies in the results. The options are A to D. Let's read the options again.

Option A: qPCR cannot be used for quantification. That doesn't make sense because the R² is 1 and efficiency is 100%, which suggests it's working perfectly. So A is unlikely.

Option B: Ct values don't agree with target amounts. No, because the data fit perfectly as R² is 1, and the concentrations are known. This probably isn't the issue.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, the slope is -3.3, which closely matches a 10-fold dilution corresponding to a 3.3 cycle change. So each dilution step (like from 10,000 to 1,000) should have a Ct difference of about 3.3 cycles. Let's check the data.

Looking at the Ct values:
- 100000: 33.9-34.5 (average ~34.2)
- 10000: 30.6-31.2 (average ~30.9)
Difference between 100000 and 10000 is about 3.3 cycles (34.2 - 30.9 = 3.3). Similarly, 10000 to 1000: 30.9 to 27.6, difference is about 3.3. So each ten-fold dilution corresponds to a 3.3 Ct decrease, which is correct. So this option seems incorrect as there's no discrepancy here.

Option D: Deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates. Let's check the replicates. At 100000: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5 → differences are 0.3 (34.2-33.9) and 0.3 (34.5-34.2). So the maximum deviation is 0.3. Similarly, other concentrations have similar ranges. So the deviation is 0.3 at most, which is acceptable. So D is not the issue.

Wait, the question is about discrepancies in the results. So what's the discrepancy here? The data seems perfect. But the options are giving possible explanations. Since all the data points fit perfectly, what could be wrong?

Wait, looking at the Ct values: when the concentration is 10 copies, the Ct is around 20.7. Let me think about the expected Ct based on the standard curve. Let's take the highest concentration as 100,000, Ct ~34.2. Each ten-fold dilution drops Ct by 3.3. So 10,000 would be
