Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about determining the starting materials for two different reductions that lead to the same product but with different configurations. 

The problem says that a chemist used two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B, and both resulted in (R) and (S) configurations of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. The options are A and B with different configurations, and I have to pick the right pair.

Hmm, let's start by recalling some concepts. I think this has to do with the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols. Wait, but wait, the product is a pyranone, which is a cyclic ketone. Oh wait, no, wait a second. Let me think. Oh, wait, maybe it's a reduction of an ester or something else. No, wait. The product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar. Oh wait, no, wait. Maybe it's a reduction of an epoxide or some cyclic ether. Or perhaps it's a reduction of a carbonyl group inside a ring.

Wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the structure would be a six-membered ring with an oxygen (like a pyran ring), a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4. So the ring is tetrahydro, which means it's a partially saturated ringâ€”so a five-membered ring? No, wait, pyran is six-membered. Oh, wait, no, pyran is six-membered with one oxygen. So tetrahydro implies four single bonds, so maybe it's a partially saturated ring, perhaps a five-membered ring? Wait, not sure. Let me visualize: pyran is like a six-membered ring with one oxygen (like a five-membered furan but one more carbon), and tetrahydro-2H means that the ring has two double bonds? Or perhaps it's a partially hydrogenated ring.

Wait, perhaps the product is a tetrahydropyranone. So it's a cyclic ketone, a six-membered ring with an oxygen. The position 2 is the ketone, and position
