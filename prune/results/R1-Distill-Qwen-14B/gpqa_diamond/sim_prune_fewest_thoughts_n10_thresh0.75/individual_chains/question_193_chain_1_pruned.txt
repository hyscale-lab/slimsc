Okay, I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question. Let's see what it says. So, the question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance, given that the number varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if the distance (r) increases, the parallax decreases. The formula I think is plx = 1/d, where d is distance. Or wait, maybe it's plx in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. Because 1 parsec is the distance where 1 AU subtends 1 arcsecond. So yeah, plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs.

The problem states that the number of stars (N) is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N would be proportional to (d)^5. Because plx = 1/d, so 1/plx = d. So 1/(plx)^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, the question is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So maybe it's about the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r, not the total up to r.

If the number of stars in a thin shell (a small range of distance dr around r) is proportional to the surface area of the shell multiplied by the volume element and the density. Or wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Density of stars could be considered as number per unit volume. Let's say the number density is n. Then the number of stars in a shell between r and r+dr would be n * 4πr² dr. But wait, if the number is varying with parallax, maybe the density isn't uniform. Because if N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, which is d^5, then perhaps the number of stars at a distance d is proportional to d^5.

Alternatively, the question might be modeling that the number of stars at a given distance is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to distance, N ∝ d^5. So for each unit increase in distance, the number would increase by d^5. But wait, when considering the number per unit
