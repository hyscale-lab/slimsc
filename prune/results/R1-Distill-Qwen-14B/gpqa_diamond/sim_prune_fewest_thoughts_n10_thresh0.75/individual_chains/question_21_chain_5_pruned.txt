Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question is about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. There are two types mentioned: constitutional and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have different structures, like different connectivity of atoms. Stereoisomers have the same connectivity but different arrangements in space, like geometric or optical isomers.

The question has two parts, A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Part B is about which of the two compounds—methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate—show optical isomerism.

I'll tackle each part separately.

Starting with part A. I need to determine which of the two compounds doesn't show tautomerism.

Tautomerism, as I recall, involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and the shift of a bond, usually in compounds with adjacent double bonds and hydrogens that can move. For example, in compounds like ketones and aldehydes, or in compounds like sugars where enol and keto forms can interconvert.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. Wait, no, benzoquinone is actually a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms in a diketone structure. So, it's something like O=C6H4=O. Wait, no, more accurately, benzoquinone has two ketone groups attached to the benzene ring. So, it's 1,4-benzoquinone, which is para-quinone. Quinones generally have a conjugated system. Do they show tautomerism? Hmm. I'm not so sure. Tautomerism usually requires adjacent double bonds or the possibility of shifting hydrogens. Alternatively, maybe if the structure has conjugated carbonyl groups, like in 1,4-benzoquinone, does that lead to tautomerism? Or maybe it's more about whether the structure can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Wait, but quinones
