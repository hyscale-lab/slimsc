Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some solutions. Hmm, let me try to think through this. I'm a bit rusty on enthalpy stuff, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says: Calculate the enthalpy when 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is usually calculated per mole of acid reacting with a base. But wait, when mixing these, it's important to figure out the limiting reagent because the reaction will stop when one of them is used up.

So first, I need to figure out the moles of each acid and base component.

Let me start by calculating the moles for each solution.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M, so moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so each mole will donate one H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. So moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. In solution, it dissociates into 2 H+ per molecule. So for each mole of H2SO4, we get 2 moles of H+.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid but it's diprotic. The first dissociation is complete, giving H+ and HSO4^-; the second may not be 100% but in many cases, especially in dilute solutions, we consider both as dissociated. But I might need to check that. For neutralization, typically, each mole of H2SO4 would provide 2 moles of H+ available for reaction. So 0.09 moles H2SO4 would contribute 0.18 moles H+.

Now for the base: Ba(OH)2. 200 mL is 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M, so moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. So 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 moles OH-.

Wait, but when you mix an acid and a base, the H+ from the acid reacts with OH- from
