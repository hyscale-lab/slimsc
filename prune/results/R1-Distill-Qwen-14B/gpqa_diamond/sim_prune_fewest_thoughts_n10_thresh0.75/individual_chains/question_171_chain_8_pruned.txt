Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question lists six substances, each with a benzene ring attached to some group. The task is to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer when they undergo bromination with excess Br2. So, the idea is to figure out for each compound how much of the para product is formed, and then rank them from least to most.

Electrophilic substitution reactions on aromatic compounds depend a lot on the substituents already present. The substituents can be activating or deactivating, and they can also direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions—ortho, meta, or para.

First, I need to recall the directing effects of each substituent in the given compounds.

1) C6H5-CH3: The substituent is a methyl group. Methyl is an activating group because it's an electron donor (due to the +I effect). Activating groups direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. So, when methyl is attached, the bromine can add at ortho, para, or maybe meta if something else is going on. Wait, no, activating groups are ortho/para directors. So for this compound, the substituent is meta with respect to the benzene ring? Wait no, the substituent is on the benzene ring—so the methyl is directly attached. So when bromine adds, it can go ortho, meta, or para relative to the methyl group. Wait, no, the substituent is the methyl group, so the incoming Br+ will attack either ortho, meta, or para to the methyl. But since methyl is an activating group (ortho/para), the major products would be ortho and para.

Wait, but the question says that "only one monobromo derivative is formed." Oh, wait, that's confusing. Wait, no, the question states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So for each substance, when bromine is added, it forms one major product. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, does that mean that under the reaction conditions, each substituent directs the electrophile to a single position, making only one product? Or perhaps that each substitution only leads to one possible position because of steric hindrance or other factors?

Wait, another possibility: maybe the substituent is such that it only allows for a single possible position for bromination. Like, maybe if the substituent is in a position that only allows para substitution because ortho is blocked, or something like that.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent directs the electrophile to a specific position, making the para isomer the major or only product. Or perhaps the substituent is such that the para position is not possible, so the bromine adds in meta or ortho.

Wait, but the problem is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, for each compound, when bromine is added, how much of the product is the para isomer.

Wait, but for each compound, the substituent is a substituent on the benzene ring. So, the substituent is in a specific position. The bromine can add in ortho, meta, or para relative to that substituent.

Wait, but in some cases, the substituent could be such that it's a meta director, and thus the para position relative to it might be the same as the ortho position of another substituent, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Maybe I should go through each substituent one by one.

Looking at each compound:

1) C6H5-CH3: substituent is methyl. Methyl is an activating group (ortho/para-directing), so bromination can occur at ortho, para positions. But in the case of a single substituent, if the substituent is in position 1, then adding Br can be in position 2 (ortho), 3 (meta), or 4 (para) positions. Wait, no, wait, benzene is a ring; the substituent is at position 1. Then, the para position would be position 4, but wait, benzene is symmetric. So, for a substituent in position 1, the para position is position 4. But in a monosubstituted benzene, the substituent is in one position, and the ring is symmetric. So, when you add an electrophile, the para product is formed when the Br adds opposite the substituent.

But methyl is activating, so the major products are ortho and para. But in the case of a single substituent, how much of each product is formed? For methyl, which is a strong activating group, the para product would be major compared to ortho? Or is it the opposite?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. I think that for an activating group, the para product is often more favored than the ortho because the para position is less sterically hindered. Or maybe it's the other way around. I remember that for substituents like -NH2, the para product is major, but for others, maybe it's different.

Wait, I think for groups that are ortho/para directors, in a monosubstituted benzene, the para product is usually more abundant than the ortho. Because when the substituent is at position 1, the para position is 4, and the ortho positions are 2 and 6. But since the ring is symmetric, the two ortho positions would lead to the same product, so the ortho product would have two possible positions, but they're considered the same (so when you have a substituent at 1, adding Br at 2 and 6 leads to the same structure). So, the ortho and para are separate.

Wait, but in terms of product ratios, the para product is generally more favored than the ortho because the para position is less crowded. So for a methyl group, the para substitution would be more than the ortho.

Wait, but in this problem, each compound is undergoing bromination to form a single monobromo derivative. So perhaps each substituent directs the bromine to only one position, which is para? Or maybe some substituents are meta directors, leading to different products.

Wait, perhaps the substitution occurs at the position that is most activated. Let me go through each substituent.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: substituent is an ethyl ester group (OOCR, where R is ethyl). The ester group is a meta director because it's an electron-withdrawing group (due to the carbonyl). So, when the benzene ring is substituted with an ester, the incoming electrophile will add to the meta position. So, for this compound, the para product would be negligible, and the meta product is major. But wait, the substituent is an ester group. So, the bromine will add meta to it. So, the product would be meta-substituted bromobenzene. So the para isomer would not be formed, but wait, the problem states that each undergoes substitution and forms a para-isomer. Hmm, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, for this compound, the para product is 0%? Or perhaps in some cases, the substituent can lead to more than one para product.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think again about each substituent.

Substituent Groups and their Directing Effects:

1) -CH3 (methyl): activating, ortho/para director. So, bromine can add ortho, para.

2) -COOEt (ester): deactivating, meta director.

3) -Cl: deactivating (due to -I effect), ortho/para director.

4) -NO2: deactivating, meta director.

5) -C2H5 (ethyl): similar to methyl, activating, ortho/para.

6) -COOH (carboxylic acid): deactivating, meta director.

Wait, correction: -Cl is a deactivating group but is an ortho/para director because of its lone pairs. So, yes, Cl is a deactivating (due to -I) but ortho/para-directing because it can donate electrons through resonance (but wait, Cl's -I effect is stronger, making it deactivating
