Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here with three different reactions and I need to figure out what each product is. The reactions are all sigma-tropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction. The question gives four options, each with possible products A, B, and C. I need to pair each reaction to the correct product.

Let me start by going through each reaction one by one and think about what's happening.

First Reaction:
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and Heat â†’ A

Hmm, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine sounds like a compound with two methoxy groups on an ethylamine. The structure would be (CH3O)2CH-NH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would mean the two methoxy groups are on the first carbon. So the structure is OCH3-O-C-CH2NH2? No, wait, wait, let me think again. Oh wait, the formula is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. So the ethanamine is CH2CH2NH2, but with two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine. So that's CH2(NH2)(OCH3)2? Wait, maybe it's (CH3O)2CH2NH2? No, wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. So the first carbon (the one next to NH2) would have two methoxy groups. So structure is CH2(NH2)(OCH3)2? No, that can't be right because that would make the molecule unstable. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (OCH3)2CH-NH2. Or wait, maybe it's (CH3O)2CH2NH2? Hmm, maybe it's better to draw it mentally. So ethan-1-amine is CH3
