Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about pericyclic reactions, specifically sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question has three reactions (A, B, C) and four options (A, B, C, D). I need to figure out the products for each and match them with the options.

First, let me start with reaction A. The reactant is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me draw the structure. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would have an amine group on carbon 1, with two methoxy groups also on carbon 1. So the structure is like H2N-C(OCH3)2.

But wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-amine is NH2-CH2-. So 1,1-dimethoxy would have two OMe groups on the same carbon as the NH2. So the structure is NH2-C(OCH3)2? Or is it ethane with the amine on C1 and two OMe on C1 as substituents? Either way, perhaps it's a compound where the amine is adjacent to two methoxy groups.

The other reactant is but-3-en-2-ol. Structure: CH2CHCH2OH, but wait. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Or maybe it's CH2=CHCH2CH2OH? Wait, no. The correct structure for but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2(OH)CH2CH3. Wait, maybe I should write it as CH2=CHCH2OH? No, no, wait. The formula is but-3-en-2-ol. So the double bond is between C3 and C4, but wait, butane is four carbons, so numbering from 1 to 4. So 3-en means double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between C2 and C3, because the position is after the -en. Wait, no. The numbering starts from the end closest to the hydroxyl group. So but-3-en-2-ol would have the OH on C2, and the double bond between C3 and C4. So structure is CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond? No, that can't be, because but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2(OH)CH2CH3 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2CH2OH. Wait, but that would be 1-butene with hydroxyl on the end
