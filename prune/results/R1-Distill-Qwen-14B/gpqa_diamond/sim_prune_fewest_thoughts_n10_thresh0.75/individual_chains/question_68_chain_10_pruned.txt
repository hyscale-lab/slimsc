Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says there's a particle with spin 1/2 and magnetic moment mu equals gamma times Sz. Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. So the magnetic moment is aligned with the field, right? Because if the field is in +Z, the magnetic moment, which is proportional to Sz, would be pointing the same way to minimize energy.

Then, suddenly the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, with the same magnitude B. Wait, so the initial field was along Z, then it's switched to Y, same strength.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So after the field changes, what happens to <mu_z>?

I remember that when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. Initially, the Hamiltonian was H_initial = -mu · B. Since B was along Z, H_initial = -gamma Sz B.

When the field changes to Y, H_final = -mu · B', where B' is along Y. So H_final = -gamma (Sx B) because Y direction for spin is Sx? Wait, no, wait. Spin components: Sx is in x, Sy in y, Sz in z. Oh wait, no. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin operators are Sx, Sy, Sz. So if the magnetic field is in +Y direction, the magnetic moment (which is gamma Sz?) No, wait. Wait, the magnetic moment mu is given as mu = gamma * Sz. Oh, wait, that's interesting. So mu is specifically in the z-direction because it's gamma times Sz. So if the magnetic field is in the Y direction, the interaction would be mu · B = (gamma Sz) · (B Y). Hmm, wait, no. The dot product of mu and B would involve their vector components. Wait, mu is a vector, and B is a vector. So if mu is gamma Sz, then mu has components (0, 0, gamma S_z). Oh wait, no, because Sz is an operator, so mu would have components (gamma Sx, gamma Sy, gamma Sz)? No, wait, no. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The magnetic moment mu is given as mu = gamma * Sz. So mu is a vector whose components are (gamma Sx, gamma Sy, gamma Sz)? Or is mu in the direction of spin? Wait, no, wait. Spin is a vector operator, so if the particle's spin is in a particular direction, the magnetic moment would be proportional to that spin. Wait, but the formula says mu equals gamma times Sz. So that would imply mu is along the z-axis. Hmm, but when the magnetic field is along Y, the magnetic moment would experience a torque, causing it to precess around Y.

Wait, but the initial situation is that the magnetic field is along Z. So the magnetic moment mu is aligned with Z. So the eigenstate is |+z> or |-z>, right? Because mu is along Z.

Then the field is switched off in Z and on in Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B = -gamma Sz *
