Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I remember that non-Gaussian states are important in quantum optics and quantum information because they exhibit more complex behavior than Gaussian states, which include coherent states, squeezed states, etc.

The state given is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. Oh wait, N is the normalization constant. And N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2*alpha²)). Okay, so normalization is important because the state needs to be a valid quantum state with norm 1.

The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I'll need to compute the non-Gaussianity measure, which is defined as del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state, and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on what the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity actually measures. From what I remember, relative entropy is a measure of distinguishability between two states. Here, it's the difference between the entropy of the state rho and the entropy of the reference Gaussian state tau. So higher del_b implies more non-Gaussianity.

But before calculating all that, I need to find the density matrix rho for the given state. The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha>, right? Coherent states are Gaussian states, but their superpositions can lead to non-Gaussian states.

The density matrix rho is |psi><psi|. So I'll need to compute rho and then find its entropy. The problem is that calculating this directly might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps there's a known formula or a way to relate this to known results.

Wait, but the relative entropy measure compares the state to a Gaussian reference. What is the reference Gaussian state tau in this case? I think it's the closest Gaussian state to rho. Alternatively, maybe it's the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho. I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps for this problem, I don't need to calculate tau explicitly.
