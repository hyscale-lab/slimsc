Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what I remember and how I can apply it.

The question is about identifying a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using the given spectroscopic data. The options are four different organic compounds, each with a benzene ring and some substituents. The IR and NMR data will help narrow it down.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3420 and 3325 cm-1, which are medium to strong. Those are probably due to N-H or O-H stretching. Wait, but if it's amide or amine groups, the N-H peaks usually appear around 3300-3500, maybe as a broad peak. Oh wait, but in the IR data here, they're two separate peaks. Hmm. Could that be from an amide group, which has two N-H stretches (like in a secondary amide), or maybe an amine? Or maybe it's an O-H group, but that usually shows up as a broad peak, not two. Or perhaps it's another possibility, like an aromatic amine or something else.

Then, there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a good indicator. A strong peak around 1700-1750 typically corresponds to carbonyl groups (C=O). So this compound has a carbonyl. Now, what kind of carbonyl? If it's a ketone, ester, amide, or maybe a formamide. Let me think: esters have C=O around 1730-1750. Amides are usually a bit lower, like 1650-1680, but if it's a formamide (like R-NH-C=O), maybe that's higher. Wait, I'm a bit confused about formamide's exact position. Alternatively, maybe it's an acyl group attached to something else.

Looking at the 1H NMR data now.
