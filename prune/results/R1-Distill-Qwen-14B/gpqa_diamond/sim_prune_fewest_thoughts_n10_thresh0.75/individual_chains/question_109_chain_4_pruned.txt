Okay, so I'm trying to solve this nuclear physics problem. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the emission of a particle by two nucleons in a 1S0 state, and we're supposed to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed based on conservation laws.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. The term is written as (2S+1)L(J), right? So 1S0 would mean 2(0)+1 =1, so the spin part is S=0, L is 0 (since it's S), and J is 0. So the initial state has spin 0, orbital angular momentum 0, and total angular momentum 0.

The two nucleons emit a particle X. The particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of the system changes due to this emission. Also, according to the Pauli exclusion principle, the total wavefunction (which is a product of spatial, spin, and isospin parts) must be antisymmetric under exchange of the two nucleons. But wait, the problem statement says that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. So the isospin T has to satisfy this condition.

The final state NN has T=0. So let's compute T for the final state. T=0. Let me see what that implies about the other quantum numbers.

So from the condition: T = S + L +1 mod 2. Since T is 0, 0 â‰¡ S + L +1 mod 2. So S + L must be 1 mod 2. So S and L must have opposite parity (one even, the other odd).

Now, the initial state. The system is in 1S0, which I think implies that the initial state has S=0, L=0, and J=0. So when they emit a particle, the system's angular momentum and spin might change. Wait, but in terms of the final state, the NN system must have their own S, L, and J.

Wait, no, the final state after emission is the NN system plus the particle X. But in the problem statement, the options are about the partial wave of X, right? Because each option shows 1S0 -> some state plus p, s, etc. So the particle emitted is X, and its angular momentum is given
