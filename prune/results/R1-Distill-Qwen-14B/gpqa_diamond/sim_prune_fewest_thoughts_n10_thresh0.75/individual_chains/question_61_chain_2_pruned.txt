Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with benzene and ending with a final product. There are five steps in total, each leading to a new product. I'll go through each step one by one, thinking about what reactions occur and what structures are formed.

Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) are used as a nitrating mixture. When benzene undergoes nitration, it typically adds a nitro group. Benzene is a good aromatic compound, so the nitration would substitute a hydrogen with a nitro group. The nitration reaction is an example of electrophilic substitution. The nitro group is a strong meta-directing group. So the product, product 1, should be nitrobenzene. Structure-wise, that's benzene with a nitro group in the para position? Wait, no, nitration of benzene adds nitro in the meta position? Wait, wait, no—nitro is a meta-directing group, but that's when another substituent is present. Wait no, the first nitration of benzene would produce nitrobenzene with the nitro group in the para position, but wait, no, benzene is symmetric, so nitro can only add once. No, wait, when benzene is nitrated, the product is nitrobenzene with a single nitro group. So, product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Wait, wait, no—I think for benzene, the nitration gives nitrobenzene, which is a benzene ring with a nitro group attached. Since the starting material is benzene, product 1 is nitrobenzene. So, that's a nitro group in the para position to itself, but since it's the only substituent, it's just a single nitro group attached.

Wait, no, in benzene, when you nitrate it, the nitro group can enter any position, but due to symmetry, it's just nitrobenzene—so the exact structure is a benzene ring with a nitro group attached in a single position, which is the same as any other position due to the ring's symmetry. So product
