Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about how the number of stars changes with distance. Let's see what the question says.

The question states that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power, so 1/plx^5. And they're asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right! Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if plx increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa. The formula is plx = 1/distance in parsecs, I think. So distance r is roughly 1/plx.

Wait, the number of stars N varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

Since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, N would be proportional to 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me calculate that. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5. So 1/(1/r^5) is r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Wait N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. And plx is 1/r (since plx = 1/r). So plx = 1/r → r = 1/(plx). So substituting, N = 1/( (1/r) )^5 = r^5.

So the number of stars is proportional to r^5.

But wait, the question is about how N changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh, because when you look at a range of distances, you have to consider the volume, which depends on r squared. Wait, but here we have a relation that's not directly about volume. This is a specific case where the number varies with plx in a certain way.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's think about how the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r depends on r.

In general, the number of stars in a volume between r and r + dr is proportional to the volume element multiplied by the number density. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Wait, the question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But plx = 1/r, so N ∝ r^5.

So for each unit increase in r, the number of stars increases by r^5 per unit distance. So the change in N with r is proportional to r^5.

Looking at the options, option B is r^5. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about whether I've made any mistake in substitution.

plx is 1/r in parsecs. So N is proportional to 1/(plx^5) = r^5. So as r increases, N increases as the fifth power. So per unit r, N increases as r^5.

So the answer is B, which is ~r^5.


The question states that the number of stars \( N \) in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax \( \text{plx} \) as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax is inversely proportional to distance \( r \), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting this into the given relationship, we find:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5.
\]

Thus, the number of stars \( N \) is proportional to \( r^5 \). Since the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of \( r \), the dependence remains \( N \propto r^5 \).

From the options provided:
- **A)** \( \sim r^3 \): Incorrect, as the dependence is \( r^5 \), not \( r^3 \).
- **B)** \( \sim r^5 \): Correct, as derived above.
- **C)** \( \sim r^4 \): Incorrect, as the dependence is \( r^5 \), not \( r^4 \).
- **D)** \( \sim r^2 \): Incorrect, as the dependence is \( r^5 \), not \( r^2 \).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: B
