Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but let's see.

So the problem says there are two binary systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses, and their periods are given. System_1 has a period of 2 years, and system_2 is 1 year. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses, which I guess means the orbital period of the stars around each other.

Then, spectroscopic observations give the radial velocity amplitudes. For system_1, the stars have RV variations of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2's are 15 and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Oh wait, but wait, the mass of each system is the sum of the two stars' masses.

Wait, I remember that in binary stars, the radial velocity method is used to find the mass function, which relates the velocities to the masses. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Let me think. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K (which is the amplitude observed) is related to the mass of the companion. The formula I remember is something like K = (v * sin i) where v is the orbital speed. But when you have two stars, each orbiting the common center of mass, their velocities are related to their masses.

So for a binary system, the more massive star moves slower because it's closer to the center of mass. So if star A is more massive, it has a smaller velocity amplitude.

In a binary system, the two stars' velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. Because the center of mass requires m1 * a1 = m2 * a2, where a is the orbital radius (distance from the center), so m1/m2 = a2/a1. Since velocity v is proportional to a (because v = 2Ï€a/P), and P is the same for both, the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So if m1 is bigger, its velocity is smaller.

So for system_1, the two RVs are 10 and 5. Let's say star A has velocity 10, star B has 5. So their mass ratio would be m1/m2 = (v2)/(v1) = 5/10 = 1/2. So m1 is half the mass of m2? Wait, no, because m1 is the more massive star. Wait, no, if star A has a higher velocity, it's less massive. Because the more massive one moves slower. So if star A has velocity 10 and star B 5, then m_A/m_B = v_B / v_A = 5/10 = 1/2. So m_A is half of m_B. Thus, the total mass of system_1 would be m_A + m_B = (1/2 m_B) + m_B = (3/2) m_B. So system_1's total mass is 1.5 times m_B, but wait wait, I think I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps it
