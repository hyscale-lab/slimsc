Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about the luminosities of two stars. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.

Alright, so there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, so both radius and mass are scaled by the same factor. But wait, the question is about luminosity, right?

The question says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body is determined by Wien's Law, which is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if lambda_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same because if T increases, lambda_max decreases. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Oh yeah, because the stars are radiating as black bodies, so their luminosities depend on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So since both stars have the same temperature, T is the same for both. So the luminosity would be proportional to R squared times T^4. But wait, since T is the same for both, the luminosity should be proportional to R squared. Because T^4 cancels out when taking the ratio. Because L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4). Since T1 = T2, it's (R1/R2)^2.

Wait, but wait another thing. The masses of the stars are given as 1.5 times, but in this problem, the masses might not directly affect the luminosity. Because luminosity for main-sequence stars is more closely tied to mass, but in this case, the question states that they're assuming black body radiation, so perhaps the mass is a distractor. Because if they are main-sequence stars, more massive stars are hotter, but here, the peak wavelengths are the same, implying same temperature, so maybe they are not main-sequence? Or perhaps the mass is just additional info, but not directly needed for the calculation.

So focusing on the luminosity. Star_1 has radius 1.5 times Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. But since T1 = T2, that ratio is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the luminosity of Star_1 would be 2.25 times that of Star_2.

But wait, the options include 2.25 and also 2.23 and 2.32, 2.35. So option A is 2.25, which seems straightforward. But wait, is there another factor I'm missing here?

The question also mentions the radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of
