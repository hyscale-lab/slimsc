Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, let me think. Alright, the question is about the probability of an atom decaying over a certain period. Let me break it down.

So, the problem says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. That means, if we have a bunch of these atoms, after 100 minutes, 32% of them would have decayed. But wait, the question is about a single atom. Oh right, in radioactive decay, each atom has a certain probability of decaying regardless of the others. So the fact that one hasn't decayed yet might affect the remaining probability?

Wait, I remember from my studies that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. So the decay process is memoryless, which I think means that the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So if 50 minutes have passed without decay, does that change the probability for the next 150 minutes?

Wait, no. The decay probability is based on the half-life or the decay constant. Let me clarify. The decay constant λ is related to the half-life t½ by λ = ln(2)/t½. The probability P that an atom decays in a time t is P = 1 - e^(-λt). 

But wait, the question states that the probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So 32% is P(100) = 0.32. So I can write that as 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 1
