Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with buffer solutions and all that. But I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. In this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with water. The temperature is 25°C, and we need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-.

Wait, orthophosphate is the conjugate base, right? Because H3PO4 has three dissociation steps, so PO4^3- is the deprotonated form from HPO4^2-, which comes from H2PO4^-. So in this solution, I probably have a buffer system involving H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

I remember that when you mix a weak acid with its conjugate base, you get a buffer solution. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is probably involved here. But wait, which pKa should I use? Because H3PO4 has three Ka values: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. 

So, the first deprotonation (H3PO4 → H2PO4^- + H+) has a Ka1 of 7.5e-3. The second is H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+ with Ka2 of 6.2e-8. The third is HPO4^2- → PO4^3- + H+ with Ka3 of 1.8e-12. So the relevant pKa here is probably the second one, because the solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think: KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- (since K+ is the counterion). Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus water. So I have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution. That's the second dissociation step. So the buffer is between H2PO4^- (the acid, which can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-) and HPO4^2- (the conjugate base, which can accept a proton to become H2PO4^-).

So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation should be used with the pKa of the second dissociation. Let me calculate pKa2. Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa is log(1/(6.2e-8)).

Calculating that: log(6.2e-8) is log(6.2) + log(1e-8) → 0.792 ≈ 0.79 → so log(6.2e-8)= -7.12. So pKa2 is 7.12.

So the equation is pH = pKa2 + log([A-]/[HA]), where A- is HPO4^2- and HA is H2PO4^-.

Wait, but the question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3- (from HPO4^2- losing another H+). Hmm, that's complicating things. Because in the solution, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. PO4^3- is much less because the third dissociation is much weaker (Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so very small). So maybe the concentration of PO4^3- is
