Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for each reaction. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then, the second reaction uses the product from the first, which is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and reagent B (along with water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, what's going on here? Let me think about each step.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when it reacts with NaCN and reagent A, it's probably a nucleophilic addition. But wait, butan-2-one is a ketone. Oh, right! CN- is a nucleophile, and it can add to the carbonyl group. But wait, ketones typically undergo nucleophilic addition, but without any acidic protons, maybe it's more about the conditions.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. The nitrile is on the second carbon, and there's a hydroxyl group there too. So the starting material is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, perhaps it's a substitution after some kind of acid workup?

Wait, no. Wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So in ketones, under certain conditions, like maybe in a nucleophilic addition, the CN- could attack the carbonyl carbon. But then after that, what happens? For ketones, the mechanism would be nucleophilic addition, but then after adding CN-, maybe there's an acid workup that protonates the oxygen and then leads to elimination or something else.

Wait, but in the product, both the hydroxyl and the nitrile are on the same carbon. So the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So how does that happen?

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. If NaCN adds, the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, so we'll get (CH3)2C(O^-)CN. Then, perhaps under acidic conditions, something
