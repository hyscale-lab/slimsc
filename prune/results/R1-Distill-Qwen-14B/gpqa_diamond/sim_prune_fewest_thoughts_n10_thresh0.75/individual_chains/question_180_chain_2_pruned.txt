Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question again carefully.

So, the problem is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e, and they have negligible mass. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places in Joules. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right. I remember that when dealing with charges and their interactions, electric potential energy is a key concept. Since the system is isolated, we don't have to worry about external fields, just the interactions between these charges.

So, the setup is that one charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. Each charge is 2e, so the magnitude is twice the elementary charge. The elementary charge e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

Wait, but since we're dealing with electric potential energy between charges, the sign of the charges matters. But wait, the problem states they're identical particles each with charge 2e. So if they're like charges, meaning all positive or all negative, the potential energy would be positive if they're all positive because they repel each other. But the problem is about finding the minimum energy. Hmm, but wait, if all the charges are positive, the potential energy would be positive, and you might think that the minimum energy would be negative. Wait, no, that depends on the interactions. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the question is about the minimum energy. So perhaps the minimum is the lowest possible potential energy the system can have. That would occur when the potential energy is as negative as possible, which happens when the charges are as close as possible because opposite charges attract. But wait, in this problem, the 12 charges are fixed at a distance of 2 meters from point P, which is where the 13th charge is fixed. So all 12 are at 2m from P. So their positions are fixed, right? So the 13th charge is at P, fixed, and the others can't move because they are constrained. So the system's configuration is fixed. So the potential energy is determined by all the interactions between the charges.

Wait, but all the 12 are 2 meters away from P. So each of these 12 charges is 2 meters from the 13th charge at P. So each of the 12 has a charge of 2e, and the 13th is 2e as well. So each pair between the 13th and the 12 others would contribute to the potential energy.

Additionally, the 12 charges are at 2m from P, but what about their distance from each other? Oh, wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their positions are at a fixed radius of 2m around P, but how are they arranged? Are they all at the same point? Probably not, because
