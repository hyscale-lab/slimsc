Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the given options. The compound X has specific IR and NMR data provided. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the manufacture of alkenes, maybe via some elimination or perhaps a substitution reaction. Oh wait, I think it's the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and HCl, but wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Oh wait, actually, I think red phosphorus and HI are used for the reduction of carbonyl groups to alkanes. Clemmensen is for ketones and aldehydes, using HCl. Wait, no, maybe it's the other reaction. Oh right! When you have a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde), treating it with red phosphorus and HI can lead to the formation of an alkane. Because the P and HI would do a reduction, probably a deoxygenation. So if X has a carbonyl, that would be reduced.

So looking at the IR data first. The IR shows peaks in 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which suggests O-H or N-H stretch. But more likely O-H here because the other peaks include 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) peak. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are probably C=C stretching, maybe aromatic rings. So, the compound X has a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring. The O-H peak in IR (broad around 3400) could be from a carboxylic acid, but wait, carboxylic acids have a broad O-H around 2500-3000 as well. Alternatively, maybe an alcohol, but less likely if there's a carbonyl. Wait, but 1720 is high for a ketone. Wait, no, 1720 is more like a carbonyl in a ketone, maybe an ester or a carboxylic acid. Wait, carboxylic acids have lower wavenumbers for C=O, around
