Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The setup is that there's a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The problem also gives me the formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. And the pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about that complicating things. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so probably no issues there.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It binds metal ions like Ca²+ pretty tightly. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, and the solution is 0.02 M of that complex. But the question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. So, I think I need to find [Ca²+] when the complex is in solution.

Formation constants (K) are for the reaction where the metal ion and EDTA form the complex. The general equation would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for this reaction. So K is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in this case, we have a solution where the complex is already formed. So the initial concentration is 0.02 M of CaEDTA^2-. That means the concentration of EDTA and calcium in their free forms will be very low because the complex is stable (since K is large, 5e10, so it's a strong complex).

So, let me set this up. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's assume that some of it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. Let the concentration of Ca²+ be x. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x, because each complex releases one Ca and one EDTA.

So, the K expression is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

Substituting the values, [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 - x, but wait,
