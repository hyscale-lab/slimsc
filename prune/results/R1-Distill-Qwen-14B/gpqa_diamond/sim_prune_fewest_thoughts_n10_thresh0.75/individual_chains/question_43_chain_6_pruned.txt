Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about naming a benzene ring with several substituents. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when naming benzene derivatives, the substituents are numbered in a way that gives the lowest possible set of numbers. The principal functional group gets the lowest number, and it's usually the one with the highest priority. The order of priority for functional groups is: carboxylic acid is the highest, followed by nitriles, then aldehydes, and then others like ethers and alcohols.

The molecule in question has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which is an aldehyde), and a cyano group (which is a nitrile). Then, it also has a hydroxyl group and a dimethylamino group ortho to the carboxylic acid, and a methoxy group para to the carboxylic acid. Additionally, the methoxy and the alcohol are both ortho to the nitrile.

Wait, let me visualize this. The benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group attached. The substituents are meta to each other. Hmm, wait, the question says that the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano group are all meta to one another. So, each of these three groups is at a position that's meta relative to the others.

Wait, meta to each other? So, if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then the carbaldehyde (formyl) would be at position 3, and the cyano at position 5? Because in a benzene ring, positions 1, 3, 5 are meta to each other. Or wait, no. If the substituents are all meta to one another, each pair is meta. So, for three substituents to be all meta, they must be placed at positions 1, 3, and 5. Because in a benzene ring, position 1 is meta to 3 and 5, and so on.

Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring. Let's imagine the numbering. Let's say the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Then, the carbal
