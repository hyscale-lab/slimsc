Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the solution has 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The problem gives me the molecular weights: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are given as Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, and Ka3=1.8e-12.

Wait, orthophosphate ions are HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Or is it H2PO4^-? Hmm, I think orthophosphate is H3PO4. Oh wait, no, the terms can get confusing. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, and the ions are H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. So orthophosphate ion is probably referring to H2PO4^- in this context because that's the first deprotonated form.

But wait, the solution has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me think about what those salts dissociate into. 

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its dissociation would give K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When it dissociates in solution, it would give 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So in solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Hmm. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's not present as the acid because it's in a solution where phosphate exists as ions. Wait, maybe I got it wrong. Or maybe it's referring to the HPO4^2- ion as orthophosphate? Or perhaps, since the solution is a buffer, the
