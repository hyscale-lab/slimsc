Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR and reaction mechanisms can get tricky. Let me take it step by step.

The question starts with Compound A. Its proton NMR has two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I'm trying to think about what structure would give that. Triplets usually mean coupling with two neighboring protons, and quartets with three. Wait, but for NMR signals, it's the splitting due to neighboring protons. So the triplet (0.9 ppm, 6H) is probably from two sets of equivalent protons. Hmm, 0.9 ppm is typically for methyl groups attached to something, maybe a CH2 or a cyclohexane ring. The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4Hâ€”quartet suggests each proton is next to three others. So maybe a CH2 adjacent to another CH2 group.

Wait, maybe it's a di-substituted cyclohexane. Let me think: if compound A is cyclohexane with two substituents. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) could be two methyl groups attached to adjacent carbons. Each methyl would be next to another CH2 group. So the structure might be something like 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane. Because then each methyl (CH2CH3) would be next to another CH2. Wait, but wait, the triplet implies that each proton on the CH2 is next to two protons. No, wait, if the protons are on CH2 groups that are adjacent, each CH2 would be next to another CH2. So the splitting for a CH2 next to another CH2 would be a quartet. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the triplet at 0.9 ppm is for 6H. So maybe it's two sets of 3H each, but that doesn't add up because 3H + 3H is 6H. Or maybe it's a single group of 6H? Wait, 6H is two CH2CH3 groups. Because each CH2CH3 has 3H, so two would have 6H. So if the structure is a cyclohexane ring with two CH2CH3 groups attached, maybe on adjacent carbons. So when
