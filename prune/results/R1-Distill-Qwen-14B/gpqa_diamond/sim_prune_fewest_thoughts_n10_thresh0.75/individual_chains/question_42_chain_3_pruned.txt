Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, let's see. The question gives me some ratios of equilibrium temperatures, masses, and asks about the orbital period ratio between Planet3 and Planet1. 

Wait, equilibrium temperature... right, that's the temperature a planet would have if it were a perfect black body, right? The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [ (L*(1 - a))/(16πσd²) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and d is the distance from the star. Since all three planets have the same albedo (0.3), that part is the same for all.

The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4. Similarly, T2/T3 is 2.3. So maybe I can find T1, T2, T3 in terms of each other. Let's see: T1 = 1.4*T2. And T2 = 2.3*T3. So substituting, T1 = 1.4 * 2.3 * T3. Let me calculate that: 1.4 * 2.3 is about 3.22. So T1 = 3.22 * T3. That means T3 is T1 divided by 3.22, which is approximately 0.31 T1.

But wait, the question is about orbital periods. Oh right, orbital period relates to the distance from the star. The formula for orbital period is Kepler's third law: P² ∝ (d³)/(M), where M is the mass of the star. Wait, but wait, in this case, the problem gives the masses of the planets, not the star. Hmm, but I think in the TTV method, the masses of the planets influence the gravitational interactions, but Kepler's law is about the star's mass. Oh wait, but the problem doesn't give the star's mass. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, no, the problem gives the mass ratios of the planets. Planet1/Planet2 mass is 1.15, so Planet2 is about 1/1.15 times Planet1? Or wait, the ratio is Planet1/Planet2 =1.15, so Planet1 is 1.15 times more massive than Planet2. Similarly, Planet2/Planet3 is 1.35, so Planet2 is 1.35 times Planet3. So Planet1 is 1.15 * Planet2, and Planet2 is 1.35 * Planet3. So Planet1 is 1.15 * 1.35 * Planet3. 1.15 times 1.35 is approximately (1.1*1.3=1.43, 0.05*1.3=0.065, 1.1*0.05=0.055, 0.05*0.05=0.0025. Wait, better to compute 1.15 * 1.35. 1 *1.35=1.35, 0.15 *1.35=0.2025. So total 1.35 +0.2025=1.5525. So Planet1 is 1.5525 times Planet3 in mass. Hmm, not sure if that's directly relevant, but perhaps not for Kepler's law, since Kepler's law depends on the star's mass, not the planet's. So the
