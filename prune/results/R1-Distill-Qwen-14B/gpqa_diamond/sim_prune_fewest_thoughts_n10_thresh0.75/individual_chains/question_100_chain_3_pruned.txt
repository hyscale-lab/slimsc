Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, I remember that C3H6 is propene or propylene because the formula for alkenes is CnH2n. So for n=3, it's C3H6. So A is propene.

Then, compound A undergoes bromination in the presence of CCl4. Bromination of alkenes usually adds bromine across the double bond, right? So propene would react with Br2 to form 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, but wait, the structure of propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So adding bromine would add across the double bond. So the product would be 1,2-dibromopropane, which is BrCH2CHBrCH3? Or wait, wait, no. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, actually, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So when Br2 adds, it adds across the double bond, so the product, compound B, would be 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2BrCH2CH2Br? No, wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, I think it's CH2=CHCH3. So when Br2 adds, it's an anti addition
