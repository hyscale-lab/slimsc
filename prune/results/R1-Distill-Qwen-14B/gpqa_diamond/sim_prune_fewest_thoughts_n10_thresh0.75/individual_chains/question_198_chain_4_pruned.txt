Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in a solution. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)_2]²+ complex, right?

Wait, the question mentions 'blue dithiocyanato', and I remember that Co with two SCN ligands is often blue. So that's probably the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex, which would be the second complex in the series. But wait, the stability constants are given in order, so β1 is for the first complex, which would be [Co(SCN)]+? No, wait, stability constants are typically for the formation of the complex step by step. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^+, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^ something, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^ something else. But I'm a bit confused about the exact charge and structure.

Wait, the stability constant (formation constant) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the ions. So for the first complex, it's Co²+ + SCN^- ⇌ [CoSCN]^+, with β1=9. The second step would be [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_2]^0, and β2=40. Wait, but wait, the charges would change. Let me think about the charges.

Co²+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN^- is -1. So for each complex:

- [CoSCN]^+: Co²+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+, charge is +1. So β1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co²+][SCN
