Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its spectroscopic data.

First, the problem says the FTIR shows peaks for an ester group. Esters typically have a carbonyl group (C=O) which absorbs around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹. So that's one functional group confirmed.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data. There are six signals in total. Let's break them down:

1. Two signals for aromatic protons. Since the ring is di-substituted, the aromatic protons could be in ortho, meta, or para positions. But the number of signals suggests symmetry. For example, if the substituents are para, there might be two sets of aromatic protons (each with two equivalent H), but maybe more if they're in other positions. Hmm.

2. Two signals for vinyl protons. A doublet and a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically adjacent to a double bond. The doublet might be a trans coupling, and the quartets could be from coupling with adjacent protons on a double bond, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, a vinyl group would have two protons that are adjacent. So maybe the doublet is from one J coupling, and the quartet is from another. Alternatively, perhaps the doublet is from coupling with another proton, and the quartet from coupling with two others. Not sure yet.

3. Two signals for –CH3 groups. So there are two sets of methyl groups. One possibility is that the substituents on the aromatic ring are esters, each with a methyl group, but maybe in different environments. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents have different structures where each has a methyl.

The absence of –CH2 signals suggests that there are no methylene groups in the molecule. So the substituents can't have CH2 groups. For example, if the substituents were ethyl esters (OCH2CH3), that would produce CH2 signals, which aren't present here. So the ester groups must be methyl esters. Because esters are usually R-O-CO-O-R', wait, no, wait. No, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So if the substituent is an ester like OCOCH3, that's a methyl ester. But then, in that case, the ester would contribute a methyl group. Wait, but the molecule is di-substituted, so perhaps each substituent is an ester group. Or maybe one substituent is an ester and another is something else. Wait, but the IR shows an ester, so only one ester group? Or maybe two?

Wait, the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents on the aromatic ring. Maybe each substituent is an ester group. But that would mean each has a carbonyl, but wait, no, because the IR only shows peaks for an ester. Hmm, maybe each substituent
