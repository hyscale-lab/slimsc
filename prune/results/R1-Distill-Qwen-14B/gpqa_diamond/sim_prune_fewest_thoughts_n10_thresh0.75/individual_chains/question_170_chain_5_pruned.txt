Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that an electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). I need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. The options are given, so I'll work through it and see which one it matches.

First, I remember that the expectation value of an observable is calculated as the bra-ket of the state with the operator acting on it. So, for S_y, the expectation value would be ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩.

Wait, but what's S_y in terms of the Pauli matrices? Oh right, the spin operator S is given by ħ/2 times the Pauli matrix σ. So S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y. And the σ_y matrix is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So that's the matrix we'll be using.

The spin state ψ is given as (3i, 4). I should write this as a column vector. So ψ = [3i; 4]. I think the notation here is the first component is the first entry, so yeah, that's correct.

Now, to compute the expectation value, I need to calculate ⟨ψ| σ_y |ψ⟩ multiplied by ħ/2.

Let me break it down. First, compute σ_y |ψ⟩. Then take the inner product with ⟨ψ|.

So σ_y is a 2x2 matrix:
[0, -i]
[i, 0]

Multiplying this by the vector [3i; 4]:

σ_y |ψ⟩ = [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) , (i)(3i) + (0)(4) ]^T ?

Wait, no, wait. Matrix multiplication: each component is the dot product of the matrix's row with the vector.

So first component is (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component is (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = i * 3i = 3i². Since i² is -1, that's 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y |ψ⟩ = [ -4i ; -3 ]

Wait, maybe I should double-check my matrix multiplication. Let me write it out:

σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
|ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]^T

So,

First element of σ_y |ψ⟩ is (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = (-4i)
Second element is (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = i*(3i) =3i² = -3.

Yes, that looks right.

Now, the inner product ⟨ψ| σ_y |ψ⟩ is the conjugate transpose of ψ dotted with σ_y |ψ⟩.

ψ is [3i, 4], so the conjugate transpose (bra) is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, wait, no. The conjugate transpose would be [ (3i)* , 4* ] → [ -3i, 4 ] because the conjugate of 3i is -3i, and 4's conjugate is 4.

So now, we compute [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ -4i ; -3 ]

The inner product is (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3).

Let me compute each term.

First term: (-3i)(-4i) = 12 i². Since i² is -1, this becomes 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

So adding the two terms: -12 + (-12) = -24.

Wait, that can't be right, because expectation value can't be negative in this context. Or can it? Because the spin can have positive or negative values. Hmm, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the matrix multiplication or the inner product.

Wait wait, let's be precise. The inner product is the first component times the first component, plus the second component times the second component.

Wait, no, no. The inner product is the row vector [a*, b*] multiplied by the column vector [c; d], so a* c + b* d.

Given that:

a is 3i → a* is -3i.

b is 4 → b* is 4.

c is -4i.

d is -3.

So the inner product is (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3).

Compute each term:

(-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

4*(-3) = -12.

Adding them together: -12 + (-12) = -24.

So the inner product is -24.

But wait, that's without the ħ/2 factor, right? Because S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y.

So the expectation value is (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12 ħ.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, none of them have -12 ħ. Or do they?

Let me see the options again.

Options:

A) -12*hbar/25

B) 12*hbar/25

C) 25*hbar/2

D) -25*hbar/2

Hmm, so my calculation gives -24 ħ/2, which is -12 ħ. That's not matching any of the options.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the inner product calculation? Or perhaps I messed up the matrix multiplication.

Wait, perhaps
