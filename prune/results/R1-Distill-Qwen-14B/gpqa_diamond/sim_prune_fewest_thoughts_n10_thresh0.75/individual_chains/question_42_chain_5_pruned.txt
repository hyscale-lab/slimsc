Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. It's about exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for Transit Timing Variation. I think TTV is a method used to detect planets by observing changes in the timing of a planet's transit as it passes in front of its star. This method can detect other planets in the system because their gravity affects the timing of transits of the planet we can see.

The question gives me some ratios between the equilibrium temperatures of the planets and the masses. The planets are Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. The ratios are Planet1 to Planet2 temperature is 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 2.3. So, Planet1 is hotter than Planet2, and Planet2 is hotter than Planet3. But wait, equilibrium temperature usually depends on the distance from the star, right? The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ))^(1/4) ) * ( (M_planet) / (M_star) )^(some exponent?) Wait, no, wait. The equilibrium temperature is given by the formula T = T_star * ( (R_star / (2a)) )^(1/2), where a is the planet's orbital distance. Or wait, no, maybe I'm mixing that up. Let me think.

Actually, the equilibrium temperature is calculated using the formula:

T_planet = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) )

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the formula is based on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. The standard formula is T = T_star * ( ( L ) / ( (4πσ) ) )^(1/4) * ( (1 - albedo) / ( (1 - e^2)^(0.5) ) ) )^(0.25) ) * ( (a / R_star) )^(-0.5) ), but that seems complicated.
