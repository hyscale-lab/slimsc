Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out how many carbon atoms are in product 3. Let me try to break this down step by step because I'm still pretty new to these reactions.

Alright, the starting material is trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember trans-cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde, right? It has a benzene ring attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to a double bond, then another CH and an aldehyde group. Wait, no, let me get that right. Trans-cinnamaldehyde is actually the aldehyde form of cinnamic acid. So its structure is a benzene ring with a propenal substituent. The structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, wait, no. Wait, cinnamic acid is Ph-CH2-CH2-COOH, but the aldehyde version would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? Or is it Ph-CH=CH-CHO? Oh yeah, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH=CH-CHO. And since it's trans, the substituents on the double bond are on opposite sides. So the structure is benzaldehyde with a vinyl group attached.

So the first step is treating trans-cinnamaldehyde with methyl magnesium bromide. That's a Grignard reagent. Grignard reagents add to carbonyl groups. So the aldehyde group is a carbonyl. So in the first step, the Grignard would add to the aldehyde, forming an alcohol.

Wait, aldehyde has the structure RCHO. Grignard adds to the carbonyl, so the mechanism would be the Grignard (CH3-) attacks the carbonyl carbon, then the oxygen gets a negative charge, which then picks up a proton from the workup (maybe water). So the product would be RCH2OMgBr... wait, no. Wait, after the Grignard adds, you have RCH2-O-MgBr, but then during workup (maybe acid), it would protonate to RCH2-OH. Wait, no, wait. No, when you add a Grignard to an aldehyde, the general reaction is RCHO + RMgX â†’ RCH2OR (but I'm getting a
