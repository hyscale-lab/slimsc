Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question again.

The scenario is that I've synthesized a small peptidic compound. When I look at the 1H NMR of the crude material, most of the peaks match what's expected. Except, there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. These two have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So the integral suggests it's the same proton, but split into two. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause.

Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum matching the expected molecule. So, same molecular weight, but two separate peaks on the LC.

Hmm, what could cause this? Let's go through the options.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, a precursor would have a different mass. Since the MS has the same mass, that might not fit. Unless the precursor somehow has the same mass, which seems unlikely for a peptidic compound. So maybe not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular formula and same physical properties except for their optical activity. So in NMR, they would show the same shifts, but wait, if the compound is a racemic mixture, the NMR would only show one set of peaks because the environments are identical. So why would there be two peaks for the same alpha-proton? Maybe if the coupling is intra-molecular or something else... Or perhaps if the enantiomers are causing a splitting, but I'm not sure. Also, in the NMR, the integrals add to 1H. Enantiomers would have the same NMR spectrum, so why two peaks? That might not explain the NMR observation.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not exactly sure what 'double coupling' means here. Maybe it's a term related to side reactions during the formation of the amide bond. For example, if two different amide bonds formed or something, but that's unclear. Alternatively, maybe in the reaction, the protons are coupling with more than one other proton, but the question says coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So maybe it's not about coupling in NMR, but about the reaction forming two different structures.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR spectra would show different peaks. Each diastereomer would have their own set of protons. But wait, the question says the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. So each diastereomer would have that proton, but perhaps in different environments. But wait, the integrals add up to 1H. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. That suggests that the proton is split into two, but the total is 1H. So maybe the alpha-proton is in a different environment in two different isomers. For diastereomers, each would have the same alpha-proton, but the environment would be different, leading to different shifts. That would explain two separate peaks with similar shifts if the environments are very similar. But why would the integrals add up to 1H? Because each diastereomer contributes one proton, but since they're both present in the same amount, perhaps the integral for each is 0.5H, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a 1:1 mixture, so each peak integrates to 0.5H, adding up to 1H.

In the LC-MS, two peaks but same mass. Diastereomers would have different physical properties, but same molecular weight. So they would elute at different times, hence two peaks. But wait, the question says both have the same mass spectrum. So that's consistent with diastereomers, which have the same molecular formula but different structures, so same mass
