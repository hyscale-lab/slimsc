Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the layer of a star where light is emitted, right? The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium.

Wait, so in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor tells us the relative number of particles in two energy states. The formula is something like N2/N1 = exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*T) ), right? Oh wait, E2 is higher than E1 because if an atom is excited, it's in a higher energy level. So if in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited, that means N2 (the excited state) is twice as much compared to star_2's N2. Or wait, wait. Wait, the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So for a given energy level, say level E2 compared to E1, the ratio N2/N1 is higher in star_1.

Wait, more specifically, N2/N1 is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels. Since the energy difference is given, let's call it ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

In star_1, the ratio is twice that of star_2. Wait, or no. Wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So, the excitation state is higher in star_1. So the number of atoms in the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2 for the same energy level.

Wait, but how do the temperatures relate to this? Because the Boltzmann factor depends on temperature. So for each star, the ratio N2/N1 will be different based on their temperatures.

Let me define the ratios for each star. Let's say for star_1, the ratio is R1 = N2_1 / N1_1. For star_2, R2 = N2_2 / N1_2. According to the problem, R1 = 2 * R2.

But wait, I think the ratio is R = (number in excited state)/(number in ground state). So for star_1, R1 = 2 * R2.

Because for star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as star_2, so R1 = 2 R2.

Now, using the Boltzmann equation, R = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). So,

R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) )
R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) )

So the ratio R1/R2 is [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let's compute R1/R2:

R1/R2 = [exp(-ΔE/(kT1)) ] / [exp(-ΔE/(kT2))] = exp( ΔE/(k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] )

Because when you divide exponents, you subtract the exponents. So, the exponents are (-ΔE/(k T1)) and (-ΔE/(k T2)), so subtracting gives (ΔE/(k))(1/T2 - 1/T1).

But wait, the problem states that R1 = 2 R2. So R1/R2 = 2. So,

2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

ln(2) = [ ΔE/(k) ] (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Hmm, rearranging,

ln(2) = [ ΔE/(k) ] ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

Wait, because (1/T2 -1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Hmm, but I don't see T1 and T2 in the options, so perhaps I can rearrange this equation differently.

Wait, but the problem gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. But perhaps for this question, the exact value isn't needed because the other terms might cancel or not appear in the options.

Looking at the options, they are all equations with ln(2) on the left. So to match the options, perhaps I can rewrite the equation.

Let me denote the equation as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

But the options don't have ΔE or k. So perhaps the correct equation is ln(2) equals (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) multiplied by something, but the options don't include that. Wait, perhaps the options are written in terms of T1 and T2 only, without the constants.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Option C) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)^2 )

So, from my equation, ln(2) equals (ΔE/(k)) multiplied by (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So, without knowing the values of ΔE and k, perhaps the equation is proportional to (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So the correct option would have ln(2) equal to (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) multiplied by a factor, but the options don't include the factor. Hmm, but the options might have a different arrangement.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-express the equation.

We had:

R1 = 2 R2

R1/R2 = 2

Which is exp( [ΔE/(k) ] (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2

Taking ln,

[ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Multiply both sides by (k/ΔE):

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln(2)) / ΔE

But let me see, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = (k ln(2)) / ΔE

So, rearranged,

ln(2) = [ ΔE/(k) ] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But I don't know if any of the options include this. Looking back, the options don't have ΔE or k, so perhaps the question is considering the equation without these constants, leading to the equation as ln(2) equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) multiplied by (ΔE/k). But given that the question asks for the equation that is correct, perhaps the option that matches the form (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) is option D.

Wait, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So, from our equation, when you factor in the constants, the equation is:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But the options don't have ΔE or k, so it's possible that the correct option is D, but with the assumption that (ΔE/k) is being treated as 1, which isn't the case. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me recheck. The ratio of populations is R1 = 2 R2. So,

R1 = 2 R2

But R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2

So, same as before. So taking ln,

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Which can be written as,

(ΔE/k) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

But none of the options have ΔE or k in them, which suggests that perhaps the equation can be simplified in terms of T1 and T2, but I'm not seeing it. Wait, maybe I can rearrange this equation.

Wait, perhaps the equation is (ΔE/(k)) (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which can be written as,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (k ln(2)) / ΔE )

But without knowing the value of k and ΔE, perhaps the equation in the options must match this form. Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) equals (T1-T2)/(T1 T2). So our equation is ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1-T2)/(T1 T2). So without knowing the constants, perhaps the correct form is option D, but scaled by (ΔE/k). But the problem doesn't give us the value of that, so perhaps the equation provided in the options assumes that (ΔE/k) is equal to 1, which is not correct, but maybe that's the intended step.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the setup. Wait, perhaps the energy difference is given but not needed for the relation between T1 and T2. Because the equation involves the ratio, perhaps the constants cancel out when taking the ratio.

Wait, let me think again. The question gives the energy difference, but perhaps it's a red herring because when taking the ratio R1/R2, the ΔE cancels out. Wait no, it's in the exponents, so no, it doesn't cancel. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to write the equation as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which can be rearranged as,

(1/T2 -1/T1 ) = (k ln 2)/ΔE

But that's not matching any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the equation can be rewritten as,

(1/T1 - 1/T2 ) = (k ln 2)/ΔE

Which is the same as,

(T2 - T1)/(T1 T2) ) = (k ln 2)/ΔE

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = - (k ln 2)/ΔE

Which would imply,

ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) * (ΔE) ] / (k T1 T2 )

Hmm. But the options don't include this. So perhaps the correct equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ), assuming that the other constants are equal to 1, which they are not. But given the options, the equation that matches the structure is option D.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check. The problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So the excitation in star_1 is higher than in star_2. That means that the ratio N2/N1 is higher for star_1 than for star_2. So R1 = 2 R2.

Wait, but the Boltzmann factor says that higher temperature leads to higher excitation because the exponent is negative, so higher T makes the exponent less negative, so N2/N1 increases with T.

So if R1 = 2 R2, then star_1 must have a higher temperature than star_2. So T1 > T2.

Now, going back to the equation:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Since T1 > T2, 1/T2 is bigger than 1/T1, so 1/T2 - 1/T1 is positive. So ln(2) is positive, which makes sense because ΔE is positive, and (1/T2 - 1/T1) is positive, so the right-hand side is positive.

So, the equation is correct as written.

But the options don't have the (ΔE/k) term. So perhaps the question is only about the relationship between T1 and T2, ignoring the constants. But the options must include the correct form of the equation.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Our equation is ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the option D would match if (ΔE/k) equals 1. But that's not necessarily the case. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be, because the options are given. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Alternative approach: perhaps the ratio is inverted. Because in star_1, the excitation is higher, which would mean higher population in the excited state. So R1 = N2_1 / N1_1, R2 = N2_2 / N1_2.

Given that R1 = 2 R2,

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking both sides and dividing by exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ):

exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2

Taking ln:

(ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln 2

Multiplying both sides by k/ΔE:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = (k ln 2)/ΔE

Which can be written as:

( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = (k ln 2)/ΔE

Which is,

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = (k ln 2 ) / ΔE

But again, this doesn't match any of the options since the options don't have k and ΔE. So perhaps we can write the equation in terms of T1 and T2 only, but I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the given energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. Let's compute (ΔE/k). The Boltzmann constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So,

ΔE / k = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So, (ΔE/k) = 1 K.

So our equation becomes,

ln(2) = (1 K) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which can be written as,

ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which is,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 )

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which matches option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So yeah, that's how the equation comes out. So the correct option is D.


The problem involves two stars, star_1 and star_2, where iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and the stellar photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The goal is to determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of the stars.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Boltzmann Distribution**: In LTE, the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann factor:
   \[
   \frac{N_2}{N_1} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
   \]
   where \( N_2 \) and \( N_1 \) are the populations of the excited and ground states, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

2. **Given Condition**: The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. This implies:
   \[
   \frac{N_{2,1}}{N_{1,1}} = 2 \cdot \frac{N_{2,2}}{N_{1,2}}.
   \]
   Using the Boltzmann factor, this translates to:
   \[
   \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
   \]

3. **Simplifying the Equation**: Dividing both sides by \( \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right) \), we get:
   \[
   \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
   \]
   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
   \]

4. **Rearranging the Equation**: The term \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) can be rewritten as:
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
   \]
   Substituting this back, we get:
   \[
   \ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
   \]

5. **Simplifying Further**: The Boltzmann constant \( k \) is approximately \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), and the given \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). Thus:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.38 \times 10^{-23}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} = 1.
   \]
   Substituting this into the equation:
   \[
   \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
   \]

6. **Matching with Options**: The derived equation matches **Option D**, which states:
   \[
   \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct equation relating the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) is given by Option D.
