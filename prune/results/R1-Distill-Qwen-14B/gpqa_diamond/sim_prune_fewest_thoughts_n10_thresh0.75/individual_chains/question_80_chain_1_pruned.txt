Okay, so I've come across this problem about an algorithm that takes DNA sequences as input and gives numerical outputs. The question is asking me to find the output for the sequence ACAGTGACC based on the examples given. Let me think about how to approach this.

The examples provided are:
AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

Hmm, I need to find a pattern or a rule that converts the DNA sequences into numbers. DNA sequences are made up of the nucleotides A, T, C, G. So each letter represents a base.

Let me list out the examples again:

First input: AGG
Output: 115

Second input: TGCTGA
Output: 176

I wonder if each nucleotide is being converted into a specific number, and then those numbers are being summed up or used in some other way. Alternatively, maybe it's something like treating the sequence as a base-4 number, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's see. Maybe each nucleotide is assigned a numerical value, and then the sum is calculated. Let's check:

Looking at AGG: A, G, G.

If I assign each nucleotide a value:
A = 1, T = 2, C = 3, G = 4 (for example), then for AGG, the sum would be 1 + 4 + 4 = 9. But that's way less than 115. So that might not be it.

Alternatively, perhaps each nucleotide is being converted to a number and then the entire string is treated as a number in a certain base.

Wait, another approach: maybe each nucleotide is converted into its position in the alphabet. Let's see:

A is the 1st letter, T is 20th, C is 3rd, G is 7th.

So for AGG: A(1) G(7) G(7) = 1,7,7.

If we consider this as a base-10 number, 177? No, but the output is 115. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's a base-4 system? Let me think. Each nucleotide corresponds to a base-4 digit. Let's assign numbers as A=0, T=1, C=2, G=3. Then, for example:

AG
