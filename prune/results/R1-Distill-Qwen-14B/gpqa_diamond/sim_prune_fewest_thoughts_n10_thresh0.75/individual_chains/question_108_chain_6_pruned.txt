Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term to the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm. I've heard about paramagnetism and the hydrogen atom model before, but I'm a bit rusty on the exact details. Let me think.

The setup says there's a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, and m is small. B is 1 Tesla, which is a pretty strong magnetic field, but I remember that in some contexts, even smaller fields can have significant effects.

So, the problem is about comparing two energies: the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is related to the magnetic interaction) and the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom with a given wavelength. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers. Wait, that's the wavelength of the Balmer series, right? Like the H-alpha line, which is about 656 nm, but wait, 0.4861 micrometers is 486 nm, which is blue-green. Oh wait, no, the Balmer series has lines in the visible spectrum. Let me think: H-alpha is about 656 nm (red), H-beta is about 486 nm (blue-green), so that's the λ given here. So the transition would be from n=4 to n=2, I think. Or maybe n=3 to n=2? Wait, the Balmer series is transitions to n=2, so yes, the wavelength λ corresponds to the energy of that transition.

So, the transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two levels in the hydrogen atom. The paramagnetic coupling term is probably the energy due to the interaction of the electron's magnetic moment with the external magnetic field.

I need to find the order of magnitude of these two terms and see which is bigger.

First, let me recall the formulas involved.

The transition energy ΔE can be calculated using the Rydberg formula. The Rydberg constant R is approximately 1.097e4 m^-1. The formula is 1/λ = R(1/(n1^2) - 1/(n2^2)), where n2 > n1. Since the wavelength given is 486.1 nm, which is about
