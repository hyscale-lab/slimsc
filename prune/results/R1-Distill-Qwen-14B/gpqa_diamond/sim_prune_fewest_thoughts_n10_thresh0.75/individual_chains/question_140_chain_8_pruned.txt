Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question talks about a substance X that incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. When X reacts with liquid Y, it releases a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. There's also a part about a keto acid reacting with X to give a product with two oxygen atoms. Plus, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog of it.

Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, I need to identify what these substances could be. Let's start with the reaction between X and Y. Since X has a heavier isotope, maybe it's something like a halogen, which often has heavy isotopes. Wait, but wait. Let me think about the gas W. The gas molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecular formula is something where protons (which equal electrons in the molecule) and neutrons are the same. Let's think about possible gases that fit this.

If W has same protons and neutrons, maybe it's a molecule like CO2? No, wait, CO2 has 22 protons (C has 6, O has 8 each, so 6 + 16 = 22). But that's the protons. The neutrons would be (12 -6) for C? No, wait, each atom's neutrons need to be considered.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about simpler possibilities. Hydrogen has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. No, that's not same. Helium? Helium-4 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So He is a noble gas. But does that fit the reaction?

Alternatively, maybe W is a molecule like H2O? No, because H2O has H (protons=1 each) and O (8). So total protons would be 2, but the total neutrons would be 8 (O has 8 neutrons in the common isotope). So not equal. Hmm.

Wait, maybe W is CH4? No
