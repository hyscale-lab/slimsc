Okay, I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the scenario is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for making this compound has five exons and four introns. The goal is to eliminate this compound, which probably means we want to disrupt the gene's function.

They used EMS mutagenesis, which I think is ethyl methanesulfonate—a chemical mutagen that causes point mutations. So, the mutations here are probably point mutations where one base is changed to another.

Looking at the gene sequences, the intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. The task is to find which mutant has a mutation that would likely disrupt the gene's function, thereby stopping the production of the anti-nutritional compound.

Let's look at each mutant:

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Hmm, looking at the beginning. The first part is ATGTTT in the intact gene, but in Mutant 1, it's ATGTTCTA. Wait, no, maybe I should compare each position.

Wait, perhaps I should align the sequences.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …TGA
Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC …TGA

Wait, perhaps the differences are in the middle of the first exon. Let me count the letters. Let's compare each nucleotide.

Looking at the first line:

Intact: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA
Mutant 1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

Wait, in the intact, the sequence is TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT.

Mutant 1 has TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT ... So, let me break it down.

Intact: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant 1: TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

So, the first part compared is at positions perhaps where the third T in TTT is changed. Wait, in the intact, it's TTT in the first four nucleotides (ATG TTT...), and in Mutant 1, it's TTC at the start? Wait, wait, let me look again.

Wait, the intact gene starts as 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTG
