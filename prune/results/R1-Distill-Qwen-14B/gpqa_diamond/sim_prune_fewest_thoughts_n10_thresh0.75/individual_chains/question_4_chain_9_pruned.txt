Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this Maxwell's equations question. The question is about how Maxwell's equations would change in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles, meaning monopoles exist. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets are dipoles, so every magnet has both a North and South pole, but if there were isolated monopoles, things would be different.

Maxwell's equations are four fundamental laws of electromagnetism. Let me think about each one. The first equation is about the divergence of the electric field. Gauss's Law for electricity. It says the divergence of E is rho over epsilon zero. If there were magnetic monopoles, would that affect this one? I don't think so, because Gauss's Law for E deals with electric charge, not magnetic. So that equation should stay the same.

The second equation is Gauss's Law for magnetism. The divergence of B is zero. Oh wait, that's the one that assumes no magnetic monopoles. Because if there were monopoles, then the divergence of B wouldn't be zero. Instead, it would be something like rho_m (magnetic charge density) over mu zero, similar to how Gauss's Law for E has rho. So that equation would definitely change. So the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore.

The third equation is Faraday's Law of induction. It says the curl of E is minus the time derivative of B. I think this equation might stay the same because it's about induced electric fields due to changing magnetic fields. Or does the existence of monopoles affect it? Hmm, not sure. Wait, if there are magnetic monopoles, maybe there's a new term involving them. Or does this equation remain unchanged, and a new term is added elsewhere?

The fourth equation is Ampère's Law, with Maxwell's addition. It involves the curl of H being equal to the time derivative of D plus the current density J. Without magnetic monopoles, that's how it is. But if magnetic monopoles exist, would that affect this equation? Oh wait, Ampère's Law is about the magnetic effects of electric currents. If there are magnetic currents (from monopoles), then maybe a new term would appear in Ampère's Law. Alternatively, perhaps a new equation is added. Wait, but Maxwell's equations are four, so maybe one of them changes.

Wait, I remember that when magnetic monopoles are introduced, two of Maxwell's equations change. Let me think again. The original equations are:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀ (electric charge)
2. ∇·B = 0 (no magnetic monopoles)
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t (Faraday)
4. ∇×H = ∂D/∂t + J (Ampère's Law with Maxwell's term)

In a universe with magnetic monopoles, equation 2 would change to ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m (like Gauss's Law for E). Also, I think that equation 4 would change because Ampère's Law would have to account for magnetic current density. Oh wait, maybe equation 4 would have a term involving the time derivative of the magnetic current?

Wait, no, Ampère's Law in Maxwell's equations deals with currents producing magnetic fields. So if there are magnetic currents, perhaps Ampère's Law would include another term. Alternatively, perhaps Faraday's Law would gain a term as well. Or maybe both equations 2 and 4 change.

Wait, let me check. Without monopoles, the curl of E is -∂B/∂t. If monopoles exist, would there be a source term? Suppose magnetic monopoles have a magnetic current, then Faraday's Law would have an additional term, like the time derivative of the magnetic current, similar to how Ampère's Law includes the time derivative of electric displacement and the current.

Alternatively
