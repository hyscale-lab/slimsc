Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about nucleons and emitted particles. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin of the final state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. I need to find which partial wave isn't allowed based on conservation of angular momentum and parity.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. The term symbol notation is (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0, S is 0 because it's S=0. So 2*0 +1 =1, so the term is ^1S0. That means the orbital angular momentum L is 0 (since it's S), and the total angular momentum J is 0. So initial state has L=0, S=0, J=0.

The system emits a particle X. So the final state is the NN with some quantum numbers, and the emitted particle X in some state.

Pauli's condition says T = S + L + 1 mod 2. Since the final T(NN) is 0, that implies 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. Rearranging, S + L must be 1 mod 2. So S + L is odd.

But wait, what's S here? S is the spin of the NN system. Or wait, no—Pauli's condition is about the isospin, spin, and angular momentum. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me recheck.

The problem statement says, "Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)."

So T is the isospin, S is the spin quantum number, and L is the orbital angular momentum. So the condition is T = S + L + 1 mod 2.

Given that T is 0 for the final state, so 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2 → S + L is odd.

So the final NN state must have S and L such that their sum is odd.

But what are the possible values for S and L in the NN system after emission?

Wait, the NN system is in a bound state. The initial state is 1S0, which is spin 0, L=0. After emitting X, the NN system's spin and orbital angular momentum might change.

But wait, the emission of a particle is a process that involves angular momentum. So the total angular momentum must be conserved. So the initial state has J=0, so the total angular momentum after emission must also be 0.

Wait, but the problem is about the partial wave, which refers to the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X. So the initial state is 1
