Okay, so I have this physics problem about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember Maxwell's equations from my studies. Let me think about each equation and how they might change if isolated poles exist.

Maxwell's equations are four fundamental laws of electromagnetism. The original four are:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: The divergence of E equals rho over epsilon zero.
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: The divergence of B is zero.
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: The curl of E is negative the rate of change of B.
4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: The curl of H equals J plus the displacement current.

Wait, but the question is about a universe where a magnet can have isolated poles. In our universe, magnets always have both a North and South pole; you can't have a single pole. So if in this universe, you can have isolated poles, that must change something in the equations.

Which Maxwell's equations would that affect? Well, Gauss's Law for magnetism says that the divergence of B is zero. That equation implies that there are no isolated magnetic charges because the divergence (which is like the sources) is zero. So if in this universe, you can have isolated magnetic monopoles, then the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. It would be proportional to the magnetic charge density, similar to how Gauss's Law for electricity includes electric charge density.

So equation 2 (Gauss's Law for magnetism) would change. But the question is about which equations are different. So in our known case, equation 2 is different because it's now divergence of B equals some term. But the other equations, would they change?

Wait, let me think about Faraday's Law. It relates the curl of E to the time derivative of B. If there are magnetic monopoles, would that change anything? I'm not sure. Faraday's Law is more about how changing magnetic fields create electric fields. I don't think the existence of magnetic monopoles would affect Faraday's Law directly unless we have different boundary conditions.

What about Ampère's Law? It's about the curl of H and current. I don't think Ampère's equation would change unless there are magnetic currents, but the question is about isolated poles, not moving ones. So maybe Ampère's Law remains the same.

Let me consider Maxwell's equations in the presence of magnetic monopoles. From what I remember, if magnetic monopoles exist, two of Maxwell's equations would change. The Gauss's Law for magnetism (equation 2) would become non-zero divergence of B, proportional to the magnetic charge density. And also, Faraday's Law (equation 3) would change because the curl of B would now be related to the electric current plus something else.

Wait, no, in standard physics, the curl of B is due to currents and displacement. But if magnetic monopoles exist, then the divergence of E would be proportional to the magnetic current density. Or maybe the other way around. Let me think. In standard, electric charges are sources for E, and magnetic monopoles would be sources for B. So equation 2 (div B
