Okay, so I'm looking at this quantum mechanics problem, and I need to figure out the oscillation frequency of the z-component of a spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment after the magnetic field direction is changed. Hmm, let me start by breaking down the problem.

Alright, the setup is that there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given by gamma multiplied by Sz. So mu equals gamma Sz. The magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction, and the particle is aligned with it. Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, and both have the same magnitude B. The question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillating and what the frequency of that oscillation is.

Wait, so initially, when the magnetic field is along +Z, the particle's spin is aligned with it. So the magnetic moment would be in the same direction as the field, right? But when the field is switched to +Y, the situation changes. Now the magnetic field is along Y, which is a different axis.

I remember that in such cases, when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian governing the energy of the system changes. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -mu · B. So initially, H was proportional to Sz, but after the switch, it's proportional to Sy.

Wait, so before the switch, the system was in an eigenstate of Sz, since the magnetic field was along Z. The eigenvalues for Sz are ±ħ/2 since it's spin 1/2. So the initial state was either |+z> or |-z>, depending on the alignment. But since it's aligned, it must be the |+z> state, because the magnetic moment is in the same direction as B.

Then, when the field is switched to +Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma S_y B. Because mu is gamma S, and the magnetic field is B in the y-direction. So H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but let me think about the units. The magnetic moment mu is gamma times S, so mu_z is gamma S_z. So the energy is H = -mu · B, which would be -gamma S · B. Since the field is along y, H = -gamma B S_y. Hmm, but actually, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the interaction energy is
