Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (ν + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think that's the interaction term. So the boson X is interacting with fermions via some coupling λ, right?

The boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. The question is asking about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So I need to figure out which fermion pairs X can decay into.

I remember that for a particle to decay into two particles, their combined rest mass must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. So kinematically allowed means that the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of X.

Looking at the options, I see that the possible decay channels involve various quark-antiquark pairs and lepton pairs. Let's break it down.

First, let me list the masses of the possible fermions:

- Up quark (u): around 2.2 MeV (so 0.0022 GeV)
- Down quark (d): about 4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)
- Strange quark (s): around 100 MeV (0.1 GeV)
- Charm quark (c): about 1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): around 4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV
- Electron (e): negligible, ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.1 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos (ν): their masses are very tiny, but I think in this problem, perhaps we can ignore them because the term has (ν + X) but maybe it's more about the X coupling? Wait, the interaction term is written as (ν + X). Hmm, maybe not so important for the decay, but perhaps the neutrino is just part of the interaction term.

Wait, the problem states that the interaction is given by that Lagrangian, so perhaps X is coupling to fermions f. So the possible decay products are the fermion species that are present in the interaction term.

Looking at the interaction term, it's ψ_f, so the fermions are f. But in the Lagrangian, the term is -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (ν + X(y)) ψ_f (y). Wait, maybe that's a typo? Or perhaps the f is a flavor index? Let me think. Maybe the term is supposed to be something like X ψ̄_f ψ_f, but with a coupling
