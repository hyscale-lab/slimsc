Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read through it carefully and try to figure it out step by step.

The question is about a reaction involving an anhydride and a cyclopentadiene derivative. The products are two, with the major and minor having the same molecular formula, C13H16O3. They also mention that the 2D NOESY NMR of the major product has a cross-peak, but the minor doesn't. So, I think that must relate to the stereochemistry of the product, maybe about whether the substituents are on the same face or opposite.

First, let's break down the starting materials. The initial compound is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The NMR data for the anhydride is given: a single peak at 7 ppm in 1H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in 13C. 

Wait, so the 1H NMR shows a singlet at 7 ppm. That's probably the protons from the carbonyl groups. But wait, anhydride protons are usually around 7-8 ppm, and they are deshielded. Since it's a singlet, maybe the two protons are equivalent. So perhaps the anhydride is symmetric. 

The 13C NMR shows two peaks. One is at 137 ppm, which is likely a carbonyl (like from the anhydride), and another at 165 ppm. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Anhydride carbons are usually around 165-175 ppm. Wait, so maybe the 165 is the carbonyl, and 137 is another carbon, perhaps the one adjacent to the double bond, like a spÂ² carbon. Hmm.

Wait, the initial acid had a cis-alkene. When it dehydrates to form an anhydride, the structure would have the two carboxylic acid groups connected by the anhydride linkage. Since the starting alkene is cis, the two substituents (the two carboxylic acid groups) would be on the same side in the anhyd
