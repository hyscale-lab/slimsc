Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula based on the given spectral data. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's something like a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group, right? So there's probably an ester functional group in the molecule.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: six signals. Two are aromatic-H, two are vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets), and two are –CH3 groups. No –CH2 signals. So the structure must have aromatic protons, vinyl protons, and some methyl groups, but no methylene (CH2) groups.

Let me try to visualize the structure. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents could be in the para, ortho, or meta positions. But wait, the NMR has six signals, so maybe each substituent contributes some unique protons.

The presence of an ester group suggests that one substituent is an ester, like OCOOR, where R is some alkyl group. Because esters have the structure RCOOR', their presence would account for the carbonyl peak in the IR.

Now, the aromatic protons: two signals. That suggests that the substituents are in such a way that only two types of aromatic protons are present. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons, perhaps giving a singlet each, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester and the other is something else, like a methyl group attached via a double bond.

Wait, the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals. Vinyl protons are typically from double bonds. So perhaps one of the substituents is an ester group, and the other is an alkene group, like an allyl group or a vinyl group attached to the ring.

Let me think about the substituents. If one substituent is an ester (like OCOOR), and the other is a vinyl group (like CH2CH2 or something), but wait, the vinyl protons in the NMR are a doublet and a doublet of quartets. Hmm, what's that mean? A doublet might be from a proton adjacent to one other proton (like in a trans coupling), and a doublet of quartets could be more complex. Alternatively, maybe the vinyl protons are part of a substituent that's more complex.

Wait, another thought: maybe the substituents are such that one is an ester (like OCOOR), and the other is a group that has a double bond, like a substituted vinyl group. For example, an ester and a vinyl group attached to the ring. Let's think about the structure:

Ph-O-CO-O-R? No, that doesn't make much sense. Wait, esters are RCOOR', so the substituent
