Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's start.

The problem says the state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vector has to be normalized, right? So the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should be 1. Let me check that. The components are -1, 2, and 1. So squaring them: (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. Sum is 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Oh, wait a second! That's 6, not 1. So this state isn't normalized. That's a problem because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to have a norm of 1. So maybe I should normalize it first.

But wait, maybe the problem is in some units where normalization isn't required, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. No, I think normalization is key. So the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. To normalize, I need to divide each component by the square root of the sum of squares. The sum is 6, so the normalization factor is sqrt(6). So the normalized state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

Now, the observable is represented by matrix P. Let me write down what P looks like. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So P is a 3x3 matrix.

The question is to find the probability that measuring the observable P yields 0. So in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P, and then determine which eigenvalue is 0, and then find the probability of the state |ψ> collapsing into the corresponding eigenvector.

Alternatively,
