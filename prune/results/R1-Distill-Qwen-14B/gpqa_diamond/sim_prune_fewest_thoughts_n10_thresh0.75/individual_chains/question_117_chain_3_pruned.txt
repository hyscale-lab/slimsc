Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, specifically about isomerism, and I'm a bit new to this. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking which of the given organic compounds show optical isomerism. Optical isomerism refers to compounds that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning they can rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions. This typically happens when a molecule has a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

So, I need to analyze each of the four compounds given in the options and determine if they have any chiral centers or other features that allow for optical isomerism.

Let's go through each one:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
   - Hmm. Biphenyl structures can have some interesting isomerism. The substituents are on the benzene rings. The main part is a biphenyl (two benzene rings connected by a single bond). The substituents are at positions 6 and 6' on each ring with nitro groups, and at 2 and 2' with carboxylate groups. But wait, the question is about optical isomerism. For a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or some kind of stereogenic element. Biphenyls can sometimes have axial chirality if the connecting bond has restricted rotation, but in this case, the substituents are symmetrical perhaps? Let me think. The substituents are 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. Since both substituents are in the same positions on each ring, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. So, perhaps there's no chiral center here. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl has two substituents that could create a chiral axis. Wait, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe the ester groups are in positions that might allow for some stereochemistry, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, and thus not chiral.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**
   - Let's write the structure. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO- but modified. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HO-CH2-C(O)OH. When it's an ester, the structure is HOCH2COOCH3. Wait, no, the propanoate would have three carbons. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, no, wait. Propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate
