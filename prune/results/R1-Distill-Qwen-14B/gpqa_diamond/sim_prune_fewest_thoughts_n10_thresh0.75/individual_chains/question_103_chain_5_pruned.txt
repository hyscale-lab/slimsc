Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here. So, I need to find the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Let's break this down.

The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. That means the benzene ring has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions: a bromine and a nitro group. And there's an acetyl group (ethan-1-one) attached to the benzene as well.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. Let me draw this structure mentally. The benzene ring has a substituent at position 1 which is the ketone group (since it's ethan-1-one, so the carbonyl is attached directly to the ring). Then, the substituents at positions 3 and 5 are bromo and nitro. Wait, no, the numbering might be different. Wait, the substituents are on the phenyl group attached to the ketone. So the phenyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the benzene ring is attached to a carbonyl group (CO). So the ketone is the main group, and the benzene ring has substituents on it.

Wait, the structure is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethan-1-one is a ketone (R-CO-) where R is the phenyl group. So the benzene ring has the ketone group attached to it, and then on that same ring, positions 3 and 5 have bromine and nitro groups.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Let's number the positions. Suppose the ketone is at position 1. Then, the substituents would be at positions 3 and 5 relative to that. So positions 3 and 5 have Br and NO2.

Wait, but wait: when substituents are present on a benzene ring, their positions are relative to each other. So the ketone is on position 1, and bromo on 3 and nitro on 5. Alternatively, it could be bromo on 3 and nitro on 5, or vice versa, but the question specifies 3-bromo and 5-nitro.

So, I need to figure out how to introduce these substituents in the correct positions.

Now, starting with benzene, I think I need to perform a series of substitution reactions. But the order is crucial because each substitution can direct the next.

First, I should consider the directing effects of substituents. Nitro groups are meta directors, while bromine is an ortho/para director. But wait, when substituents are introduced, their order of introduction affects where subsequent groups go.

Wait, but in this target molecule, the substituents are at the 3 and 5 positions of the phenyl group attached to the ketone. So the ketone is at position 1 of the phenyl ring, and then bromo is at 3 and nitro at 5, or perhaps the other way around. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way round in the numbering. Hmm, perhaps I should think about
