Okay, so I have this genetics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So the setup is about white lupine plants and their resistance to a fungal disease called anthracnose. They did an experiment where they knocked out three genes: G1, G2, and G3. Then they made double mutants and tested their resistance. The results show different levels of resistance compared to the wild-type, which has 100% resistance.

The question is about figuring out the interactions between these genes based on the resistance levels. The options involve things like transcription factors, epistasis, pleiotropy, and gene redundancy.

Wait, what's the deal with transcription factors and epistasis here? I remember that a transcription factor is a protein that helps turn on other genes. So if a transcription factor is knocked out, the genes it controls might not be expressed. So, in this case, the knockout mutants' resistance would be lower if the transcription factor is upstream.

Epistasis is where the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. Like, if gene A is epistatic over gene B, then the phenotype of gene B can only be seen if gene A is working. So, if a double mutant of A and B has the same phenotype as the A knockout, it suggests that A is epistatic over B.

Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. But here, I don't think that's the main point because we're dealing with resistance levels, which is a single trait. So maybe not directly related, but I'm not sure.

Gene redundancy is when two or more genes do the same thing, so knocking both out leads to a more severe phenotype than each single knockout.

So, looking at the data:

Single mutants:

g1: 75% resistance. So, less than wild-type. So they're more susceptible.

g2: 0% resistance. So, super susceptible. No resistance at all.

g3: 50% resistance. So, half as resistant as wild-type.

Double mutants:

g1g3: 10% resistance. That's even worse than both singles.

g2g3: 0% resistance, same as g2.

g1g2: 0% resistance.

Hmm, so let's think about each gene's role. The fact that g2 is completely susceptible suggests that it's a key gene. Also, when g2 is in a double, like g1g2 and g2g3, both give 0% resistance. So in those cases, the double mutants are as bad as g2 alone.

So what does that mean? If the presence of g2 in the double leads to no resistance, maybe G2 is the one that's acting upstream. Because if G2 is knocked out, perhaps G1 and G3 don't matter anymoreâ€”so their function is dependent on G2.

Wait, but why is g1g3 10%? That's way worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So knocking out both G1 and G3 together makes things much worse than either alone.

So let's think about the hierarchy of these genes. If G2 is a transcription factor, it might be activating other genes, like G1 or G3. So if G2 is not working, those downstream genes can't help either.

Wait, in the single mutant g2, resistance is 0. So without G2, the plant can't resist the pathogen at all. So maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates genes necessary for resistance. For example, G2 might be activating G1 and G3.

In that case, in the G2 knockout (g2), both G1 and G3 are not functional because their expression is controlled by G2. So the single g2 mutant can't activate G1 or G3, so no resistance.

But what about the double mutants. Let's see:

g1g2: Both G1 and G2 are knocked out. But since G2 is a transcription factor for G1, knocking out G2 would already mean that G1 isn't active. So the double mutant g1g2 would have the same phenotype as g2 alone, which we see as 0% resistance.

Similarly, g2g3 would have the same phenotype as g2, 0%, because G2 is not working, so G3 isn't active either.

But what about g1g3? Their resistance is 10%. So if both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is lower than either alone. Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor for both, then in the single knockouts, G1 and G3 are not expressed. So why do the single knockouts have
