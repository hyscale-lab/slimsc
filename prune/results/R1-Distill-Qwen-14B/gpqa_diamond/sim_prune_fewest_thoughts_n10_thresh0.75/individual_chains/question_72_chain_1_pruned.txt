Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then it's combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1. Then, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. After that, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150Â°C to form product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on product 4. The options are A) 8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down into each step.

First, I'll try to figure out what each reaction does.

Step 1: The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. That looks like a norbornene structure with a tert-butoxy group at position 7. Norbornene has a bicyclo[2.2.1] structure, so it's a bridged bicyclic compound. The substituent is at the bridgehead, the 7 position.

This is combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temp. Hmm, sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, and dibromomethyl groups are leaving groups. Oh wait, this sounds like a Diels-Alder reaction? Or maybe an elimination or substitution.

Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two dibromomethyl groups on adjacent carbons. So when you have a diene with two leaving groups, perhaps undergoing a reaction with a dienophile. But wait, the starting material is a bicyclic diene, so maybe it's a dienophile?

Wait, Diels-Alder is between a diene and a dienophile. But here, maybe the norbornene is acting as a dienophile. Alternatively, perhaps this is a case of coupling via elimination, like a [4+2] cycloaddition.

Wait, when dienes react with dienophiles, they form six-membered transition states. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-closing Diels-Alder? Or perhaps the norbornene is undergoing some kind of conjugate addition.

Wait, but let me think about the structure. The norbornene has a bridge. If the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which is a norbornene with the bridgehead substituent. Then, when it reacts with the diene, perhaps a [4+2] cycloaddition occurs, adding two rings.

Wait, but the other reagent is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of the 5 and 6 positions has a dibromomethyl group. So the structure is cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two CH2Br2 groups at positions 5 and 6.

When NaI is present, perhaps it's a SN2 reaction. The Br groups are good leaving groups. So maybe each of the dibromomethyl groups undergo substitution.

Wait, but the starting material is a diene. So perhaps the norbornene is reacting with the diene in a Diels-Alder fashion, but then the substitution occurs.

Alternatively,
