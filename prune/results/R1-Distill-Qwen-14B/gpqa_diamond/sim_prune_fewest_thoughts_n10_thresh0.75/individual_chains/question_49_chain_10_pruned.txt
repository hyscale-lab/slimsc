Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it.

The question is about sigmatropic rearrangements, which are a type of pericyclic reaction. I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a pi bond within a conjugated system, moving a sigma bond from one position to another. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are examples of this, and they're usually thermodynamically favored, meaning they proceed to the more stable product.

The problem has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving a reaction under heat and sometimes with H+. I need to determine the products for each and match them with the given options.

Let's tackle each part one by one.

**Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ + Heat â†’ A**

Hmm, so the starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol, and they're reacting with H+ and heat. I'm trying to think about what kind of reaction this could be. Since it's a sigmatropic rearrangement, maybe it's a Claisen or Cope rearrangement. Wait, but those typically involve 1,5-dienes or similar structures. Alternatively, the presence of an amine and an alcohol might lead to some condensation or cyclization.

Wait, but 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is like ethylamine with both oxygens as methoxy groups. Structure-wise, it's (CH3O)2CHNH2. But but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is actually CH2=CHCH2OH. No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Let me think again. But-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CHCH2OH? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is (CH2)2, with the double bond from C3 to C4? Wait no, but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3, since but is four carbons. So, structure is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? Or maybe CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me write it as HOCH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond? No, wait. The formula is
