Okay, I'm trying to figure out this enamine reaction problem. Let me break it down.

So the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize the structure. Pentan-2-ylidene implies a double bond starting at the second carbon of pentane, so the structure would be CH2=C(CH2CH2CH3)–… but wait, the substituent is on the ethanaminium part.

Actually, the compound is an enamine. The formula is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the ethanaminium part is (CH3)2N+–CH2– something. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: the ethanaminium would be like CH2-NR2 with a positive charge. So the enamine structure is probably a secondary amine attached to a carbonyl via a double bond.

Wait, no. Enamines are typically formed from a secondary amine and a ketone or aldehyde. The general structure is R2N–CH–R, where the CH is part of a conjugated system. So, the starting material here is an enamine, which is in the form of an iminium ion, I think. Because ethanaminium suggests a positively charged amine. So maybe it's something like (CH3)2N+=CH–CH2– something?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-configured, so the substituents on the double bond are opposite each other. Let me think, the enamine is formed from a secondary amine and a carbonyl. So, the starting material is an enamine, which is a conjugated amine with a double bond.

The reaction is: starting material + reagent A → product B. We need to find what B is, and what the correct sequence of reagents in A is.

Looking at the options, some involve LDA, DME, CH3CH2I, and H3O+.

Wait, let's think about the enamine mechanism. Enamines are often used as nucleophiles. When treated with an electrophile, the enamine can attack it, and then hydrolysis gives the corresponding product.

But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps. Alternatively, enamine can undergo alkylation. So, perhaps in the presence of a strong base, the enamine is deprotonated, then reacts with an alkyl halide.

Wait, another approach: the starting material is an enamine. If we deprotonate it with a strong base like LDA (lithium diisopropylamide), which is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. DME is a solvent, often used with LDA. Then maybe an alkylating agent comes in, like CH3CH2I (ethyl iodide). Then acid work-up.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is first deprotonation, then alkylation, then acid work-up.

Wait, but when an enamine is treated with a strong base, what happens? Enamines have protons alpha to the nitrogen. Deprotonation would form an enamine anion, which is a strong nucleophile. Then, adding an alkyl halide would alkylate the alpha position.

After alkylation, when you protonate (with H3O+), you get the product. But wait, in an enamine alkylation, the process typically adds a group to the alpha position, and upon hydrolysis, you get a ketone and a secondary amine.

Wait, no, wait. When the enamine is alkylated, it becomes a new enamine, and upon hydrolysis, gives a new ketone and the amine.

Wait, let me outline the steps:

1. Enamine (starting material) is treated with a strong base, like LDA. LDA deprotonates the most acidic proton, which is alpha to the electronegative atom (nitrogen). So, the enamine's alpha H is abstracted, forming an enamine anion.

2. This enamine anion is a strong nucleophile and will attack an alkyl halide, like ethyl iodide (CH3CH2I), resulting in alkylation. The ethyl group adds to the alpha carbon.

3. After alkylation, perhaps a work-up step (like adding H3O+ to protonate) occurs. But then, what happens next? Or maybe the product is the alkylated enamine, which upon hydrolysis would give a different product.

Wait, but the product B is given as either pentan-2-one + something, or heptan-4-one.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option C says B is heptan-4-one. Option D says same.

So, perhaps the starting material upon reaction forms a larger ketone.

Let me think about the starting material structure. The enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the structure is N-methyl attached to a pentan-2-ylidene group (which is CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2?), but wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH(CH2CH2CH3)–N(CH3)–CH2+? Not sure, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of the reaction.

Assuming the starting enamine is (CH2CH2CH3)CH=CH–N(CH3)–CH3+ ?

Wait, maybe the starting material is an enamine derived from pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine.

Wait, pentan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH2CH3. To form an enamine, you'd react that with a secondary amine, say, N,N-dimethylethanamine (which is (CH3)2NCH2CH3). Wait, no, the enamine would form when the secondary amine (like (CH3)2NH) reacts with a carbonyl.

Wait, but the starting material is an enamine already. So, perhaps it's (CH2CH2CH3)CH=CH–N(CH3)2+?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH2)2CHCH2–N+(CH3)–CH2, but I'm getting stuck on that. Maybe I should focus on the reaction steps.

So, the starting material is treated with reagent A, which is a sequence of steps. Let's look at the options for A.

Option C's A is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

Option D's A is (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+.

Wait, but in any case, the steps involve LDA, then ethyl iodide, then acid.

Wait, LDA is used as a base, deprotonating the enamine. Then ethyl iodide would alkylate the enamine. Then acid work-up.

So, when the enamine is deprotonated and alkylated, adding an ethyl group to the alpha position.

Then, upon adding H3O+ (acid), what happens? Maybe the enamine is protonated, but also, maybe the enamine ring opens upon hydrolysis.

Wait, no. Wait, the enamine typically, when hydrolyzed, gives a ketone and an amine. But in this scenario, after alkylation, perhaps the enamine is larger, leading to a different ketone upon hydrolysis.

Wait, let's think of a specific example. Suppose the starting enamine is from pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylamine. Then, when the enamine is alkylated, you add an ethyl group. Then, hydrolysis would give a larger ketone.

Wait, but let's think:

Enamine structure: R2N–CH–R'

When you deprotonate, you get R2N–CH–R'– with a negative charge on the carbon. Then ethyl iodide would add an ethyl group to that carbon. So, the enamine becomes R2N–CH(Et)–R'.

Upon hydrolysis (acid work-up), this enamine would break down into a ketone and an amine.

Wait, but wait, the hydrolysis of an enamine generally gives a ketone and the amine. So, if the starting enamine is R2N–CH–R', then hydrolysis gives R'–C=O and R2NH.

Wait, but in this case, after alkylation, the enamine is R2N–CH(Et)–R''.

So, when that's hydrolyzed, you get R''–C=O and R2NH.

So, the ketone part would be R''.

But in the starting material, the enamine is from pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine.

Wait, let's see. The starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium.

Pentan-2-ylidene is CH2CH2CH2CH2–CH2– but wait, that's not right. Wait, pentan-2-ylidene is CH2–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–.

Wait, no, pentan-2-ylidene is (CH2)2CH–CH2– but perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps pentan-2-ylidene is CH2–CH2–CH(CH2CH3)–?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the enamine as derived from pentan-2-one. So, pentan-2-one is (CH2CH3)COCH2CH3. The enamine would have the structure:

R2N–CH–C(O)–R'

Wait, no, the enamine is R2N–CH–CH2–CO–R.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the product. When the enamine is hydrolyzed, it would form a ketone. So if the enamine is from pentan-2-one and a dimethylamine, the hydrolysis would give pentan-2-one and the amine.

Wait, but in the problem, the starting material is already an enamine—so after alkylation and hydrolysis, the product would be a larger ketone.

Wait, the starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. After alkylation, perhaps the alpha position (the CH in the enamine) gets an ethyl group. Then, upon hydrolysis, that would form a new ketone.

So, let's say the enamine is:

(CH3)2N+–CH–CH2–CH(CH2CH3)

Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2N+–CH–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–.

Wait, maybe the enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and (CH3)2NH. So the enamine would be (CH3)2N–CH–CO–CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the enamine is (CH3)2N–CH–CH2–CH(CH2CH3). So when you alkylate it, adding an ethyl group at the alpha position (the CH), it becomes (CH3)2N–CH(Et)–CH2–CH(CH2CH3).

Then, upon hydrolysis, the enamine would break down into a ketone and the amine. The ketone would be the part that was attached to the nitrogen. Wait, no, the enamine's structure is R2N–CH–R', so hydrolysis gives R'–CO–R'' and R2NH.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Enamine formation: R2NH + R'COR'' → R2N–CH–R'COR'' + H2O.

Wait no, the actual process is:

R2NH + RCOCH3 → R2N–CH–R–COCH3 + H2O.

Wait no, the enamine is formed by the secondary amine attacking the carbonyl, then losing water to form the double bond.

So, the enamine is R2N–CH–CH2–R'.

Wait, perhaps in this case, the enamine is (CH3)2N–CH–CH2–CH(CH2CH3)–.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the product.

If the starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium, and you alkylate it with ethyl iodide, then hydrolyze.

Upon hydrolysis, the enamine would form a ketone. Let's say the starting enamine is from pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine.

So, after alkylation, the enamine is longer. Upon hydrolysis, the ketone would be in a different position.

Wait, the starting material is (E)-configured, so perhaps the enamine is a conjugated diene? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting enamine is (E)-configured in terms of substituents around the double bond.

But perhaps the main point is that after alkylation and hydrolysis, the product is a larger ketone. Let's think of the possible product.

Looking at the options:

Option C: B = heptan-4-one.

Heptan-4-one is (CH2)2CHCOCH2CH2CH3.

Wait, no. Heptan-4-one is CH2CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Heptan-4-one would be:

CH2CH2CH2–CO–CH2CH2CH3? No, because 4 ketone in heptane would be:

CH3CH2CH2–C(O)–CH2CH2CH3. So, it's 4-pentanone? No, wait. Wait, heptane is 7 carbons. So heptan-4-one would be: CH2CH2CH2–C(O)–CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait. Let me count:

Heptane is CH3(CH2)5CH3. Heptan-4-one would have the ketone group on the 4th carbon.

So positions 1 to 7:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: CH2-

4: C=O

5: CH2-

6: CH2-

7: CH3.

So structure is CH2CH2CH2–C(O)–CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, maybe it's:

CH2CH2CH2–C(O)–CH2CH2CH2CH3? Or perhaps I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, but if the starting enamine is pentan-2-one-based, and we add an ethyl group, then upon hydrolysis, we'd get a longer ketone.

Wait, pentan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH2CH3. If we add an ethyl group via alkylation, perhaps the ketone becomes longer.

Wait, perhaps after adding an ethyl group, the enamine becomes a longer chain. So, when hydrolyzed, the ketone would be in a different position.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition or something else.

Wait, going back to the reagents. The steps are:

Reagent A is a sequence:

Option C: (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

So three steps: first LDA (base), then ethyl iodide (alkylating agent), then acid.

So the steps would be:

1. Deprotonate enamine with LDA → enamine anion.

2. Quench with ethyl iodide → alkylation occurs at alpha position.

3. Work-up with H3O+ → protonation, perhaps, and then hydrolysis.

Wait, but when you treat an enamine with acid after alkylation, does it hydrolyze?

Wait, the enamine after alkylation would have a new substituent. Then, adding acid would protonate it, but to hydrolyze the enamine into a ketone, you might need more than just acid, maybe aqueous work-up.

But perhaps the steps are such that after alkylation, the enamine is protonated and then hydrolyzed.

So, let me model this.

Starting material: enamine (from pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine).

After alkylation with ethyl iodide, the enamine now has an ethyl group at the alpha position.

Upon hydrolysis, this would form a ketone.

So, the original enamine derived from pentan-2-one (5 carbons) and ethyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is from a 3-carbon enamine. No, maybe it's better to think in terms of the product.

For example, if the starting enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and (CH3)2N–, then the enamine is (CH3)2N–CH–CH2–CO–CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2N–CH–CH(CH2CH2CH3).

Wait, maybe I should just think about the product of alkylation and hydrolysis.

The product B is either pentan-2-one plus N,N-dimethylethanamine (option B and A), or heptan-4-one (options C and D).

So, if the enamine after alkylation is larger, then upon hydrolysis, the ketone would be longer.

Let's say the starting enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and (CH3)2N–.

After alkylation, the enamine is (CH3)2N–CH(Et)–CH2–CO–CH2CH2CH3.

Upon hydrolysis, this would give:

The part after the N would become a ketone. So, the CH(Et)–CH2–CO–CH2CH2CH3 would become CO–CH2–CH(Et)–CH2CH2CH3?

Wait, maybe not. Wait, when the enamine is hydrolyzed, the structure would be R'–CO–R''.

Wait, perhaps the enamine is:

(CH3)2N–CH–CH2–CH(CH2CH3).

Upon alkylation, the CH becomes CH(Et), so (CH3)2N–CH(Et)–CH2–CH(CH2CH3).

Upon hydrolysis, this would break down into the amine (CH3)2NH and a ketone.

Wait, how? Let me think.

The enamine hydrolyzes as follows:

R2N–CH–R' → R2NH + R'–CO–H.

Wait, but R' would be a substituent, perhaps.

In the starting material, R' might be a propyl group or something else.

Wait, perhaps the starting enamine is (CH3)2N–CH–CH2–CH(CH2CH2CH3).

Wait, no, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting enamine is (CH3)2N–CH–CH2–CH(CH2CH3).

After alkylation with EtI, it becomes (CH3)2N–CH(Et)–CH2–CH(CH2CH3).

Upon hydrolysis, this would form (CH2CH2CH3)CH2–CO–CH2CH2CH3?

Wait, perhaps that would be pentan-2-one plus something else, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the product after hydrolysis is a larger ketone.

Wait, the options for product B are pentan-2-one + something (options A and B) or heptan-4-one (options C and D).

So, if the product is pentan-2-one, that suggests the reaction didn't change the ketone part. But if it's heptan-4-one, the chain is longer.

Wait, maybe the starting enamine is from a three-carbon compound.

Wait, another approach: the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium.

Breaking that down: ethanaminium is CH2NH3+? Or perhaps CH3NH2+.

Wait, (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium.

'Ethanaminium' suggests an ethylamine with a positive charge. So, the structure is CH2–N(CH3)– with a positive charge.

And pentan-2-ylidene is a substituent on the N. So, the structure would be CH2–N(CH3)(CH2CH2CH2CH2– something?).

Wait, maybe it's (CH3)2N+–CH2–CH(CH2CH2CH3).

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2N+–CH–CH2–CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, perhaps the enamine is (CH3)2N+–CH–CH2–CH(CH2CH2CH3).

So, when you deprotonate with LDA, you get an enamine anion, which can attack ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group to the alpha position.

So, after alkylation, the structure becomes (CH3)2N+–CH(Et)–CH2–CH(CH2CH2CH3).

Upon hydrolysis, this would form a ketone and the amine.

The amine would be (CH3)2NH, and the ketone would be the part derived from the enamine.

So, the ketone would be CH2–CH2–CH(CH2CH2CH3)–CO–something?

Wait, perhaps I should count the carbons. The starting material is pentan-2-ylidene, which is five carbons with a double bond at position 2.

After adding an ethyl group, perhaps the new ketone is seven carbons long, leading to heptan-4-one.

Wait, heptan-4-one is:

CH2CH2CH2–CO–CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, no, heptan-4-one is:

CH2CH2CH2–CO–CH2CH2CH3?

Wait, no, let me count: Heptane is seven carbons, so positions 1-7.

Heptan-4-one would have the ketone on carbon 4.

So:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: CH2-

4: C=O

5: CH2-

6: CH2-

7: CH3.

So, structure: CH2CH2CH2–C(O)–CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, but that's pentyl group on each side, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is heptan-4-one, which would be option C or D.

Looking back at the options:

Option C says B is heptan-4-one, and the reagents are LDA, DME, ethyl iodide, H3O+.

Option D has the same product but different reagent steps.

Wait, the correct sequence of reagents is important. Let me think about the steps again.

The enamine is treated with LDA (a strong base) in DME (a solvent), which deprotonates the alpha hydrogen.

Then, the enolate (or enamine anion) attacks ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group to the alpha position.

Then, acid work-up (H3O+) protonates, and perhaps the enamine is hydrolyzed to give the ketone.

But wait, when you add acid after alkylation, does the enamine hydrolyze immediately?

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. LDA in DME: deprotonates enamine.

2. Add CH3CH2I: alkylation occurs.

3. Add H3O+: quench the reaction, possibly leading to protonation and hydrolysis.

If the hydrolysis occurs, then the product would be the ketone.

So, the product would be a ketone derived from the enamine after alkylation.

So, the starting enamine is (E)-something, which after alkylation becomes longer. Hydrolysis gives a larger ketone.

So, if the starting enamine was derived from a 5-carbon (pentan-2-one) and a dimethylamine, adding an ethyl group would make it a 7-carbon ketone.

Wait, let's count the carbons. The starting enamine (from pentan-2-one) has five carbons in the ketone part. Adding an ethyl group would add two more carbons, perhaps extending the chain.

Wait, perhaps the starting enamine is:

(CH3)2N–CH–CH2–CH(CH2CH2CH3).

After alkylation, it becomes (CH3)2N–CH(Et)–CH2–CH(CH2CH2CH3).

Upon hydrolysis, this would form (CH2CH2CH3)CH2–CO–CH2CH(Et)–CH(CH3)2?

Wait, I'm getting tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is heptan-4-one (7 carbons, ketone at position 4), which would require the enamine to have a longer chain after alkylation.

So, assuming the correct steps are: LDA (base), then ethyl iodide, then H3O+.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Reagents are LDA, DME, ethyl iodide, H3O+.

But the order in option C is (i) LDA, DME (so maybe step 1 is LDA in DME), then step 2: ethyl iodide, step 3: H3O+.

Alternatively, option D says (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+.

Wait, but LDA is typically used in DME as the solvent. So, perhaps the first step is LDA in DME.

Then, adding ethyl iodide as the alkylating agent.

Then, adding H3O+ for work-up.

So, the reagent sequence in option C is: (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

In option D, the steps are (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+.

Wait, but in practice, LDA is used in DME as the solvent. So, step (i) would be LDA in DME, then adding ethyl iodide, then H3O+.

So, the correct sequence is option C or D.

But looking at the options, option C has three steps, and option D has two steps, but the second step is a mix of DME, ethyl iodide, and H3O+.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. LDA in DME (deprotonate).

2. Add ethyl iodide.

3. Add H3O+.

Which matches option C.

So, the product B would be heptan-4-one, which is option C.

Alternatively, heptan-4-one would involve a longer chain.

So, with the assumption that adding ethyl iodide extends the chain by two carbons, the product would be a seven-carbon ketone, heptan-4-one.

Thus, the correct answer would be option C: A is (i) LDA, DME, (ii) CH3CH2I, (iii) H3O+; and B is heptan-4-one.


The reaction involves an enamine, specifically (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium, which undergoes a sequence of reagents to form a product. The enamine is treated with a strong base (LDA) in a solvent (DME), which deprotonates the enamine at the alpha position, forming a nucleophilic enamine anion. This anion then reacts with ethyl iodide (CH₃CH₂I), an alkylating agent, to add an ethyl group to the alpha position of the enamine. Finally, acid work-up (H₃O⁺) is performed, leading to the hydrolysis of the enamine and the formation of a ketone.

The starting enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and a secondary amine. After alkylation with ethyl iodide, the enamine becomes longer, and upon hydrolysis, the ketone formed is heptan-4-one, which is a seven-carbon ketone with the ketone group at the fourth carbon. This matches the product described in option C.

The correct sequence of reagents is as follows:
1. LDA in DME (to deprotonate the enamine).
2. CH₃CH₂I (to alkylate the enamine).
3. H₃O⁺ (to hydrolyze the enamine and form the ketone).

Thus, the product B is heptan-4-one, and the correct sequence of reagents is given in option C.

Answer: C
