Okay, so I've got this question about two planets orbiting a star, and I'm supposed to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh right, the formula is something like Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ) / ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ), but wait, maybe I'm mixing up some terms. Or is it just proportional to the star's temperature and inverse square root of distance?

Wait, the formula for equilibrium temperature is Te = T_star * ( L_star/(16πσ a²) )^½ ), but perhaps more accurately, it's Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I remember that the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4), and since L depends on the star's properties, maybe using the Stefan-Boltzmann law L = 4πR_star²σ T_star^4.

Putting it together, the equilibrium temperature of a planet would be Te = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) ) * (1/( (1 - albedo)^(1/4) )) ).

But wait, the question says both planets have the same albedo, so that part cancels out when taking the ratio.

So the ratio of their temperatures, Te1/Te2, would be sqrt( (R_star / (
