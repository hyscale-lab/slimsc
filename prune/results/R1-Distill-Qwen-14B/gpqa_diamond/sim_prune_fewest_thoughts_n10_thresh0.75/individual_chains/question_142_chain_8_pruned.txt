Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking about the geometrical position of a specific density matrix in the qubits space. The given matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or in a statistical ensemble.

Wait, what's the structure of a density matrix for a qubit? A qubit is a two-level system, so the density matrix should be a 2x2 matrix. The general form is ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ| for a pure state, but this is a mixed state because it's an average of two projectors.

Let me write down the given ρ. Each term |0⟩⟨0| is a projector. So |0⟩ is the first basis vector, and |1⟩ is the second. The identity matrix for a qubit is |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|. Wait, the given ρ is (1/2) multiplied by the identity matrix. Because ρ = (1/2)(I), since I = |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|.

So ρ is (1/2) times the identity matrix. That means each diagonal element is 1/2, and the off-diagonal elements are zero. So ρ looks like [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. Right.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I remember that in the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be represented as a vector in 3D space. For a pure state |ψ⟩, it's a point on the surface of the sphere. For a mixed state like this, which is a completely mixed state, it's at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Wait, let me think again. The Bloch vector r is defined such that ρ can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So if I rearrange this, r·σ = 2ρ - I.

Substituting ρ into that equation: r·σ = 2*(1
