Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let me recall what optical isomerism is. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning the molecule isn't symmetrical and can't be superimposed on its mirror image. This leads to enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images. These enantiomers can rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions, hence the term optical isomers.

The question lists four organic moieties, and I need to determine which of them exhibit optical isomerism. Let's go through each one step by step.

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**

Hmm, this sounds a bit complex. Let me break it down. It's a biphenyl compound, meaning two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring, and nitro groups at 6 and 6'. Also, each ring has a carboxylate group (since it's a dicarboxylate).

Wait, biphenyls can have different conformations due to rotation around the central bond, but for isomerism, we're concerned about the spatial arrangement of substituents. But in this case, are there any chiral centers?

Looking at the molecule, the central bond is a single bond, so the two benzene rings can rotate. If the substituents on each ring are in a way that creates a chiral center, then there could be isomerism. But wait, the substituents here are at positions 2 and 2' which are para to the connecting bond. Let me think about whether that leads to chirality.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the two substituents on each benzene are symmetrical, the molecule might not be chiral. For example, if the substituents are such that the molecule is symmetric, it won't have a chiral center.

Wait, in this case, each ring has two substituents: a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Oh wait, wait: 6,6'-dinitro means each benzene has a nitro group at the 6 position, and 2
