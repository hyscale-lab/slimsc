Okay, let me try to think through this problem. So, the question involves organic chemistry reactions, specifically epoxidation and then something else. Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. Oh right, epoxidation is when a double bond reacts to form an epoxide.

The problem states that two reactions are performed. Reaction 1 uses (E)-oct-4-ene, and Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and analyzed using HPLC columns.

Wait, so first, what happens in each reaction when they react with mCPBA? Since mCPBA is an oxidizing agent, the alkene would form an epoxide. But wait, the stereochemistry of the starting alkene will influence the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, but after epoxidation, what happens when they're treated with aqueous acid? Oh, that's ring-opening of the epoxide. In acidic conditions, the epoxide oxygen becomes protonated, making it a better leaving group. Then, the ring opens via an acid-catalyzed mechanism, typically leading to diols. But wait, the way the ring opens depends on the structure of the epoxide.

Wait, but when the epoxide is formed from a diene, the ring-opening could lead to different products based on the configuration of the epoxide. Let me think about this.

But wait, first, let's analyze the starting materials. The starting alkenes are (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are dienes, but their stereochemistry is different. When mCPBA reacts with each, it adds an epoxide group across the double bond.

Wait, mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. Oh right, mCPBA is an epoxidizing agent that adds an epoxide across the double bond in a syn addition. So, the configuration of the double bond (E or Z) will affect the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, no, actually, mCPBA adds across the double bond to form an epoxide where the oxygen is added in a cis fashion. So, the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects how the epoxide is formed. Let me think: for (E) and (Z) alkenes, the epoxide formation would lead to different diastereomers.

Wait, let's take (E)-oct-4-ene. The double bond is trans. When mCPBA epoxidizes it, the oxygen atoms add to the same face (syn addition), so the epoxide would have a certain configuration. Similarly, for (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is cis, the epoxide would form differently.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to draw this mentally. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds, the two oxygen atoms add across the double bond in a syn fashion, so the resulting epoxide would have the two new oxygen bonds on the same face.

Wait, but the configuration of the starting double bond would determine the structure of the epoxide. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents are trans, so after epoxidation, the epoxide would have a certain stereochemistry. Similarly, for (Z), the substituents are cis.

Wait, but wait—epoxidation of (E) and (Z) alkenes with mCPBA. Since mCPBA is a peracid, which reacts with the alkene in a way that adds an oxygen across the double bond. The reaction is stereospecific, meaning the geometry of the starting alkene affects the product.

So, (E)-oct-4-ene would form an epoxide where the oxygen atoms are on the same face as the double bond. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the products of each reaction.

After epoxidation, each reaction will form an epoxide. Then, when treated with aqueous acid, the epoxide undergoes ring-opening. In acidic conditions, the epoxide ring opens via a protonation, leading to a carbocation intermediate. Then, nucleophilic attack occurs. But wait, in this case, maybe it's a different pathway.

Wait, when an epoxide is treated with acid, the mechanism is typically that the proton adds to the less substituted oxygen, making the more substituted oxygen a better leaving group. Then, the ring opens with a nucleophilic attack, which is usually water in this scenario, leading to a diol.

Wait, but wait: when the epoxide is formed from (E)-oct-4-ene, what's the structure? Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH=CHCH2CH3? Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2=CHCH2CH3? No, wait, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, no, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me correct that.

Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's not possible. Wait, octane is CH3(CH2)6CH3. So, oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's not right. Let me think: The structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, actually, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3.

Wait, no, no, wait, let me count. Oct-4-ene would have the double bond starting at the fourth carbon. So, positions 4 and 5. So, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C4 and C5? Wait, perhaps it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a single bond. So, wait, the actual structure of (E)-oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C4 and C5. No, wait, no. Let me write it correctly.

The correct structure of oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH=CHCH2CH3. No, wait, that can't be right because the positions are a bit confusing. Wait, perhaps it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between carbons 4 and 5.

Wait, perhaps a better way: for oct-4-ene, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between the fourth and fifth carbons. So, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 → No, that would be a single bond. Oh wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3. So, four carbons on each end of the double bond.

Wait, actually, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C4 and C5. So, it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 → no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. Octane is eight carbons, so oct-4-ene would have the double bond between C4 and C5. So, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's not correct because that would imply all single bonds. Oh wait, no, the structure is actually CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C4 and C5. So, it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond in positions 4 and 5. So, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as:

For oct-4-ene, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C4 and C5. So, more accurately, it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 where the middle part is CH2-CH2. No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's impossible, so perhaps the correct structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C4 and C5, so CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with CH2-CH2 as the double bond? No, that's not correct. Maybe I should just focus on the reaction rather than the structure.

Wait, perhaps the structure isn't that important right now. Let me get back to the reactions.

So, the first reaction is (E)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA. mCPBA adds across the double bond, forming an epoxide. Then, aqueous acid is added, leading to ring-opening.

Similarly, the second reaction is (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA and then aqueous acid.

After both reactions, the products are combined and run on HPLC columns.

So, what's the product after each reaction?

In Reaction 1, (E)-oct-4-ene becomes an epoxide, then upon acid treatment, this epoxide ring opens to form a diol. Similarly for Reaction 2.

Wait, but wait, the question is about what the products are after each reaction. So, when (E)-oct-4-ene is epoxidized, followed by acid, what product do we get? Similarly for (Z).

Wait, but mCPBA is a peracid, which reacts with the alkene in a syn addition to form the epoxide. The configuration of the starting alkene affects the configuration of the epoxide.

So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, which is trans, when mCPBA adds, the oxygen atoms come from the same face. So, the resulting epoxide will have adjacent stereocenters. Then, when acid is added, the epoxide ring opens.

Wait, but when the epoxide is formed, the configuration of the two new stereocenters will depend on the starting geometry. So, for (E) and (Z) starting materials, the epoxide will form different diastereomers.

Wait, but let's think about this: for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are opposite each other. So, when the epoxide forms via syn addition, the two new oxygen atoms will be on the same face. So, the resulting epoxide will have a trans configuration across the two stereocenters.

Wait, no, wait. Suppose the starting alkene is (E), so the substituents on each carbon are opposite. When mCPBA adds, the two new oxygen groups add to the same face, so the two stereocenters in the epoxide will have their substituents in a cis configuration.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, perhaps I should think of the example. Let's say the starting double bond is between C4 and C5. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on C4 (like the two CH2 groups on either side) are opposite to those on C5. When mCPBA adds, the oxygen adds across in a way that the two oxygens are on the same face, leading to the epoxide. So, the resulting epoxide will have two adjacent stereocenters with a particular configuration.

Similarly, when (Z)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA, the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are on the same side. So, the epoxide formed will have the two stereocenters with a different configuration.

Wait, but maybe this part is the same for both E and Z alkenes, but it's getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about the ring-opening step.

Once the epoxide is formed, it's treated with aqueous acid. In acidic conditions, the epoxide protonates, making the oxygen a better leaving group. Then, the ring opens via a nucleophilic attack, typically by water. The attack can happen from either face, but in a small molecule or symmetric epoxide, it's more likely to form a specific product.

Wait, but the epoxide's structure will influence the product's stereochemistry. Let me think about this. For each epoxide, after ring-opening, what products are formed?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about each reaction separately.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide → diol after acid.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide → diol after acid.

Wait, but wait! I think I'm getting this wrong. Because when the epoxide is formed, the starting material's geometry affects the diastereomer formed, and then the ring-opening can lead to different diastereomers or enantiomers.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the diastereomers formed in each case. Let me try to model this.

First, for Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene.

Upon epoxidation, the epoxide will have two adjacent stereocenters. Let's say the configuration is such that the stereocenters are trans. Then, when this epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, the ring opens to form a diol.

In the ring-opening of an epoxide under acidic conditions, the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon because it's more stabilized as a carbocation. Wait, or is it the less substituted carbon? Hmm, perhaps I should remember that in acid-catalyzed ring-opening of epoxides, the nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon, which is typically the less substituted one. Wait, but in many cases, it's the more substituted because the transition state is more stabilized. Hmm.

Wait, but regardless, when the epoxide ring opens, the stereochemistry of the diol depends on the attack of water from one face or the other.

Wait, but perhaps the attack can be from either face, leading to different diastereomers or enantiomers.

Wait, but when the epoxide is from an (E) starting material, the diol formed may have a certain stereochemistry, and when from (Z), another.

Alternatively, perhaps each starting material gives a diastereomeric pair of diols. Because the starting materials are enantiomers (E and Z would be enantiomers if they have opposite configurations), but wait, no, (E) and (Z) are enantiomers if they have the same substituents on each carbon and are mirror images, but in this case, both are oct-4-ene, so the (E) and (Z) are enantiomers.

Wait, no. Wait, (E) and (Z) are geometric isomers; in this case, (E) and (Z) are enantiomers only if the substituents on each carbon are the same. Let me see: for oct-4-ene, each carbon of the double bond is connected to two CH2CH3 groups and two CH2 groups. Wait, no, each carbon in the double bond in oct-4-ene has a CH2CH2CH2 group and a CH2CH2CH3 group? Hmm, perhaps for oct-4-ene, each carbon of the double bond is connected to a CH2CH2CH2- group and a CH2CH3 group.

Wait, perhaps they're both CH2 groups. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but maybe that's not essential for the problem.

But going back, each epoxide formed from (E) and (Z) will have different configurations, leading to different diastereomers when the epoxides are opened.

Wait, but when the epoxide is opened under acidic conditions, the product's stereochemistry depends on the attack of the nucleophile. For each epoxide, the ring-opening could lead to two possible diastereomers, but perhaps in this case, due to the structure, only one is formed.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the possible diastereomers.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a single diol, but with different configurations based on the starting epoxide.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the products as follows:

1. Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (trans configuration) → under acid, opens to form a diol with a specific configuration.

2. Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (cis configuration) → under acid, opens to form a diol with a different configuration.

Wait, but after opening, each reaction could produce a diol with a specific stereoisomer.

Wait, but in aqueous acid, the epoxide opens to form a diol. For each epoxide, the ring-opening leads to a diol with a specific configuration. But considering that the starting epoxides from (E) and (Z) are different, their ring-opening products would also be different.

Wait, but perhaps each reaction leads to a pair of diastereomers. Alternatively, perhaps each reaction leads to one diastereomer, and combining the products from both reactions would lead to a mixture of diastereomers and enantiomers.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible products.

Assuming that each reaction produces a diol with two chiral centers.

Wait, for each epoxide, the ring-opening under acidic conditions could lead to two possible products (if the nucleophilic attack can occur from either face), but perhaps the reaction leads to a specific diastereomer.

Alternatively, perhaps each epoxide leads to a single product upon ring-opening, but with a specific configuration.

Wait, but the question says both reactions go to 100% completion, so each product is a single compound.

Wait, so Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 each produce one product. Thus, combining the two would give two products.

But wait, maybe each reaction produces two products, leading to four products when combined. Hmm, but that depends on if the diastereomerism leads to multiple products.

Wait, perhaps each epoxide upon ring-opening produces a diastereomeric diol. Let's say Reaction 1 produces a diol with R and S configuration, and Reaction 2 produces a diol with S and R configuration, but perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps each epoxide leads to a pair of enantiomers, but since the reaction is 100% efficient, only one enantiomer is formed.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

The key is to determine how many distinct products are formed after both reactions, and how they appear on standard and chiral HPLC.

So, if each reaction produces multiple stereoisomers, then combining them would lead to more peaks. But if each reaction produces a single stereoisomer, combining would give two products.

But wait, let's model this.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide A → upon acid, forms diol A.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide B → upon acid, forms diol B.

If diol A and diol B are enantiomers, then in a standard (achiral) HPLC, they would co-elute because achiral columns can't distinguish enantiomers. But if they're diastereomers, they would elute separately.

Wait, but wait, when you run a product on a standard HPLC, enantiomers would appear as one peak because the column doesn't separate them. Diastereomers would show as separate peaks.

But the problem states that the products are combined and run on both a standard and a chiral HPLC.

Assuming maximum resolution, the chiral HPLC can separate enantiomers.

So, the question is, how many distinct stereoisomers are present in the combined product mixture?

Let me think: Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 each produce a diol. The diols from each reaction could either be enantiomers or diastereomers.

Wait, let's think about whether the diols are enantiomers or diastereomers. Let's say each epoxide's ring-opening leads to a specific diol.

If the diols from each reaction are enantiomers, then in the combined mixture, you would have two enantiomers. On a standard column, they would appear as one peak, but on a chiral column, they would be two peaks.

But perhaps the diols are diastereomers, leading to two distinct peaks on both types of columns.

But wait, perhaps each reaction produces two stereoisomers, leading to four products in total. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps each epoxide leads to two possible diastereomers upon ring-opening, and each reaction produces a 50:50 mixture of the two. Then, combining both reactions would have four stereoisomers.

But that depends on how the ring-opening proceeds.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a single diastereomer. Let me consider the possible products.

Assume that the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene leads to a diol with a specific configuration, say, (2R,3S), and the epoxide from (Z)-oct-4-ene leads to a diol with (2S,3R). Are these enantiomers?

Wait, if the two diols are enantiomers, they would be mirror images, but perhaps they are actually the same compound because the configuration is opposite. For example, (2R,3S) and (2S,3R) could be enantiomers.

Alternatively, perhaps they are the same diastereomer, but that depends on the structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of the problem.

Each reaction produces a diol. Each diol has two stereocenters. Thus, each diol can have four possible stereoisomers: (R,R), (R,S), (S,R), (S,S). But in reality, whether they are possible depends on the structure.

Wait, but the epoxide's configuration will determine the diol's configuration.

Suppose that Reaction 1 (E) leads to a diol with (R,S) configuration, and Reaction 2 (Z) leads to (R,R) configuration. Then, the combined mixture would have two diastereomers, each of which can have enantiomers.

Wait, but maybe each reaction produces only one stereoisomer. So, in total, two stereoisomers.

Wait, if each reaction produces a single stereoisomer, then combining them would give two stereoisomers. But if those two are enantiomers, then on a standard column, they would give one peak, but on a chiral column, two peaks.

Alternatively, if the two are diastereomers, they would give two peaks on both columns.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction leads to two stereoisomers. For example, each epoxide ring-opening leads to two diastereomers, but perhaps only one is formed because the reaction goes to 100% completion.

Wait, but the question states that each reaction goes to 100% completion, so each product is a single stereoisomer.

Wait, but let's think again about the epoxide ring-opening. When the epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, the ring opens to form a diol. The mechanism typically involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate, but for symmetrical epoxides, the diol would be the same regardless of the attack's face.

Wait, but for an unsymmetrical epoxide, the ring-opening leads to a mixture based on where the nucleophile attacks. But in this case, perhaps the epoxides are symmetrical, leading to a single product.

Wait, oct-4-ene is a symmetrical molecule. Because it's in the middle of the chain, so the epoxide would be symmetrical. So, when (E) and (Z) alkenes are epoxidized, the resulting epoxides may be either symmetric or not.

Wait, (E)-oct-4-ene is symmetric because the substituents on either end of the double bond are the same. Similarly for (Z)-oct-4-ene.

Wait, if the starting alkene is symmetric, then the epoxide would also be symmetric. So, would the ring-opening under acid conditions lead to a single product?

Wait, if the epoxide is symmetric, then the ring-opening would form a diol with two identical stereocenters.

Wait, for example, consider a symmetrical epoxide like cis-2,3-dimethyloxirane. When opened under acidic conditions, the attack can occur from either face, but because the molecule is symmetric, the resulting diol would be a single compound, perhaps with a meso configuration.

Ah, yes! If the diol has two stereocenters but is a meso compound, it would not be chiral—it would have an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

So, if each reaction produces a meso diol, then the diol would be achiral. Thus, when the two products (from Reaction 1 and Reaction 2) are combined, you would have two different diols, perhaps both achiral, or one achiral and one chiral.

Wait, let me make this concrete. Suppose that Reaction 1, starting from (E)-oct-4-ene, forms an epoxide which, upon ring-opening, gives a meso diol. Similarly, Reaction 2, starting from (Z)-oct-4-ene, forms an epoxide which upon ring-opening gives another meso diol. But wait, that can't be because (E) and (Z) are different.

Alternatively, perhaps (E) and (Z) starting materials, when epoxidized and then opened, give different diastereomers, some of which are meso.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces a meso diol. So, each diol would be achiral, meaning that when you combine both, you have two distinct achiral diols.

But then, when you run them on standard HPLC, each would be a single peak. On a chiral HPLC, since the compounds are achiral, they would also appear as a single peak each, so two peaks in total.

But wait, maybe that's not the case. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces a diol with two stereocenters, but the configuration is such that the diol is a meso compound. So, each reaction produces a single meso diol. Since the starting alkenes are E and Z, perhaps each gives a different meso diol.

Wait, but E and Z would give different epoxides, leading to different diols.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction leads to a diol that is not meso but has two stereocenters that are enantiomeric.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, perhaps I should approach this differently.

Let me consider the possible diastereomers and enantiomers.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → Epoxide A → Diol A.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → Epoxide B → Diol B.

If Epoxide A and B are enantiomers, then Diol A and B could be enantiomers as well, assuming the ring-opening doesn't change the configuration.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the diols from each reaction are diastereomers, leading to different products.

Wait, but perhaps each reaction produces a pair of enantiomers, but since the reaction is 100% efficient, each reaction produces a single enantiomer.

Wait, but I think the key is to determine whether the diols are enantiomers or diastereomers and how many distinct stereoisomers are present.

If each reaction produces a single stereoisomer, and the two stereoisomers are enantiomers, then on standard HPLC (which can't distinguish enantiomers), they would co-elute as one peak. On a chiral column, they would elute as two separate peaks.

If the two diols are diastereomers, then both columns would show two peaks.

So, if the combined products have two diastereomers, then the standard HPLC would show two peaks, and the chiral HPLC would also show two peaks.

Alternatively, if the products are enantiomers, then standard HPLC would show one peak, and chiral HPLC would show two.

But then, what about the number of stereocenters and the possibility of being meso?

Wait, perhaps each diol has two stereocenters but is a meso compound, making it achiral. So, each reaction produces a single achiral diol.

In that case, combining both products would result in two achiral diols, which are enantiomers or diastereomers.

Wait, but if each diol is achiral (meso), then when you combine them, you have two different achiral compounds.

So, in the standard HPLC, each would elute as a single peak. Thus, two peaks total.

In the chiral HPLC, since the compounds are achiral, they would also elute as a single peak each. So again, two peaks.

But then, looking at the options, option C says 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC. That would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces two stereoisomers, leading to four products in total.

Wait, but the question says each reaction goes to 100% completion, so each produces a single product.

Thus, combining two reactions would give two products. Each product is a diol with two stereocenters.

If each diol is a meso compound, then each is achiral. So, two achiral diols. Thus, on standard HPLC, two peaks. On chiral HPLC, two peaks as well, because the column can separate them as they are different compounds.

Alternatively, if the diols are enantiomers, then on standard HPLC, they would appear as a single peak, but on chiral HPLC, as two peaks.

But wait, if each diol is a meso compound, then they are achiral, so no matter which HPLC is used, each would produce a single peak.

So, for the combined products:

- If they are two different achiral diols, then on both HPLCs, two peaks.

Thus, the correct answer would be C) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers, but since the reaction goes to 100% completion, each produces only one diastereomer. Thus, combining the two reactions' products gives two diastereomers, which would show as two peaks on both HPLCs.

Wait, but if the diols from each reaction are diastereomers, then yes, two peaks on both columns.

So, putting it all together, the products from each reaction are two different diols, each with two stereocenters. If these diols are diastereomers, then the HPLC would show two peaks in each case.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a single diastereomer, leading to two diastereomers when combined.

Thus, the correct answer is C) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.


The problem involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid, and the products are analyzed using standard and chiral HPLC columns. The key steps to determine the chromatographic outcomes are as follows:

1. **Reaction Overview**:  
   - mCPBA reacts with the double bond in each alkene to form an epoxide via syn addition.  
   - The stereochemistry of the starting alkene (E or Z) determines the configuration of the epoxide.  
   - Upon treatment with aqueous acid, the epoxide undergoes ring-opening to form a diol.  

2. **Epoxide Formation**:  
   - For (E)-oct-4-ene, the trans configuration of the double bond leads to an epoxide with a specific stereochemistry.  
   - For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the cis configuration of the double bond leads to a different epoxide stereochemistry.  

3. **Ring-Opening of the Epoxide**:  
   - In acidic conditions, the epoxide ring opens to form a diol. The stereochemistry of the diol depends on the configuration of the starting epoxide.  
   - Each reaction produces a single stereoisomeric diol due to 100% completion.  

4. **Combined Products**:  
   - Reaction 1 produces one diol, and Reaction 2 produces another diol. These diols are distinct stereoisomers, likely diastereomers, as they originate from different starting materials.  

5. **HPLC Analysis**:  
   - **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**: Since the diols are diastereomers, they will elute as separate peaks. Thus, two peaks are observed.  
   - **Chiral HPLC**: Chiral columns can separate enantiomers, but since the diols are diastereomers, they will also elute as separate peaks. Thus, two peaks are observed.  

6. **Conclusion**:  
   - The combined product mixture contains two distinct diastereomeric diols. On both standard and chiral HPLC columns, these diols will produce two separate peaks due to their distinct stereochemical configurations.

ANSWER: C
