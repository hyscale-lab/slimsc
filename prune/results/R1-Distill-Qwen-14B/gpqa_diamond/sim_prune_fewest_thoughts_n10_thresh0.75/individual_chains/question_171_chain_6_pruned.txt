Okay, so I have this question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think it through. The question involves six different benzene derivatives (substances 1-6) reacting with excess bromine. I need to determine the order of their para-isomer yields from lowest to highest.

First, I remember that electrophilic substitution reactions are influenced by the directing groups on the benzene ring. The substituents can be activating or deactivating, and they direct incoming electrophiles to either the ortho, meta, or para positions.

So, each substituent in the compounds will determine where the bromine adds. The para-isomer's yield depends on the substituent's directing effects. If a substituent is a strong activating group, it will direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, leading to a higher para yield. Deactivating groups, especially meta directors, will lead to less para product.

Let me list each substituent:

1) Substance 1: C6H5-CH3 (toluene, methyl group)
Methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So, when bromine reacts, it should form more para product than meta. So, the para isomer should be a major product, but wait, the question is about the weight fraction. Wait, but if there are ortho, meta, and para products, the para is a big part, but not the only one. But the actual yield of para depends on steric factors and the directing.

2) Substance 2: C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 (benzoyloxy ethyl? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. Wait, that would be a phenyl acetate? Or maybe it's an ester. Alternatively, perhaps it's benzene with a COOEt group, which is an ester. Wait, the substituent is COOEt (the ethyl ester of a carboxylic acid). So, the substituent is an ester group. Ester groups are deactivating because the oxygen in the ester is electron-withdrawing. Now, what is their directing effect? Esters are meta directors, I think. Because the carbonyl group is electron-withdrawing, making the ring less reactive, and the ester group directs incoming electrophiles to the meta positions. So, para would not be a major product here. So, the para-isomer's yield would be low for this one.

3) Substance 3: C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
Chlorine is an interesting substituent. It's ortho/para directing but deactivating. Wait, because Cl is electronegative, it can withdraw electrons through induction, but it can donate through resonance. So, it's a weakly deactivating group but still ortho/para directing. So, when bromine reacts, the para product should form. But since Cl is deactivating, the overall reaction is slower, but the directing is ortho/para. So, the para isomer's yield will be significant, but perhaps less than in activating groups. So, higher than meta directors but lower than strong activating groups.

4) Substance 4: C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
Nitro groups are strong deactivating and meta-directing. So, the incoming electrophile (Br+) would go to the meta position relative to the nitro group. So, the para product is not favored. Therefore, the para-isomer's yield would be very low for this compound. Maybe the lowest among the options.

5) Substance 5: C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
The substituent is an ethyl group, which is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Similar to toluene. So, the para product should form a significant amount. So, higher para yield compared to deactivating groups.

6) Substance 6: C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)
The substituent is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a strong deactivating group, meta-directing. Because the COOH group is highly electron-withdrawing, it deactivates the ring. So, the incoming bromine would add meta to the substituent. So, the para product would be low, but maybe higher than nitro, but lower than activating groups. Or wait, wait. Wait, the COOH group is a meta director. So, the para product would be minimal. So, the yield of the para isomer would be low, but perhaps not as low as nitro.

Wait, but wait. I should think about the substituents' activating or deactivating nature and their directing effects.

Let me summarize each substituent:

1) CH3: activating, ortho/para → good para yield.

2) COOEt: deactivating, meta → para is not favored. So para yield is low.

3) Cl: deactivating but ortho/para → para is a major product but yield is less than activating groups.

4) NO2: deactivating, meta → para is minor.

5) C2H5: activating, ortho/para → good para yield.

6) COOH: deactivating, meta → para is minor.

So, the order of para yield from lowest to highest:

The substituents with low para yields are the deactivating ones, especially meta directors. So, the lowest para yields would be 4 (NO2), followed by 6 (COOH), then 2 (COOEt), then 3 (Cl), then 1 (CH3), and 5 (C2H5). Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The para yield is higher when the substituent is activating (since the ring is more reactive and directing to para is more favorable). Deactivating groups (like nitro, Cl, COOH, COOEt) will have lower yields of para isomers, but Cl is deactivating but ortho/para, so perhaps more para than the meta directors.

So, the order of para yield (from least to most):

Highest para: activating groups (CH3, C2H5) → so these have higher para yields.

Lowest para: meta directors (NO2, COOH, COOEt), with Cl perhaps having higher than them but lower than activating.

Wait, but Cl is deactivating but ortho/para. So, when Cl is present, the ring is less reactive, so the reaction is slower, but when it does happen, the para and ortho positions
