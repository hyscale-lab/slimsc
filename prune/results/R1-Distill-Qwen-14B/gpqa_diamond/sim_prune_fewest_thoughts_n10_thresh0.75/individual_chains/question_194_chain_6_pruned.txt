Okay, so I've got this physics problem about spins and partition functions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the setup is three spins: S1, S2, S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I'm supposed to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). Right? So I need to figure out all possible configurations of the three spins and compute E for each, then sum exp(-βE) for all of them.

Let me think about the possible states. Each spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I can list them as all combinations of S1, S2, S3.

But maybe there's a smarter way than listing all 8. Let me think about the energy expression.

E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me denote each pair: term1 = S1S2, term2 = S1S3, term3 = S2S3. So each term is either +1 or -1, because the product of two spins is 1 if same, -1 if different.

So each of term1, term2, term3 can be +1 or -1. So the sum S = term1 + term2 + term3 can range from -3 to +3 in steps of 2, I think. Wait, because each term contributes either +1 or -1.

Wait, no. Let me see: each term is either +1 or -1. So the sum of three such terms can be:

3 (all +1)
1 (two +1, one -1)
-1 (two -1, one +1)
-3 (all -1)

Wait, no, wait. Let's see: If all three terms are +1, sum is 3. If two are +1 and one -1: sum is 2 -1 =1. If one +1, two -1: sum is -1. If all three are -1: sum is -3. So yeah, possible sums are 3,1,-1,-3.

So E = -J*(sum). Therefore, E can be: -J*3 = -3J; -J*(1)=-J; -J*(-1)=J; -J*(-3)=3J.

So for each state, we can compute E, then compute exp(βE) because Z is sum of exp(-β E) → but wait, no. Wait, no, the partition function is sum exp(-β E). So E is the energy of each state.

Wait, wait: Each state has its own energy, which is E = -J (sum of the three terms). So for each state, the exponent is -β E = β J (sum). Because E is negative J times the sum.

So for each state, the term is exp( β J (sum) ), since E is negative.

So, the
