Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and molecular symmetries. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question starts with toluene. I remember that toluene is methylbenzene, right? So it's a benzene ring with a methyl group attached. The first step is treating it with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. Oh, that's a nitrating mixture. Nitration usually happens under acidic conditions, and the nitronium ion is the active agent here.

Wait, where does the nitro group get attached on toluene? Toluene undergoes electrophilic substitution. The methyl group is an activating group, directing the incoming nitro group to the ortho, para positions. But since nitration is a strong nitrating agent, the major product is para-nitrotoluene, I think. So product 1 would be para-nitrotoluene.

Next step, product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent, especially in acidic conditions. I remember that when nitro groups are on aromatic rings, especially in the para position, the nitro group can be oxidized. Wait, or is it that the methyl group adjacent to nitro can be oxidized? Let me think. In nitrotoluenes, when the nitro is in the para position relative to the methyl, the methyl can be oxidized. 

Wait, nitrotoluene (para-nitrotoluene) has a methyl group attached to the benzene ring and a nitro group opposite it. So when you oxidize a methyl group that's attached to a benzene ring and is adjacent to a nitro group, what happens? I think the oxidation of toluene derivatives with nitro groups leads to the formation of a carboxylic acid. So the methyl would become a COOH group. So product 2 would be para-nitrobenzoic acid. Because the methyl becomes COOH, right?

Wait, para-nitrotoluene on oxidation would go from CH3 to COOH. So, the structure should be a benzene ring with a nitro group in the para position relative to the COOH group. So, the substituents are at positions 1 and 4 (if you imagine the COOH at position 1, nitro at position
