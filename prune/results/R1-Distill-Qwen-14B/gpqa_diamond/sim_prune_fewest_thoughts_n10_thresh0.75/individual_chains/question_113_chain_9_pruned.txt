Okay, I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to break it down step by step. So, the question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with varying numbers of carbons, hydrogens, oxygens. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The question says there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong peak, sometimes even at a lower wavenumber than 3000. Alternatively, if there's an -OH group, like in an alcohol or phenol, that could explain it. 

Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak that often corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation. Wait, sometimes in conjugated carbonyls, like in a ketone with some conjugation, the peak can be a bit lower. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents, like in an ester or something. Alternatively, the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are the ones attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound probably has a double bond, maybe part of a conjugated system. 

Mass Spec shows a fragment at m/z=45. Hmm, 45 is a key mass. Let's think about that. The molecular ion breaks down into fragments. A mass of 45 could correspond to a couple of possibilities. For example, it might be a CH3CO+ (acetate) fragment, which is (CH3CO) with a mass of 45 (12*2 + 1*3 +16= 24 +3 +16=43? Wait, wait, 12*2 is 24, 1*3 is 3, 16 is 16. Total 24+3=27 plus 16 is 43. Oh, wait, maybe I miscalculated. Acetate is CH3COO-, which is 60 (12*3 +1*3 +16*2= 36+3+32=71?), no, wait that can't be. Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the fragment could be a ketene group or something else. Alternatively, the mass 45 could be (CH3)2CO, which is acetone, mass would be 58. No, that's not 45. Or maybe a fragment from an ester. Wait, another approach: 45 is the mass of C3H7O? Let me see. Carbon is 12, hydrogen 1, oxygen 16. So 3*12=36, 7 is 7, 16 is 16. 36+7=43 +16=59. No, that's not 45. Hmm. Wait, another possibility: the fragment may be from a butyrate group? Like (CH2)2COO- but that might not lead to 45. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketone, like (CH3)CO, which is 45? Let's compute. CH3CO+ would be 12*2 +1*3 +16 = 24 +3 +16=43, but wait, that's 43. Hmm, not 45. Oh wait, maybe another group. What about a CH2=CHCOO- group? Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 45 comes from a COOCH2CH3 group. Let me calculate: COOCH2CH3 is (12+16*2) + (12*2 +1*5) = (12+32) + (24+5)=44 +29=73, no. That's not it. Wait, perhaps a different approach. Let's think about the possible molecular formulas and see what their fragmentation might give.

The possible options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

So, molecular formulas:

Option A: C6H12O2. Molar mass would be 6*12 +12*1 +2*16=72+12+32=116.

Option B: C6H10O. Molar mass is 6*12 +10 +16=72+10+16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2. 72 +10 +32=114.

Option D: C6H12O. 72 +12 +16=100.

The mass spec fragment is 45. So, which of the molecular formulas, when fragmented, could produce a 45 fragment.

Another approach: The molecular formula likely has an ester group or a ketone or an acid, given the IR peaks. The strong peak at 1700 suggests a carbonyl. The 1650 could be an conjugated carbonyl or possibly an aromatic ring (like C=C in a benzene ring with substituents). Also, if there's a carbonyl and a conjugated double bond, like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, that could explain the 1650.

Given that, the compound might be an ester, maybe with a conjugated double bond. Or perhaps a cyclic ester, but that's a stretch.

Looking at the NMR: there are vinyl hydrogens. So, there's a double bond in the structure. So, perhaps the compound is an ester with a double bond, like maybe methyl vinyl something. Or a ketone with a double bond.

Wait, another thought: the IR peaks. The broad peak at 3000 could be an -OH group. The two carbonyl peaks: 1700 and 1650. If I have two carbonyl groups, that would be unusual, but maybe the 1650 is from an aromatic ring (like C=C stretch). Alternatively, perhaps one is a carbonyl (like ester or ketone) and the other is an aromatic ring. Wait, aromatic rings typically have C=C stretching around 1600 cm^-1, but could be higher if there's conjugation. So maybe the 1650 is from an aromatic ring. So, that would suggest the compound has both a carbonyl group (like an ester or ketone) and an aromatic ring.

Wait, but the options given don't include any benzene rings. Wait, no, the options are about the molecular formula, not the structure. So perhaps the compound isn't aromatic but has a conjugated carbonyl.

Another angle: the IR absorption at 1700 is a strong peak, which is typical for an ester or a ketone. The 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl, say, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. So perhaps the compound has a structure like a ketone with a double bond nearby.

Additionally, the presence of -OH (from the broad peak) could indicate a hydroxyl group, like in an alcohol. But wait, if it's an ester, then maybe the -OH is in an -COOH group. Alternatively, maybe it's a hemiacetal or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the broad peak could be from an -NH stretch, but that's usually around 3300 and it's more for amines. But the question says it's a broad peak at 3000, which is more typical for O-H. So perhaps
