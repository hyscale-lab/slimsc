Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by breaking down what the question says and see if I can visualize each step.

First, the problem describes compound A. Its proton NMR has two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in proton NMR, the integration tells us about the number of protons. So 6H as a triplet and 4H as a quartet.

Wait, a triplet usually comes from splitting due to neighboring protons. Let's think about common structures. Maybe it's a diethyl group? Because ethyl groups have a triplet for the CH3 and quartet for the CH2. So diethyl something? Like diethyl ether? But wait, diethyl ether's NMR would have a triplet at around 1.2 ppm for the CH3 and a quartet around 3.5 ppm for the OCH2. Oh, but here the quartet is at 1.3 ppm, which is more like a CH2 next to another CH2, not an oxygenated one. So maybe it's a different structure.

Another possibility: maybe a cyclohexane derivative. Wait, if we have two sets of protons, maybe it's a 1,2-dimethylcyclobutane or something else. Or perhaps it's a diethyl group attached to a larger ring.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests two equivalent CH3 groups. Each CH3 has 3H, so two of them would account for 6H. And the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H suggests a CH2 group that's next to another CH2. Because a quartet means each proton is split by two neighboring protons. So if it's a CH2 next to another CH2, like in an ethyl group. So maybe the structure is something like two ethyl groups attached to a central structure.

Wait, but if it's a cyclohexane with substituents, maybe. Suppose the structure is like a cyclohexane with two ethyl groups attached to adjacent carbons. So each ethyl group contributes a triplet and quartet. Wait, but the NMR of each ethyl would be as follows: the CH3 would be a triplet because they are adjacent to a CH2, and the CH2 would be a quartet because it's next to another CH2 (like in ethyl groups attached to a ring).

So for example, if the structure is 1,2-diethylcyclohexane. So each ethyl group's CH3 would be a triplet, and the CH2 would be a quartet. But wait, in that case, each ethyl would have its own triplet and quartet, but in the NMR, the signals might overlap if they're equivalent. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different structure.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the molecule is a diethyl ether, but that would have a different NMR. Or maybe a diethyl ester? No, because the quartet in an ester would be around 4.1 ppm (like OCH2CH3), which doesn't match the 1.3 ppm here.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexane with two methyl groups attached to adjacent carbons, each with their own substituents. Wait, but that might not fit the NMR.

Another angle: The number of signals in NMR. Compound A has two signals, so likely symmetry. If it's a diethyl group, perhaps on a symmetrical part of a ring, like 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane but with each methyl as CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 1,2-dimethylcyclopropane? No, because cyclopropane would have protons in a different region. Alternatively, maybe it's a bicyclic compound, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's a diethyl group attached to a central carbon, like diethyl ether. No, because diethyl ether's OCH2 is around 3.5 ppm, not 1.3. So that doesn't
