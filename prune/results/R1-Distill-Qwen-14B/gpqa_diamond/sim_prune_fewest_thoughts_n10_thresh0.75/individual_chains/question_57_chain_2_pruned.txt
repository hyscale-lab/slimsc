Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my scattering theory, but let's see if I can work this out.

Alright, the phase shifts given are δ0 = 90 degrees, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, and δ4=13°. The rest are ignored. The electrons are 50 MeV, but I'm not sure if the energy plays a role here. The question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the beam direction.

Wait, from what I remember, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using the partial waves. The formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδl} sin(δl) / (something with sinθ), but wait, I think the exact expression might be f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) [e^{2iδl} - 1] / (something). Or maybe it's related to the sum of (2l+1)e^{iδl} (e^{iδl} -1) ? I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another thought: The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by the sum over l of (2l + 1) e^{iδl} sinδl / (k * ... ) * something involving Legendre polynomials? Or is it for specific angles, like forward direction (θ=0), the expression simplifies?

Oh wait, the question specifies along the incident beam direction, so θ=0. In that case, the expression might simplify because the Legendre polynomial P_l(cosθ) becomes P_l(1), which is 1 for all l. Hmm, but wait, the Legendre polynomials are 1 for l=0, and 0 for even l>0, and some other value for odd l. No, wait, no. Actually, P_l(1) is 1 for all l because it's the value at the pole. Wait, no, P_l(1) is 1 for any l, right? Because P_l(x) evaluated at x=1 is 1. Yeah, that makes sense
