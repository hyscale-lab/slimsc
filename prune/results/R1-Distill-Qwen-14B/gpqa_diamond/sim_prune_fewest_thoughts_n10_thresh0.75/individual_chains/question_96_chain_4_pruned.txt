Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area, specifically through the formula S = (k c^3 A)/(4 ħ G), where A is the area of the event horizon. Oh wait, right, k is Boltzmann's constant, c is the speed of light, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and G is Newton's constant.

So the problem gives me the angular size θ of the event horizon. I think I need to find the radius of the event horizon first. Oh right, the angular size is given by θ ≈ (2R)/(d), where R is the radius of the event horizon, and d is the distance to the black hole. But wait, θ is given in degrees, and I might need to convert that to radians because the formula for angular size usually uses radians. Oh yeah, radians are better for calculations here.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Convert θ from degrees to radians.
2. Use θ ≈ 2R/d to solve for R.
3. Calculate the area A of the event horizon (A = 4π R²).
4. Plug A into the entropy formula to find S.
5. Calculate the order of magnitude of S and pick the closest option.

Okay, starting with step one. θ is 1e-17 degrees. To convert to radians, we multiply by π/180. So θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * π / 180.

Wait, let me compute that: 1e-17 degrees * (π rad / 180 degrees) = (1e-17 * π) / 180. Let me approximate π as 3.1416. So 3.1416 / 180 is approximately 0.0174533. So θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * 0.0174533 ≈ 1.74533e-19 radians.

Next, step two: θ ≈ 2R/d. So R ≈ (θ * d)/2. But wait, the distance d is given as 1e10 parsecs. Oh, I need to convert parsecs into meters to keep the units consistent. One
