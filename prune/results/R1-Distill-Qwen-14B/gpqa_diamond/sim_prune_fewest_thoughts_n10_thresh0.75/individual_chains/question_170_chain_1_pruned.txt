Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, so that's a two-component vector, right? So the state vector is χ = [3i, 4]^T. I think that's the spinor representation. 

The question is about the expectation value of S_y. Oh right, the expectation value is like the average value you'd measure if you measured S_y many times on identical systems. The formula for expectation value is the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator, multiplied by the state vector again. So ⟨S_y⟩ = χ† σ_y χ.

Wait, σ_y is the Pauli y-matrix. I remember it's [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So I need to compute that.

Let me write down the steps. First, compute χ†, which is the conjugate transpose of χ. The given χ has components [3i, 4]. The conjugate would change 3i to -3i, and 4 stays the same. So χ† would be [-3i, 4], but wait no, wait. Wait, χ is a column vector, so its conjugate transpose would be a row vector [3i*, 4*], where * is the complex conjugate. So 3i becomes -3i, and 4 is still 4. So χ† is [-3i, 4].

Then, multiply χ† by σ_y. Let me write that out. σ_y is a 2x2 matrix:

[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

So when I multiply χ† (which is a 1x2 vector) by σ_y (2x2), I get a 1x2 vector. Let me compute each element.

First element: ( -3i * 0 ) + (4 * i ) = 0 + 4i = 4i.

Second element: ( -3i * (-i) ) + (4 * 0 ) = (3i^2) + 0. Wait, i squared is -1, so 3i^2 is 3*(-1) = -3. So the second
