Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. Hmm. It's about the uncertainty principle, right? The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. I remember that this principle states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, like position and momentum, can be known simultaneously.

The question says that an electron is traveling along the x-direction at a speed v = 2e8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its position Δx is 0.1 nm. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron. The options are given as A to D, each a different order of magnitude in joules.

Wait, right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. But wait, isn't ħ the reduced Planck constant? Oh right, ħ is h/(2π), where h is Planck's constant. So, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So, since I'm looking for ΔE, and I know that the energy of a particle is related to its momentum, I think I need to connect Δp (uncertainty in momentum) to ΔE. Because the problem is about energy uncertainty, maybe using the relation between energy and momentum.

Wait, the kinetic energy of a particle is given by KE = p²/(2m), where m is mass. Since we're dealing with uncertainties, perhaps the uncertainty in energy ΔE is related to the uncertainty in momentum Δp. So, if Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, then ΔE would be (Δp)²/(2m), right? Because E is p²/(2m), so the uncertainty would be the derivative, but I might be overcomplicating. Maybe for small uncertainties, we can say ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m). That sounds right.

So first, calculate Δp using the uncertainty principle. Then use that Δp to find ΔE.

So, starting with Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. We can take Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx) as the minimum uncertainty. So solving for Δp: Δp = ħ/(2Δx).

Wait, but wait, sometimes the formula is written as Δx Δp ≥
