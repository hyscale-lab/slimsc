Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then figuring out the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, sounds like maybe some kind of substitution or elimination reaction. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad range. That usually suggests the presence of either an alcohol (OH) or an amine (NH) group. But more likely, since the other peaks are around 1720 and 1610, maybe it's an alcohol. Wait, 1720 is a strong carbonyl peak, which could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. But the 1610 cm-1 peak is lower than a typical C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid (which is around 1700). Hmm, maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl group.

Looking at the NMR data. The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, which is very characteristic of an aldehyde proton. Wait, no, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, wait, could it be a carboxylic acid O-H? Carboxylic acids also have protons around 10-12 ppm, and the broadness suggests it's an -OH group. But the IR at 1720 cm-1 could fit a carboxylic acid's carbonyl. But wait, sometimes carboxylic acids have a higher wavenumber, but maybe it's conjugated or something.

Wait, let me think. The 10.5 ppm could be an aldehyde proton, but that's a bit high for an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Let me think. The 1720 cm-1 would fit a carboxylic acid, but that's actually a bit low for a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids are usually around 1700, so 1720 could be an ester or maybe a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl. I'm a bit confused here.

Looking at the NMR again. The 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. The coupling is doublets, which makes me think each proton is adjacent to two others of the same. So maybe an aromatic ring with substituents in the para positions. Like a benzene ring with two substituents opposite each other.

What about the other signals? The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a methine group attached to something, maybe an oxygen. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be a methylene group, perhaps adjacent to something like a carbonyl. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a singlet for a methyl group attached to something, maybe an oxygen. And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, like an ethyl chain.

Wait, putting this together. The aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene. If the substituents are in para positions, what could they be? Let's consider the substituents. One substituent could be a carbonyl group, and another could be an alkoxy group or another substituent.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl, so maybe a ketone or ester or acid. If the NMR has a 10.5 ppm peak, which is a singlet, that could be a carbonyl group's alpha proton. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 10.5 ppm is more likely an aldehyde proton, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe it's a phenolic O-H, but the IR doesn't show O-H stretching for phenols in that region. Wait, phenols have broad O-H stretches around 3200-3600 cm-1. The IR given includes 3400–2500, which is a broad region, possibly including a O-H stretch. So maybe it's a phenol group.

Wait, but combining that with the NMR. If the 10.5 ppm is the phenolic O-H, then the IR would have a strong O-H peak. However, the IR given doesn't specify whether it's a broad peak or not. The 1720 cm-1 could be something else. Hmm.

Let me think about the structure. The NMR shows a benzene ring with two substituents, each in para positions. So substituents on carbons 1 and 3, or 1 and 4? No, that's not para. Wait, in para positions, two substituents are on opposite carbons, like 1 and 4 positions.

So for example, 4-substituted and another substituent on position 1. So maybe something like a substituent at position 1 and another at position 4. So then, the substituents could be a carbonyl group and an alkoxy group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester), and another is an alkoxy group. But the NMR doesn't show an OCH3 or similar.

Wait, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group and a methyl group. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group and another group, like an ethyl or isobutyl group. Let me think about the other NMR signals.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group attached to another group, perhaps an oxygen. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be a CH2 next to something, perhaps a carbonyl. The 1.4 (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to something, maybe an oxygen. Wait, that could be a geminal dimethyl group, but it's a singlet? No, wait, it's a doublet. No, wait, 1.4 ppm, d, 3H. So maybe it's a CH(CH3)2 group? Or a CH2CH(CH3) group.

Wait, putting this together. Let me try to build the structure.

The aromatic ring has two substituents in para positions. Let's say one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and another is a substituent that includes a CH group with a chain leading to a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. Let me think. An isobutyl group would have a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3). Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the NMR shifts. The 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (m) for 1H. That could be a methine (CH) connected to something. The 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H, perhaps a CH2 connected to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group (COCH2CH2...). Or maybe an acetoxy group, but the IR doesn't show an ester peak beyond 1720, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let me consider the possible options given.

The options are A, B, C, D. Let's look at them.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So that would be a benzene ring with an ethyl group at position 4 and a propanoic acid group at position 2. Wait, but the substituents would be in positions 2 and 4? Or maybe it's a different substitution.

Wait, the structure for option A would be benzene with substituents at 2 and 4. Let me see: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid would mean the phenyl group is attached to the propanoic acid at position 2, but that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a substituent at position 4 (ethyl) and another substituent at position 2 (propanoic acid). That would make them meta to each other, but the NMR suggests para substituents.

Hmm, maybe not. Let me check the other options.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's a benzene with a isobutyl group at position 1 and a methyl at position 4. Wait, that would be para substitution if the substituents are at 1 and 3? No, 1 and 4 would be para. So it's para substitution. So that would fit the NMR's aromatic pattern. But then, what about the other NMR signals?

The isobutyl group would have a CH2CH(CH3) structure. The H on the CH would be around 1.7 ppm? Wait, the isobutyl group's CH is typically around 1.0-1.5 ppm, but maybe in this case it's different.

But the NMR shows a 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which could be the CH in the isobutyl group. Then, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the CH2 next to the benzene. The 1.4 (d, 3H) would be the methyl groups attached to the CH. Wait, but for an isobutyl group, the structure is CH2CH(CH3)2. So the CH would have two methyl groups attached, so the H would be split into a triplet or something. Wait, but in the NMR, the 1.4 is a doublet for 3H, which suggests maybe a methyl group attached to a CH2. Hmm, not sure.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group at position 4 and a carboxylic acid group at position 1. Wait, that would make them para to each other. The benzoic acid would have a COOH group, so the NMR should have a broad peak around 10 ppm, which matches the 10.5 ppm in the data. The IR would show a carbonyl at around 1700 cm-1. The given IR is 1720, which is a bit higher, but maybe due to conjugation.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720, which could be the carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids usually have lower wavenumbers, but maybe it's a substituted acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. But if it's a benzoic acid, the IR would typically be around 1700, so 1720 is a bit high. But maybe it's an acid.

So for option C, the structure would be a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group and a COOH group in para positions. The IR would have a strong carbonyl (the COOH) at ~1700, but the given is 1720, which is a bit higher. Hmm, could that be the case?

Alternatively, if it's a ketone, the 1720 would fit. But then where would the 10.5 ppm peak come from? Maybe an aldehyde group. But wait, if it's a ketone, the aldehyde would be absent. So maybe this isn't the right scenario.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So the benzene has a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl at position 4. That would be para substitution. The substituents are on opposite positions. The NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, which matches the data.

But then, what about the other NMR signals? The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be the CH in the sec-butyl group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the CH2 next to the benzene. The 1.4 (d, 3H) could be the methyl groups attached to the CH, but wait, a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. So each CH would have two methyl groups attached. So the H on the CH would be split into a triplet or something. But the NMR here shows a doublet for 3H at 1.4 ppm, which would indicate a methyl group attached to a CH2. Hmm, maybe that's not a sec-butyl.

Wait, but perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. The isobutyl group would have a structure like CH2CH(CH3)2. So the CH would have two methyl groups attached. The H on the CH would be a singlet if it's a tert-butyl, but if it's isobutyl, it's a CH connected to two CH2 groups. Wait, no, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. So the CH would have two methyl groups attached. So the H on CH would be a singlet? No, wait, maybe it's split into a septet, but in the NMR, it's at 2.9 ppm as a multiplet.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let me think.

Wait, the NMR has a 1.7 ppm (m,2H) which could be a CH2 next to a carbonyl. If the substituent is an acetyl group (like CH2CO-) then perhaps the CH2 would be next to the carbonyl, giving a shift around 2.3-2.5 ppm. But here it's 1.7, which is lower. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the IR has a peak at 1610 cm-1, which is in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. The 1450 cm-1 could be the stretching of the C-O in an ester or something like that, but I'm not certain.

Let me try to look for the functional groups. The IR has peaks around 3400–2500, which includes the O-H stretch. If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad around 2500-3300. But the 10.5 ppm in NMR is a broad peak, which suggests an -OH group. So, maybe it's a benzoic acid derivative.

So, if the compound is a benzoic acid with a substituent, the IR would show a strong carbonyl (around 1700), which is close to our given 1720. The NMR peak at 10.5 ppm would be the -COOH proton, which is typically broad and around 10-12 ppm.

So, looking back at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would have a benzoic acid group (COOH) and a sec-butyl substituent in the para position.

So, the NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, as the substituents are in para positions. The 10.5 ppm peak would be the COOH proton, which is broad and a singlet because it's a single proton. The other signals would come from the sec-butyl group attached to the benzene.

The sec-butyl group is: benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)2. So, the structure would have a CH2 between the benzene and the CH. The CH has two methyl groups attached. So, the H on CH would be a singlet? Or perhaps a multiplet due to coupling.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet of 1H. That could be the CH in the sec-butyl group, which is attached to two methyl groups. So, the CH would have two adjacent CH2 groups? No, wait, the structure is benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)2. So the CH is attached to two methyl groups and a CH2. So, the H on the CH would have two neighboring H's (from the CH2), leading to a triplet? Or maybe a multiplet due to coupling with multiple protons.

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the CH2 group between the benzene and the CH. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be the methyl groups attached to the CH, but wait, the CH is attached to two methyl groups, each with 3H. But in the NMR, the 1.4 is a doublet for 3H. That doesn't add up because each methyl would be a singlet, but maybe they're equivalent. Hmm, perhaps the two methyl groups are equivalent, so their signals would be a singlet. But the data shows a doublet for 3H at 1.4 ppm. That's confusing. Maybe I'm not interpreting the structure correctly.

Wait, perhaps the substituent isn't a sec-butyl but an isobutyl group. Let me think. An isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. So, the CH would have two methyl groups attached, and the CH2 would be next to the benzene. So, the CH2 would have two Hs, and the CH would have one H. The H on the CH would be split into a triplet because it's next to a CH2 with two Hs. The CH2 would be split into a quartet because it's next to the CH with one H. But in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H), which could be the CH. The 1.7 ppm (2H, m) could be the CH2 group. The 1.4 ppm (3H, d) could be the methyl groups attached to the CH. Wait, but for isobutyl, each methyl is attached to the CH, so each would be a triplet, but if they're equivalent, maybe it's a singlet. But the data shows a doublet, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let's think: CH2CH2CH3. No, that's straight chain. Or perhaps a neopentyl group? Not sure.

Wait, let's think about the integrating. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a single methyl group, perhaps attached to a CH2. So maybe the structure is benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something. Hmm, not sure.

Let me think about the reaction after identifying the compound. The question says that compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. That reaction is typically used for the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids or for the dehydrohalogenation of alcohols. Wait, wait, no. Wait, red phosphorus and HI is used to eliminate in the presence of an alcohol, known as the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction? Or perhaps it's for the substitution of a leaving group.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI is a standard reagent for deoxygenation of epoxides, but more commonly, it's used in the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: red phosphorus and HI is used in the hydrolysis of esters to acids. Wait, no, esters are hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's for the elimination reaction, such as dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, another possibility. Red phosphorus and HI are used to deoxygenate epoxides, but more importantly, they are used to convert alcohols into halides. Wait, no, that's more like LiAlH4 or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's the opposite: converting a halide into something else. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is a way to perform an elimination. For example, in the presence of a tertiary alcohol, it could form an alkene via E2 mechanism. But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of alcohols with red phosphorus and HI is known as the Wolff-Kishner reaction? No, that's for ketones to alkanes. Alternatively, maybe it's the hydroiodic acid cleaving an ether? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. If the compound has a good leaving group, like a tosylate, it might substitute with HI. But without knowing the structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the more straightforward approach is to first figure out the structure of compound X, and then determine the product.

So, let's go back. Based on the NMR and IR data, I think compound X is likely 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). So the structure would be a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

Then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Wait, red phosphorus and HI is a strong acid and a good nucleophile. In the case of a benzoic acid, reacting with HI would not make sense because the acid is already at its maximum protonation.

Alternatively, perhaps compound X has an ester group. Because in that case, red phosphorus and HI would hydrolyze the ester to a carboxylic acid. But looking at the options, the product options include a carboxylic acid (option C) and others.

Wait, but in the initial reaction, compound X is treated with red phosphorus and HI. If X is an ester, then the product would be a carboxylic acid. Let me see which options are acids.

Looking at the options, option C is a benzoic acid, and option A is a propanoic acid. So, if X is an ester, the product would be the acid. But the problem says X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, which suggests X has a leaving group that can be replaced by HI.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to form the acid. Like, if X is a benzyl ester, then reaction with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze it to the acid.

Wait, but the options given include only the final products. So, if X is the starting material and the reaction produces one of the options, perhaps I need to figure out what the product is.

Wait, perhaps compound X is an ester. Let's say X is an ester such as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate ester. Then, upon hydrolysis with HI (acidic conditions), it would form the carboxylic acid, which would be option C. But would red phosphorus be involved? Hmm, red phosphorus is sometimes used as a catalyst or in deoxygenation reactions.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution. If X has a leaving group like a bromide, then HI would substitute it with iodide. But without knowing the structure, it's hard.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the IR and NMR data are for compound X, and after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, we have to identify the product. So perhaps compound X is an ester, and the reaction is cleavage to form a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the NMR data includes a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which would fit a carboxylic acid. So, if X is already a carboxylic acid, what reaction would it undergo with red phosphorus and HI? That doesn't make much sense, because HI is a strong acid but with a carboxylic acid, perhaps nothing would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps compound X is a benzyl halide. For example, if X is a benzene ring with a bromine and an ester group. Then, the reaction with HI would substitute the bromine with iodine. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydration. If X has an alcohol group, HI might protonate it, and red phosphorus could help in elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, another angle. Let me consider the reaction conditions again. Red phosphorus and HI are often used for the elimination of alcohols to form alkenes. The process is called dehydrohalogenation if there's a leaving group, but more likely, if X is an alcohol, then under acidic conditions, it could form an oxonium ion, which could lose water to form an alkene.

Wait, but if X is a tertiary alcohol, then elimination would form an alkene. For example, (CH3)3COH would form (CH3)2C=CH2 upon treatment with HI and red phosphorus.

But looking back at the NMR data, is there an OH group? The IR shows a peak in the 3400–2500 cm-1, which includes the O-H stretch. The NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which could be an aldehyde or a phenolic O-H. But earlier, I thought it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, maybe X is a benzyl bromide derivative. Let's think: if X is an aryl bromide, then with HI, it would undergo substitution to form an aryl iodide. But the options don't show iodide products.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzyl chloride, but again, the options don't show that.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think again about the structure of X. Let me piece it together.

The NMR shows a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. One substituent is a carbonyl group (1720 cm-1), and the other is a substituent that includes a CH, CH2, and some methyl groups.

So, perhaps the structure is benzene with a ketone group and a substituent that's a CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, but how would that fit the NMR? Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an isopropyl group. No, because that wouldn't have a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group with a branch, like a butyl group. Let me think about option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

In that case, the benzene has a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in the para positions. The substituents would be at positions 1 and 4. The aromatic protons would be as in the NMR: two doublets, each integrating for 2H.

Then, the other signals would come from the substituents. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be the CH in the sec-butyl group. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be the adjacent CH2, and the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) could be the methyl groups attached to the CH.

But wait, a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH3)2. So, the CH in the middle would have two methyl groups attached. The H on that CH would be a singlet? No, because it's attached to a CH2 and two CH3 groups. The J values would cause it to be a heptet or something else, but in the NMR, it's a multiplet of 1H. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an isobutyl group. The isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. The H on the CH would be a septet if it's coupled with the two Hs on the CH2. But in the NMR, it's a multiplet, but the integration is 1H, which matches.

The 1.7 ppm (2H, m) would correspond to the CH2 group adjacent to the benzene. The 1.4 ppm (3H, d) would be the CH3 groups attached to the CH. Wait, but in an isobutyl group, the CH is connected to two CH3 groups, each with 3H. So the CH3 signals would each be singlets, but they are equivalent, so it would be a singlet. But the NMR shows a doublet for 3H at 1.4 ppm, which doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let me think: maybe CH2CH2CH3, but that's just a straight chain.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a tert-butyl group. That would be (CH3)3C-. The H on the CH would be a singlet. But in the NMR data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think about the reaction again.

Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction, like turning an alcohol into a iodide.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the options and see which one could be the product of a substitution or elimination reaction.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If X is an ester, then reaction with HI (acid) would hydrolyze it to the acid. So, if X is an ester, the product would be the acid, which is option C.

Alternatively, if X is an acid chloride, then HI would not react in that way. But the IR shows a carbonyl at 1720, which could be an ester or acid.

So, if X is an ester, like 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate, then treatment with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze the ester to the acid. So the product would be option C.

But then, why is the 10.5 ppm peak present in X's NMR? Because if X is an ester, the carbonyl would be around 1720, and the ester oxygen would have an O-H stretch in the IR, but the ester's O-H is usually not that broad and may appear at a lower wavenumber.

Wait, but esters don't have an O-H group. Wait, no. Esters don't have an -OH group, they have an OR group. So, the IR peak around 3400-2500 would be for something else, maybe an alcohol or amine.

Wait, but if X is an ester, then the 10.5 ppm peak must be something else. Like an aldehyde proton. But earlier, the 10.5 could be a phenolic O-H. But the IR doesn't show a clear O-H stretch in that region. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe X is a benzaldehyde derivative. The 10.5 ppm would be the aldehyde proton. Then the IR would have a peak around 1720 for the aldehyde's C=O. But aldehydes typically have C=O at around 1720 cm-1, so that fits. The aromatic protons would be as in the NMR.

Then, what about the other signals? The 2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 (m,2H), 1.4 (d,3H), and 0.9 (t,3H) suggest a chain attached to the aromatic ring. Maybe a propyl chain or something.

Wait, if X is 4-(propyl)benzaldehyde, would that fit? The substituents would be an aldehyde group and a propyl group at the para positions. But then, the other signals don't fit. The 2.9, 1.7, etc., would be part of the propyl chain.

Wait, but a propyl chain would have a CH2CH2CH3. The CH2 next to the ring would be around 2.6-2.8 ppm. But in the NMR, it's 2.9 ppm for 1H. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. Let's say it's a pentyl group or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ethyl group attached to a methylene group, which is attached to a methyl group. Like CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an isopropyl group. Then, the structure would be benzaldehyde with an isopropyl group in para position. But the isopropyl group would have a CH with two CH3 groups attached. The H on CH would be a septet if next to a CH2, but in the NMR, it's a multiplet of 1H. Not sure.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to summarize.

Based on the IR and NMR data, X could be a benzoic acid derivative (option C) or a benzyl alcohol derivative. But the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is key here.

If X is an ester (like 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate), then the reaction would hydrolyze it to the acid (option C). Alternatively, if X is an alcohol, the reaction might eliminate to form an alkene.

But looking at the options, only option C is a carboxylic acid. So perhaps X is an ester, and the product is the acid.

Wait, but the NMR data of X includes a 10.5 ppm peak, which would be the -COOH proton if it's an acid. So if X is an acid, the reaction with HI would not change it. Therefore, perhaps X is an ester, and the product is the acid.

So, putting it all together: X is an ester, like 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate. Upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, it hydrolyzes to 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). Therefore, the answer is C.


The problem involves identifying the final product of a reaction between Compound X and red phosphorus and HI, based on the given IR and NMR data. Here's the analysis:

### IR and NMR Data Analysis
1. **IR Data**:
   - **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates the presence of an O-H group (likely a carboxylic acid or phenol).
   - **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid or ester.
   - **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching, suggesting a benzene ring.

2. **NMR Data**:
   - **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: Broad singlet, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).
   - **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring.
   - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: These signals suggest a chain attached to the aromatic ring, likely a sec-butyl group.

### Structure of Compound X
The NMR and IR data indicate that Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. The para-substituted benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a sec-butyl group (-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂) in opposite positions. The broad singlet at 10.5 ppm corresponds to the carboxylic acid proton, and the IR carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ confirms the presence of the carboxylic acid group.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids. However, since Compound X is already a carboxylic acid, no further reaction would occur under these conditions. Thus, the product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Evaluation of Options
- **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: Incorrect, as the aromatic substituents and chain structure do not match the NMR data.
- **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect, as this structure lacks a carboxylic acid group and does not explain the IR and NMR data.
- **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: Correct, as it matches the IR and NMR data and remains unchanged after the reaction with red phosphorus and HI.
- **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect, as this structure lacks a carboxylic acid group and does not explain the IR and NMR data.

### Conclusion
The final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
