Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?

Hmm, the options are A to D, with energies in eV. I remember that the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time uncertainty (Δt) is at least on the order of ħ (hbar), which is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

Wait, but time here is given as the lifetime of the states. So the uncertainty in time, Δt, is the lifetime of each state. Oh wait, but wait—both states have different lifetimes. Or is the question considering the time resolution required to distinguish them?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The energy-time uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So if the states have lifetimes τ1 and τ2, then their energy uncertainties would be ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2. But wait, the problem is about resolving two energy levels, so perhaps we need the energy difference between them to be much larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe just each of their uncertainties?

Wait, no, when you have two states with different energies, to resolve them, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the combined energy uncertainty of both states. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might overlap and not be distinguishable.

So the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Or perhaps, since each state has its own uncertainty, the difference must be bigger than each individual uncertainty? Not sure.

Wait, let me think. For a single state with lifetime τ, the energy uncertainty is about ħ/τ. So for E1, ΔE1 is about ħ/(1e-9 s). For E2, ΔE2 is ħ/(1e-8 s). Let me calculate those in eV to see.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the key is that the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state so that they can be distinguished. So the required condition is ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2? Or perhaps ΔE > max(ΔE1, ΔE2)? Or maybe just ΔE > ΔE1 and ΔE > ΔE2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the energy resolution. If the energy difference is much larger than the energy uncertainty for both states, then the two levels can be clearly resolved.

So the energy difference (ΔE) should be greater than both ΔE1 and ΔE2. Because if it's bigger than both, then the difference is well beyond the uncertainties of each state, making them distinguishable.

So first, calculate the energy uncertainty for each state.

Let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1
ΔE2 = ħ / τ2

Given τ1 =1e-9 s, τ2=1e-8 s.

Compute each:

ΔE1 = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.05e-25 J

Convert J to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So divide by that.

ΔE1 = 1.05e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.55e-7 eV ≈ 6.55e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J. Convert to eV:

1.05e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.55e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 6.55e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 6.55e-8 eV.

So to resolve E1 and E2, the energy difference ΔE must be larger than the maximum of these two uncertainties. Hmm, wait, but wait: actually, when you have two states, their energy uncertainties are ΔE1 and ΔE2, so the combined effect might require the energy difference to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: the energy difference should be such that it's larger than the uncertainty of each state, so that they don't overlap. So ΔE > ΔE1 and ΔE > ΔE2. So the minimum ΔE would be the larger of the two, which is ΔE1 = 6.55e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be at least something like 7e-7 eV or more.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-7 eV → smaller than both ΔE1 and ΔE2. So no, can't be resolved.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller. No.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → which is much larger than 6.55e-7 (about 6e-7). So 1e-4 eV is 1e-4 = 1e-4. 6.55e-7 is 0.655e-6. So 1e-4 is 100 times larger (since 1e-4 is 100e-6, 1e-4 = 0.0001, 6.55e-7 is 0.000000655). So 1e-4 eV is much bigger than the required 6.55e-7 eV. So this would satisfy ΔE > both uncertainties.

Wait, but wait another thought: the energy difference is fixed, and the uncertainties are for each state. So if the energy difference is larger than the uncertainties, then the peaks (if we model them as Lorentzian lineshapes) won't overlap, and can be resolved.

So for two lines with widths (half-widths) Γ1 and Γ2, the condition for separation is that the distance between their centers is greater than the sum of their half-widths?

Wait, yes. Because if the lines are too close, their peaks would overlap. So the separation between centers should be greater than the sum of their half-widths.

Hmm, so perhaps I should think in terms of the sum of the uncertainties.

So for two states, the energy uncertainty for E1 is ΔE1 = ħ/τ1, and for E2 is ΔE2 = ħ/τ2.

The required condition for clear resolution is that the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 must be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Let's compute that.

ΔE1 is approx 6.55e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 6.55e-8 eV.

So sum is 6.55e-7 + 6.55e-8 = 7.205e-7 eV.

So ΔE must be greater than approximately 7.2e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV → 1e-4 eV is 1e-4, which is much larger than 7.2e-7. So that's okay.

Options A, B, D: Let's see.

Option D is 1e-8 eV. Which is smaller than 7.2e-7. So no.

Wait, but the numbers here seem way off. Let me recheck calculations.

Wait, let me compute the actual values accurately.

Compute ΔE1:

ℏ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s

τ1 = 1e-9 s → ΔE1 = ℏ/τ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J.

So ΔE1 = 1.0545718e-25 / 1.602176634e-19 ≈ (1.0545718 / 1.602176634) * 1e-6 eV.

1.0545718 / 1.602176634 ≈ 0.658.

So ΔE1 ≈ 0.658e-6 eV = 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ℏ/τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 1.0545718e-26 / 1.602176634e-19 = (1.0545718 / 1.602176634) * 1e-7 eV ≈ 0.658e-7 eV = 6.58e-8 eV.

So sum ΔE1 + ΔE2 = 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = 7.238e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than this sum, about 7.2e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → 1e-9 is less than 7.2e-7 → No.

B) 1e-11 eV → 0.00001e-6 → No.

C) 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV → 1e-4 eV is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 > 7.2e-7 → Yes.

Option C is way larger than required.

Option D is 1e-8 eV → 0.001e-7 eV → which is smaller than 7.2e-7 → No.

Wait, but 1e-8 is 0.01e-7, which is 0.01 times 1e-7. So 1e-8 is 0.01e-7, which is 1e-8. So that's much smaller than 7.2e-7.

So the only option that satisfies ΔE > sum is option C.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between the two states. So if their energy difference is, say, 1e-4 eV, which is way bigger than 7e-7 eV, then they can be resolved. So option C is the correct answer.

Wait, but another thought: maybe I'm confusing the energy-time uncertainty with the lifetime uncertainty. Because the energy uncertainty is for each state, but perhaps when you have two states, the combined uncertainty is the sum. So the required ΔE is greater than the sum of the individual uncertainties.

So the energy difference must be at least the sum of the two energy uncertainties.

In that case, the correct answer would be delta E > 7.2e-7 eV, and looking for an option that is larger than that.

The options are:

A) 1e-9 → 0.001e-6 → 1e-9 < 7.2e-7 → No.

B) 1e-11 → 0.00001e-6 → No.

C) 1e-4 → 0.0001 eV → which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 eV.

1e-4 eV is 1e-4, which is 0.1e-3 eV.

Wait, 7.2e-7 is 0.72e-6 eV, which is 0.00072 eV.

So 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV → wait no, 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV? Wait, 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV. Oh, wait that's 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV. But 7.2e-7 eV is 0.00000072 eV.

So 0.0001 eV is bigger than 0.00000072 eV. So yes, it's bigger.

So option C is the correct choice.

So the answer should be option C: 1e-4 eV.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \hbar
\]

Here, \( \Delta E \) is the energy uncertainty, \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). For each state, the energy uncertainty is approximately:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties for each state
- For the first state with lifetime \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}
  \]
  Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
  \]

- For the second state with lifetime \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
  \]
  Converting to electron volts:
  \[
  \Delta E_2 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the condition for resolving the energy levels
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) between \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) must be greater than the sum of their energy uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E > 6.58 \times 10^{-7} + 6.58 \times 10^{-8} = 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**
  \[
  10^{-9} \, \text{eV} < 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \quad \text{(Not sufficient)}
  \]

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**
  \[
  10^{-11} \, \text{eV} < 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \quad \text{(Not sufficient)}
  \]

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**
  \[
  10^{-4} \, \text{eV} > 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \quad \text{(Sufficient)}
  \]

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**
  \[
  10^{-8} \, \text{eV} < 7.238 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \quad \text{(Not sufficient)}
  \]

### Conclusion
The only option that satisfies the condition \( \Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \) is **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**.

Answer: C
