Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work it out.

So the setup: Two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. The planets have their own masses and radii. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses, radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses, radius 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which probably will matter for the temperature calculation.

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. So I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The formula I think is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ). But wait, since both planets have the same albedo, that factor (1 - albedo) will cancel out when taking the ratio. So I can probably ignore it for this problem.

So, the main variables are the distance of each planet from the star. How do I find the distance? Well, the question mentions the transit and radial velocity methods. The transit method gives the planet's radius relative to the star's radius. RV method gives the mass and the distance based on the Doppler shift, but I'm not sure exactly how.

Wait, the RV method gives the mass of the planet (via the Doppler shift, which depends on velocity and mass) and the distance affects the velocity. Oh right, the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us due to the planet's gravitational pull. The radial velocity amplitude K depends on the planet's mass, the distance between the star and planet (a), and the inclination of the orbit. But since both planets are detected using RV, I think we can assume the same inclination (probably edge-on for both, but maybe not). Wait, but the question doesn't specify, so perhaps I can proceed under the assumption that both have the same inclination, or maybe it's not needed.

Wait, the problem states that both planets are in circular orbits. So their orbits are circular, which simplifies things.

Now, the RV method gives us the velocity semi-amplitude K. K is related to the
