Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and which ones operators must respect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the Standard Model (SM) symmetries. So the operators in SMEFT should respect the same symmetries as the SM, right?

Wait, what are the symmetries of the Standard Model? I think the SM has Lorentz symmetry, which includes things like rotations and boosts. Then there's the Poincaré symmetry, which includes Lorentz plus translations. Oh wait, Poincaré is a bigger symmetry group because it includes translations, so if operators respect Poincaré, they automatically respect Lorentz. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

Wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so when you write down operators, they have to be renormalizable or beyond, but still, they must respect the underlying symmetries of the theory. So which symmetries are part of the SM?

I remember that the SM has the gauge symmetries (like SU(3), SU(2), U(1)), Lorentz symmetry, and also C, P, T symmetries—though not all together necessarily. Wait, the SM is CPT symmetric. Because CPT symmetry is a fundamental part of quantum field theory, right? The SM has CPT symmetry, which implies that if you have C, P, or T symmetry, you must have the others if you have one of them.

Wait, but does the SM respect CP symmetry? I think that the SM doesn't have a global CP symmetry because of things like CP violation in the CKM matrix. So some operators might violate CP, but I'm not sure how that affects SMEFT.

Wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. So which of these symmetries are absolutely necessary for all operators to preserve?

Let's look at the options:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: I think all operators must respect this because it's a part of the SM which SMEFT is built upon. So operators must be Lorentz invariant.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Hmm, Poincare includes translations (momentum conservation) and Lorentz. But in SMEFT, operators are classified based on their dimension and the fields they include. But do they have to respect Poincare? Well, the SM's Lagrangian is Poincare invariant, so I guess the operators in SMEFT must also be Poincare invariant, so option 2 is correct.

3. CP symmetry: Does SMEFT require all operators to have CP symmetry? I think no. Because some operators in SMEFT can violate CP. For example, the Wilson coefficients can be complex, leading to CP violation. So operators don't have to respect CP.

4. CPT symmetry: The SM is CPT symmetric. So I think operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry because the underlying theory (SM) is CPT symmetric. Because SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the SM, any operator in SMEFT must also obey the same CPT symmetry as the SM.

Wait,
