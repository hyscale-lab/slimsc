Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So the problem is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z for a given quantum state. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). 

Wait, I need to compute the uncertainty in P_z. I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So for P_z, it would be sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

But wait, the state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So I can't directly write ⟨P_z⟩ as the eigenvalue. I need to compute the expectation values ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ in this state.

First, let me write down the matrix form of P_z. The matrix is a 3x3 diagonal matrix because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. The given matrix for P_z has first row (ħ, 0, 0), second (0,0,0), and third (0,0,-ħ). So,

P_z = [ [ ħ, 0, 0 ],
         [ 0, 0, 0 ],
         [ 0, 0, -ħ ] ]

Wait no, wait. Wait, the matrix is as given:

P_z matrix is:

Row 1: (ħ, 0, 0)
Row 2: (0, 0, 0)
Row 3: (0, 0, -ħ)

So, the diagonal elements are ħ, 0, -ħ. So P_z is a diagonal operator.

The state is given as a column vector: |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

Wait, but quantum states are usually normalized. Let me check the normalization of this vector. The norm squared is ( (-1/2)^2 ) + ( (1/√2)^2 ) + ( (-1/2)^2 ). So that's (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4)= 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Oh, wait, 1/4 + 1/2 is 3/4, plus another 1/4 is 1. So it's correctly normalized. Okay, good.

Now, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I need to calculate ψ† P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, this is straightforward.

Each component of ψ is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z.

So, the components of ψ are: ψ₁ = -1/2, ψ₂ = 1/√2, ψ₃ = -1/2.

The diagonal elements of P_z are: p_z1 = ħ, p_z2 = 0, p_z3 = -ħ.

So, ⟨P_z⟩ = |ψ₁|² * p_z1 + |ψ₂|² * p_z2 + |ψ₃|² * p_z3.

Wait, no! Wait, no, that's for diagonal operators. Because the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities (|ψ_i|²) multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue.

So, let's compute each term:

|ψ₁|² = ( (-1/2)^2 ) = 1/4. Multiply by ħ: (1/4) ħ.

|ψ₂|² = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. Multiply by 0: 0.

|ψ₃|² = ( (-1/2)^2 ) = 1/4. Multiply by (-ħ): (1/4)(-ħ) = - ħ/4.

So summing up: (1/4) ħ + 0 + (-1/4) ħ = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is 0.

Hmm, okay. So the expectation of P_z is zero. Now I need to find ⟨P_z²⟩.

Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the squares of the diagonal elements. So P_z² is:

[ [ (ħ)^2, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, (-ħ)^2 ] ]

So the diagonal entries are ħ², 0, ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is again ψ† P_z² ψ.

So,

|ψ₁|² * (ħ²) + |ψ₂|² * 0 + |ψ₃|² * (ħ²).

Calculating each term:

(1/4) * ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)* ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So, ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/2) ħ².

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² ). Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, this simplifies to sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt(1/2) ħ = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So that should be the correct answer.

But wait, let me double-check my steps.

1. The state is correctly normalized. Yes, because sum of squares is 1.

2. Calculated ⟨P_z⟩ correctly? Yes. (1/4)*ħ + (1/4)*(-ħ) = 0.

3. Calculated ⟨P_z²⟩ correctly? Both ψ₁ and ψ₃ contribute 1/4 each to (ħ²), so 1/2 ħ². Correct.

So ΔP_z = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) ) = ħ / sqrt(2). Which is option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix for $P_z$ is diagonal:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = \sum_{i} |\psi_i|^2 P_z^{ii}.
\]

The components of $|\psi\rangle$ are $\psi_1 = -\frac{1}{2}$, $\psi_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, and $\psi_3 = -\frac{1}{2}$. The diagonal elements of $P_z$ are $P_z^{11} = \hbar$, $P_z^{22} = 0$, and $P_z^{33} = -\hbar$. Thus:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |\psi_1|^2 \cdot \hbar + |\psi_2|^2 \cdot 0 + |\psi_3|^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

The probabilities are $|\psi_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, $|\psi_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, and $|\psi_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$. Substituting:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$.

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z^2$ is the square of the diagonal elements of $P_z$:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = \sum_{i} |\psi_i|^2 (P_z^2)^{ii}.
\]

The diagonal elements of $P_z^2$ are $P_z^{11} = \hbar^2$, $P_z^{22} = 0$, and $P_z^{33} = \hbar^2$. Using the same probabilities as before:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |\psi_1|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |\psi_2|^2 \cdot 0 + |\psi_3|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$ and $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
