Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar and its spectrum, and I'm supposed to figure out the comoving distance based on some cosmological parameters. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but I'll try to work through it.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum, with flux dropping significantly below that. I remember that the peak wavelength of emission can be related to the redshift due to the expansion of the universe. Oh right, if the peak is at 790 nm, and if it's emitted at a certain wavelength, say in the optical, then the shift tells us about the redshift.

Wait, but wait. Do I know what the rest wavelength of this peak is? The question doesn't specify, but maybe I can assume it's from a particular emission line. Wait, think about it: in galaxies, the Balmer break is around 400 nm (violet end of visible light), but that's for star formation. Quasars are powered by supermassive black holes and might have strong emission lines. Hmm, but without knowing the rest wavelength, maybe I can't get the redshift directly. Wait, perhaps the peak is the Lyman-alpha line? No, Lyman-alpha is at 121 nm, which is UV. But the peak here is in the near infrared, which is longer than 700 nm. Oh wait, that might be the Balmer series. The Balmer-alpha line is hydrogen's emission line in the optical, at about 656 nm (red). So if the observed peak is at 790 nm, that's longer than 656, so perhaps it's a redshifted Balmer line.

So let's model this. Let me denote the observed wavelength as λ_obs, which is 790 nm. The rest wavelength λ_rest would be, say, 656 nm (assuming it's the Balmer-alpha line). Then the redshift z is given by (λ_obs - λ_rest) / λ_rest → z = (790 - 656)/656. Let me calculate that.

790 - 656 is 134. 134 divided by 656 is approximately 0.204. So z is about 0.204. That's a
