Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through step by step. The goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence will give the desired product in high yield.

First, let's figure out what the target molecule looks like. The substituents on the benzene ring are:

- At position 1: ethoxy group (OCH2CH3)
- At position 2: tert-butyl group (C(CH2CH3)3)
- At position 3: nitro group (NO2)

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering might be a bit tricky. Let me think about the positions. If it's 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, and 3-nitro, then the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions, meaning they are adjacent to each other in a meta arrangement? Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, in benzene, positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent, so the substituents are in a sort of sequential manner.

But maybe it's easier to think about how to introduce these groups in the right order. Since the substituents are in different positions, the order in which we add them will affect the final structure due to directing effects of the groups.

I remember that substituents on benzene can be either activating or deactivating, and they direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions. For example, nitro groups are strong deactivating and meta-directing. Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Tert-butyl is a bulky, deactivating (due to being an alkyl group which is actually activating but in this case, maybe it's a bulky group affecting where substitution occurs? Wait, no. Alkyl groups are activating, but they are ortho/para directors. Wait, but tert-butyl is a bulky substituent, so in some cases, it might favor para substitution because it's harder to fit in the ortho position due to steric hindrance
