Okay, so I've got this question about ChIP-seq results and why some peaks disappear when using a different fixation method. Hmm, I remember that ChIP-seq is used to find where transcription factors bind on the DNA. The question mentions PFA-fixed samples and then using PFA+DSG. I think PFA is paraformaldehyde, which is a fixative that cross-links proteins and DNA. But wait, why would they use DSG too? Oh right, DSG is a reducing agent, I think it's used to break disulfide bonds, which are strong bonds between proteins. So adding DSG after PFA probably makes the cross-linking more efficient by breaking some of the protein-protein interactions, allowing the antibodies to bind better.

Wait, but the peaks disappeared when using PFA+DSG. So maybe the initial PFA fixation without DSG wasn't enough, and the DSG in the second case helped in some way. Or perhaps the oppositeâ€”without DSG, certain regions were not properly cross-linked, leading to peaks that shouldn't be there. Or maybe the DSG treatment affects DNA accessibility or the binding sites.

I recall that PFA cross-links DNA and proteins, but it might not permeate the cells easily, so sometimes people use DSG to enhance the cross-linking. Oh wait, but I'm a bit confused. Another point is that without DSG, maybe some of the cross-links are incomplete. Or perhaps the DSG treatment is actually a problem because it might break some cross-links in a way that certain regions aren't preserved.

Wait, the question says when PFA+DSG was used, the peaks disappeared. So the initial PFA-only fixations had peaks, but PFA+DSG didn't. That's odd. Why would that happen?

I think DSG is used in some protocols to reduce the proteins after formaldehyde cross-linking. Formaldehyde cross-links DNA and proteins, but proteins are in a more open conformation when treated with a reducing agent like DSG. This helps the antibody access the epitopes better. So maybe in the first case, without DSG, the cross-linked proteins are more aggregated or the epitope is not available, leading to lower signal
