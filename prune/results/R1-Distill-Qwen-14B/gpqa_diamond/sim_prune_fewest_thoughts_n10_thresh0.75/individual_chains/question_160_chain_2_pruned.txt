Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength Î» is shining along the z-axis, and we're supposed to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N is infinitely large. Hmm, that sounds a lot like diffraction, probably using the Fraunhofer diffraction concept.

Wait, the question says N is infinitely large. Oh right, when the number of sides becomes very large, the polygon approximates a circle. So in that case, the problem simplifies to a circular aperture, right? Because a polygon with infinite sides would be a circle. But wait, the apothems are all the same length. The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, which for a regular polygon is also the radius of the inscribed circle. So if the apothem is 'a', then for an infinitely large N (so a circle), the radius would be 'a'? Or wait, no. Wait, for a regular polygon, the apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle. So when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle of radius 'a'. So the radius of the circular aperture is 'a'.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes the radius of the circle is called the 'radius' and the apothem is the same as the radius for a regular polygon. Oh, right, for a regular polygon with infinitely many sides, the apothem is the same
