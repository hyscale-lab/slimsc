Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. But I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about finding the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of steps. I need to figure out which sequence of reactions leads to the desired product with high yield.

First, I should draw the target molecule to visualize it better. The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So benzene ring with substituents: at position 1 (ortho to position 2?), wait wait. Let me think about the numbering. Wait, in benzene, numbering starts at a substituent. Wait, so the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So the positions are:

1: ethoxy group
2: tert-butyl group
3: nitro group

Wait, no. Let me think again. The formula is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, which implies the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So the benzene ring has substituents in the 1, 2, and 3 positions. So they are all adjacent to each other? Wait, because 1, 2, and 3 are consecutive. So the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions, making a meta arrangement? Or wait, perhaps I should imagine the benzene as a hexagon. Let me number the positions: 1, 2, and 3 would be adjacent.

Wait, perhaps it's better to sketch it mentally. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Let's fix the ethoxy group at position 1. Then the next position is 2, which is ortho to 1. So position 2 has tert-butyl, and position 3, which is meta to position 1 and ortho to 2, has nitro. So the substituents are
