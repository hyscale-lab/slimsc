Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out what the product is after a Cope rearrangement. The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break this down.

First, I need to recall what a Cope rearrangement does. From what I remember, the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement that typically occurs in 1,5-dienes. It forms a new six-membered ring, right? The reaction usually results in a shift of the double bond from the 1,5 positions to new positions in the ring. Wait, but wait, in this case, the starting material isn't a diene. Oh, wait, no, 2-vinyl means there's a vinyl group attached at position 2. So maybe the structure has conjugated double bonds that can form a diene after some rearrangement.

Let me try to draw the structure of 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is like a norbornane structure. So the azabicyclo would have a nitrogen in one of the bridge positions. Let me think: the numbering for bicyclo systems is a bit tricky. So the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has two bridges: one with two carbons, another with two, and the last with one. The numbering starts at one bridgehead, then goes around.

So the compound is 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Wait, that's position 2 has a nitrogen, and there's a double bond at position 5. Then, the 2-vinyl substituentâ€”so a vinyl group attached to the same carbon as the nitrogen. So the structure would have a bicyclic system, with a nitrogen at position 2, a double bond between 5 and 6 (maybe?), and a vinyl group (CH2-CH2?) attached to position 2. Or wait, maybe the structure is more like a bridge with the nitrogen at position 2, and the vinyl group attached to it.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that
