Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals and their angular momentum. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step.

The problem says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l. For a p orbital, l is 1. So both l₁ and l₂ are 1.

They're talking about the coupled angular momentum state, which is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh right, when you couple two angular momenta, the total angular momentum quantum number l is the sum of the individual l's for the maximum case, but wait, no, I think that's when they are in the same direction. Wait, the maximum possible l is l₁ + l₂, right? So here, l is 2, which makes sense because 1 + 1 = 2. So that means the two electrons' angular momenta are aligned in the same direction, adding up to l=2.

The state is |1,1,2,-1>. So the m value here is -1. Wait, m is the projection of the total angular momentum onto the z-axis. So each electron has m₁ and m₂, and the total m is m₁ + m₂.

But the question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L₁z and L₂z. I need to find the joint probability of both measurements being -ħ.

Wait, each electron's orbital angular momentum is described by Lz for each. For a p orbital, l=1, so the possible m values (or eigenvalues of Lz) are -1, 0, +1, multiplied by ħ. So each Lz can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ.

In the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, what do the individual m₁ and m₂ look like? Because the total m is m₁ + m₂ = -1. And each m₁ and m₂ can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but the possible combinations that sum to -1 would be:

m₁ = 0, m₂ = -1 → sum is -1.

m₁ = -1, m₂ = 0 → sum is -1.

But wait, can
