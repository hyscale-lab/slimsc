Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I need to figure out the orbital period ratio between Planet3 and Planet1. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were found using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. But I'm not too sure; maybe that's not super relevant right now.

The problem gives me some ratios. The equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. And between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3. So, the ratio T1/T2 is 1.4, and T2/T3 is 2.3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the way ratios are given is a bit tricky. The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. So that means T1 is 1.4 times T2? Or is it the other way around? Hmm, equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. The formula I remember is T = [(L/(16πσ d²)) (1 - a)]^0.25, where a is albedo. Since all albedos are 0.3, that's the same for all. So the temperature is proportional to (L/(d²))^0.25.

Wait, but I think in this problem, since all planets are around the same star, L is the same. So T is proportional to (1/d)^0.5. Because (d^2) in the denominator, take the square root, then the 0.25 power gives 1/d^0.5.

So if the ratio of T1 to T2 is 1.4, then T1 = 1.4 T2. But since T is inversely proportional to sqrt(d), then the distances are inversely proportional to T squared. Let me think again. Let's suppose T1 / T2 = 1.4. Since T is proportional to (1/d)^0.5, then (1/d1^0.5)/(1/d2^0.5) = 1.4.

Which is (d2/d1)^0.5 = 1.4. So d2/d1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So d2 is about 1.96 times d1. So Planet2 is farther from the star than Planet1. Wait, but wait a second. Because if a planet is farther, d increases, so its temperature should be lower. But T1 is higher than T2 (since 1.4 is T1 over T2), meaning Planet1 is hotter, so it must be closer. So that makes sense.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3, right? Because the ratio of Planet2 to Planet3 is 2.3. So T2 = 2.3 T3. So since T is inversely proportional to sqrt(d), then (1/d2^0.5)/(1/d3^0.5) = 2.3.

Which gives d3/d2 = (2.3)^2. Let me compute that. 2.3 squared is 5.29. So d3 = 5.29 * d2.

Wait, but earlier we found that d2 is 1.96*d1. So substituting, d3 = 5.29 * 1.96 * d1. Let me calculate that. 5.29 multiplied by 1.96. Hmm, 5 * 1.96 is 9
