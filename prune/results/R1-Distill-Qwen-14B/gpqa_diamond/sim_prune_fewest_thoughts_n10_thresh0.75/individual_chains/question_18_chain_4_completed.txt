Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll think it through step by step.

So, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. We have their masses and some elemental abundance ratios. Hmm, I remember that the [X/Y] notation is a logarithmic scale. The subscript probably indicates which star we're looking at.

Wait, the given data includes [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. That means the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is higher than in the Sun by a factor of 10^0.3. Similarly, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3, so Mg is more abundant relative to Si in Star_2 compared to the Sun.

Also, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so Fe is the same as H in Star_1 as in the Sun. Same with [Mg/H]_2 being 0: Mg is same as H in Star_2 as in the Sun.

The Sun's photosphere has 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So, log10(nFe/nH) is 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg, it's 7. So log10(nMg/nH) = -5. So nMg/nH is 10^-5.

Wait, I think the formula for [X/Y] is log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So [X/Y] = log10( (nX/nY) / (nX,nY_sun) )

Wait, let me get that right. The [X/Y] is defined as log (nX/nY) - log (nX/nY)_sun. So that's log(nX/nY / (nX_sun/nY_sun) ) = log( (nX/nY) * (nY_sun/nX_sun) )).

Hmm. Alternatively, [X/Y] = log (nX/nY) - log (nX_sun/nY_sun) = log( (nX/nY) / (nX_sun/nY_sun) ) = log( (nX * nY_sun) / (nY * nX_sun) )

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of each element's abundance relative to hydrogen.

So for each star, we can express [Si/Fe], [Mg/Si], and such in terms of their abundances relative to H and each other.

Let me get the given data:

Star_1:
Mass = 1.5 solar masses.
[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 --> log(Si/Fe) - log(Si/Fe)_sun = 0.3
[Fe/H]_1 = 0 --> log(Fe/H) - log(Fe/H)_sun = 0. So Fe/H in Star_1 is same as Sun.

Star_2:
Mass = 1.2 solar masses.
[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 --> log(Mg/Si) - log(Mg/Si)_sun = 0.3
[Mg/H]_2 = 0 --> log(Mg/H) - log(Mg/H)_sun = 0. So Mg/H in Star_2 is same as Sun.

We need to find the ratio (nSi_1 / nSi_2). So, [Si]_1 / [Si]_2.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, (nSi_1) / (nSi_2) = ?

To find that, perhaps I should express nSi in each star relative to H, and then take the ratio.

Alternatively, express the abundance of Si in each star relative to the Sun, and then compute the ratio.

So, let's see.

First, for Star_1:

Given [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So Fe/H ratio is same as Sun.

Sun has [Fe/H]_sun = log(nFe_sun / nH_sun) - 12 = 7.5. Wait no, wait. Wait, the given data says for the Sun, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) for the Sun. Similarly, for Mg, log10(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5. So nMg/nH =10^(-5) for the Sun.

Wait, maybe I should compute the abundance of each element in each star.

Let me start with Star_1.

Star_1:
[Fe/H]_1 = 0 --> log( (nFe_1 / nH_1) / (nFe_sun / nH_sun) ) ) =0.

So (nFe_1/nH_1) = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * 10^0 = (10^-4.5) *1 = 1e-4.5.

So nFe_1/nH_1 = 1e-4.5.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 --> log( (nSi_1/nFe_1) / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) )=0.3.

So (nSi_1/nFe_1) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

What's (nSi_sun/nFe_sun)?

We have nFe_sun =1e-4.5 (from Sun's data: log(nFe/nH) = -4.5). For nSi_sun, we need to find.

Wait, the Sun's data gives nFe and nMg relative to H. But Si isn't given. Hmm, maybe I need to find nSi_sun in terms of H.

Wait, the problem doesn't provide the solar abundance of Si. Hmm, maybe I can express it in terms of Mg and Si, using the [Mg/Si] ratio.

Wait, for the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun = log10(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) - log10(nMg_sun/nSi_sun)_sun. Wait, no, the [X/Y] is defined as log10( (nX/nY) / (nX/nY)_sun ). So [X/Y]_star = log( (nX/nY)_star / (nX/nY)_sun )

Wait, so for the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun would be log10( (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) / (nMg_sun /nSi_sun )) ) = 0. So that's just zero.

But perhaps the given data for the stars uses the Sun's [Mg/Si] as a reference. Wait, but the question doesn't give the Sun's [Mg/Si], but the stars have their own. So maybe I can express the solar [Mg/Si] as a ratio.

Wait, in the Sun, nMg/nH = 1e-5, and nFe/nH =1e-4.5.

But we don't know nSi/nH. Hmm, unless we can derive it from the [Mg/Si] ratio.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the Sun's [Mg/Si], but for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3. Hmm, perhaps I need to proceed without the exact solar Si, but express ratios using the given data.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratios of elements in each star relative to the Sun.

Let's tackle Star_1 first.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 = 0, so Fe/H in Star_1 is same as Sun.

[Fe/H]_1 =0 = log( (Fe_1/H_1) / (Fe_sun/H_sun) )

So Fe_1/H_1 = Fe_sun/H_sun * 10^0 = Fe_sun/H_sun.

So, Fe_1 = Fe_sun * (H_1/H_sun).

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3.

So [Si/Fe]_1 = log( (Si_1/Fe_1)/(Si_sun/Fe_sun) ) =0.3.

So, (Si_1/Fe_1) = (Si_sun/Fe_sun) *10^0.3.

But, from Fe_1 = Fe_sun * (H_1/H_sun), so Fe_1/Fe_sun = H_1/H_sun.

So, Si_1 = Fe_1 * (Si_sun/Fe_sun) *10^0.3.

Wait, let me write that again.

(Si_1/Fe_1) = (Si_sun/Fe_sun) *10^0.3.

But Fe_1 = Fe_sun * (H_1/H_sun) * (Fe_sun/Fe_sun) )? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, let's express Si_1 in terms of H.

We know Fe_1 = Fe_sun * (H_1/H_sun) because Fe/H is same.

So, Fe_1 = (Fe_sun / H_sun) * H_1.

Then, Si_1 = Fe_1 * (Si_1/Fe_1) = Fe_1 * (Si_sun/Fe_sun) *10^0.3.

Substituting Fe_1, we get:

Si_1 = (Fe_sun / H_sun) * H_1 * (Si_sun/Fe_sun) *10^0.3.

Simplify: Fe_sun cancels, so (H_1 * Si_sun) / H_sun *10^0.3.

So, Si_1 = (H_1/H_sun) * Si_sun *10^0.3.

But H_1 is the number of H atoms in Star_1, and Si_1 is the corresponding Si.

So, the ratio of Si_1 relative to H in Star_1 is (Si_1/H_1) = (Si_sun / H_sun) *10^0.3.

Wait, because:

(Si_1 / H_1) = (Si_1) / H_1 = [ (H_1 / H_sun) * Si_sun *10^0.3 ) ] / H_1 = (1/H_sun) * Si_sun *10^0.3.

Which is (Si_sun / H_sun) *10^0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 = log(Si_1/H_1) - log(Si_sun/H_sun) ) = log(10^0.3) ) =0.3.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Si/H] as [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H], since [Si/H] = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H].

Yes, that's a useful relation. Because [X/Y] + [Y/Z] = [X/Z].

So, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, and [Fe/H]_1 is 0.

So, [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 +0=0.3.

So, the abundance of Si relative to H in Star_1 is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun.

Which means, (nSi_1 / nH_1) = (nSi_sun / nH_sun) *10^0.3.

Because [Si/H] = log(nSi/nH) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) = 0.3.

So, nSi_1/nH_1 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2.

Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2 =0. So [Mg/H]_2 = log( (Mg_2/H_2)/(Mg_sun/H_sun) ) =0. So Mg_2/H_2 = Mg_sun/H_sun.

So, Mg_2 = Mg_sun * (H_2/H_sun) * (H_sun / H_sun) )? Well, I think it's Mg_2 = Mg_sun * (H_2 / H_sun) ).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think as (Mg_2 / H_2) = (Mg_sun / H_sun) *10^0 = same as Sun.

So, Mg_2 = (Mg_sun / H_sun) * H_2.

Then, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3.

So, [Mg/Si]_2 = log( (Mg_2/Si_2)/(Mg_sun/Si_sun) ) )=0.3.

So, (Mg_2/Si_2) = (Mg_sun/Si_sun) *10^0.3.

But since Mg_2 = (Mg_sun / H_sun) * H_2.

So, Mg_2 = (Mg_sun / H_sun) * H_2.

Substituting into Mg_2/Si_2 = (Mg_sun/Si_sun) *10^0.3.

=> [ (Mg_sun/H_sun) * H_2 ] / Si_2 = (Mg_sun/Si_sun) *10^0.3.

Multiply both sides by Si_2:

(Mg_sun/H_sun) * H_2 = (Mg_sun/Si_sun) *10^0.3 * Si_2.

Divide both sides by Mg_sun:

(1/H_sun) * H_2 = (1/Si_sun) *10^0.3 * Si_2.

Multiply both sides by H_sun * Si_sun:

H_2 * Si_sun = H_sun * 10^0.3 * Si_2.

Solve for Si_2:

Si_2 = (H_2 * Si_sun ) / ( H_sun * 10^0.3 )

= (H_2 / H_sun) * (Si_sun / 10^0.3 )

But (H_2 / H_sun) is (H_2 / H_sun) = (nH_2 / nH_sun ) ? Or is it the ratio in terms of number of atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps considering H_2 is the number of H atoms in Star_2, and H_sun is the number in the Sun.

So, (H_2 / H_sun) = (nH_2 / nH_sun ) = (nH_2 / nH_sun ) = (H_2 / H_sun ) = same as the H abundance ratio.

Wait, let's think in terms of ratios.

We can express Si_2 as:

Si_2 = (H_2 / H_sun) * (Si_sun /10^0.3) )

But from earlier, H_2 / H_sun is Mg_2 / Mg_sun. Because for Star_2, Mg_2 = Mg_sun * (H_2 / H_sun ), since [Mg/H]_2=0.

So, Mg_2/H_2 = Mg_sun/H_sun → H_2 = (Mg_2 * H_sun ) / Mg_sun.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Another approach: express each element's abundance relative to H in each star, then find the ratio of Si.

So for Star_1:

[Si/H]_1 =0.3.

For Star_2, let's find [Si/H]_2.

We have [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2=0. So, [Mg/H]_2= [Mg/Si]_2 + [Si/H]_2.

Wait, no: [Mg/H] = [Mg/Si] + [Si/H].

So,

0 = 0.3 + [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_2 is -0.3, meaning Si is 0.3 dex less abundant relative to H than the Sun.

So, nSi_2/nH_2 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *10^(-0.3).

Now, we need the ratio (nSi_1 / nSi_2).

(nSi_1 / nSi_2 ) = [ (nSi_1 / nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 / nH_2 ) ] * (nH_2 / nH_1 ).

Because, (nSi_1 / nSi_2 ) = (nSi_1/nH_1 ) * (nH_1/nH_2 ) * (nH_2/nSi_2 ) )

Wait, perhaps better to write:

nSi_1 / nSi_2 = (nSi_1/nH_1 ) * (nH_1/nH_2 ) * (nH_2/nSi_2 )

Which is (nSi_1/nH_1 ) / (nSi_2/nH_2 ) * (nH_2/nH_1 ).

Wait, no. Let me think again.

nSi_1 / nSi_2 = (nSi_1 / nH_1) * (nH_1 / nH_2) * (nH_2 / nSi_2 )

Which is (nSi_1/nH_1 ) * (nH_1/nH_2 ) * (nH_2 / nSi_2 )

= [ (nSi_1/nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 ) ] * (nH_2 / nH_1 )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express each star's Si abundance relative to H, then take the ratio and see how H varies.

Wait, but the ratio of silicon between the two stars is (nSi_1 / nSi_2) = (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2 ) * (nH_1 / nH_2 )

But that's complicated because we don't know the ratio of H in each star.

Hmm, maybe I should consider that the stars have the same mass as the Sun, but wait no: Star_1 is 1.5 solar masses, Star_2 is 1.2.

Wait, but the problem states to assume LTE and use the EW method, which I think is about measuring equivalent widths. But I'm not sure if the masses are relevant here. Because the EW method gives abundance ratios, but the actual number of atoms would depend on the star's overall composition and perhaps its size or mass.

Wait, but maybe the abundance is given as number densities, so the ratio would be the same regardless of the star's mass. Or perhaps the mass is a distractor here.

Wait, the problem is about the photospheric composition, which I think refers to the number densities, so the mass might not affect the ratio of elements in the photosphere. Because the abundance is about the ratio of elements, not the total number.

So perhaps the mass can be ignored, and we can proceed with the given abundance ratios.

So, let's proceed with the [Si/H] values.

For Star_1, [Si/H]_1=0.3 → (nSi_1/nH_1) = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) * 10^0.3.

For Star_2, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 → (nSi_2/nH_2) = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *10^-0.3.

So, the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2) = [ (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) ) ] * (nH_2 /nH_1 )

But we don't know (nH_1 /nH_2 ), which is the ratio of hydrogen in the two stars.

Wait, but perhaps the stars have the same number of hydrogen atoms? No, that's not necessarily the case. Each star's photosphere could have varying amounts of hydrogen, depending on their composition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the total number of atoms is the same, but that's unlikely given their masses.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the ratio of Si in each star is (nSi_1/nSi_2) = (nSi_1/nH_1) * (nH_1/nH_2) * (nH_2/nSi_2 )

But I don't have the ratio of nH_1 and nH_2.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't require that because the ratio is relative to H in each star, but we're to find the ratio of Si atoms, regardless of H. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of Si is simply (nSi_1 /nSi_2) = [ (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) ) ] * (nH_2 /nH_1 )

But I don't know nH_1 /nH_2.

Wait, but perhaps the ratio of H in each star can be found from other given data.

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So (Fe_1/H_1) = (Fe_sun/H_sun).

Which implies that Fe_1 = Fe_sun * (H_1/H_sun).

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0. So Mg_2 = Mg_sun * (H_2/H_sun).

But how does that help us find H_1 and H_2?

Wait, perhaps the mass of the star relates to the total number of atoms, but that's more about the overall scale of the star than the photospheric composition.

Alternatively, perhaps the H content isn't needed because when taking the ratio of the two stars, the H cancels out somehow.

Wait, let's think again. The problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, nSi_1 /nSi_2.

Each star's photosphere has its own abundance ratios. So, for Star_1, nSi_1 = (nSi_sun ) *10^0.3 * (nH_1 /nH_sun )

Similarly, Star_2: nSi_2 = nSi_sun *10^-0.3 * (nH_2 /nH_sun )

So, the ratio is:

(nSi_1 /nSi_2 ) = [10^0.3 * (nH_1 /nH_sun ) ] / [10^-0.3 * (nH_2 /nH_sun ) ]

Simplify:

= (10^0.3 /10^-0.3 ) * (nH_1 /nH_2 )

= 10^(0.6) * (nH_1 /nH_2 )

10^0.6 is about 3.98, approximately 4.

So, the ratio becomes 4 * (nH_1 /nH_2 )

But we don't know (nH_1 /nH_2 ). Hmm, but perhaps we can find it from the given data.

Wait, for Star_1, we know [Fe/H]_1=0, which implies Fe_1 = Fe_sun * (H_1 / H_sun )

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → Mg_2 = Mg_sun * (H_2 / H_sun )

But how can we relate H_1 and H_2?

Wait, perhaps the masses of the stars are given. Star_1 is 1.5 solar masses, Star_2 is 1.2.

But how does that relate to the number of atoms? Well, the mass would be the sum of the masses of all the atoms. But if the stars have different compositions, the actual number of H atoms would depend on their composition.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is a distractor, and we can proceed assuming that the H in each star's photosphere is the same as the Sun's. But that can't be right because [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So, their H is scaled based on their Fe.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of mass fractions. Because mass fraction X is X = (n_i * m_i) / (total mass), where m_i is the mass per atom of element i.

Wait, but this might complicate things, but perhaps it's necessary.

Let me denote X as the mass fraction.

For the Sun, the mass fraction of Fe is X_Fe_sun = n_Fe_sun * m_Fe / (n_Fe_sun * m_Fe + n_H_sun * m_H + ... )

Similarly for Mg and Si.

But without knowing the exact mass fractions of each element, this might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the mass of the star doesn't affect the ratio of elements in the photosphere. Or perhaps, because we're considering the photospheric composition, which is given in terms of number densities, the ratio of elements would be independent of the star's mass.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that the number of H atoms in each star's photosphere is the same as the Sun's. But that's not correct because [Fe/H]_1 is 0.

Wait, [Fe/H]_1=0 implies that the number of Fe atoms relative to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. So Fe_1 = Fe_sun * (H_1 / H_sun )

Similarly, Star_2's Mg is same as Sun's: Mg_2 = Mg_sun * (H_2 / H_sun )

So, let's consider the number of H atoms in each star.

But without knowing the total number of atoms in each star, I'm not sure. Perhaps it's better to find the ratio of H_1 to H_2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's possible to find the ratio (H_1 / H_2 ) from other given data, but I'm not seeing it right now.

Wait, wait! Maybe I can express H_1 and H_2 in terms of the given data.

From Star_1: [Fe/H]_1=0 → Fe_1 = Fe_sun * (H_1 / H_sun )

From Star_2: [Mg/H]_2=0 → Mg_2 = Mg_sun * (H_2 / H_sun )

But without knowing the Fe and Mg in each star, how can I relate H_1 and H_2?

Alternatively, perhaps the stars have the same mass as the Sun, but no, the problem states that Star_1 is 1.5 solar masses and Star_2 is 1.2.

Wait, but mass is the sum of all the atoms, each multiplied by their mass. So for Star_1, the total mass M1 = 1.5 * M_sun.

M1 = sum (n_i * m_i ) for all elements i.

But without knowing the composition, this seems difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the H ratio can be determined from the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] values.

Wait, perhaps we can think about the ratio of H in each star relative to the Sun.

For Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → Fe_1 = Fe_sun * (H_1 / H_sun )

Similarly, for Star_2, Mg_2 = Mg_sun * (H_2 / H_sun )

But I don't see a direct connection between H_1 and H_2.

Wait, perhaps I can express the ratio (H_1 / H_2 ) as (Fe_1 / Fe_sun ) * (H_sun / H_1 ) → no, that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the number of H atoms is the same in both stars as in the Sun. But that would only be true if [H/Fe] is zero, which isn't the case here.

Wait, maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the ratio (H_1 / H_2 ) is 1, i.e., same number of H atoms as the Sun. But that can't be right because Star_1's Fe is same as Sun's, which would imply H_1 is same as H_sun.

Wait, no. Because [Fe/H]_1=0 means (Fe_1/H_1) = (Fe_sun/H_sun ), so if H_1 is same as H_sun, then Fe_1 is same as Fe_sun. But Star_1 has a higher mass, so perhaps that's not the case.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should make an assumption that the problem expects us to ignore the H ratio and just compute the ratio based on the [Si/H] values.

So, from earlier:

nSi_1/nH_1 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *10^0.3.

nSi_2/nH_2 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *10^-0.3.

So, the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2 ) = (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2 ) * (nH_2 /nH_1 )

But without knowing (nH_2 /nH_1 ), I can't find this ratio.

Wait, maybe the problem assumes that the number of H atoms is the same in both stars, which would make the ratio (nH_2 /nH_1 ) =1. But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of H in each star is 1, so their H is same as Sun.

But I'm not confident about this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the H ratio cancels out, but I'm not seeing how.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem doesn't require knowing the H ratio because the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms, which can be found from the two [Si/H] values.

Wait, the ratio of Si in the two stars is (nSi_1 /nSi_2 ) = (nSi_1/nH_1 ) * (nH_1/nH_2 ) * (nH_2/nSi_2 )

Wait, let me reorganize:

(nSi_1/nSi_2 ) = [ (nSi_1/nH_1 ) / (nSi_2/nH_2 ) ] * (nH_2/nH_1 )

= [ (10^0.3) / (10^-0.3) ) ] * (nH_2/nH_1 )

= 10^(0.6) * (nH_2/nH_1 )

= 10^0.6 * (nH_2/nH_1 )

But 10^0.6 is about 3.98, so approximately 4.

So, the ratio is 4 * (nH_2/nH_1 )

But I don't know (nH_2/nH_1 ) → the ratio of hydrogen in Star_2 to Star_1.

Wait, but is there any way to find this from the given data?

Wait, perhaps using the fact that [Fe/H]_1=0 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

For Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → Fe_1 = Fe_sun * (H_1 / H_sun )

Similarly, Star_2: [Mg/H]_2=0 → Mg_2 = Mg_sun * (H_2 / H_sun )

But how does that relate H_1 and H_2?

Another approach: perhaps express the ratio of H in the two stars, H_1 and H_2, in terms of their other elements.

Wait, for Star_1, the total mass is 1.5 solar masses.

But the mass is the sum of the masses of all atoms, which is sum (n_i * m_i ), where m_i is the mass per atom for element i.

But without knowing the composition, this is hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the H is the same in both stars, which would make (nH_2/nH_1 )=1, but I don't think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't require knowing the H ratio and the answer is simply 10^0.6 = ~3.98, so option A is ~3.9.

Looking at the options:

A) ~3.9

B) ~12.6

C) ~0.8

D) ~1.2

So, if the ratio is 4, then option A is correct.

But how can I be sure that (nH_2/nH_1 ) is 1?

Wait, perhaps because in Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0, which implies that Fe_1/H_1 = Fe_sun/H_sun → Fe_1 = Fe_sun * (H_1 / H_sun )

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → Mg_2 = Mg_sun * (H_2 / H_sun )

So, the number of H atoms in each star is proportional to the number of Fe and Mg atoms, respectively.

But without knowing the total number of Fe and Mg, it's hard to relate H_1 and H_2.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative abundances of Fe and Mg are the same as the Sun, but I don't think that's given.

Wait, perhaps the H ratio can be found using the mass of the star and the average mass of the elements.

But this seems complicated. Maybe the problem expects us to ignore the H ratio and just compute the ratio based on [Si/H]_1 vs [Si/H]_2.

In that case, the ratio would be 10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) )= 10^0.6 ≈3.98, so option A.

But I'm not entirely confident, but given the options, that seems to fit.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given abundance data and compute the ratio of their silicon abundances relative to hydrogen ([Si/H]).

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
   - [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3 dex

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex
   - [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + [Mg/H]_2 = 0.3 + 0 = -0.3 dex

### Silicon Abundance Ratios:
The abundance of silicon relative to hydrogen in each star is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}} = \left(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}\right)_{\odot} \cdot 10^{\text{[Si/H]}}
\]
Thus:
- For Star_1:  
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}} = \left(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}\right)_{\odot} \cdot 10^{0.3}
  \]
- For Star_2:  
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} = \left(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}\right)_{\odot} \cdot 10^{-0.3}
  \]

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}}{\frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}
\]
Substituting the expressions for \(\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}\) and \(\frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}}\):
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}\right)_{\odot} \cdot 10^{0.3}}{\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}\right)_{\odot} \cdot 10^{-0.3}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}
\]
Simplify:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}
\]
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.6} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}
\]
Since \(10^{0.6} \approx 3.98\), the ratio depends on \(\frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}\). Assuming the problem does not require detailed knowledge of the hydrogen ratio, we approximate \(\frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}} = 1\), leading to:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} \approx 3.98
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
