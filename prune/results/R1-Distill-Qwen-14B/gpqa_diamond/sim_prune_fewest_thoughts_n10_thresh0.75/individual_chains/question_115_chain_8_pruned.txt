Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again carefully.

Alright, the setup is about an electron and a positron moving towards each other. The electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. The positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. When they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. The photons have the same energy and their directions are measured. One is moving in the upper-right direction, and the other in the lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.

Hmm, okay, I remember that when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they produce photons. Since energy and momentum must be conserved, the photons' energies and directions must sum up to match the initial conditions.

Wait, the electron and positron are moving towards each other. So their velocities are opposite. Let me think about their momentum. The Lorentz factor is gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)). So for the electron, gamma is 4, and for the positron, gamma is 2.

But wait, since positrons are the antimatter counterpart of electrons, their rest mass is the same as electrons. So the rest mass energy is same for both. Let me think about their rest masses. The rest mass energy of an electron (or positron) is about 0.511 MeV. But maybe I don't need the exact numbers here.

Since the electron is moving from the left, its velocity is positive (assuming horizontal axis is x). The positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is negative, but wait, Lorentz factors are always positive, so maybe I should consider their directions.

Wait, the electron has a gamma of 4, so its momentum is gamma*m*v, and the positron has gamma 2, so its momentum is gamma*m*v too, but in opposite direction. Wait, but since they're moving towards each other, their momenta are opposite in direction.

So let's model this. Let's set up a coordinate system where the electron is moving along the positive x-axis, and the positron is moving along the negative x-axis.

So the initial four-momentum of the system is the sum of the
