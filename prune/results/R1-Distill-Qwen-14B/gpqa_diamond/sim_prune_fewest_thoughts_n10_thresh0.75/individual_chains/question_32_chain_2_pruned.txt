Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. It’s about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium. So Li-6 maybe? Because lithium typically has 3 protons, and if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6. Oh right, because the atomic number is 3 for lithium, and the mass number is 3 +3 =6.

So the question is asking for the energy of the RHIC. The options are A to D, and I need to calculate which one is correct. The speed is given as 0.96c, which is pretty high, so relativistic effects are definitely in play here.

I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, the energy isn't just the classical kinetic energy. You have to use the relativistic formulas. The total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, right? Gamma equals 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So v is 0.96c, so let me plug that in.

Wait, but what's the rest mass of this nucleus? I know that the rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass would be 3*(proton mass + neutron mass). Let me calculate that.

Proton mass: approximately 938 MeV/c², neutron is about 939.5 MeV/c². So each is around 938.5 MeV. So the total rest mass energy E_rest is (3 protons + 3 neutrons) * 938.5 MeV. Wait, that's 6 * 938.5 MeV. Let me compute that: 6 * 938.5 = 5631 MeV. Oh wait, but wait. Wait, no, actually, each nucleon (proton or neutron) is about the same mass. So perhaps I should calculate the sum as 3*(proton) +3*(neutron), but maybe their masses are slightly different, but probably the problem expects me to approximate. Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass is given as 6 times the mass of a proton, but I think that's not accurate because neutrons have a slightly higher mass. But maybe the problem expects using the average or exact as per standard data.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look up the exact mass of Li-6. Wait, but wait, I don't have exact data memorized. Hmm. Let me think. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0123 atomic mass units (u). Oh, right, because each u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.0123 u would be 6.0123 * 931.5 MeV. Let me compute that.

Wait, 6 * 931.5 is 5589 MeV.
