Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the position of the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the probability of finding a particle in a certain region is determined by the square of the absolute value of the wave function. And for the wave function to be normalized, the integral of the probability density over all space should equal 1.

Wait, right. So the wave function must satisfy the normalization condition. That is, the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from -infinity to +infinity should equal 1. But since the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, the wave function must be zero outside this interval. Hmm, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Wait, that seems complex. So the wave function is a complex number.

But wait, the problem says that when they measured the position, they found none at x <1 and x>3. So that implies that the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3. So maybe the given wave function is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. Because if the wave function were non-zero outside that region, then there would be a non-zero probability of finding the particle there, which contradicts the given data.

So the given wave function is part of the overall wave function, which is zero outside x=1 to x=3. Therefore, the overall wave function is ψ(x) = 0 for x <1 and x>3, and ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤3.

Wait, but wait a minute. The wave function given here is (a/sqrt
