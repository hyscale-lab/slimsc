Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a particle moving in two dimensions with a specific potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. And the question is asking for the energy spectrum. The options are A to D, each with a different expression involving n_x and n_y, and some coefficients multiplied by ħ times sqrt(k/m).

Hmm, right. So I remember that in two dimensions, especially in polar coordinates, the potential can sometimes be separated into radial and angular parts. That might help in finding the energy levels. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, let's write down the potential again: V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. I can factor out r² from both terms, right? So V(r,θ) = r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos²θ ].

Wait, that's (1/2)k r² [ 1 + 3 cos²θ ]? Is that correct? Let me double-check. Oh wait, no, because (1/2)k + (3/2)k is (2k/2)k, but since we're factoring, it's just r² ( (1/2)k (1 + 3 cos²θ) ), so yeah, V = (k/2) r² (1 + 3 cos²θ).

Hmm, maybe I can separate this potential into two parts: one that depends on r and another that depends on θ. Because in quantum mechanics, when the potential is separable, the solutions are also separable into radial and angular parts.

So, let's think about the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates. The time-independent Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates is:

[- (ħ²/(2m)) ( (1/r) ∂/∂r (r ∂ψ/∂r) ) + (1/(r²)) ∂²ψ/∂θ² ) ] + V(r,θ) ψ = E ψ.

Plugging the potential in, we get:

[- (
