Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of quantum mechanics and magnetic fields. But I'll take it step by step.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the Hamiltonian for the magnetic interaction) with the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom. The setup is a magnetic field B along the Oz axis, with small values of m (the orbital magnetic quantum number). B is given as 1 Tesla. The transition wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which I recognize as the wavelength for the Lyman-alpha line, corresponding to a transition in hydrogen from n=2 to n=1. 

Hmm, I remember that the paramagnetic term in the Hamiltonian is given by something like H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. And the magnetic moment for an electron is μ = -gμ_B m, where g is the Landé g-factor (approximately 2), and μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait, no, the paramagnetic term is probably the Zeeman term. Oh right, the Zeeman effect is the interaction of an atom's magnetic moment with an external magnetic field. So the Hamiltonian should be H = -μ·B. Since B is along Oz, μ·B would be μ_z * B. So H = -μ_z B.

The magnetic moment μ_z is given by μ_z = g μ_B m, where m is the magnetic quantum number. So the energy due to this term would be H = -g μ_B m B. Wait, but the problem is comparing the expectation value of H, which is just the average energy from this term, and ΔE, the transition energy.

Wait, no, the paramagnetic coupling term is the perturbation. So the energy shift due to the magnetic field is the expectation value of H, which is ⟨H⟩ = -g μ_B m B. But wait, for hydrogen, the orbital magnetic moment is due to the electron's orbital motion, right? So m here is the orbital magnetic quantum number. But they said m is small, but I'm not sure if that's relevant because m can be -1, 0, +1 for p orbitals, but for s it's 0. Hmm, but wait, the field is applied, so the Zeeman effect comes into play, splitting the energy levels.

But the question is comparing the magnitude of the paramagnetic term (which I think is the Zeeman energy) to the transition energy ΔE. So ΔE is the energy difference between two states when the electron transitions, like between n=2 and n=1, which is the Lyman-alpha line.

I need to compute both the Zeeman energy shift and the transition energy ΔE, then compare them.

First, I'll compute ΔE. The transition wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nm. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 J·s), c is speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s). So let's calculate that.

Calculating ΔE: hc is about 1240 eV·nm (since 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, but this is a handy approximation). So λ = 486.1 nm, so ΔE = (1240 eV·nm) / 486.1 nm ≈ 2.55 eV. Wait, but wait, the Rydberg energy is about 13.6 eV, so 2.55 eV is a fraction of that. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate using exact values.

Another approach: hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. λ = 486.1e-9 m. So E = (1.9878e-25 J·
