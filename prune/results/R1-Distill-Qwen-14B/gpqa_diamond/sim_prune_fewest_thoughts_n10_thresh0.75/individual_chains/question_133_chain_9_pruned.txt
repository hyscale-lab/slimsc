Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because buffer solutions can be a bit tricky. Let's take it step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 200 mL. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2- or PO4^3-?) in this solution. The temperatures are at 25°C, and we're given the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, Ka3=1.8e-12.

Wait, so first, I remember that H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons. The different K values correspond to each dissociation step.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K H2PO4. And Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate with two waters of crystallization. So, when dissolved, what do they become?

KH2PO4 would dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion. Then, Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So, HPO4^2- is the hydrogen phosphate ion.

So in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. That setup sounds like a buffer solution because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. Wait, but wait: H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donate a proton to become HPO4^2-) or as a base (接受 a proton to become H3PO4). But in the presence of HPO4^2-, which is the conjugate base, the solution should be a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but which is the acid and which is the base in this buffer? Let me think. H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2- (so H2PO4^- is the acid), and H
