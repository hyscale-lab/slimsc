Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, let's think this through. I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star from us. Oh wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a larger parallax means the star is closer, and a smaller parallax means it's farther away.

The question states that stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in terms of what? Well, if it's uniform in the sky, I think that means they're spread out uniformly in space. But wait, the problem is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, how does that relate to distance?

Oh right, distance and parallax are related by the formula plx = 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs. So the parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if a star is at distance d, its parallax is 1/d.

Now, the number of stars in a given volume of space would be uniform. But how does that translate to parallax? Well, we can think of it in terms of the volume of a spherical shell. The volume between distances d and d + δd is (4/3)π ( (d + δd)^3 - d^3 ). For small δd, this approximates to 4π d² δd. So the number of stars in that shell is proportional to d² δd.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So let's express δd in terms of parallax. Since plx = 1/d, the change in distance δd is related to the change in parallax δplx. Let's see: If plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So δd is the change in d when plx changes by δplx. Let's compute δd = - (1/plx²) δplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but we can ignore the sign for magnitude purposes.

But we need the number of stars in a range of plx. So the number of stars between plx and plx + δplx would correspond to the number in the d and d + δd shell. From earlier, that number is proportional to d² δd. Substituting d = 1/plx, we get (1/plx)^2 * |
