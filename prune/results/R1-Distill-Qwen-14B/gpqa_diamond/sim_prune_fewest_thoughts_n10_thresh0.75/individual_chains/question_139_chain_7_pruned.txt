Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right starting materials A and B that, when treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water, produce the given diketones. Hmm, let me think about what's happening here.

Wait, the reagents used are HCl, NaNO2, and water. I remember that these are typically involved in diazotization reactions, especially with aromatic amines. But wait, the products here are diketones. Oh, wait! Diazotization is usually for aryl or aliphatic amines, and when they undergo certain reactions, they can form diazonium salts. But how does that lead to diketones?

Oh wait, maybe the starting materials aren't amines. Hmm. Or perhaps I'm mixing things up. Another possibility is that these reagents might be used in a different context. Wait, I've heard of the Stephen reduction or the Clemmensen reduction, but those involve different reagents. Or perhaps it's about the formation of carbonyl groups from alcohols.

Wait, wait a second. Oh, I think I remember something about the treatment of alcohols with nitrous acid. Diazonium salts can undergo various reactions depending on the conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a secondary or tertiary alcohol that, when treated with nitrous acid, can form a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: I've heard of the production of ketones from alcohols using the treatment with nitrous acid. For instance, in the case of an aliphatic alcohol reacting under certain conditions. Oh! Maybe it's the formation of ketones from secondary alcohols via the Hurd-Mory procedure or something like that. Or perhaps it's the oxidation of alcohols, but oxidation usually involves different reagents.

Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Let's see, the reagents are HCl, NaNO2, and H2O. I think that when a secondary alcohol is treated with nitrous acid (HNO2), which can be generated from NaNO2 and HCl, it can lead to the formation of a carbonyl group. So maybe the starting material is a secondary alcohol, and the reaction converts it into a ketone.

So, if the products are diketones, then each starting material must have two alcohol groups or perhaps one secondary and another primary or something that
