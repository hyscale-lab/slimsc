Okay, so I've got this question about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ bar σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh right, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that gamma matrices are involved in the Dirac equation and stuff.

Wait, the question is about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. I think I need to figure out the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian.

In quantum field theory, the Lagrangian has to be dimensionless because it's the integral (in 4D) of the action, which is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have a certain mass dimension based on the spacetime dimensions.

Let me recall the mass dimensions of the fields. In 4 dimensions, a spinor field ψ has a mass dimension of 3/2 because the Dirac equation is first order. The field strength tensor F^{μν} comes from the electromagnetic (or gauge) field, which has a dimension of 1. Because F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so each derivative adds a dimension of 1. So F has dimension 2? Wait, no, wait. A gauge field A has dimension 1. So F, which is ∂ A, has dimension 1 + 1 = 2. Right.

Now, the sigma tensor σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices and commutators. Since gamma matrices are dimensionless (they're matrices, not fields), the sigma term doesn't change the dimension.

So let's look at the term ψ bar σ_{μν} ψ. Each ψ is dimension 3/2. So ψ bar ψ is (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. Then σ_{μν} is dimensionless, so the whole ψ bar σ ψ term has dimension 3.

F^{μν} has dimension 2. So the entire term is κ multiplied by (dimension 3) multiplied by (dimension 2). So the term is κ * (3 + 2) = κ * 5? Wait, no, when you multiply fields, you add their dimensions. So the term is κ ψ bar σ ψ F. So the dimensions are [κ] + [ψ bar σ ψ] + [F]. Wait no, the Lagrangian term is one term, so the dimension is [κ] + [ψ]^2 [σ] + [F] ? Wait, no. Let me approach it differently.

Wait, the term is [κ] * [ψ]^2 * [σ_{μν}] * [F^{μν}]. But σ is made from gamma matrices and derivatives? No, wait, σ_{mu nu} is (i/2)[gamma_mu, gamma_nu], which doesn't involve derivatives. So σ is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So [σ] is 0.

Wait, no, σ_{mu nu} is a tensor built from gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So [σ_{mu nu}] is zero.

So the term in the Lagrangian is [κ] multiplied by [ψ]^2 (since ψ bar is ψ^dagger gamma^0, which has the same dimension as ψ) multiplied by [F^{mu nu}].

Wait, ψ bar is dimension 3/2, ψ is 3/2 as well. So ψ bar σ ψ would be (3/2 + 3/2) = 3.

Then F^{mu nu} is dimension 2.

So the whole term is [κ] * 3 * 2 = [κ] * 6. But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4 in 4 spacetime dimensions because the action is dimensionless (integral of Lagrangian density, which is dimension 4 in 4D) divided by dimension 4 (volume element). Wait no, the Lagrangian density itself has dimension 4 because it's integrated over d^4 x (dimension 4) to give a dimensionless action. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So the term κ ψ bar σ F has to have dimension 4. So [κ] + [ψ]^2 + [F] = 4. [ψ]^2 is 3, [F] is 2. So 3 + 2 =5. So [κ] must be 4 -5 = -1. So [κ] = -1.

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. The term is κ * ψ bar σ ψ * F. Each ψ has dimension 3/2, F has dimension 2.

So ψ bar ψ has dimension 3. Multiply by F (dimension 2), so 3 + 2 =5. So the term is κ * (5). So [κ * (5) ] must be 4, because the term is part of the Lagrangian.

So [κ] + 5 =4 => [κ]= -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. Looking at the options, options A and C have [κ]_M =-1.

Now, about renormalizability. A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constant has a mass dimension >=0. Because, in general, a coupling with negative mass dimension implies that the interaction becomes stronger at higher energies (UV divergences), making the theory non-renormalizable.

Wait, no, I think it's the opposite. Wait, the mass dimension of the coupling tells us about the superficial degree of divergence. The coupling is dimensionless for renormalizable theories.

Wait, wait, in 4D, a renormalizable interaction term must have a coupling with positive mass dimension? Or is it that the term in the Lagrangian must be dimension 4, and the coupling is dimensionless (so that the term is dimension 4) for renormalizable theories.

Wait, let me get this straight. In a renormalizable theory, the interaction terms have Lagrangian terms which are of mass dimension 4, and the coupling constants are dimensionless. Because the coupling is multiplied by the fields, which have certain dimensions, so the coupling must have the right dimension to make the term dimension 4.

In this case, the term is dimension 4, so the coupling κ has dimension -1, which is negative. So the coupling is dimensionful. Which implies that the theory is not renormalizable because the coupling has negative mass dimension, meaning higher-order terms would involve higher powers of the coupling, which would have more negative mass dimension, leading to nonrenormalizable interactions.

Wait, no, more precisely, in a renormalizable theory, the coupling constants are dimensionless. So in 4D, for a term like ψ^2 F, which is dimension 5, the coupling must have dimension -1 to make the term dimension 4. So this would mean the coupling is dimensionful and negative, implying the theory is non-renormalizable.

Because renormalizable theories only have interactions with dimensionless couplings. So if [κ]=-1, which is negative, the theory is not renormalizable.

So putting it together: [κ]=-1, theory not renormalizable. So the option is C.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of fields
- In 4 spacetime dimensions, the Dirac spinor field $\psi$ has a mass dimension of $\frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$, which is derived from the gauge field $A_\mu$, has a mass dimension of $2$.
- The $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ tensor is constructed from the gamma matrices $\gamma_\mu$, which are dimensionless. Thus, $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ has no mass dimension.

### Step 2: Dimension of the Lagrangian term
The Lagrangian density must have a total mass dimension of $4$ in 4 spacetime dimensions. The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ contributes as follows:
- $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi$ has a mass dimension of $3$ (since each $\psi$ has dimension $\frac{3}{2}$, and $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is dimensionless).
- $F^{\mu\nu}$ has a mass dimension of $2$.

Thus, the total dimension of the term is:
\[
[\kappa] + 3 + 2 = 4.
\]
Solving for $[\kappa]$, we find:
\[
[\kappa] = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constants are dimensionless (i.e., $[\kappa] = 0$). In this case, $[\kappa] = -1$, which is negative. A negative mass dimension implies that the interaction becomes stronger at higher energies, leading to non-renormalizable divergences. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
