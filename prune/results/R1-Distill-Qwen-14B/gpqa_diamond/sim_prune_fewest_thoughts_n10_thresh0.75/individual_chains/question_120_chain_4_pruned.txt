Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, uniform distribution—so the density of stars is the same everywhere. But how does the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) change with plx?

Hmm, parallax is a measure of distance. I remember that the parallax in arcseconds (") is inversely proportional to the distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/distance. So, a larger parallax means a closer star because it has a bigger shift.

Now, the question is about how the number of stars per unit parallax range varies with plx. So, if I think in terms of a differential, like how many stars are there between plx and plx + dplx, right?

Wait, the problem states it's uniform distribution. So, the number density (stars per unit volume) is the same everywhere. But parallax relates to distance, so we need to consider how the volume changes with distance.

Let's model this. Assume the stars are uniformly distributed, which means the number of stars in a volume element dV is proportional to dV. So N ∝ dV.

But distance is related to parallax. Distance d = 1/plx. So, d = 1/plx, which means as plx increases, d decreases.

Now, I need to express dV in terms of parallax. Let's consider a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr. The volume would be 4πd² dr. But since d = 1/plx, let's substitute that in.

Wait, but we're looking at a range in parallax, not distance. So, maybe I should express dr in terms of dplx. Let me think.

Parallax plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Taking the derivative, dr = d(1/plx) = (-1/plx²) dplx. Wait, but I'm dealing with a small change in plx (dplx), so the change in distance dr is proportional to dplx times (-1/plx²). But since we're dealing with magnitudes, perhaps the absolute value is what matters here.

Wait, but in terms of the volume element, which is 4π d² dr, I can substitute dr in terms of dplx. So, dr = (d(1/plx)) = (-1/plx²) dplx. But since plx is positive, and d is positive, perhaps we take the absolute value, so dr = (1/plx²) * dplx.

So, substituting into the volume element, dV = 4π d² dr.

But d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/plx². And dr is (1/plx²) dplx. So, dV = 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx) = 4π (1/plx⁴) dplx.

So, the number of stars in this volume element would be proportional to dV, which is proportional to (1/plx⁴) dplx. So, the number of stars per unit range of plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx⁴.

Wait, but let me double-check.
