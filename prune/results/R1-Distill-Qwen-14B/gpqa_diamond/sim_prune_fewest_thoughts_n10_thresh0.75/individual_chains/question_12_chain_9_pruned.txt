Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle physics, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

The question is about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. The reaction is Pi(+) at rest decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses given are Pi(+) as 139.6 MeV and mu(+) as 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles, which are the muon and the neutrino. The options are A, B, C, D with different pairs of energies.

Wait, but wait a second, neutrinos are super light, right? I remember that in particle physics, the neutrino is considered to have negligible mass compared to other particles. So in this case, the neutrino's mass would be approximately zero. That’s going to be important because it affects the energy distribution between the particles.

So the problem is a decay at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. But since the neutrino has almost no mass, its velocity is going to be very high, but the muon, being much heavier, will have a lower velocity.

To find the kinetic energies, I think I need to use conservation of energy and momentum. Let me outline the steps.

First, the total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the Pi(+) since it's stationary. So that's 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is just its momentum times c (or in MeV units, since c is accounted for, E = |p| * c, but in MeV, E = |p| because E is in MeV and p is in MeV/c, so E = pc). 

Wait, actually, for a massless particle like the neutrino, E = |p| because E² = (pc)² + (m c²)², and m
