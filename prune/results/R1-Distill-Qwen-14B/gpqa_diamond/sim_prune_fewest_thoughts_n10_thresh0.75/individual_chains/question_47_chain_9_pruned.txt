Okay, I'm trying to figure out which compound C9H11NO2 is based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is CnHmOxNp. Degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m -x)/2. So here, n=9, m=11, x=2 (since O is 2), p=1 (for N). Wait, wait, no, wait. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So substituting: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2. So (20 -11 +1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (3 double bonds, so 3), plus a double bond or ring (2 more), maybe a carbonyl group. So benzene plus another double bond maybe.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are likely N-H stretches. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is probably a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which is typical for amides or esters.

Now, the 1H NMR. Let's break it down.

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That's probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group. So maybe an ethyl ester or ethyl amide.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests maybe an NH group, but wait, looking at the options, perhaps this is an OCH2 group. Or maybe it's adjacent to an electronegative atom. Alternatively, it could be an NH in a primary amine, but broad signals are tricky. Maybe it's part of an amide or an ester.

4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H. Quartet with 2H. Quartet suggests coupling with a triplet, maybe a CH2 next to another CH2. So like CH2CH2O grouping. For example, OCH2CH2O or something similar.

Wait, but in ethyl esters, the splitting is different. Let me think. In an ethyl ester like ethyl benzoate, the CH2CH3 would be a triplet at around 1.2 ppm, and the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1 ppm. So in the NMR, 4.5 ppm is a bit higher than that. Hmm. Or perhaps it's a different structure.

Looking at the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H
