Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, so each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time. The question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. But wait, 50 minutes have already passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. Now, they're asking what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, let me think. Radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model, right? The general formula is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. But probability of decay is a bit different. The probability that a nucleus will decay in a certain time is given by P = 1 - e^(-λt), where t is the time.

But wait, here's the thing: the problem says that the probability of decay is 32% within 100 minutes. So, 32% is 0.32. So P = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Hmm, I can solve for λ there.

Let me compute λ. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ). Rearranging, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking natural log on both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

Wait,
