Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me first read the question carefully.

So, the setup is about particles being collided in a detector. The particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector, and they travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls instead.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is related to how much time dilation occurs, but wait, maybe it's more about how far the particles can travel before decaying? Because if they decay quickly, they might not reach the detector walls. So, the problem is probably about the particles' lifetime from our frame of reference versus their rest frame.

Wait, particles that are fast-decaying... so, their proper lifetime (in their rest frame) is very short. But from our lab frame, since they're moving at a high speed, their lifetime is dilated by the Lorentz factor gamma. So, the longer the lifetime (the higher gamma), the farther they can travel before decaying.

Oh right, the mean lifetime from our perspective is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime. So, the distance they can travel is velocity multiplied by their lifetime. But since they're moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their velocity is approximately the speed of light, c. So, distance D = v * gamma * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime. But since v is almost c, it's approximately c * gamma * tau.

Wait, but I think the problem is about the fraction of particles that reach the detector walls. So, the initial setup says that with gamma ~20, one third reach the walls. So, maybe the particles have a certain probability of decaying before reaching the wall, based on their lifetime. 

Wait, but how does the fraction relate to the Lorentz factor? Let me think. The distance the particle can travel before decaying is something like L = gamma * c * tau. But the detector has a radius R = 30 meters. So, for a particle to reach the wall, L must be at least R.

But wait, the particles are produced at the
