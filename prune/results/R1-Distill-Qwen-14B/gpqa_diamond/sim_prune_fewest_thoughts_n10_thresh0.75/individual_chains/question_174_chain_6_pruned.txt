Okay, so I have this physics problem here about atomic nucleus fission. Hmm, I should take it step by step. Let me read the question again.

Alright, the problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. We need to find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the one calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Hmm, I remember that in such fission processes, energy is released because some mass is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, the sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of M, so there's a mass defect of 1%? Or wait, M is the initial rest mass, so the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. After fission, the sum of rest masses is 0.99 M, meaning the rest mass energy after is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the mass difference is 3 GeV? Because 300 - 297 = 3 GeV. But wait, the initial energy is rest mass, which is 300 GeV. After fission, the rest mass is 297 GeV, so the energy released would be 3 GeV, right? Because E=mcÂ², so the missing mass is converted into kinetic energy.

Wait, but in reality, the nuclear rest masses before and after the reaction include binding energies. But maybe I don't need to get into that for this problem. Let's proceed.

So, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. Therefore, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So their momenta must cancel each other out.

The problem states that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's denote the masses. Let me call the smaller fragment's rest mass m, so the more massive one is 2m. The sum of their masses is m + 2m = 3m = 0.99 M. So
