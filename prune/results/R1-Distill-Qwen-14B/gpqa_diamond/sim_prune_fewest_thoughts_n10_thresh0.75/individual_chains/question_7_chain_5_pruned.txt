Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. The process is gamma-gamma annihilation producing electron-positron pairs. The question is asking from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV.

Wait, right, the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and its photons have very low energy. So the gamma-rays in question are high energy, way higher than the CMB photons. The process here is that a gamma-ray photon interacts with a CMB photon to produce an electron and a positron. That process must depend on the energies of the photons involved.

I've heard that in particle physics, when considering interaction rates, cross-sections come into play. The cross-section is a measure of the probability of a particular interaction happening. So the reaction gamma + gamma -> e+ + e- would have a certain cross-section that depends on the energies of the gamma photons.

I think the cross-section for this annihilation process is given by a formula involving the energy of the gamma-rays. I'm a bit rusty on the exact formula, but I remember that the cross-section for two photons colliding to produce electron-positron pairs depends on their energies. Let me think: the cross-section probably increases as the product of the energies of the two photons. Or wait, maybe it's a function of the center-of-mass energy. Oh right, because the reaction requires a certain minimum energy in the center-of-mass frame.

The threshold energy for producing an electron-positron pair is when the center-of-mass energy is at least twice the electron rest mass. The rest mass energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so twice that is 1.022 MeV. So the combined energy of the two photons in their center-of-mass frame needs to be at least that.

So, the center-of-mass energy squared (s) should be s ≥ (2m_e c²)^2. The square of the sum of the four-momenta of the two photons. Since photons are massless, their energy and momentum are related by E = |p|c. So the square of the sum would be (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Wait, but since photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta might subtract. Hmm, no, wait, in the lab frame where one photon is the gamma (high energy) and the other is the CMB photon (low energy), the momenta are in opposite directions. So the total momentum is (p_gamma - p_cmb) in the direction of the gamma photon.

Alternatively, the center-of-mass energy squared is s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2. Because if they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta would subtract. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of vector addition. If the two photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta vectors are opposite. So the total energy is E1 + E2, and the total momentum is p1 - p2 (if the CMB photon is moving in the opposite direction).

Wait, another approach: For two photons with energies E1 and E2, moving in opposite directions, the center-of-mass energy squared is s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2. Because when you compute the invariant mass squared, you have (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2. Since E = |p|c for photons. So E_total is E1 + E2. The momentum vectors are opposite, so the magnitude is |p1 - p2| = |(E1/c) - (E2/c)| = (E1 - E2)/c. Hence, (p_total c) = E1 - E2.

Putting it all together, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2. Let's compute that: 

(E1 + E2)^2 = E1² + 2 E1 E2 + E2²
(E1 - E2)^2 = E1² - 2 E1 E2 + E2²
Subtracting, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = [E1² +2 E1E2 + E2²] - [E1² -2 E1E2 + E2²] = 4 E1 E2.

So s = 4 E1 E2. Therefore, the condition for producing electron-positron pairs is sqrt(s) ≥ 2 m_e c². So sqrt(4 E1 E2) ≥ 2 m_e c². Simplifying, 2 sqrt(E1 E2) ≥ 2 m_e c² → sqrt(E1 E2) ≥ m_e c² → E1 E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2.

So the product of the two photon energies must be at least (m_e c²)^2. The CMB photons have E2 ≈ 1e-3 eV (given), so E1 must be at least (m_e c²)^2 / E2. 

Wait, wait, let me compute that. m_e c² is about 0.511 MeV. So (m_e c²)^2 is (0.511 MeV)^2 = (0.511)^2 (1e6 eV)^2 = approximately 0.261 MeV², but wait, perhaps I should compute it in eV terms. 0.511 MeV is 511,000 eV. So (511000 eV)^2 = (5.11e5 eV)^2 = approx 2.61e11 eV².

Then, E1 * E2 >= (5.11e5 eV)^2. Since E2 is 1e-3 eV, so E1 >= (5.11e5)^2 / (1e-3) eV.

Wait, no: E1 * E2 >= (5.11e5 eV)^2 → E1 >= (5.11e5)^2 / E2. Since E2 is 1e-3 eV, substituting: (5.11e5)^
