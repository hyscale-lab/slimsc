Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and it's a bit tricky, but let's take it step by step. I remember that NMR signals can tell us a lot about the structure of a compound. Let's start by analyzing what compound A might be.

So, compound A has two signals in the proton NMR. A triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm. The triplet at 0.9 ppm likely comes from a CH3 group attached to something else. Since it's 6H, that probably means two CH3 groups, each with three H. The quartet suggests that these CH3 are next to a CH2 group, because a quartet usually comes from neighboring with three H, like in -CH2CH2-.

Wait, wait. If the quartet is at 1.3 ppm for 4H, that might mean two sets of CH2 groups. Because 4H would imply two CH2 groups. So putting it together, maybe compound A is something like neopentyl or maybe a di-substituted alkane.

Wait, another thought. The triplet (0.9 ppm, 6H) could be two equivalent CH3 groups. And the quartet (1.3 ppm, 4H) could be a CH2CH2 group. So maybe it's (CH2CH3)2CHCH2CH3? Wait, no, that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a structure with two CH3 groups adjacent to a CH2, which is next to another CH2.

Wait, maybe it's 2,2-dimethylbutane? Let's see. But wait, 2,2-dimethylbutane would have a structure like CH2CH(CH3)2. But the NMR would have signals from different environments. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted ethane? No.

Wait, another approach. Think about the splitting. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) suggests each of these protons is split into a triplet, which would mean each is adjacent to a CH2 group. So, perhaps each CH3 is attached to a CH2. So maybe two CH3 groups attached to a CH2CH2 group?

Wait, maybe the structure is something like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2 something. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused
