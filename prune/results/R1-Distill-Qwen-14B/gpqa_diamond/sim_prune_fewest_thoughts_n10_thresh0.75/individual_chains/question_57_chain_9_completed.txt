Okay, I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, let me think. So the question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The given phase shifts are δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, and δ4=13°. And we're told to ignore the rest of the phase shifts. The electrons are 50 MeV, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant yet.

Wait, what's the formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts? I remember that in partial wave analysis, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over l of (something with the phase shifts and spherical harmonics). But since we're looking along the incident direction, that's θ=0°, right?

Oh right! The scattering amplitude along the incident direction (θ=0) is dominated by the l=0 term, which is like the s-wave. But wait, no, because each partial wave contributes. Wait, no, actually, for θ=0, the expression simplifies because the sum might have terms that are zero except for certain l.

Wait, let me recall the formula. The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, Im f(θ), is related to the sum of the partial waves. I think the expression is Im f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l} (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l * P_l(cos θ), where P_l are Legendre polynomials. But wait, when θ=0, P_l(1) is 1 for l=0, and zero for other l's? No, wait, no. Wait, no, Legendre polynomials P_l(1) are 1 for all l, because P_l(1) =1. Because P_l(x) evaluated at x=1 is always 1, regardless of l.

Wait, that can't be right. Because for l=0, P_0(x) is 1, so P_0(1)=1. For l=1, P_1(x)=x, so P_1(1)=1. For l=2, P_2(x)=(3x²-1)/2, so P_2(1)=(3-1)/2=1. Oh, right, so for all l, P_l(1)=1. That's an important point.

So for θ=0, the expression simplifies to Im f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l} (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l * 1.

Wait, wait, but the formula I remember for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is Im f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) ∑ (2l+1) sin δ_l P_l(cosθ). Because e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l = sin δ_l (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l) ? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the partial wave expansion for f(θ) is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) ∑ (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} - 1] P_l(cosθ). So the real part would be (1/(2ik)) ∑ (2l+1) (cos(2δ_l) -1) P_l, and the imaginary part would be (1/(2ik)) ∑ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) P_l.

Wait, no, wait. Because [e^{iδ_l} - 1] is the unit in the partial wave expansion. Or wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) ∑ (2l+1) [e^{iδ_l} (1 + cos(2δ_l)) -1] P_l(cosθ) ? No, I might be getting mixed up. Let me try to recall correctly.

Wait, I think the correct expression is f(θ) = (1/(2ik))∑(2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1] P_l(cosθ). Because the partial wave amplitude is [e^{2iδ_l} -1], right? Because the scattering amplitude is given by f = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l} (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1] P_l(cosθ). So for the imaginary part, Im f(θ) would be (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) Im [e^{2iδ_l} -1] P_l(cosθ).

But when θ=0, P_l(cos0) = P_l(1) = 1 for all l. So Im f(0) is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) Im [e^{2iδ_l} -1 ].

Now, let's compute Im [e^{2iδ_l} -1]. Let me compute this term. The expression e^{iθ} -1 has an imaginary part. Let me compute the imaginary part of (e^{iθ} -1):

e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ. So e^{iθ} -1 = (cosθ -1) + i sinθ. So the imaginary part is sinθ. So Im [e^{iθ} -1] = sinθ. But in our case, θ is 2δ_l. Wait, because it's e^{2iδ_l} -1. So Im [e^{2iδ_l} -1] = sin(2δ_l).

Wait, no. Because [e^{i(2δ_l)} -1] = cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l) - 1. So the imaginary part is sin(2δ_l). So yes, Im [e^{2iδ_l} -1] = sin(2δ_l).

So putting it all together, Im f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * 1.

Wait, but the given phase shifts are δ_0, δ_1, δ_2, δ_3, δ_4. So l runs from 0 to 4. So we sum over l=0,1,2,3,4.

So the sum becomes:

(2*0 +1)*sin(2δ_0) + (2*1+1)*sin(2δ_1) + ... + (2*4+1)*sin(2δ4).

So each term is (2l+1) * sin(2δ_l).

Wait, but wait, what about the other phase shifts beyond the given ones? The question says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so I think we can assume that only l=0 to 4 contribute, and higher l's are zero. So we include l=0,1,2,3,4.

So now, I need to compute (2l+1)*sin(2δ_l) for each l, sum them, then multiply by 1/(2ik).

Wait, but what is k? Because k is the wave number of the electrons. The energy is given as 50 MeV. Since the electrons are non-relativistic? Hmm, wait, 50 MeV is a high energy for electrons. Electrons have rest mass around 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is way higher, so relativistic effects are significant.

But for the calculation of k, we need to find the wave number. The formula for k is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ, but wait, for relativistic particles, this isn't the right approach. Let me think.

Wait, the energy of a relativistic electron is E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. The momentum p is γ m v, where v is the velocity. And for an electron, E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So for an electron with kinetic energy K, the total energy E is K + m c². Wait, but in particle physics, energies are often given as kinetic, but sometimes as total. Hmm, the question says 50 MeV electrons, so I'm assuming that's the kinetic energy. So E = 50 MeV + m c². But m c² for electron is ~0.511 MeV. So E ≈ 50.511 MeV.

But perhaps, for a rough approximation, it's taken as E ≈ 50 MeV, and since m c² is small compared to E, we can approximate E ≈ pc. So p ≈ E/(c). Then, the wave number k is p/(ħ c) * c = p/(ħ) ? Wait, no, let me think. The wave number k is given by k = p/(ħ), because the momentum p is ħ k.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get this straight. The de Broglie wavelength λ is h/(p), which is 2πħ / p.

k is defined as k = p/(ħ), so p = ħ k.

But E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2. So for high energies, pc ≈ E. So p ≈ E/(c). So k = p/ħ = E/(c ħ).

So E is in MeV, c is in m/s, ħ is in J·s.

Let me calculate k. Let's compute.

First, E =50 MeV. Let me convert E into Joules. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 50 MeV is 50e6 eV, so 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.

Wait, but another approach is to use natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but perhaps we can find a formula in terms of MeV and inverse femtometers.

Wait, I remember that 1 MeV/c² has a certain length associated with it. But perhaps it's easier to compute k in 1/fm units.

Wait, the Compton wavelength of an electron is λ_c = h/(m_e c) = 2.426e-12 m. Wait, 2.426e-12 meters is 2.426 fm. So 1 fm is 1e-15 m.

Wait, maybe it's easier to use the relation k (in 1/fm) = (E in MeV) / (0.1973) ), approximately. Because I remember that for an electron, k ≈ E/(0.1973) in units of MeV and inverse femtometers.

Wait, why 0.1973? Because 1/(ħ c) in units of MeV fm is approximately 0.1973. Let me check:

ħ is about 6.582e-16 eV·s. c is ~3e8 m/s. So ħ c in eV·fm is:

ħ = 6.582e-16 eV s. 1 fm = 1e-15 m. So ħ c = 6.582e-16 eV s * 3e8 m/s * (1e-15 m / 1 fm) ) = 6.582e-16 * 3e8 * 1e-15 fm → 6.582 * 3e-13 fm eV.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps using ħ c in units of MeV fm.

Wait, ħ c ≈ 197.3 MeV fm. So 1/(ħ c) ≈ 1/(197.3 MeV fm) ≈ 5.05e-3 fm/(MeV). So 1/(ħ c) = 1/(197.3) fm/MeV.

So the wave number k = p/(ħ) = (E/(c)) / (ħ) ) = E/(c ħ) ) → E/(ħ c) * (1/c) → ?

Wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, the relation is k = (E)/(ħ c) ) * (1/c) ?

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for a formula that connects k with E (in MeV) and gives it in inverse femtometers.

I remember that for an electron, k (in 1/fm) ≈ E (in MeV) / 197.3. Because 197 MeV fm is approximately ħ c.

So if E =50 MeV, then k = 50 / 197.3 ≈ 0.253 fm^-1.

But wait, let me double-check that. Because k is given by k = p/(ħ), and p = √(E² - m² c^4)} / c. For E much larger than m c^2, p ≈ E/c. So k = p/(ħ) = (E/c) / ħ. So k = E/(c ħ).

But c ħ in units of MeV fm is 197.3 MeV fm. So k = E (MeV) / (197.3 MeV fm) ) * (1 fm) ) → E/(197.3) 1/fm.

So yes, k = E/(197.3) ≈50/197.3 ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So k is approximately 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Wait, but in our formula for Im f(0), we have 1/(2ik). So let's compute 1/(2ik).

But 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k). Since 1/i = -i.

So, substituting k ≈0.253 fm^{-1}, 1/(2ik) = (-i)/(2*0.253) ≈ (-i)/(0.506) ≈ -i * 1.976 fm.

Wait, but wait, let me calculate this precisely.

k = 50 / 197.3 = 0.25307 fm^{-1}

So 1/(2ik) = 1/(2i * 0.25307) = (1/(0.50614 i)) = -i/(0.50614) ≈ -i * (1.9759) fm.

So approximately -1.9759 i fm.

Wait, but we'll need to compute it accurately, but perhaps for this problem, keeping it as (1/(2ik)) is manageable.

So now, the sum S is:

S = sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) * sin(2δ_l)

Let me compute each term:

l=0: 2l+1=1. δ0=90°. sin(2*90)=sin(180)=0.

l=0 term: 1 * 0 = 0.

l=1: 2l+1=3. δ1=67 degrees. sin(2*67) = sin(134°). Let me compute 134 degrees. So 180-46=134, sin(134)=sin(46)= approx 0.7193.

So 3 * 0.7193 ≈ 2.1579.

l=2: 2l+1=5. δ2=55. 2δ=110 degrees. sin(110)= sin(70)= approx 0.9397. 5 * 0.9397 ≈4.6985.

l=3: 2l+1=7. δ3=30. 2δ=60. sin(60)= approx 0.8660. 7 * 0.8660≈6.062.

l=4: 2l+1=9. δ4=13. 2δ=26. sin(26)= approx 0.4384. So 9 * 0.4384 ≈3.9456.

Now, sum all these terms:

l=0:0

l=1:2.1579

l=2:4.6985 → sum so far: 6.8564

l=3:6.062 → sum:12.9184

l=4:3.9456 → sum:16.864.

So S ≈16.864.

So Im f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * S.

But 1/(2ik) is (-i)/(2k) = (-i) * (1/(2k)).

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the earlier substitution. Because the formula was Im f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * S. So since 1/(2ik) is (-i)/(2k), the entire expression becomes:

Im f(0) = (-i/(2k)) * S.

But wait, the imaginary part is a real number multiplied by i, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Wait, let's think.

The expression for Im f(0) is (1/(2ik)) * S. Since S is a real number (sum of real terms), so when we compute (1/(2ik)) * S, which is S/(2ik) = S/(2i k) = (S/(2k)) * (1/i) ) = (S/(2k)) * (-i).

So Im f(0) = -i * S/(2k).

But wait, that would make Im f(0) an imaginary quantity. But the question says to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, which is a real number.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the formula. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that f(θ) is a complex quantity, and the expression for Im f(θ) is (1/(2ik)) multiplied by the sum, which would be imaginary. So perhaps the expression I have is correct, and the result would be a real number multiplied by i, but since we're taking the imaginary part, the overall factor would be real.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the formula correctly. Let me re-derive it.

The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) [e^{2iδ_l} - 1] P_l(cosθ)

The imaginary part of f(θ) is Im f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) ∑ (2l +1) Im [e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l(cosθ).

As we established earlier, Im [e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] = sin(2δ_l).

So, Im f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) ∑ (2l +1) sin(2δ_l) P_l(cosθ).

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1 for all l, so:

Im f(0) = (1/(2ik)) ∑ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

So, as computed, S= sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) from l=0 to 4. S =16.864.

So Im f(0) = [16.864] / (2ik) = 16.864/(2ik) = 8.432/(ik).

But wait, 1/(ik) = -i/(k^2) ? No, wait, 1/(ik) = (-i) * (1/k) * (1/(i^2)) ??? Wait, 1/(ik) = (1/i) * (1/k) ) = (-i) * (1/k).

So, 1/(ik) = -i (1/k).

So, Im f(0) = 8.432 * (-i) /k.

Wait, but that would make Im f(0) an imaginary number. That can't be right because the imaginary part is a real number. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im f(θ) = (1/(k)) * [sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) P_l(cosθ)].

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me check my notes.

Wait, another approach: the optical theorem says that the total cross-section is proportional to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude. The formula for the total cross-section is σ_total = 4π |f(0)|^2, but I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.

Alternatively, I think I might have a mistake in the formula. Let me check a textbook or notes.

Wait, according to my notes, the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ sum_{m=-l}^l (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) ( (i^l) / sqrt(4π) ) ) * P_l^m (cosθ) e^{i m φ}.

But when calculating the imaginary part, perhaps I should take the imaginary part of the entire expression.

Wait, but in this problem, we're considering the scattering along the beam direction, which is θ=0 and φ=0, I think. So the expression simplifies because P_l^m(1) is zero for m≠0, and P_l^0(1) is 1.

So f(0,0) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) * ( i^l / sqrt(4π) ) * P_l^0(1) * e^{i 0}.

Since P_l^0(1)=1, and e^{i0}=1, this simplifies to sum (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) i^l / sqrt(4π).

So f(0,0) = (1/sqrt(4π)) sum (2l+1) (e^{2i δ_l} -1) i^l.

The imaginary part of f(0,0) is Im [ (1/sqrt(4π)) sum (2l+1) (e^{2i δ_l} -1) i^l ].

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I should compute it directly for each l.

Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on the original approach, which was Im f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

Wait, but that led to an imaginary number, which can't be correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check another source.

Wait, another approach: the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l} (2l+1) [ e^{iδ_l} (1 + cosδ_l) ) -1 ] P_l(cosθ) ?

Wait, perhaps I should re-express [e^{2iδ_l} -1 ].

Wait, e^{2iδ_l} -1 = e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} - e^{-iδ_l} ) = e^{iδ_l} (2i sin δ_l ) = 2i e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l.

Wait, so [e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] = 2i e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l.

So, substituting into the expression for f(θ):

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [2i e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ] P_l(cosθ).

That simplifies to:

f(θ) = (i/(k)) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

So, the imaginary part of f(θ) is Im f(θ) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ] Im [e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ] ?

Wait, no. Let's compute Im f(θ):

Im f(θ) = Im [ (i/k) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l ].

Since P_l is real, and sin δ_l is real, each term is (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l. So, (i/k) multiplied by that.

The imaginary part of (i * x), where x is a complex number, is (Re(x)).

Because i x = i (a + ib) = -b + i a. So the imaginary part is a, which is Re(x).

So, Im f(θ) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) Re( e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ) * 1.

But e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l = [cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ] * sin δ_l = cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l.

So Re( e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ) = cos δ_l sin δ_l.

So, Im f(θ) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so:

Im f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l.

So, the formula is Im f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l.

Ah, so earlier approach was wrong because I used 2δ_l instead of δ_l. Now, with the correct formula, we can proceed.

So now, the formula is Im f(0) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l.

So let's compute each term:

l=0: delta_0=90°. cos(90)=0, so term is 1 * 0 * sin(90)= 0.

l=1: delta=67°. cos(67)≈0.3907. sin(67)=0.9205. So term is 3 * 0.3907 * 0.9205 ≈3 * 0.3907 *0.9205.

Compute 0.3907 * 0.9205 ≈ 0.3596. 3 * 0.3596 ≈1.0788.

l=2: delta=55. cos(55)=0.5736. sin(55)=0.8192. term is5 *0.5736 *0.8192.

0.5736 * 0.8192 ≈0.4706. 5 *0.4706≈2.353.

l=3: delta=30. Cos(30)=√3/2≈0.8660. sin(30)=0.5. term is7 *0.866 *0.5 =7 *0.433 ≈3.031.

l=4: delta=13. cos(13)= approx 0.9744. sin(13)= approx 0.22495. term=9 * 0.9744 * 0.22495.

0.9744 * 0.22495 ≈0.2194. 9 * 0.2194≈1.9746.

Now sum all terms:

l=0:0

l=1:1.0788

l=2:2.353 → sum so far: 3.4318

l=3:3.031 → sum:6.4628

l=4:1.9746 → sum:8.4374.

So sum S ≈8.4374.

Now, k is 50 MeV / 197.3 MeV fm^{-1} ≈0.25307 fm^{-1}.

So Im f(0) = S / k = 8.4374 / 0.25307 ≈33.344 fm.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them match this. The options are A) 87163.4 fm, B) 355.351 fm, C) 177.675 fm, D) 251.271 fm.

Hmm, 33.344 isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the formula. Let me check again.

Wait, in the previous approach, I thought Im f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

But after re-deriving, I found another formula: Im f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l.

But according to that formula, the result is around 33.344 fm. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculation of S. Let me recompute the sum S:

l=0: cos(90) * sin(90) =0*1=0. term=1 *0=0.

l=1: 67 degrees. cos(67)= approximately 0.3907. sin(67)=0.9205.

0.3907 * 0.9205 = approx 0.3596. 3 *0.3596=1.0788.

l=2: 55 degrees. cos=0.5736. sin=0.8192. product=0.5736 * 0.8192=0.4706. 5*0.4706=2.353.

l=3:30 degrees. cos=√3/2≈0.8660. sin=0.5. product=0.866 *0.5=0.433. 7 *0.433=3.031.

l=4:13 degrees. cos≈0.9744. sin≈0.22495. product=0.9744 * 0.22495= approximately 0.2194. 9 * 0.2194=1.9746.

Adding all terms: 0 +1.0788 +2.353 +3.031 +1.9746 = approximately 8.4374.

So S=8.4374.

k=50 /197.3 ≈0.25307 fm^{-1}.

So Im f(0)=8.4374 /0.25307 ≈33.344 fm.

But the options are much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let's think again.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, because I'm getting a result that's not in the options. Or perhaps the correct formula is Im f(0)= (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

Let me try that.

Compute sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l):

l=0: sin(180)=0. term=1*0=0.

l=1: sin(134)= sin(180-46)=sin(46)= approx 0.7193. 3 *0.7193=2.1579.

l=2: sin(110)=sin(70)= approx 0.9397. 5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3: sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660. 7 *0.8660≈6.062.

l=4: sin(26)= approx 0.4384. 9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum is: 0 + 2.1579 +4.6985 +6.062 +3.9456 ≈ 16.864.

Then, Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) * 16.864.

k=0.25307 fm^{-1}.

So 1/(2k)=1/(2 *0.25307)≈1.9759 fm.

Then, Im f(0)=16.864 * 1.9759 ≈33.344 fm.

Same result as earlier. So same issue.

Hmm, perhaps the initial approach was correct, but the options are way off. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the relation between the imaginary part and the sum of the partial waves.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

Wait, but then I need to compute the imaginary part of that expression.

Wait, no, because the formula is (1/(2ik)) multiplied by a sum of complex terms. So Im f(0) would be the imaginary part of (1/(2ik)) multiplied by the sum.

But 1/(2ik) is (-i)/(2k). So when multiplied by the sum, which is a complex number, say S = sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l, then:

(1/(2ik)) * S = [ (-i)/(2k) ] * S = [ (-i) * S ] / (2k).

The imaginary part of this would be:

Im [ (-i S)/(2k) ].

But S is a sum of terms like (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

Each term is (2l+1) (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l) sin δ_l.

Which expands to (2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l ].

So S is a complex number with real part sum (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l and imaginary part sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

So, S = Re(S) + i Im(S).

Then, (-i S)/(2k) = [ -i (Re(S) + i Im(S)) ]/(2k).

Multiply out:

= [ -i Re(S) - i^2 Im(S) ]/(2k )

= [ -i Re(S) + Im(S) ]/(2k )

Because i^2 =-1.

So this can be written as (Im(S) )/(2k ) - i Re(S)/(2k )

The imaginary part of this expression is the coefficient of i, which is (- Re(S))/(2k).

Wait, so Im [ (1/(2ik)) * S ] = (- Re(S) )/(2k )

But Re(S) is sum (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l. So Re(S)= S1.

So Im f(0) = (- S1 )/(2k )

In our case, S1 =8.4374.

So Im f(0) = (-8.4374 )/(2 *0.25307 ) ≈ (-8.4374 )/(0.50614 )≈-16.67 fm.

Negative value? But the options are positive. So perhaps the formula gives the magnitude, but I might have messed up the signs.

But regardless, the order of magnitude is about 16.67 fm, which doesn't match the options.

Wait, but this is getting too complicated, and perhaps I should step back.

Another approach: perhaps the formula for Im f(0) is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, let's compute that sum:

sum (2l+1) sin δ_l:

l=0: 1 * sin(90) =1.

l=1: 3 * sin(67)=3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5*0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9*0.22495≈2.0245.

Sum=1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0245=13.382.

So sum≈13.382.

Then, Im f(0)= (13.382)/(0.25307) ≈52.88 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (1/(2ik)) multiplied by sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} -1.

But that seems even more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a formula in terms of the phase shifts. I recall that the scattering amplitude can be written as:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^L (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] P_l(cosθ)

So for θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^L (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ]

The imaginary part of this is Im f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) Im [e^{2i δ_l} -1 ].

As before, Im [e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] = sin(2δ_l). So Im f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

Which brings us back to our initial approach.

So sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) is 16.864, 1/(2ik) is ( -i/(2k) ), so:

Im f(0) = [16.864] * [ -i/(2k) ]

But wait, this would give an imaginary number, but the question asks for the imaginary part. So perhaps the expression is:

Im f(0)= [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] / (2k)

Because 1/(2ik) is (1/(2i k)) = (-i)/(2k), but when you multiply by a pure imaginary term, you get a real number.

Wait, no. Let me think. The formula is Im f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

But 1/(2ik) = (-i)/(2k). So, the expression becomes:

Im f(0) = [ (-i)/(2k) ] * sum real terms.

Which is a purely imaginary quantity. So the imaginary part of f(0) would be the real part of this expression.

But this seems a bit confusing. Perhaps I should consider that the formula for Im f(0) is simply (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

Because 1/(2ik) × (sum real) is imaginary, but perhaps the correct way is to take the magnitude.

Alternatively, perhaps I should ignore the sign and take the absolute value. Let me proceed.

So sum is 16.864.

k=0.25307 fm^{-1}.

Im f(0)= (16.864) / (2 *0.25307) = 16.864/(0.50614) ≈33.34 fm.

Still 33.34; not matching any options.

Wait, but let's look at the options again. Option C is 177.675 fm, which is exactly twice 88.8375. Hmm, but how?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Maybe I should use a different value for k.

Wait, let's re-calculate k.

Given E=50 MeV for the electron.

But electrons are relativistic, so E=gamma m c^2. So, gamma = E/(m c^2) = 50 MeV / 0.511 MeV ≈97.827.

So, E=gamma m c^2 =50 MeV.

The momentum p = gamma m v. But v ≈c for high gamma.

But the correct way is p = gamma m v. Since gamma is large, v ≈c, so p ≈ gamma m c.

So p ≈ (50 MeV / (0.511 MeV)) * m c.

Wait, but m c is 0.511 MeV/c. So p = (50 /0.511) * (0.511 MeV/c) ) =50 MeV/c.

Wait, that's interesting. So p =50 MeV/c.

Then, the wave number k = p / (ħ c) ) * (1/ c )? Hmm, no, k = p/(ħ).

Because p = ħ k.

So, k = p / ħ.

But p is in units of MeV/c, and ħ c is approximately 197.3 MeV·fm.

So, k= (p c )/(ħ c²) ) * c → perhaps better to compute in units.

Wait, since p =50 MeV/c, and ħ c ≈197.3 MeV·fm, then k = p/(ħ c) ) * c → no, perhaps another approach.

Wait, the expression is k= p/ħ.

But p=50 MeV/c. ħ is in J·s.

Alternatively, 1 fm^{-1} = 1e15 m^{-1}.

But maybe it's easier to compute k in terms of MeV and fm.

Wait, using natural units where ħ= c=1, then k (in fm^{-1}) is p (MeV/c) × (1 fm) / (ħ c) ) → no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, here's a formula: k (in 1/fm) = (E (MeV)) / (197.3 MeV fm) ) → So, k= E/(197.3) 1/fm.

So for E=50 MeV, k=50 /197.3 ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So the same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im f(0)= (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, but I don't think that's correct. Earlier, that gave us about 52.88 fm, which is still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the way I'm calculating the sum. Let me double-check the sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) again.

Compute each term:

l=0: δ=90°, 2δ=180°. sin(180)=0. term=1*0=0.

l=1: δ=67, 2δ=134°. sin(134)=sin(46)=≈0.7193. (2*1+1)=3 →3 *0.7193≈2.1579.

l=2: δ=55°, 2δ=110. sin(110)=sin(70)=≈0.9397. (2*2+1)=5 →5 *0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3: δ=30°, 2δ=60°. sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660. 7 *0.8660≈6.062.

l=4: δ=13°, 2δ=26°. sin(26)=≈0.4384. 9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum: 0 +2.1579 +4.6985 +6.062 +3.9456 =2.1579+4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

Yes, same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the real part. But no, the question specifically asks for the imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to ignore the phase shifts beyond l=4? But the question says to ignore the rest, so only l=0 to4 are considered.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum correctly. Let me compute each sine value more accurately.

Compute each sin(2δ_l):

l=1: δ1=67° → 2δ=134°. sin(134)=sin(180-46)=sin(46)=0.7193398003.

l=2: δ2=55→110. sin(110)=sin(70)=0.9396926208.

l=3:30→60. sin(60)=√3/2=0.8660254038.

l=4:13→26. sin(26)=0.4383711468.

So the terms:

l1:3 * 0.7193398003=2.1580194.

l2:5 * 0.9396926208=4.698463104.

l3:7 *0.8660254038=6.062177826.

l4:9 *0.4383711468=3.945340321.

Sum:

2.1580194 +4.698463104=6.856482504.

+6.062177826 →12.91866033.

+3.945340321 →16.86400065.

So sum=16.86400065.

So same as before.

So Im f(0)=16.86400065 / (2 *0.25307) =16.86400065 / 0.50614 =33.344 fm.

But options are A) 87163, B)355, C)177, D)251.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (1/(k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

But in that case, sum (2l+1) sin δ_l is:

l=0:1*1=1.

l=1:3*sin(67)=3*0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5*sin(55)=5*0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7*sin(30)=3.5.

l=4:9*sin(13)=9*0.22495=2.02455.

Sum=1+2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455≈13.38205.

Multiply by (1/k)=1/0.25307≈3.952.

13.38205 *3.952≈52.88 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should remember that the scattering amplitude f is in units of fm, as cross-sections are in barns (1 barn=10^-24 cm²=10^-20 fm²), but the question says the answer is in fm. So perhaps Im f(0) is in fm.

But given that none of my calculations match the options, I'm probably missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im f(0) is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which would give 13.38205/(2*0.25307)=13.38205/0.50614≈26.43 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l}.

So then, Im f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l}.

Compute sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l}:

Each term is (2l+1) [cos δ_l +i sin δ_l ].

Sum:

l=0:1*(cos90 +i sin90)=1*(0 +i*1)=i.

l=1:3*(cos67 +i sin67)=3*(0.3907 +i 0.9205)=1.1721 +i 2.7615.

l=2:5*(0.5736 +i 0.8192)=2.868 +i4.096.

l=3:7*(0.8660 +i 0.5 )=6.062 +i3.5.

l=4:9*(0.9744 +i 0.22495 )=8.7696 +i 2.02455.

Adding all terms:

Real parts: i (from l=0) → real part is 0.

l=1: 1.1721.

l=2:2.868 → total so far:4.0401.

l=3:6.062 →10.1021.

l=4:8.7696 →18.8717.

Imaginary parts:

l=0:1.

l=1:2.7615 →3.7615.

l=2:4.096 →7.8575.

l=3:3.5 →11.3575.

l=4:2.02455 →13.38205.

So sum S=18.8717 +i 13.38205.

Now, Im f(0)= (1/(2ik)) * S.

Which is (1/(2ik)) * (18.8717 +i13.38205).

Expressed as:

= [18.8717 +i13.38205]/(2i k )

Multiply numerator and denominator by i:

= [i (18.8717 +i13.38205 ) ]/( 2i^2 k )

= [i 18.8717 -13.38205 ]/( -2k )

= [ -13.38205 +i 18.8717 ]/( -2k )

= [13.38205 -i 18.8717 ]/(2k )

So Im f(0) is the imaginary part of this, which is (-18.8717)/(2k).

Because the expression is [13.38205/(2k)] - i [18.8717/(2k)].

The imaginary part is [ -18.8717/(2k) ].

So Im f(0)= -18.8717/(2k) = -18.8717/(2 *0.25307) ≈-18.8717/0.50614≈-37.29 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Considering the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l}.

But that seems even more complex.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the answer is 33.344 fm, but the options are given in a different unit.

Wait, no, the options are in fm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the sum should include all phase shifts up to l=4, but I might have missed including the term for l=0. Wait, no, the question gives phase shifts δ0 to δ4, so l=0 to4.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum as (sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l)) / (k).

Because earlier, when I thought Im f(0) is sum/(2k), I got 33.34 fm, but if it's sum/(k), then 16.864 /0.25307 ≈66.688 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A:87163 fm → way too big.

B:355.351 fm.

C:177.675 fm.

D:251.271 fm.

Wait, option B and C are about 355 and 177, which are about 10 times larger than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to multiply by something. For example, perhaps the formula includes a factor of 2, so Im f(0)= sum/(k), giving 66.688 fm.

But that's not any option either.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula includes the sum of 2l+1 multiplied by sin δ_l, not sin(2δ_l).

So Im f(0)= (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which we computed as 13.38205 /0.25307 ≈52.88 fm.

No, that's not matching either.

Hmm.

Perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts are given in degrees, so I should convert them to radians before computing the sine.

Wait, that's a possibility. Let me recalculate the sum using radians.

Compute sin(2δ_l) in radians.

l=0:δ=90°=π/2 radians. 2δ=π radians. sin(π)=0.

l=1:δ=67°=1.16937 radians. 2δ=2.3387 radians. sin(2.3387)=approx 0.7193.

Same as before.

l=2:55°=0.95993 radians. 2δ=1.91986. sin(1.91986)=0.9397.

l=3:30°=0.523599 radians. 2δ=1.047198 radians. sin(1.047198)=0.8660.

l=4:13°=0.226893 radians. 2δ=0.453786 radians. sin(0.453786)= approx 0.4384.

Same as before. So no change in the sum.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the imaginary part but the real part. But the question clearly says the imaginary part.

I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, none of the options match, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l}.

Which we computed as (18.8717 +i13.38205)/(2ik).

But perhaps Im f(0) is the imaginary part of that, which would be (13.38205)/(2k).

Because the expression is (18.8717 +i13.38205)/(2ik) = [18.8717/(2ik) ] + [i13.38205/(2ik) ].

The first term is real, and the second term is imaginary. So the imaginary part is [13.38205/(2k)].

So Im f(0)=13.38205/(2 *0.25307)≈13.38205/0.50614≈26.43 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l and multiply by 1/k.

Which gives 13.38205 /0.25307≈52.88 fm.

But none of the options match. I'm really not sure where the mistake is.

Perhaps the correct approach is to look for the formula elsewhere, but I'm not able to find the correct one. So with the time I've spent, I'll have to make a guess.

Looking back, the sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) is 16.864, and k=0.25307, so 16.864 /0.25307≈66.688 fm.

Which is about 66.69 fm.

But the options are 355, 177, etc. Wait, 66.688 is about 25% of option B (355), which is 5 times larger.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to multiply by 2. Then 16.864 * 2=33.728, which is still not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply by twice the sum. 16.864 *2=33.728; 33.728/(0.25307)=133.34 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me recheck.

E=50 MeV.

k = E/(ħ c) =50 / (197.3 MeV fm) )=50/197.3≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

Yes.

Hmm. Perhaps the correct answer is option C:177.675 fm. Because 177.675 is approximately 5.3 times 33.5.

But I don't see a way to get that factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f(0)= (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l).

Which gives13.38205/0.25307≈52.88 fm, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the real part. But the question says imaginary.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f(0)= (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

Which is 16.864/(2*0.25307)=33.344 fm.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but among the options, the closest is option C:177.675 fm, which is approximately 5.3 times 33.344.

But I can't find a reason for that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum more accurately.

sum (2l+1)*sin(2δ_l):

l=0: 1* sin(180)=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134)=3 *0.7193398003=2.1580194.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 *0.9396926208=4.698463104.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7 *0.8660254038=6.062177826.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9 *0.4383711468=3.945340321.

Sum=2.1580194 +4.698463104=6.856482504 +6.062177826=12.91866033 +3.945340321=16.86400065.

Yes, same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula should have a factor of 2 from the sum. Maybe I should multiply the sum by 2.

Then, 16.864 *2=33.728.

But 33.728/0.25307≈133.34 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply the sum by 1/(k^2).

k=0.25307 fm^{-1} →k^2≈0.06405 fm^{-2}.

So sum=16.864.

16.864/(0.06405)=263.3 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm not able to find a matching result, so perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Looking at the options, option C is 177.675 fm, which is approximately 5.3 times 33.5. But without a clear path, I can't justify why that would be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f(0)= (1/(k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which is13.38205/0.25307≈52.88 fm. Not matching.

Wait, wait a minute. Another possibility: perhaps the formula is Im f(0)= (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} P_l(1).

But P_l(1)=1, so it's the same as (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l}.

Which brings us back to the earlier calculation, giving Im f(0)= -37.29 fm.

But that's not an option.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} -1.

But that would complicate things further.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the optical theorem.

The optical theorem states that the total cross-section is sigma_total = 4π |f(0)|^2, and also sigma_total = 4π (Im f(0))/k.

Wait, no, the optical theorem says sigma_total = 4π (Im f(0,0))/k.

Wait, let me check.

Optical theorem: sigma_total = 4π (Im f(0))/k.

So, sigma_total =4π (Im f(0))/k.

But I don't know the cross-section, so perhaps this isn't helpful.

But if I have Im f(0)= (k sigma_total)/(4π ), and without sigma_total, I can't proceed.

So, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps the intended answer is option C:177.675 fm, which is approximately 5.3 times my initial calculation. But I can't see why that would be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D:251.271 fm, which is roughly 7.5 times my result.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f(0)= (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which gives 13.38205/0.25307≈52.88 fm. But that's not an option.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum as (2l+1) * (1 - cos(2δ_l)), but this doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the imaginary part is (1/(2ik)) multiplied by the sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (1 - e^{i 2δ_l} ).

But that complicates it further.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f(0)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (1 + cos δ_l).

But this is getting too complicated without a clear path.

In conclusion, after multiple approaches, I think the intended answer is option C:177.675 fm, but I'm not confident in this choice. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B:355.351 fm, which is roughly twice option C.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the sum should be multiplied by 2 because each term (2l+1) is counted for two. But I don't see why that would be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f(0)= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which would be 1 +3*0.9205 +5*0.8192 +7*0.5 +9*0.22495.

Which is 1 +2.7615 +4.096 +3.5 +2.02455=13.382.

But that's not matching any options.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im f(0) = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l )/ (2k).

Which is 13.382/(2 *0.25307)=13.382/0.50614≈26.43 fm.

No, that doesn't match.

I think I've exhausted all my options, so I'll have to make a guess based on the calculation I did earlier where the sum was 16.864 and k=0.25307, giving 66.688 fm. But this isn't an option. The closest option is B:355.351 fm, which is about five times that. So perhaps I missed a factor of 5.3 somewhere.

But without further insight, I can't determine the correct answer. I'll have to go with the calculation I think is correct, which is 33.344 fm, but since it's not an option, I'm likely missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:177.675 fm, which is exactly 5.3 times 33.5. Perhaps there's a factor of 5.3 I missed, but I can't figure out where.


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( \text{Im} f(0) \), for elastic electron scattering at the incident beam direction (\( \theta = 0^\circ \)) using the given phase shifts \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \). The formula for \( \text{Im} f(0) \) is derived from the partial wave expansion and is given by:

\[
\text{Im} f(0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l),
\]

where \( k \) is the wave number of the electrons, calculated using \( k = \frac{E}{\hbar c} \). For \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \), \( k \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1} \).

### Key Steps:
1. **Sum Calculation**: The sum \( \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \) is computed for each \( l \):
   - \( l=0 \): \( \sin(180^\circ) = 0 \), contribution = \( 1 \cdot 0 = 0 \).
   - \( l=1 \): \( \sin(134^\circ) \approx 0.7193 \), contribution = \( 3 \cdot 0.7193 \approx 2.1579 \).
   - \( l=2 \): \( \sin(110^\circ) \approx 0.9397 \), contribution = \( 5 \cdot 0.9397 \approx 4.6985 \).
   - \( l=3 \): \( \sin(60^\circ) \approx 0.8660 \), contribution = \( 7 \cdot 0.8660 \approx 6.062 \).
   - \( l=4 \): \( \sin(26^\circ) \approx 0.4384 \), contribution = \( 9 \cdot 0.4384 \approx 3.9456 \).

   Total sum: \( 0 + 2.1579 + 4.6985 + 6.062 + 3.9456 \approx 16.864 \).

2. **Wave Number**: \( k \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1} \).

3. **Imaginary Part**: Substituting into the formula:
   \[
   \text{Im} f(0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \cdot 16.864.
   \]
   Since \( \frac{1}{2ik} = -\frac{i}{2k} \), the imaginary part is:
   \[
   \text{Im} f(0) = \frac{16.864}{2k} = \frac{16.864}{2 \cdot 0.253} \approx 33.344 \, \text{fm}.
   \]

### Discrepancy with Options:
The calculated value \( \text{Im} f(0) \approx 33.344 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. The closest option is **C) 177.675 fm**, which is approximately 5.3 times larger than the computed result. Despite extensive recalculations and checking for potential errors in the formula, the discrepancy remains unexplained. Given the lack of clarity, the most reasonable choice based on the options is:

**Answer: C**
