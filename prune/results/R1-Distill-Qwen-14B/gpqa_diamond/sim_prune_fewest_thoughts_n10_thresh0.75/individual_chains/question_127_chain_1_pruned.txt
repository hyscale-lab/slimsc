Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here about what happens when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated. Hmm, I remember from my notes that heating dienes can lead to some kind of rearrangement. Oh right, maybe it's about pericyclic reactions, like the Cope rearrangement or something similar.

Wait, the molecule given is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Let me draw that structure. Nona means nine carbons total. The double bonds are at positions 2 and 6. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Let me think again. Oh, wait, 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. So the substituent is a butyl group at position 5.

So nona is nine carbons, and the substituent is a butyl (four carbons) attached to the fifth carbon. The diene has double bonds at 2 and 6. So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2?

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, the main chain is nine carbons long, with double bonds at 2 and 6. So positions 1 to 9.

Wait, the substituent is a butyl group on the fifth carbon. So the structure would be:

1: CH2-
