Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let me think... The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ is the Pauli vector and n is a unit vector. I remember that the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, and they form the Pauli vector when combined as σ = σx i + σy j + σz k. But wait, no, actually, the Pauli vector is just σ · n, I think. Or wait, no, n is a unit vector direction, so σ · n would be the sum of each Pauli matrix multiplied by the corresponding component of n. 

But regardless, the problem is about finding the eigenvalues. I recall that for a spin-1/2 system, the Pauli matrices are involved in the Hamiltonian, and the eigenvalues depend on the expectation value in the given direction.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices, each with eigenvalues ±1. But when you take the dot product with a unit vector n, you're essentially projecting the Pauli matrices onto that direction. The operator σ · n would then be a 2x2 matrix, and its eigenvalues should be ±1 because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, and the direction won't change that. But wait, wait, what's the actual matrix?

Hmm, no, maybe I should think differently. The eigenvalues of any matrix of the form σ · n are ±1. Because the trace of σ · n is zero, since each Pauli
