Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I remember that in scattering experiments, the scattering amplitude plays a big role, and it's often complex, meaning it has both real and imaginary parts. But the question specifically asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction.

Wait, the given data is phase shifts: δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, δ₄. The values are 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13° respectively. The problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄, so maybe only these five are considered.

I think the formula for the scattering amplitude involves these phase shifts. Oh right! The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all the partial waves. Each term is related to the Legendre polynomials multiplied by some exponential of the phase shifts.

The general formula, as far as I remember, is f(θ) = sum from l=0 to L of ( (2l+1) / (2l) ) * [ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) / (2ik) ] * P_l(cosθ) )

But wait, the question asks for the imaginary part along the incident direction. The incident direction is θ=0°, so we're looking at f(0). 

So, when θ is 0°, cosθ is 1, and each Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Oh, right! Because P_l(1) = 1 for any l. That simplifies things a lot because each term in the sum just becomes (2l+1)/(2l) multiplied by that exponential factor.

So, the formula simplifies to f(0) = sum from l=0 to L [ (2l+1)/(2l) * (e^{2iδ_l} -1) / (2ik) ) ]

Wait, but what is k here? Oh, right, k is the wave number, which is related to the momentum of the electrons. Since the electrons are 50 MeV, I might need to compute k.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. The electrons have kinetic energy T, so the total energy is E = T + m_e c². But wait, since T is 50 MeV, and m_e c
