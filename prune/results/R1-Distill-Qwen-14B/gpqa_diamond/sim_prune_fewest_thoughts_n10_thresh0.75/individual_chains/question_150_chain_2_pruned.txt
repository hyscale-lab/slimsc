Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these NMR problems and reaction mechanisms.

The question is about a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and then it undergoes a series of reactions. The task is to identify the final product from the given options.

First, I'll start by analyzing the NMR data to determine the structure of the starting compound. The NMR is given in ppm, and I know each signal corresponds to a set of protons in a specific environment.

Looking at the data:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): A triplet around 9.7 ppm. That's a high chemical shift, so it's probably an aldehyde proton. But wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet or maybe a triplet if coupled with adjacent protons. So this fits as a aldehyde group.

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet integrating for 2H. This could be aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted since it's a doublet. Like in a benzene ring with substituents where each pair is adjacent to the substituent.

- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, 2H. This might be another aromatic ring, perhaps ortho or para to another substituent. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a conjugated system, like an enone or something with conjugated double bonds.

- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. Broad signals can be due to exchange with a proton like in an -OH group, but it's a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's some vinylic protons that are deshielded. Wait, but in some cases, like if there's an enol structure or adjacent to an electronegative group, the signal can be broad. Or maybe it's some sort of coupling that's not being split well. Hmm.

- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet integrating for 2H. This looks like a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Maybe an OCH2 group. For example, a methylene next to an oxygen, like in a carbonyl group or an ether. The doublet suggests coupling with another CH2 group.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is something like a benzaldehyde derivative with some substitution. Let me think about the possible structure.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. 

Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0 (no halogens), N=1.

So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2= (10)/2=5.

So five degrees: that could be a ring (like benzene, which is 3 degrees) and an aldehyde (one DoU, as it's a double bond to oxygen, but wait, DoU counts each double bond or ring as one. So a benzene ring is 3 DoU (three double bonds, but each double bond counts as one, but for benzene, it's three double bonds but as a ring, it's considered three DoU). But wait, actually, each ring or double bond is one DoU. So a benzene is three rings (since it's three double bonds in a ring, so each double bond counts as one, so three DoU). Then, an aldehyde is a double bond (so another DoU). So 3+1=4. But our total is 5, so remaining is one more DoU. That could be another double bond or a ring. Or perhaps another functional group.

Wait, maybe another double bond. Let's see.
