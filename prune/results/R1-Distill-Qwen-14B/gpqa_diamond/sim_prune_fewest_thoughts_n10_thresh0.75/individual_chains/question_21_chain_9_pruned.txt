Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The question is in two parts, A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism.

First, I need to understand what each term means. Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between adjacent atoms, leading to different tautomers. Like how ketones and aldehydes can tautomerize if they have the right structure. Optical isomerism, on the other hand, occurs when a compound has a chiral center, making it able to rotate plane-polarized light.

So, looking at part A: the compounds are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I need to see which one doesn't show tautomerism.

Benzoquinone is a quinone, which I remember is similar to a diketone. Quinones can undergo keto-enol tautomerism because they have the necessary conjugated double bonds. So benzoquinone can tautomerize, right?

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups. Wait, that's a tricyclic structure. Each ketone is at the 1,3,5 positions. I'm thinking about tautomerism here. For a compound to show tautomerism, it needs to have a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group that can shift, leading to a different structure. But in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is between two other carbonyls. So maybe the hydrogen isn't available to shift because of the ring structure? Or perhaps the arrangement doesn't allow for enol formation. I'm not entirely sure, but I think that tricyclic diketones or triketones might not have the necessary hydrogen in the right position for tautomerism. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione might not show tautomerism, making it the answer for part A.

Moving to part B: the compounds are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate. Which one shows optical isomerism?

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has the formula CH3C(OH)COOCH3. Wait, the structure: the hydroxyl is on the second carbon, so the molecule is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Let me draw this out. The central carbon (second carbon) has a hydroxyl, a methyl, a carbonyl group, and the ester group. So that's four different groups attached to the central carbon. Oh wait, wait. Let me check: the structure is more like O=C(OCH3)-CH(OH)-CH3. No, wait, no. No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But as the methyl ester, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure is CH3-C(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, no, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-... Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the carbon with the OH) is attached to: a CH3 group, a COOCH3 group, an OH group, and a hydrogen? Wait, no. Let me think again: the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3
