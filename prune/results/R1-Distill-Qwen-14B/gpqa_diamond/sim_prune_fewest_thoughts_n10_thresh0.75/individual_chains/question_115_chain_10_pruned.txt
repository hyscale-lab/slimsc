Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's going on.

So, the setup is that an electron and a positron are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron is moving from the left, and the positron from the right. Their Lorentz factors are 4 and 2, respectively. Then they collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is going upper-right, the other lower-right. We need to find the angle between them.

Hmm, okay. Lorentz factors... I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is equal to 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So gamma is greater than 1 because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Wait, but when particles annihilate, they produce photons. Since the electron and positron are matter and antimatter, they annihilate into energy, probably gamma rays. But in this case, it's two photons.

Now, in such annihilation processes, conservation laws must apply. So, conservation of energy and momentum must hold. Since photons carry momentum, even though they have no mass, their momentum is p = E/c, and direction matters.

So, the initial system has the electron and positron moving towards each other. So their momenta are opposite in direction. But since their speeds are different (because their gamma factors are different), their momenta are different.

Wait, but the positron has a positive charge but moving from the right, so let's think about their velocities. The electron is moving left to right? Wait, no: the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, so its velocity is to the right. The positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is also to the left? Or wait, no, a positron is like a positive electron, so if it's moving from the right, its velocity is towards the left? Or wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think: the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So if you imagine the positive direction along the x-axis, then the electron is moving from the left to the right, positive direction. The positron is moving from the right to the left, so negative direction.

Wait,
