Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it step by step. 

Alright, the problem states that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. 

The question is about finding the difference between the correct kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are A to D, with differences in MeV.

Wait, the rest-mass energy is given as 300 GeV. But the sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of M. So M is 300 GeV/c², and the sum of the two fragments' rest masses is 0.99 * M, which would be 297 GeV/c². 

Wait wait, no. Wait, the rest-mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV. So M is the rest mass, which is 300 GeV/c². Then the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 0.99 * M, so 0.99 * 300 GeV/c² = 297 GeV/c².

The fragments are such that one is twice as massive as the other. Let's denote the lighter fragment's mass as m, so the heavier is 2m. So m + 2m = 3m = 297 GeV/c². So 3m = 297 GeV/c² → m = 99 GeV/c². So the masses are 99 and 198 GeV/c².

Wait, but wait. The initial nucleus is at rest, so when it splits, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Since the initial momentum is zero, their momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So the total momentum after fission is zero, which is correct.

So the problem is about the kinetic energies of the two fragments. Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the energy comes from the rest mass converting into kinetic energy and binding energy (but maybe the problem ignores that because it says to ignore electrons, but not sure about binding energy). Hmm, but the problem says, "sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M." So the initial rest mass is M = 300 GeV/c², and the sum of the fragments' rest masses is 0.99 M = 297 GeV/c². So the initial nucleus had more rest mass than the sum of the fragments. Therefore, the energy released in the fission is the difference between M and the sum of the rest masses of the fragments, which is 3 GeV. But wait, that's the rest mass energy difference. But since the fragments are moving, we
