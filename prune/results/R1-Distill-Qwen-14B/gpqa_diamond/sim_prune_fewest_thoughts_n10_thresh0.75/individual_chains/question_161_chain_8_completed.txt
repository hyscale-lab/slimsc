Okay, let's try to figure this problem out. So, the question is about the mean free path of gas molecules in a transmission electron microscope. Hmm, I remember that mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. Right?

In the beginning, Mike creates an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment. The pressure is really low, less than 10^-9 Torr. He measures the mean free path as λ1. So under these conditions, the molecules should have a longer mean free path because the pressure is low—there aren't many molecules, so they don't collide as often. That makes sense because at lower pressures, the mean free path increases.

But then, when he turns on the electron beam, something changes. The mean free path becomes λ2 instead of staying λ1. And the temperature is the same, so that's not a factor. So why would the mean free path change?

Wait, when the electron beam is active, it's likely producing a lot of electrons. These electrons will interact with the gas molecules in the compartment. Oh right, the electrons can cause the gas molecules to ionize. When gas molecules ionize, they become charged. Charged particles in a vacuum—like in an electron microscope—will experience the electric fields of the microscope's components. So these ions might get accelerated or influenced in their movement.

But how does that affect the mean free path? Well, the mean free path depends on the number of collisions. If the gas molecules are neutral, their main way of interacting is through elastic collisions. But once they're ionized, they can have different behaviors. For one, ionized particles might stick to the walls of the chamber, which would effectively remove them from the gas phase. This reduces the number density of the gas molecules in the compartment because some are now on the walls. 

Wait, but if the number density decreases, the mean free path should increase, right? Because the molecules don't collide as much. That would mean λ2 is larger than λ1. But wait, the options don't all have that. Let me look at the options again.

Option A says λ2 >= 1.22λ1. Option C says λ2 < λ1. So if ionization reduces the number of gas molecules, the number density (n) goes down. Since mean free path λ is inversely proportional to n, a lower n would mean a higher λ. So λ2 should be larger than λ1. That would suggest option A or D, but D says λ2 is between λ1 and 1.22λ1. Hmm.

Wait, but wait another point. If the gas is ionized, the ions can have different cross-sectional areas for collisions. Or maybe the ions are moving faster due to the electric fields? Or perhaps the ions are being pumped away more efficiently because charged particles are more likely to interact with the walls or the pumps.

Alternatively, if the ions are being attracted to the walls, they might not stay in the vacuum compartment as long. So the effective pressure of the gas decreases because some of the molecules are removed from the space—adsorbed onto the walls or other parts of the chamber. This would decrease the pressure, which would increase the mean free path. So, λ2 would be longer than λ1.

Wait, so λ2 > λ1. Looking at the options, option A is λ2 >= 1.22λ1. Option C is λ2 < λ1, which would be the opposite. So the correct answer must be A or another option.

But wait, another thought. The mean free path is given by λ = 1/(√2 n π d²), where d is the collision diameter and n the number density. If the gas becomes ionized, perhaps the cross-section for collisions increases. Wait, why would that be? Because when ions are formed, their effective size might be larger due to electron clouds, making it easier to collide. But wait, if the ions are sticking to the walls, the number density n decreases, which would increase λ. Alternatively, if the ions are moving faster (because they're charged and in an electric field), their mean speed is higher, which would also increase λ, because λ is proportional to speed. So either way, λ increases.

Wait, but the initial condition is a vacuum with λ1. When the beam is on, the gas is ionized. The ions might be pumped out more effectively, so the effective pressure is lower. So n decreases, so λ increases. So λ2 is larger than λ1. Therefore, λ2 > λ1.

Looking at the options, the options that have λ2 > λ1 are A and D. But what's the exact factor?

Wait, the mean free path in a gas is also influenced by the root mean square speed. If the ions are accelerated by the electric field, their speed might change. Wait, but the sample compartment's temperature is the same. So thermal speed might be the same. Unless the ions are being given additional energy from the beam, but the question says the temperature remains the same. Hmm.

Wait, another angle. When the gas is ionized, the ions might have a different effective cross-section. For neutral particles, the collision is elastic and based on their atomic size. For ions, perhaps the cross-section is larger because they have a larger electron cloud, making it easier to collide. So in that case, the collision cross-section increases, which would reduce the mean free path. But if the ions are being removed from the compartment more quickly (like sticking to walls or being pumped away), the number density would decrease, which would increase the mean free path.

So which effect dominates? I think the removal of ions from the compartment (adsorption) would be a bigger factor because it reduces n. So even if the cross-section increases, if n drops significantly, the overall effect might still be an increase in the mean free path.

Alternatively, if the ions are accelerated towards the walls or other parts of the microscope, causing them to leave the sample compartment, the effective pressure would drop. So the number density n is lower, so λ increases.

So λ2 would be larger than λ1. So looking at the options, the possibilities are A or D. Option A says λ2 >= 1.22λ1. Option D says it's between λ1 and 1.22λ1.

Wait, why would it be exactly 1.22? I'm not sure. 1.22 is approximately sqrt( (3/2)/(1/2) )? Wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, 1.22 could be related to the factor of sqrt(2) or something else. Alternatively, perhaps when the gas is ionized, the effective cross-section increases by a factor of 2, which would halve the mean free path. But that would mean λ2 is 0.5λ1, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps when the gas is ionized, the collision cross-section doubles. Then, since λ is inversely proportional to the square root of n times the collision diameter squared. Wait, no, the formula is λ = 1/(sqrt(2) n π d²). So if d increases, λ decreases. But if n decreases, λ increases.

Wait, but if the ionization leads to a doubling of d (for example), then the mean free path would decrease by a factor of 4 (since d is squared). But if the number density n is halved, then the mean free path would double. So if both factors happen, let's say d doubles and n is halved, then the effect on λ would be (1/4) from d and (2) from n. So overall λ would be 0.5 times. But that would mean λ2 is half of λ1, which is contrary to what I thought earlier.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the key here is that when the gas is ionized, the ions are more likely to be removed from the system. So the effective number density of the gas molecules (neutral and ionized) is lower, which would increase the mean free path.

Assuming that when the beam is on, the number of gas molecules in the compartment effectively is lower than when it's off. So λ2 is longer than λ1. So the mean free path increases.

So looking back at the options, option A is λ2 >= 1.22λ1 and option C is λ2 < λ1. So the correct answer must be either A or another option.

Wait, the question says that λ1 is the mean free path under the ultra-high vacuum without the beam. When the beam is on, the mean free path becomes λ2. So if the number of gas molecules is lower, the mean free path increases, so λ2 > λ1. So the correct answer must be that λ2 is greater than λ1.

Looking at the options, option A is λ2 >= 1.22λ1, which is a possibility. Option D is λ1 < λ2 < 1.22λ1. So why would λ2 be exactly in that range?

Wait, perhaps when the beam is on, the electrons cause the gas molecules to ionize, which increases their effective cross-section for scattering. So, for the same number density, the mean free path would decrease. But if the number density also decreases because ions get stuck on the walls, we have a combination of two effects: n decreases (so λ increases) and d increases (so λ decreases). Which effect is stronger?

Suppose the number density decreases by a factor k, and the collision diameter increases by a factor m. Then λ scales as (k/m²). So if k is 0.5 and m is 2, λ would be 0.5/(2²) = 0.5/4 = 0.125. So λ decreases. But that's just a hypothetical case.

Alternatively, perhaps the number density decreases more significantly than the collision diameter increases. So the net effect would be an increase in mean free path.

But without exact values, it's tricky. But in the scenario given, Mike observed that λ2 is not equal to λ1. So the mean free path changes when the beam is on. Since the pressure is the same, but the gas is ionized, the mean free path must have changed.

Another approach: the presence of the electron beam introduces another factor—electric fields. The ions are charged and will experience Lorentz forces. This can cause them to move in the direction of the electric field, leading to a drift in the gas. This could effectively reduce the number density in the beam path, but I'm not sure how that affects the mean free path.

Wait, perhaps the electric field causes the ions to move, effectively making the mean free path longer because they're moving faster or in a way that they don't collide as much in the region of interest.

Alternatively, the presence of the beam might increase the temperature of the gas locally, but the problem states that the sample compartment's temperature remains the same. So thermal effects due to beam heating are not the issue.

Wait, if the ions are being accelerated by the electric field, their velocity could increase, which would increase the mean free path because the time between collisions is longer. Because mean free path λ = v * τ, where τ is the mean time between collisions. If v increases, τ might not change much if the density is the same, but if v increases and density decreases, τ increases more. So λ increases.

But I'm not entirely certain. Maybe another approach: when the gas is ionized, the ions are more likely to stick to surfaces, reducing the effective pressure. So the effective pressure becomes lower, leading to a longer mean free path.

So, if the pressure is lower, the mean free path is longer. Therefore, λ2 > λ1. So the correct option is either A or D.

Wait, the options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

B) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1

So the question is, does λ2 exceed λ1 by more than 22% (option A) or only up to 22% (option D)?

Hmm, perhaps when the gas is ionized, the ions are more likely to be removed from the system, causing the effective n to drop significantly. But without exact numbers, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path cannot be more than 1.22 times λ1 because of some other factor, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: when gas is ionized, it's possible that the ions are either positively or negatively charged, which might cause them to be attracted to the anode or cathode in the electron microscope. This could cause them to be pumped away more effectively, further reducing the pressure, which would increase λ2 beyond λ1.

But without knowing the exact factors, perhaps the correct conclusion is that λ2 is longer than λ1. So among the options, A or D. But why would it be between λ1 and 1.22λ1?

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path can't increase beyond a certain point because the electron beam itself is a factor. Or maybe the increase is small.

Wait, Mike noticed that λ2 is no longer λ1. So the mean free path has changed. But which way?

If the gas is ionized and the ions are removed, n decreases, so λ increases. So λ2 > λ1. So the options are A and D.

But why would the factor be 1.22? I'm not sure, but maybe it's a standard factor when considering the effect of ionization. Alternatively, perhaps the cross-section changes, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps when the gas is ionized, the effective collision cross-section increases by a factor of sqrt(2), so the mean free path would decrease by a factor of 2. But if the number density also decreases by a factor of 0.5, then the overall effect would be a decrease in λ by a factor of (sqrt(2))² = 2, so λ2 would be λ1 / 2. But that would make λ2 < λ1, which contradicts.

Alternatively, maybe the cross-section decreases. If the gas remains neutral, the cross-section is d; when ionized, maybe the cross-section is less, so collisions are less frequent. That would increase λ. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the ions are more massive, but that's not relevant here.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The main factor is that when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are ionized, and the ions stick to the walls, reducing n, thus increasing λ. So λ2 > λ1. Therefore, the options are A or D.

But the question is, which one is correct? Do we know any reason why λ2 would be more than 1.22 times or less than that?

I'm not sure. But the problem says that some gas particles remained inside the compartment as detected by the mass spectrometer, so n is not zero. But when the beam is on, perhaps the ionization makes the effective n lower than before, so λ increases.

Wait, the original mean free path λ1 is calculated under the conditions of the vacuum state. When the beam is on, the pressure is effectively lower, so λ2 should be longer. So option A says λ2 is >= 1.22λ1, which is plausible, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the mean free path cannot be more than 1.22λ1 because of some other effect. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is that λ2 is less than λ1. Wait, what if the presence of the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be excited, leading to more collisions. Wait, that would decrease the mean free path.

Wait, no. The electron beam is a source of energy, but the gas molecules are already at the same temperature. So the thermal motion isn't changing. But the beam could cause ionization, which affects their behavior.

Wait, perhaps when the gas is ionized, the mean free path is actually smaller. Because ions might have a higher cross-section for scattering. So if cross-section increases, the mean free path decreases.

Wait, but the number density could also decrease because ions stick to the walls. So if n decreases but cross-section increases, which effect wins?

Suppose the cross-section increases by a factor of 2. Then, the mean free path would be halved (since λ is inversely proportional to the cross-section). But if n decreases by a factor of 4, then λ would be 4 times larger. So the net effect would be a doubling of the mean free path.

But without knowing the exact factors, it's hard to say. But in the problem, Mike's observation is that λ2 is not equal to λ1. So he notices a change.

Given all this, I think the correct conclusion is that λ2 is larger than λ1. So the options are A or D.

Wait, but I'm stuck between two options. The question says that the problem is about electron scattering with gas molecules. So when the beam is on, the electrons are scattering more, which could imply more collisions. But wait, no—the mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. So if the mean free path is shorter, it means more collisions. If the mean free path is longer, fewer collisions. If Mike is observing that the mean free path is λ2, which is different from λ1.

Wait, the question says that when the beam is on, the mean free path is λ2, and it's not equal to λ1. So if electrons are causing more scattering, that would imply more collisions, leading to a shorter mean free path. But earlier I thought that the ionization leads to a lower n, which would increase λ.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the beam introduces additional mechanisms for electron scattering, which might not be accounted for in the calculation of λ1. So the presence of the beam increases the scattering, leading to a shorter mean free path. But that would require that the beam makes the gas molecules more likely to collide.

Alternatively, perhaps the beam's electric field causes the gas molecules to move in such a way that their effective mean free path is longer because they're being accelerated away from each other.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of this differently. The mean free path is determined by gas density, molecular size, and temperature. When the electron beam is on, it's ionizing the gas, but the temperature is the same.

If the gas is ionized, the effective cross-section for collisions (d) could change. For example, if the ions have a larger effective size, d increases, so λ decreases. But if the ions are being removed from the compartment, n decreases, which increases λ.

Which effect is more significant? It depends on how much n changes versus how much d changes.

If the ionization leads to a significant reduction in n, then λ2 would be larger than λ1. If d increases but n doesn't change much, λ would decrease.

But in Mike's case, the mean free path changed, so which one is it?

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to be more ionized, which leads to a lower mean free path because the ions have more opportunities for collisions. Or maybe the opposite.

Hmm. Another approach: Let's consider the formula for mean free path. The mean free path λ is given by:

λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * n)

Where k is Boltzmann's constant, T temperature, d the collision diameter, and n the number density.

If the temperature T is the same, and considering that the collision diameter d might change upon ionization, and n might change.

If the gas is ionized, but the number density n remains roughly the same, but d increases (because ions are bigger), then λ would decrease.

But in reality, the presence of the electron beam would lead to more ionization, and these ions might stick to the walls, reducing n, which would increase λ.

So if n decreases, λ increases. If d increases, λ decreases. Which effect is dominant?

Suppose that n is halved, and d increases by a factor of 1.5.

Then, λ would be (1/2) / (1.5^2) ) = (1/2)/(2.25) ≈ 0.222. So λ would decrease.

But if n decreases by a factor of 4, and d increases by a factor of 2, λ would be (1/4)/(4) )= 1/16, which is much smaller. Hmm, but this is getting too hypothetical.

Alternatively, perhaps the dominant factor is that the ionization leads to a significant reduction in n, so λ increases.

If that's the case, then λ2 > λ1. So the options are A and D. Without knowing the exact factor, perhaps the answer is A, assuming that the mean free path increases by more than 22%.

But wait, why 1.22? That's about sqrt(1.5), which is approximately 1.2247. Hmm, maybe it's a factor that comes from considering the effective increase in cross-section or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C, λ2 < λ1. Because when the beam is on, the gas is more ionized, and the ions have a higher cross-section for scattering, so more collisions happen, leading to a shorter mean free path.

But I thought earlier that the number density would drop because ions stick to the walls, leading to a longer mean free path.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to make a decision.

If the mean free path when the beam is off is λ1, and when the beam is on it's λ2, and the compartment is under ultra-high vacuum.

When the beam is on, more gas molecules are ionized and perhaps removed from the space (adsorbed on walls), so n decreases → λ increases.

Thus, λ2 > λ1.

Looking at the options, A and D have λ2 greater than λ1.

The question is, which option is correct? The options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22λ1

But the problem doesn't specify by how much λ changes. So given that the problem states Mike accurately determined λ1, but upon beam initiation, it's different. So the correct conclusion is that λ2 is no longer equal to λ1, but it's longer.

So either option A or D.

But perhaps the factor is less than 1.22, so D. Or perhaps it's more.

If the gas is ionized and sticking to the walls, the effective n could drop significantly, making λ2 much larger than λ1, so option A.

But I'm not certain. Maybe the correct answer is C, λ2 < λ1. But I don't see why.

Wait, another thought. The presence of the electron beam causes the gas to become ionized, and ions can have a different behavior. But electrons in the beam are also contributing to scattering. If the electron beam scatters the gas molecules more effectively, then the mean free path would be shorter. Because the electrons hit the gas molecules more often, causing more collisions.

Wait, no. The mean free path is about the gas molecules colliding with each other, not with electrons. Or does it?

Wait, the mean free path in this context is about gas molecules colliding with each other. The electron beam is another source of scattering, but perhaps that's a different effect. So the mean free path λ is about gas-gas collisions, not gas-electron.

So, if the gas remains at the same pressure and temperature, the mean free path for gas-gas collisions would remain λ1, unless the composition changes (e.g., more ions). But if the ions have a larger cross-section, gas-gas collisions would have a larger d, leading to a shorter λ.

But if the ions are being removed, n decreases, leading to a longer λ.

So, which effect is stronger? If the cross-section increases, but n decreases, which effect dominates?

Hmm, perhaps the answer is that λ2 is less than λ1. Because the ions' cross-section increases more than the decrease in n. So λ2 < λ1. But earlier I thought that n would decrease more, making λ2 larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the ionization leads to a higher effective cross-section, reducing the mean free path. So λ2 < λ1.

But that would make option C correct. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but when the gas is ionized, the effective pressure in terms of number density might decrease, leading to longer λ. But the collision cross-section might increase, which would lead to shorter λ. So which effect is bigger?

If the gas molecules are ionized and sticking to the walls, n decreases, which would lead to longer λ. But if the cross-section increases, that would lead to shorter λ. The net effect depends on the relative changes.

But without exact numbers, perhaps the correct answer is that λ2 is larger than λ1, so options A or D.

Wait, but the problem states that Mike observed λ2, which is different from λ1. So he must have noticed that the mean free path changed due to the beam's presence.

If the beam causes the gas to ionize and the ions to stick to the walls, the effective pressure is lower, so λ increases. So λ2 > λ1.

In that case, between options A and D, which is correct?

The question is, which option fits this conclusion? So either A or D.

But why would the 1.22 factor be in play here? Maybe it's a red herring, and the correct answer is that λ2 is larger than λ1, so A is the correct option.

Wait, but the options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22λ1

C) λ2 < λ1

But the question says that Mike accurately determined the mean free path as λ1, then upon initiating the beam, observed λ2. So the question is, what can we conclude about λ2?

If the presence of the beam (which ionizes the gas) leads to a longer mean free path (because n is lower), then λ2>λ1, so the correct answer is either A or D.

But without knowing how much λ2 has increased, perhaps the best we can conclude is that λ2 is longer than λ1, which is option A or D.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that says λ2 > λ1 without a specific factor. Wait, looking back, option A is λ2 >=1.22λ1, and option D is λ1 < λ2 <1.22λ1. So the only way we can conclude that λ2 is longer is if we know the factor.

But the question doesn't provide any data on how much λ2 has changed, so the correct conclusion is that λ2 is longer than λ1. So the correct options are either A or D.

But the problem states that the mean free path is no longer equal to λ1, implying that it's different, but whether it's higher or lower depends on the factors.

Wait, another approach. The presence of the beam will cause the gas to be ionized, and the ions can be accelerated towards the walls, leading to more efficient pumping. So the pressure in the compartment decreases, leading to a longer mean free path.

Therefore, λ2 must be longer than λ1. So the correct options are A or D.

But the question doesn't give the exact factor. So perhaps the correct answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1, but without knowing by how much. However, all the options provide specific factors.

Wait, the problem says "some gas particles remained inside the compartment as detected by the mass spectrometer". So the pressure isn't zero, but when the beam is on, the presence of the beam causes the gas molecules to change their behavior.

But perhaps the correct answer is that λ2 is longer than λ1. So the correct option is A or D. Since without knowing the exact factor, but if the mean free path increases, A says it's at least 1.22 times.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C, but I don't see why.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes more scattering of the gas molecules, leading to a lower mean free path. But that would imply that the gas molecules are colliding more, so λ decreases, making λ2 < λ1. But earlier I thought that the ionization leads to a lower n, so longer λ.

Hmm, this is really tricky. I think I need to make a choice.

Given the situation, I think λ2 is longer than λ1 because the ionized gas molecules are being removed from the compartment, reducing n, thus increasing the mean free path. So λ2 > λ1.

Looking at the options, the possible answers are A and D. But without knowing the exact factor, perhaps the correct conclusion is that λ2 is at least 1.22 times larger than λ1.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the factor isn't that high, so λ2 is between λ1 and 1.22λ1, making D the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the factor of 1.22 comes from the fact that when the gas is ionized, the effective diameter increases by a factor of sqrt(2), leading to a mean free path that's 1/sqrt(2) times smaller, but if the number density decreases by a factor of 1.5, then:

λ2 = λ1 * (n1/n2) * (d2/d1)^2.

If n2 = n1 * k (k <1), and d2 = d1 * m (m>1), then λ2 = λ1 * (1/k) * (m^2).

If, for example, k is 0.5 and m is 1.1, then λ2 = λ1 * 2 * (1.21) = 2.42 λ1, which is more than 1.22.

But without knowing the exact factors, this is speculative.

In conclusion, I think the correct answer is that λ2 is larger than λ1, and without more information, the best choice is A: λ2 >= 1.22λ1.


The question revolves around the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in the sample compartment of a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. Initially, under ultra-high vacuum conditions (< 10⁻⁹ Torr), Mike determines the mean free path to be λ₁. However, upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ₂, and the task is to determine the relationship between λ₂ and λ₁.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mean Free Path Formula**: The mean free path is inversely proportional to the number density of gas molecules (n) and depends on the collision diameter (d) of the molecules. It is given by:
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \cdot n \cdot \pi \cdot d^2}
   \]
   A decrease in \(n\) or an increase in \(d\) leads to an increase in \(\lambda\), while an increase in \(n\) or a decrease in \(d\) reduces \(\lambda\).

2. **Effect of the Electron Beam**:
   - When the electron beam is activated, it ionizes the gas molecules in the compartment.
   - Ionized molecules (ions) can interact differently with the system:
     - **Reduction in Number Density (\(n\))**: Ions may stick to the walls of the compartment or be pumped away more efficiently, effectively reducing the number density of gas molecules. This would increase the mean free path (\(\lambda\)).
     - **Increase in Collision Diameter (\(d\))**: Ionization can increase the effective collision diameter due to the expanded electron cloud of the ions. This would decrease the mean free path (\(\lambda\)).

3. **Net Effect**:
   - The dominant factor is likely the reduction in \(n\) due to the removal of ions from the compartment. This reduction in \(n\) leads to a significant increase in \(\lambda\).
   - While the increase in \(d\) could slightly reduce \(\lambda\), the overall effect of the reduced \(n\) is expected to dominate, resulting in \(\lambda_2 > \lambda_1\).

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A (\(\lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1\))**: This suggests a substantial increase in the mean free path, consistent with the reduction in \(n\) caused by ion removal.
   - **Option B (\(\lambda_2 = \lambda_1\))**: This contradicts the observation that \(\lambda_2 \neq \lambda_1\), so this option is invalid.
   - **Option C (\(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\))**: This would imply that the mean free path decreases, which is inconsistent with the reduction in \(n\).
   - **Option D (\(\lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < 1.22 \lambda_1\))**: This suggests a smaller increase in \(\lambda_2\) compared to Option A. However, the problem does not provide specific data to support this narrower range.

### Conclusion:
Given the reduction in number density (\(n\)) due to ion removal, the mean free path (\(\lambda_2\)) is expected to be significantly larger than \(\lambda_1\). Among the options, **Option A (\(\lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1\))** is the most consistent with the observed scenario.

Answer: A
