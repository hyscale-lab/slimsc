Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question involves two reactions, and I need to pick the correct reagents A and B from the options provided. The reactions are:

1. Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.
2. 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So, I need to find what reagents A and B are from the options given.

Let's start with the first reaction. The starting material is butan-2-one. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, let me think about the structure of that product. The formula is probably something like (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. No, wait, the name is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Butane has four carbons, with the nitrile group on the first carbon. So the structure would be CH2CH2C(OH)(CH3)CN? Hmm, maybe I should draw it out.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when it reacts with NaCN, which is a nucleophile, perhaps under certain conditions, it does a nucleophilic addition to the ketone.

Wait, in a ketone, the carbonyl is a good electrophile. So when you add a cyanide ion, it would attack the carbonyl carbon. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Or wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CN, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when the cyanide adds, it would form (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile? Wait, maybe I got the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait the butanenitrile part would have four carbons, so the nitrile is on the first carbon. Let's see: butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding cyanide would produce (CH3)2(CN)COH? Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN would lead to the formation of a cyanohydrin. Right, that's a thing. A cyanohydrin is formed when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with cyanide. The
