Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about high-energy astrophysics processes, which I'm still trying to wrap my head around. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. The reaction is gamma gamma → e+ e-. And we're supposed to find the energy of the gamma-rays where their lifetime in the universe is limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a particle is often determined by processes that can cause it to decay or annihilate. So, for these gamma-rays, their lifetime is limited by how quickly they can annihilate via this process. So, the lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the annihilation rate Γ. So τ ~ 1/Γ.

Wait, but wait. Gamma-rays are high-energy photons, so how do they annihilate? Oh right, this is photon-photon annihilation. The gamma-ray (high energy) collides with a CMB photon (low energy) and produces an electron-positron pair. So the process is γ + γ → e+ + e-.

The next thing I need to recall is the cross-section for this process. The cross-section σ for photon-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs. I think the cross-section depends on the energy of the two photons. But since the CMB photons are at a much lower energy than the gamma-rays, I can probably approximate one of the photons as much lower energy. Let me think, the CMB photon energy is 1e-3 eV, and the gamma-ray is much higher, so E_gamma >> E_CMB.

I remember that the cross-section for two photons with energies E1 and E2 is given by a certain formula involving their energies. The cross-section formula for photon-photon → e+ e- is something like σ(E1, E2) ≈ (8π/3) * (α^2/(s)) * (m_e^2) * (ln(s/(4m_e^2))), where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy, s = (E1 +
