Okay, I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Let me start by recalling what factors influence the transit probability.

So, the transit method detects planets when they pass in front of their host star from our point of view. The probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbital plane with our line of sight. Wait, but I remember that the probability isn't just about the size; it also depends on the orbital distance and the size of the star.

I think the formula for the transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by 1/(a^2) * something else? Wait, no, maybe not that. Let me think again. I recall that the transit probability P is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a (1 + m_p / M_s)^(1/3)) )) )^2? No, maybe I'm mixing up some terms here. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is proportional to (R_p/R_s)^2 * (1/(1 + (M_p/(M_s + M_p)))^(1/3)) ). Wait, maybe I should think about the formula as P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (sqrt(1 + (a^2 sin^2 i)) )) ), but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps there's a simpler way. The transit probability is higher when the planet is closer to the star because the chance that the orbital plane is edge-on increases. Also, a larger planet relative to the star increases the chance of a transit because it's more likely to block the starlight.

Wait, actually, the main factors are the relative size of the planet to the star and the alignment of the orbit. But the alignment is a factor that can't be controlled; so for a given setup, the probability depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital period and the size of the orbit.

Wait, let's think about the transit probability formula. The probability P is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / ( (a / R_s) * (1 + (M_p/M_s))^(1/3) )) ), but I'm not confident about this. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a/(R_s) * (1 + (M_p/M_s))^(1/3) )) ), but I might be getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the probability that the inclination is such that the planet transits. The probability of the correct inclination is higher when the semi-major axis a is smaller, because the orbital plane is more likely to be aligned edge-on when the planet is closer.

Wait, I think the formula for the transit probability is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a (1 + (M_p/M_s))^(1/3) )) ). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, I think the probability is higher when the orbital period is shorter because the planet is closer, which increases the chance of alignment.

But wait, let's break it down step by step. Both planets have the same mass, M_p is the same. The orbital period P relates to the semi-major axis a via Kepler's third law. The formula is P^2 = (4π²/G(M_s + M_p)) ) a^3. Since M_p is much smaller than M_s (planets are much less massive than stars), we can approximate M_s + M_p ≈ M_s. So P² ≈ (4π²/(G M_s)) ) a³.

Given that, for each planet:

Planet_1 has P1 = P, Planet_2 has P2 = 3P. Wait, no, the problem says that Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = P, P2 = 3P.

So, using Kepler's law: a³ ∝ M_s * P².

For Planet_1: a1³ = (M_s1) * (P1)².

But wait, for Planet_1, M_s1 is twice that of Planet_2's star. Let me denote M_s2 as the mass of Planet_2's star. So M_s1 = 2*M_s2.

So for Planet_1: a1³ = (2 M_s2) * P1².

For Planet_2: a2³ = M_s2 * (3 P1)^2 = M_s2 * 9 P1².

So a2³ = (9/2) * a1³.

Wait, let's compute a1 and a2.

a1³ = 2 M_s2 * P1² --> a1 = [2 M_s2 P1²]^(1/3).

a2³ = M_s2 * (3P1)^2 = M_s2 * 9 P1². So a2 = [9 M_s2 P1²]^(1/3).

So a2 = [9/2]^(1/3) * a1.

Wait, [9/2] = 4.5, cube root of 4.5 is about 1.65. So a2 is approximately 1.65 times a1.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should think in terms of ratio a2 / a1.

a2³ / a1³ = [9 M_s2 P1²] / [2 M_s2 P1²] ] = 9/2.

So a2/a1 = (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ (4.5)^(0.333) ≈ 1.65.

So a2 is about 1.65 times a1.

But how does a relate to the transit probability?

Another thought: The transit probability is higher when the planet is closer to the star because the orbital plane is more likely to be aligned edge-on. Because when a planet is closer, the Hill sphere (the region where the planet's gravity dominates) is smaller, so the chances for the orbit to be edge-on are higher? Or maybe it's more about the relative sizes in the sky.

Wait, another point: the transit probability can be approximated by:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / R_s * (M_s / (M_s + M_p))^(1/3) )) )

Wait, perhaps I should look for the formula for transit probability. Oh wait, I'm trying to recall that the probability is given by the ratio of the area of the star (π R_s²) times the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned (which depends on the planet's distance and the star's size). Wait, I think the transit probability is given by:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a/(R_s) * (1 + (M_p/M_s))^(1/3) )) )

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a)^2 times (some function of the mass ratio). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the area of the star's disk, multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits. The probability of alignment is approximately (R_s / a)^2, because the planet's orbital plane has to be within a certain angle for the transit to occur.

Wait, no, I think the probability of a transit is given by (R_p + R_s) / a, but I'm confusing it with something else. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/(a * (M_s + M_p)^{1/3} / M_s^{1/3} )) ), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / R_s) ) )

Which simplifies to (R_p^2 R_s) / (a^2 R_s^2) ) = (R_p^2) / (a^2 R_s).

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a), which would be R_p^2 / (a R_s).

Wait, perhaps I should think about the solid angle. The probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits is proportional to (R_s / a)^2, because the area of the star as seen from the planet's position is π R_s², and the area of the sphere of possible orientations is 4π. So the probability that the line of sight is within the cone where transit occurs is roughly (R_s / a)^2.

But wait, no. The transit probability is the probability that the planet's orbital plane is edge-on enough for the planet to pass in front of the star. The correct formula for the transit probability is:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / R_s * (M_s / (M_s + M_p))^{1/3} )) )

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach.

The transit probability can be approximated by:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_p/M_s))^{1/3} )

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, I think the formula is:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / ( (a / R_s) * (M_s/(M_s + M_p))^{1/3} )) )

But perhaps I should think about the key factors: the planet's size relative to the star, and the planet's distance from the star.

So, the main factors are:

- (R_p / R_s)^2: larger ratio means higher probability.

- (R_s / a): larger (R_s/a) means higher probability. Because a smaller a (closer orbit) increases the (R_s/a) term.

So, for each planet, we can compute these terms.

Given that, let me compute for each planet.

We have:

Both planets have same mass, so R_p1 = R_p2 = R_p (since same mass, assuming same radius, but the question doesn't say if they're Earth-like in radius. Wait, the question says "Earth-like planets", which probably implies same radius as Earth. So yes, R_p1 = R_p2 = R_p.

The host stars have same radii. So R_s1 = R_s2 = R_s.

Wait, the problem states: "Furthermore, we know the masses and radii of the host stars of these two planets. The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2. As the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, both host stars have the same radii."

So R_s1 = R_s2 = R_s.

So the only difference is R_p is same, R_s is same. So (R_p/R_s)^2 is same for both planets. So that part is equal.

Now, the other part is (R_s / a).

We need to compute a for each planet.

Earlier, we found that a2 = (9/2)^(1/3) * a1 ≈ 1.65 * a1.

Since a is larger for Planet_2, R_s/a is smaller for Planet_2 than Planet_1.

Wait, a is larger for Planet_2, so R_s/a is smaller for Planet_2.

So (R_s / a) is larger for Planet_1.

So the (R_s/a) term is larger for Planet_1, making its transit probability higher.

Wait, but wait, the other factor from Kepler's law. Because the planet's orbital period affects a.

Wait, let's compute a1 and a2.

From Kepler's third law:

(P^2) = (4π² G)^(-1) * (a^3) * (M_s + M_p)

Assuming M_p << M_s, so M_s + M_p ≈ M_s.

So,

a³ = (G M_s) * (P/(2π))² )

Wait, let me correct that. The correct formula is:

a³ = [ G (M_s + M_p) P² ]/(4 π² )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_s, M_s + M_p ≈ M_s.

So,

a³ = (G M_s P²)/(4 π² )

So,

a ∝ sqrt( M_s ) * P^(2/3 )

Wait, no, a is proportional to (M_s * P² )^(1/3 )

So for each planet:

a1 = k * (M_s1 * P1² )^(1/3 )

a2 = k * (M_s2 * P2² )^(1/3 )

Given:

M_s1 = 2 M_s2

P2 = 3 P1

So,

a1 = k * (2 M_s2 * P1² )^(1/3 )

a2 = k * (M_s2 * (3 P1 )² )^(1/3 ) = k * (M_s2 * 9 P1² )^(1/3 ) = k * (9 M_s2 P1² )^(1/3 )

So,

a2 = k * [9 M_s2 P1² ]^(1/3) = k * [9 * (M_s2 P1² ) ]^(1/3 ) = k * (9)^(1/3) * (M_s2 P1² )^(1/3 )

Similarly, a1 = k * (2)^(1/3) * (M_s2 P1² )^(1/3 )

So, the ratio a2 / a1 is [9^(1/3)] / [2^(1/3)] = (9/2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65.

So a2 is approximately 1.65 times a1.

Thus, a1 is smaller than a2.

So, R_s / a for Planet_1 is R_s / a1, and for Planet_2 it's R_s / a2.

Since a2 is 1.65 a1, R_s / a2 = (R_s / a1 ) / 1.65.

So R_s/a for Planet_1 is about 1.65 times that of Planet_2.

Thus, the (R_s/a) term is 1.65 times higher for Planet_1.

But wait, the transit probability is proportional to (R_p/R_s)^2 * (R_s/a) * ... any other factors?

Wait, earlier I thought that the transit probability was P ≈ (R_p/R_s)^2 * (R_s/a) * ... but maybe there's another factor involving the mass because of the inclination.

Wait, another thought: the RV method can give the minimum mass of the planet, but for the transit probability, the inclination comes into play. The RV method only gives the minimum mass because it's sensitive to the component of the velocity along our line of sight. But this doesn't directly affect the transit probability because the probability depends on the true mass, but perhaps if the planet's actual mass is higher, the semi-major axis would be different? Wait, no, because the RV method already gives the actual mass if the inclination is known. But here, since the planets have already been detected via RV, the minimum masses are known, but I don't think that affects the transit probability calculation directly unless the mass affects the semi-major axis. But in our earlier analysis, we considered the masses (M_p) as same and much smaller than the stars, so perhaps the mass doesn't significantly affect a.

Wait, but in our earlier analysis, we used a from Kepler's law, which includes M_s, but not M_p because M_p is negligible. So for a, the mass term is M_s.

So, considering that, the (R_s/a) term for Planet_1 is higher, which would make the transit probability higher for Planet_1.

But wait, the transit probability is (R_p/R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) * [some function involving the mass?]

Wait, perhaps I should look for the exact formula for transit probability. Let me try to recall.

The transit probability formula is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / R_s) ) * (1 / (sqrt(1 + (M_p/(M_s + M_p))^2 )) )

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (sin i) / (a)

But sin i is the inclination, and for random inclination, the average sin i is 1/sqrt(2), but that's not the case—wait, the probability distribution for the inclination i is such that the probability of i being in [i, i+di] is proportional to sin i di. So for a random distribution, the average sin i is 2/sqrt(3) ≈ 1.1547, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. The probability of a transit is the probability that sin i >= R_p / a, right? Because the transit occurs when the inclination i is such that the planet's orbital plane is edge-on enough that the planet passes in front of the star. The condition for a transit is that the planet's distance from the star (a) times sin i is greater than or equal to R_p + R_s. Wait, no, because R_p is much smaller than R_s, perhaps R_p + R_s ≈ R_s. So the condition is a sin i >= R_s.

Wait, that's getting complicated. Let me think again.

The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane's inclination i is such that the planet's distance from the star (a) multiplied by sin i is greater than or equal to the sum of the star's radius and the planet's radius. But since R_p << R_s, we can approximate this as a sin i >= R_s.

So, sin i >= R_s / a.

The probability of this happening is the probability that sin i >= R_s/(a).

The probability distribution for i is such that the probability density function is (1/2) sin i di, for i between 0 and π/2. Because the distribution is symmetric around i=90 degrees (edge-on). So the probability that i is between θ and 90 degrees is the integral from θ to π/2 of (1/2) sin i di.

Wait, the correct probability distribution for the inclination angle i is such that the probability P(i) di is proportional to sin i di. So integrating from i=0 to i=90 degrees gives the total probability as 1/2.

So the probability of a transit is the integral from i = arcsin(R_s/a) to i=90 degrees of (sin i di) * (1/2).

Wait, no. The transit occurs when sin i >= R_s/a.

Thus, the probability P is the integral from i = arcsin(R_s/a) to π/2 of (sin i di) * (1/2) / (1/2)).

Wait, the total area for i from 0 to π/2 is 1/2 (since ∫0^{π/2} sin i di = 1). So the probability is the integral from i = θ to π/2 of sin i di, where θ = arcsin(R_s/a).

So,

P = ∫_{θ}^{π/2} sin i di = [ -cos i ]_{θ}^{π/2} = ( -cos(π/2) + cos θ ) = 0 + cos θ = cos(arcsin(R_s/a)).

But cos(arcsin x) is sqrt(1 - x²), so:

P = sqrt(1 - (R_s/a)^2 )

Wait, that can't be right because if a is very large, sqrt(1 - (R_s/a)^2 ) approaches 1, which would imply higher probability, but that's not the case. Wait, no, when a is very large, R_s/a is very small, so (R_s/a)^2 is small, and sqrt(1 - (R_s/a)^2 ) is approximately 1 - (R_s^2)/(2 a² ), which approaches 1 as a increases. That seems contradictory because when a is larger, the transit probability should be lower, not higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let's re-examine.

The condition for a transit is that the planet's orbit is aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star from our perspective. The probability of this is the probability that sin i >= (R_s + R_p)/a.

If R_p is much smaller than R_s, then it's approximately sin i >= R_s/a.

The probability is then the measure of angles i where this condition holds. The probability is the integral from i = arcsin(R_s/a) to i = π/2 of (sin i di) multiplied by 2 (since the same condition applies for the other side of the orbit, i.e., negative inclinations).

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the probability is 2 * [ ∫_{θ}^{π/2} sin i di ] where θ = arcsin(R_s/a).

So,

P = 2 * [ ∫_{θ}^{π/2} sin i di ].

The integral ∫ sin i di = -cos i.

So,

P = 2 [ (-cos(π/2) ) + cos θ ) ] = 2 [0 + cos θ ] = 2 cos θ.

But θ = arcsin(R_s/a), so cos θ = sqrt(1 - (R_s/a)^2 )

Thus,

P = 2 sqrt(1 - (R_s/a)^2 )

But wait, this doesn't make sense because when a is very small, R_s/a is large, so 1 - (R_s/a)^2 could be negative, which would make P imaginary. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternative approach: The condition is a sin i >= R_p + R_s.

Assuming R_p << R_s, so a sin i >= R_s.

Which implies sin i >= R_s/a.

The probability is the fraction of possible i where this holds.

The possible i ranges from 0 to π/2 (since higher i gives higher probability of transit). The probability is the measure of angles where sin i >= R_s/a.

The measure is (π/2 - arcsin(R_s/a)).

Because the inclination i is uniformly distributed in the sense that the probability distribution is (1/2) sin i di. So the probability is the integral from i = arcsin(R_s/a) to i= π/2 of (1/2) sin i di.

Wait, no. The probability is the integral from θ to π/2 of (probability density) di.

The total probability is the integral of (1/2) sin i di from 0 to π/2, which equals 1. So the probability of i being in [θ, π/2] is the integral from θ to π/2 of (1/2) sin i di.

Which is:

(1/2) ∫_{θ}^{pi/2} sin i di = (1/2) [ -cos i ]_{θ}^{pi/2} = (1/2) [ (-cos(pi/2)) + cos θ ] = (1/2) [ 0 + cos θ ] = (1/2) cos θ.

So,

P = (1/2) cos (arcsin(R_s/a)).

As before, cos(arcsin x) = sqrt(1 - x²), so:

P = (1/2) sqrt(1 - (R_s/a)^2 ).

Wait, that makes more sense. Because as a increases, (R_s/a) decreases, so (1 - (R_s/a)^2) approaches 1, and P approaches 1/2. But wait, when a is very large, the transit probability should approach zero because the chance of alignment is small. Hmm, but according to this formula, P approaches 1/2, which is 50%, which can't be right.

Ah, I see the mistake. The correct condition is that the planet's orbit must be edge-on enough that the planet's path intersects the star's disk. The probability of this is (R_p + R_s)/a divided by something. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternative approach: The probability of a transit is (R_p + R_s) / a, but this can't be larger than 1. So the transit probability P is approximately (R_p + R_s) / a * (something), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to think that the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a)^2, which comes from the area of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance.

Wait, in the paper I remember, the transit probability is given by:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a )^2.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, the probability is:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a )^2.

Wait, let's test the logic. If a is smaller (closer planet), then R_s/a is larger, so the probability increases. That aligns with intuition. Also, if R_p is larger, the probability increases.

So, for each planet:

Planet_1: (R_p/R_s)^2 * (R_s/a1)^2.

Planet_2: same (R_p/R_s)^2 * (R_s/a2)^2.

So P1/P2 = (a2^2)/(a1^2) ) since R_s and R_p are the same.

Earlier, we found that a2 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So P1/P2 = (1.65 a1)^2 / a1^2 = (2.72) approximately.

Thus, P1 is about 2.72 times higher than P2.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options don't have that. Let me check the options.

Looking back at the options:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability.

Wait, according to this, P1 is 2.72 times higher than P2, so Planet_1 has a higher probability, so the researchers should observe Planet_1. So option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability. But according to our earlier calculation, P1 is higher than P2 by a factor of ~2.7.

But wait, earlier when I thought about the (R_s/a) term, Planet_1 has a higher (R_s/a) because a1 is smaller. So if the probability is proportional to (R_s/a), then Planet_1 would have a higher probability. But if it's proportional to (R_s/a)^2, then the effect is stronger.

But which is correct? Because I'm getting conflicting information in my head.

Let me think again. The transit probability is the geometric probability that the planet's path intersects the star's disk. This is roughly the area of the star (π R_s²) multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that the planet passes in front. The probability of alignment is proportional to (R_s / a)^2, as the planet must be within a certain cone of inclinations for the transit to occur.

Wait, no, the probability of alignment is the fraction of possible inclinations that allow the transit, which as we calculated earlier is (1/2) sqrt(1 - (R_s/a)^2 ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, for small R_s compared to a, the transit probability is approximately (R_s/(2a))^2. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, the transit probability is approximately (R_p + R_s)^2 / (a^2), but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should refer back to the initial data.

The question says that both planets have the same mass, same radius (since Earth-like?), same star radius, but different orbital periods and star masses.

The host of Planet_1 is twice as massive as that of Planet_2, but same radius.

So, from Kepler's law, Planet_1's semi-major axis is a1, and Planet_2's is a2.

Earlier, we found that a2 = (9/2)^(1/3) * a1 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So, a2 is larger, so R_s/a is smaller for Planet_2, meaning that Planet_1 has a higher (R_s/a) term.

If the transit probability is proportional to (R_s/a)^2, then:

P1/P2 = (a2/a1)^2 = (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

So Planet_1 has a higher probability, about 2.7 times that of Planet_2.

Looking at the options, option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability. So the researchers would choose Planet_1.

But wait, another possibility: the RV method gives the minimum mass, but the actual mass could be higher. However, the question states that both planets have already been detected via RV, so their masses (minimum masses) are known, but perhaps their true masses are same, so that doesn't affect a.

Wait, but the RV method gives M_p sin i, where i is the inclination. If the planets have the same M_p, but different i, then a would be different. But in our earlier analysis, we assumed that a is determined by Kepler's law, which depends on M_s and P.

But if the RV method gives M_p sin i, and the actual mass is same for both planets, then the inclination angles would affect a. However, since we don't know the true masses, perhaps this complicates things. But the question says both planets have the same minimum masses, so perhaps M_p sin i is same for both.

But I think this is getting too complicated, and the initial approach holds.

So, the conclusion is that Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, approximately 2.7 times that of Planet_2. So the researchers would choose Planet_1, making option D the correct answer.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the factors influencing transit probability. The transit probability depends on the relative size of the planet to the star and the alignment of the orbital plane. The key factors are:

1. **Transit Probability Formula**:  
   The transit probability \( P \) is proportional to:  
   \[
   P \propto \left(\frac{R_p}{R_s}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{R_s}{a}\right)^2
   \]  
   where \( R_p \) is the planet's radius, \( R_s \) is the star's radius, and \( a \) is the planet's semi-major axis.

2. **Given Information**:  
   - Both planets have the same mass and radius (\( R_p \)) since they are Earth-like.  
   - Both host stars have the same radius (\( R_s \)).  
   - Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's (\( P_1 = P \), \( P_2 = 3P \)).  
   - The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of the host star of Planet_2 (\( M_{s1} = 2M_{s2} \)).

3. **Kepler's Third Law**:  
   Using Kepler's law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the star's mass \( M_s \):  
   \[
   a^3 \propto M_s \cdot P^2
   \]  
   For Planet_1:  
   \[
   a_1^3 \propto 2M_{s2} \cdot P^2
   \]  
   For Planet_2:  
   \[
   a_2^3 \propto M_{s2} \cdot (3P)^2 = 9M_{s2} \cdot P^2
   \]  
   Taking the ratio:  
   \[
   \frac{a_2^3}{a_1^3} = \frac{9M_{s2} \cdot P^2}{2M_{s2} \cdot P^2} = \frac{9}{2}
   \]  
   \[
   \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left(\frac{9}{2}\right)^{1/3} \approx 1.65
   \]  
   Thus, \( a_2 \approx 1.65a_1 \).

4. **Transit Probability Comparison**:  
   The transit probability is proportional to \( \left(\frac{R_s}{a}\right)^2 \). Since \( R_s \) is the same for both stars, the probability depends on \( \frac{1}{a^2} \).  
   For Planet_1:  
   \[
   P_1 \propto \frac{1}{a_1^2}
   \]  
   For Planet_2:  
   \[
   P_2 \propto \frac{1}{a_2^2} = \frac{1}{(1.65a_1)^2} = \frac{1}{(2.72a_1^2)}
   \]  
   The ratio of probabilities is:  
   \[
   \frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{1}{a_1^2}}{\frac{1}{2.72a_1^2}} = 2.72
   \]  
   Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability than Planet_2.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   Based on the calculations, Planet_1 has a significantly higher transit probability, making it the preferred target for observation.
