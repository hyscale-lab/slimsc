Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about measuring observables P and Q on a given state, and finding the probability of getting specific outcomes. 

Wait, the state is given as a column matrix (-1, 2, 1). I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vector has to be normalized. So first, I should check if this state is normalized. The way to do that is to compute the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components.

So, the components are -1, 2, and 1. Their squares are 1, 4, and 1. Adding them up, 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the norm squared is 6. Therefore, the state is not normalized. I should normalize it by dividing each component by the square root of 6. So the normalized state vector |ψ> is ( (-1)/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6 )^T.

Next, the problem talks about operators P and Q. The matrix for P is given. Let me write it down:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],
       [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
       [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

And Q's matrix is:

Q = [ [1, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, -1] ]

So, the first thing I need to do is find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for both operators because when we measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the state collapses into the corresponding eigenvector.

But wait, the question asks for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So, the measurement of P gives 0, and then immediately after measuring Q gives -1.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the order matters. First, we measure P, then Q. But when you measure P, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P. Then, measuring Q on this new state will have a different probability distribution than if you measured Q first.

So, the steps are:

1. Find the eigenstates of P, specifically the one corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.
2. Compute the probability that the
