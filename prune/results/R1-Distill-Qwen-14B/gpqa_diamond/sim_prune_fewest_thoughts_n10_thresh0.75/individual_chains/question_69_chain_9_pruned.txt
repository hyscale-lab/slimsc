Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays and the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me see. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰.

Wait, so the decay is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻. The proper lifetime τ₀ is given as 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are various resolutions in meters.

I think this has to do with the particle's lifetime and how long it travels before decaying. Oh right, the concept of the mean decay length. Because particles moving at relativistic speeds will have their lifetime dilated due to time dilation. The decay length depends on their velocity and lifetime.

So the formula I remember is the decay length L = γ * β * c * τ₀. But wait, what's γ and β here? Gamma is the Lorentz factor, and beta is v/c.

So first, I need to find gamma and beta. To get gamma, I need the energy of the particle and its mass. Oh, since X⁰ is moving with energy E, which is 27 GeV, and its rest mass is 3.41 GeV.

The energy E is related to the rest mass m and the momentum p by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². But since we're dealing in units where c=1 (like in particle physics), I can ignore c for now. So E² = p² + m².

Wait, but wait, no, not exactly. Let me think. The units are GeV, but I need to be careful with units. Oh, but maybe I can compute the gamma factor because gamma is E/(m c²), but since we're in units where c=1, it's simply E/(m) divided by c²? Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of natural units where c=1 and ħ=1.

Wait, in natural units, E (energy) has units of GeV, mass m has units of GeV/c², but when you multiply by c², it's GeV. So E = gamma * m c² → gamma = E/(m c²). But in natural units, c=1, so gamma = E / m. Because E in GeV, m in GeV/c². Wait, maybe I'm getting this a bit wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, when E is given in GeV, m in GeV/c². So to compute gamma, which is (total energy)/(rest energy). The rest energy is m c². So gamma = E / (m c²). But m is in GeV/c², so m c² is GeV. So E is in GeV, so gamma is E/(m c²) = (27 GeV) / (3.41 GeV) ) = 27/3.41 ≈ 7.918.

Wait, that's much simpler. So gamma is approximately 7.918.

Now, beta (β) is v/c. To find beta, I can use the relation E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Dividing both sides by (m c²)^2, we get (E/(m c²))² = (p c/(m c²))² + 1 → gamma² = (p c/(m c²))² + 1 → gamma² = (p/(m c))² + 1 → (p/(m c))² = gamma² -1 → p/(m c) = sqrt(gamma² -1) → p = m c sqrt(gamma² -1).

But wait, beta is v/c. And in terms of momentum, p = gamma m v → because p = gamma m v. So beta = v/c = (p)/(gamma m c). Hmm, let me see.

Alternatively, I can calculate beta from gamma and the relation gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2).

So with gamma ≈ 7.918, beta would be sqrt(1 - (1/(7.918)^2)).

Calculating that: 7.918 squared is about 62.7 (since 7.9^2 is 62.41). So 1/62.7 ≈ 0.01595. 1 - 0.01595 = 0.98405. Square root of that is about 0.992 (since 0.99^2 is 0.9801, which is a bit less, 0.992^2 is 0.984064), which is close. So beta is approximately 0.992.

So now, the mean proper lifetime is tau_0, so the mean lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma * tau_0.

The distance the particle travels before decaying is L = v * tau. Because v is beta c, so L = beta c tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

Alternatively, L = gamma beta c tau_0.

So substituting the numbers:

c is speed of light, about 3e8 m/s.

gamma is ~7.918, beta ~0.992.

So L = 7.918 * 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s.

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

First, 7.918 * 0.992 ≈ 7.866.

Multiply by 3e8
