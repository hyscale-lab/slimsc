Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, the question is a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.

So, the problem is about heating an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. The mixture weighs 7.20 grams. When heated without air, it produces a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through several tubes, and we have some results about the weight gains and losses in these tubes.

Let me start by listing what each part of the setup does. The first tube (№1) is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. Magnesium perchlorate is a strong desiccant, I think. It absorbs water, so if the gas has any water vapor, it would get trapped here. The weight of tube №1 increased by 3.60 grams. That suggests that water was absorbed here.

The second tube (№2) is a calcium hydroxide solution. Ca(OH)2 is a base and usually reacts with acidic gases like CO2. If the weight didn't change here, maybe there was no CO2 or other gases that Ca(OH)2 would react with. Or perhaps the amount was negligible. Wait, but another possibility is that maybe the gas was already neutral, or didn't react here. Hmm.

The third tube (№3) is red-hot copper. I remember that when gases pass through red-hot copper, it can react with certain gases. For example, CO2 would react to form CuO and carbon. Or maybe another gas like H2 or something else. The weight increased by 0.80 grams here, and CuO was formed. So the gas that passed through must be something that reacts with copper.

After all these, only 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP). Since STP is 0°C and 1 atm, 2.24 liters is 0.1 moles (because 22.4 L/mol). So gas C is 0.1 moles.

Now, let's think about what each gas could be.

First, the gas that caused the Mg(ClO4)2 to gain 3.60 g. Since Mg(ClO4)2 absorbs water, this must be water vapor. Let's calculate how much water that is.

The formula for water is H2O. Molar mass is 18 g/mol. So 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol of H2O. So 0.2 moles of water were absorbed in tube 1.

Next, the gas that reacted in tube 3. The increase was 0.80 g. Since CuO is formed, the gas must have been CO2 or something else. Wait, another possibility is H2S, but I don't think that reacts with copper. Let's think about CO2. The reaction with red-hot copper would be: 

CO2 + Cu → CuO + C. 

But wait, the reaction is more accurately written as:

2 CO2 + 2 Cu → 2 CuO + C. 

Wait, no, wait, for CO2 reacting with copper, perhaps it's:

CO2 + 4 Cu → 2 Cu2O + C.

Alternatively, maybe it's the reaction of CO (carbon monoxide) with copper. CO would react as:

2 CO + Cu → CuO + C.

Let me calculate the moles that caused the 0.80 g increase in tube 3. Since CuO is formed, and its molar mass is 80 g/mol (Cu=64, O=16). Wait, but the increase in weight is 0.80 grams. So the mass of CuO formed is 0.80 g. So moles of CuO: 0
