Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a particle in an isotropic three-dimensional potential. Hmm, let me think. The potential is given as V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh right, that's a harmonic oscillator potential. So this is like a 3D quantum harmonic oscillator.

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. Wait, what's the third excited state? Oh, right, the ground state is the lowest energy, so the first excited is n=1, second n=2, third n=3. Or wait, maybe I should clarify that.

In three dimensions, the energy levels for a harmonic oscillator are given by E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2). Wait, another way, sometimes it's written as E = ħω (n + 3/2), where n is the sum of the quantum numbers in each dimension. Oh wait, I think n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Right, so n is the total quantum number.

So the ground state is when n=0, right? Because n_x, n_y, n_z are all 0. Then the first excited state is n=1. Second excited is n=2, third would be n=3. So the third excited state is when n=3.

So the energy for n=3 would be E = ħω (3 + 3/2 ) = ħω (9/2). Because E = ħω (n + 3/2). So that makes the energy (9/2) ħω.

Now, the next part is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the same energy. That's about the degeneracy of the energy level. The degeneracy occurs because there are multiple combinations of n_x, n_y, n_z that sum to the same n.

So for n=3, the number of possible triplets (n_x, n_y, n_z) where each is a non-negative integer and they add up to 3. So we need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3.

Hmm, the formula for the number of solutions is (n + d - 1) choose (d - 1), where d is the number of dimensions. So here,
