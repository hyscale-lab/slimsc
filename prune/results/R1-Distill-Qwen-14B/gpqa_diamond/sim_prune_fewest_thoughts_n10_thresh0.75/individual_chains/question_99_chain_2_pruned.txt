Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound it is based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question says that the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Since the compound is an unknown and looking at the options, I see that most of them have COOH groups. So that makes sense. The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is likely a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which fits with a carboxylic acid as well because the carbonyl in carboxylic acids typically absorbs around there, maybe a bit lower but 1700 is close enough.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR data. The problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So, there are no double bonds with adjacent hydrogens, which means the structure doesn't have any vinyl groups like CH₂=CH. So, all the structures in the options don't have double bonds, so that's consistent.

Now, the NMR has some splitting patterns. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. That's a bit complicated, but I think it relates to the number of neighboring protons each set of hydrogens is experiencing.

Let me think about each option's structure and what their NMR might look like.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
This structure seems to have a central carbon attached to two ethyl groups, a CH2 group, and then a COOH. Wait, actually, looking at it, the structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So, the two middle carbons each have a hydrogen and an ethyl group. The CH2 would be next to the COOH.

Hmm, but wait, how about the symmetry? The two middle carbons are each attached to a CH group (since C(H)(C2H5) is CH2 with two ethyls? No, wait. Wait, no, for each C(H)(C2H5), it's a CH2 group where one H is attached. Wait, no, the formula is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So, the central two CH groups each have one H and two ethyl groups. So each of those CH groups would have how many neighboring Hs?

Wait, the central C's: each is attached to a CH group. So, each of those CH's will have neighboring CH groups. Let's imagine the structure: CH3-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH. So, the H on the first CH(Et) is next to the CH(Et) group, which has another CH(Et) attached. Hmm, perhaps each of those Hs would couple with neighboring Hs.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to look for symmetry in the structures. If the molecule is symmetrical, some protons would be equivalent and show as singlets or simpler splitting. But the splitting in the NMR is complex, so perhaps the structure isn't symmetrical, or the coupling is from multiple neighboring groups.

Looking at the options again.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH
So this is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the middle two CH groups each have a methyl group. The first CH is attached to a CH2CH3 (ethyl), and the next CH is attached to another CH2CH3? Wait, no, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the middle CH
