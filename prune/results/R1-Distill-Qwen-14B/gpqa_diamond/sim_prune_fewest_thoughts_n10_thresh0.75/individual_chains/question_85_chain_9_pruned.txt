Okay, so I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. 

First, the question gives me some data about two planets orbiting a star. The star's mass is 1.5 times the Sun, radius 1.2 times, and effective temperature 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and a radius of 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular.

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.5. Wait, but albedo is the same for both planets, so that part cancels out when taking the ratio. So I can ignore albedo in this case.

Wait, but how do I find the distance of each planet from the star? The question mentions the RV method and transit method. Oh, right! Both methods give different information. The transit method gives the size of the planet and the distance to the star because the transit depth depends on the planet's size relative to the star. But the RV method gives the mass of the planet and the distance through the Doppler shift.

Wait, but in this question, I think the RV method gives the Doppler shift which depends on the planet's
