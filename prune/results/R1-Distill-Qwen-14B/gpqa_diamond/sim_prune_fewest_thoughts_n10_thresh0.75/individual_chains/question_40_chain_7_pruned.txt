Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question says that a chemist is talking about their compounds being "on top of each other." Hmm, what does that mean in a chemistry context?

I remember from my studies that when compounds have similar properties, they tend to interact more. But wait, in what context would their compounds being on top of each other be a problem? Oh, maybe during a separation technique like chromatography or distillation. If compounds have similar properties, they might not separate well.

The options given are A, B, C, D. Let's go through each one. Option A says similar polarities. Polarity affects how compounds interact, like in chromatography. If two compounds have similar polarities, they might elute together, making separation difficult. But the question is about them being on top of each other, which might imply they're not separating, so maybe. 

Option B talks about non-covalent or van der Waals interactions. If the compounds are interacting through these, they might stick together. But wait, if they have strong interactions, wouldn't that make them hard to separate? Maybe, but the question is about the compounds being on each other, perhaps meaning they are not separating during a process. So maybe B is about why they stick together instead of separating.

Option C is about similar boiling points. If two compounds have similar BP, they might not distill separately. So during distillation, if they boil at about the same temperature, they would come off together, making the separation difficult. But the question is about compounds being on top of each other, which makes me think of chromatography. Oh wait, in chromatography, if their Rf values are similar, they'll come out together, but maybe the term "on top" refers to being together in a mixture.

Option D is about optical rotations. I don't think that would cause them to stick together. Optical rotation is about the direction of plane-polarized light, so that doesn't directly affect physical interactions between molecules. So D is probably not it.

So, the chemist's compounds are sticking together or not separating. The options that make sense are A, B, C. So when the chemist says they're on top, it might mean during a separation process, like in a chromatography column, the compounds are not moving apart, so they remain together. If their properties are similar, they'll move similarly.

So, if they have similar polarities (A), they might not separate in chromatography. Similarly, if they have similar boiling points (C), they won't separate via distillation. But the question doesn't specify the technique. 

Wait, the question says they're synthetic organic chemists. In synthetic work, purification is key. So when purifying, if the compounds don't separate, you might get them all together. So why wouldn't they separate? Because they have similar physical properties, like polarity or boiling points.

But the answer options point to the cause. So the statement "compounds are on top of each other" implies that they aren't separating. So the reason is that they have similar properties. 

Looking at the options again, option B says they are bonding through non-covalent interactions. If the compounds are forming bonds with each other, like hydrogen bonds or something, that would make them stick together. But in a process like chromatography, if the molecules interact with each other more than the stationary phase, they might elute together. Or, more accurately, if two compounds have strong interactions, they might form a dimer or aggregate, making separation hard.

Alternatively, if they have similar polarities, they'd interact with the stationary phase similarly and thus move similarly, leading to co-elution
