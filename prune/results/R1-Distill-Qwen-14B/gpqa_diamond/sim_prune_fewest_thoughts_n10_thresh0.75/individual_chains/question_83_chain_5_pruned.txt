Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, it's a neutralization reaction. 

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Wait, diluting it would mean we're adding more volume without adding more solute, so the concentration should decrease. Let me calculate the new concentration after dilution.

The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. Here, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 L. The new volume V2 is 0.04 L because 20 +20 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (M1 V1)/V2 = (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04. Let me compute that: 0.05 *0.02 is 0.001, divided by 0.04 is 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, we're titrating this with
