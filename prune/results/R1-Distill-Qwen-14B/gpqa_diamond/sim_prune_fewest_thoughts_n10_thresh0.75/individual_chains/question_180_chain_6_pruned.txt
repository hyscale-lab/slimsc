Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy in an isolated system. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about that. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, so I'm trying to remember about electric potential energy. I think when you have multiple charges, the potential energy of the system is the work needed to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. Since the system is isolated, I guess we're considering all the interactions between the charges.

Wait, but in this setup, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the 12 are all at 2 meters away. So, how does that work? Let me visualize it: the 13th charge is at the center, and the other 12 are arranged around it, each 2 meters away from P.

Each of the 12 charges is 2e, and the 13th is also 2e. So each of the 12 is experiencing a charge at the center of 2e. But wait, what about the interactions between the 12 charges themselves? Because they're all at the same distance from P, but are they all placed in a way where each is at 2 meters from P, but how are they arranged relative to each other? Oh, maybe it's a spherical arrangement, so the distance between any two of the 12 charges can be calculated based on that.

Wait, but maybe for this problem, considering the minimum energy, we can model it as a point charge arrangement. Or perhaps since all the 12 are at 2 m from P, the potential energy comes from their interactions with the central charge and with each other.

But wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So perhaps their configuration is such that each is at that distance, but how exactly? Maybe considering them as point charges placed at the same point? No, that can't be right because then they'd all be on top of each other, but the energy would be higher. Wait, but the problem states they are constrained to
