Okay, I have this physics problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

So, the problem is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The pion is initially at rest, and I need to calculate the kinetic energies of the products. 

The given data are the rest masses: the pion has a rest mass of 139.6 MeV, and the muon has 105.7 MeV. Hmm, wait, the neutrino is a bit tricky because its rest mass is considered negligible, right? So in particle physics, neutrinos are often treated as massless for these kinds of calculations. That makes sense because their mass is so tiny compared to other particles.

Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before the decay is zero. So, the total momentum after the decay must also be zero. That means the muon and the neutrino will have equal and opposite momenta. But since the neutrino is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum (since E = pc for massless particles). So, the muon will have some kinetic energy, and the neutrino will carry away some energy as well.

Wait, let me think. The pion is at rest, so its total energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. The muon and neutrino's energies must sum up to this.

Let me denote the energies of the muon and the neutrino as E_mu and E_nu respectively. So, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

But for the muon, its energy E_mu is equal to its rest mass energy plus its kinetic energy. So, E_mu = m_mu * c^2 + K_mu. Plugging the numbers, m_mu c^2 is 105.7 MeV. So, E_mu = 105.7 + K_mu.

The neutrino's energy is entirely kinetic because its rest mass is zero. So E_nu = K_nu.

Putting it together, 105.7 + K_mu + K_nu = 139.6 MeV. So, K_mu + K_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV.

Additionally, since the momenta must be equal and opposite, their magnitudes are the same. Let's denote the magnitude of the muon's momentum as p. Then the neutrino's momentum is also p (since they are opposite in direction). 

For the muon, E_mu^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2. So, (E_mu)^2 = p^2 c^4 + (105.7)^2 (MeV)^2.

For the neutrino, E_nu = p c, because it's massless.

So, let's write E_mu = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).
