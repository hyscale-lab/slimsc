Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The clues come from the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra.

First, the FTIR shows absorption peaks indicative of an ester group. Ester groups typically have a strong absorption around 1730-1750 cm⁻¹. So, the compound has an ester functional group, which implies the presence of an oxygen in the structure. Ester groups are usually R-O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, esters are more like R-O-CO-R. So, more accurately, an ester is a carbonyl group connected to an oxygen, which is connected to an alkyl group.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. There are six signals in total. Let's break them down:

1. Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the aromatic protons' signals depend on their substitution pattern. Di-substitution can lead to different splitting. For example, if the substituents are para, you might have two doublets. Or if they are ortho or meta, the pattern changes. But wait, the problem says two signals for aromatic H, each probably from different environments. So maybe the substituents are in positions that create two sets of aromatic protons. For example, if one substituent is an ester group and the other is something else, perhaps in para positions. Or maybe it's an ortho substitution with two different groups.

2. Two signals for vinyl-H: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are those attached to double bonds. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. A doublet of quartets—wait, quartets are from coupling with three equivalent protons. So, maybe a situation where a vinyl proton is next to two sets of different coupling partners? Or perhaps it's part of a conjugated system. Hmm.

3. Two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. And importantly, there are no signals for –CH2 groups. So, all the methyl groups are either connected to something else, like in an ester (like OCH3?), but wait, no, methyl esters would have O-CO-OCH3. Wait, but methyl esters would have a single –CH3 group. Alternatively, maybe the substituents on the ring include a methyl group attached elsewhere. Or perhaps the ester is part of a substituent that brings more carbons.

Wait, let's think about the possible structures. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, two substituents. One is likely the ester group, but maybe not. Alternatively, both substituents could be ester groups, but that's less common. Alternatively, one substituent is an ester, and the other is a vinyl group.

Wait, but the vinyl Hs are part of a substituent. So let's think: perhaps the aromatic ring has an ester substituent and another group that's a vinyl group, maybe as part of a substituent like a propenyl group or something else.

Another approach: the total number of hydrogens. Let me think about the possible molecular formulas. The options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

The molecular formulas vary in the number of carbons and hydrogens. Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here, it's (2C + 2 - H)/2.

For each option:

A) C11H14O2: (2*11 + 2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2=5. So 5 degrees. Benzene ring (
