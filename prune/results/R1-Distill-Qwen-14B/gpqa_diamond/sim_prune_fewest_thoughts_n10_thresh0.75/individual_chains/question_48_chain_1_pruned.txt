Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think it through step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question says that cyclohexanone undergoes a series of reactions, and we need to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product. The options are A to D, with numbers 6, 8,10,7.

First, let's break down each reaction step.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2) to form product 1.
Hmm, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. When it reacts with bromine, typically what happens? I remember that in cyclic ketones, bromine can add across the carbonyl group. So maybe it's an addition reaction. Wait, cyclohexanone has a ketone group, and when you add bromine, it might undergo a nucleophilic addition. Oh wait, but Br2 is more likely to do an electrophilic addition. Oh, right, the carbonyl is a good electrophile. So the bromine would add across the carbonyl, opening the C=O and adding Br across the double bond.

Wait, but wait, cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone. So adding Br2 would lead to a dibromide. Let me visualize: the ketone O is double bonded to C. When Br2 adds, it should form a vicinal dibromide. So the carbonyl becomes a C-Br, and
