Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for the given reactions. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And the product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile. So, that's interesting.

I remember that when ketones react with certain reagents, they can undergo nucleophilic addition. NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So, maybe this is a nucleophilic addition to the ketone. But wait, ketones typically form enolates when treated with strong bases, but in this case, maybe it's a different mechanism.

Wait, in the presence of an acid catalyst, ketones can undergo addition reactions. Oh, right! The acid-catalyzed addition of a cyanide ion. So, in the first reaction, the ketone butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and some acid (H3O+?), which is reagent A. That would protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic, and then the CN- would attack as a nucleophile.

So, when NaCN is used with an acid, it's probably a protonation step. So reagent A is H3O+? Because NaCN is a salt and would dissociate in solution, providing CN-.

Wait, but wait. I'm a little confused. Another possibility is that butan-2-one could undergo some kind of substitution, but more likely, it's a nucleophilic addition. So, the product is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group on the same carbon. So, perhaps the initial product is a cyanohydrin. Yes, a cyanohydrin is formed when a ketone reacts with HCN. But in this case, it's NaCN, which is a source of CN-; maybe under acidic conditions, the HCN is generated in situ.

Wait, but NaCN is a strong base, so maybe it's not HCN, but perhaps the reaction is done in a basic medium. No, wait, noâ€”NaCN is a salt, but in aqueous solution, it's a source of CN- in solution. So, perhaps the reaction is done in an acidic
