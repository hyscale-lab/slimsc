Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's start breaking it down.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution contains two substances: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both are in a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. Each contributes 1.00 grams. I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is HPO4^2- or maybe PO4^3-. Wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4. Oh wait, no. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, isn't it? Or wait, maybe I'm getting that mixed up. Let me think. H3PO4 is the trihydrogen phosphate, and it can lose protons to form H2PO4^- (dihydrogen), then HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and finally PO4^3- (orthophosphate). Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-. So HPO4^2- is hydrogen phosphate, and PO4^3- is orthophosphate. Hmm, I think that's correct.

Wait, no. Wait, the terms can be a bit confusing. Let me clarify: Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4. It can lose three protons to form H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and PO4^3- (orthophosphate). So when the question refers to orthophosphate ions, it's talking about PO4^3-.

But wait, in the solution, we have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let's figure out what these salts dissociate into.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate). Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate). So in the solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

This makes me think about the phosphate buffer system. Since the solution
