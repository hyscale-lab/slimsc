Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the question gives some key details about each spectrograph's capabilities. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes up to 17 mag. HIRES can go up to 16 mag. So any star that's brighter than 17 mag won't be visible with ESPRESSO, but anything brighter than 16 would be visible with HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. The brighter the star, the lower the magnitude. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag for V, ESPRESSO can see it. HIRES can see stars brighter than 16 mag. So for a star to be seen by both, its apparent V magnitude must be <= 17 (since both can see up to that, but depending on how bright it is). Wait, no, wait: if a star is brighter than 17 mag, it's within ESPRESSO's range. Similarly, if it's brighter than 16 mag, it's within HIRES's. So for a star to be seen by both, it needs to have an apparent magnitude that is brighter than 17 (so <=17). Because ESPRESSO can't see beyond 17, so any star that's within the HIRES limit (<=16) would automatically be within ESPRESSO's limit as well, because 16 is less than 17. So the main thing is checking which stars have V magnitudes <=17 (so both can see) and also considering any extinction (dust affecting brightness).

Now let's look at each star and compute their apparent V magnitudes, considering any extinction (E(B-V) is given for some stars, which affects the V magnitude).

Star1: RA 15, DEC -75, absolute V mag 15.5, 10 pc. Since absolute magnitude is M, we can compute apparent V (m) using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10(d/10). So d=10 pc, log(10/10)=0, so m =
