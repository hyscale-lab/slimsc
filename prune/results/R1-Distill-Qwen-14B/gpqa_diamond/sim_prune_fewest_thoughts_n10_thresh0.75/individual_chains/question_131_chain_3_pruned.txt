Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through the question again carefully and break it down step by step.

The problem starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. This acid is dehydrated to form an anhydride. So, dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid typically forms an anhydride, right? And the structure would have two carboxylic acid groups connected by an oxygen bridge, maybe like a cyclic anhydride.

Next, the anhydride has some specific NMR data. The 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. Wait, 7 ppm is usually where aromatic protons appear. But this is in an anhydride. An anhydride's structure doesn't typically have aromatic protons unless there's some conjugated system or maybe an aromatic ring involved. Hmm, but wait, the starting material is a cis-alkene. When it dehydrates, the alkene might become part of a ring structure, perhaps a cyclic anhydride like a bicyclic compound. Alternatively, maybe the anhydride has a conjugated double bond, which could lead to some deshielded protons, but 7 ppm is quite high. Alternatively, perhaps it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated anhydride. That might have some conjugated double bonds, which could lead to some protons that are deshielded enough to show up around 7 ppm. But wait, the 1H NMR has a single peak, which suggests equivalent protons, maybe a pair of equivalent protons that are deshielded.

The 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Let me think about what those carbons could be. 137 ppm is probably a carbon with a double bond, maybe a spÂ² carbon. 165 ppm is likely a carbonyl carbon. So in the anhydride, we have a carbonyl (like the anhydride's oxygen-linked carbonyls) and a double bond. Oh wait, the starting material has a cis-alkene, so when it dehydrates, perhaps the double bond is retained, making an alpha,beta-unsaturated anhydride. So the structure would have a conjug
