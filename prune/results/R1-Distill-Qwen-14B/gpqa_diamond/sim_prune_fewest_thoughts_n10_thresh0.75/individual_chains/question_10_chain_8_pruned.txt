Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, let me think through this. The question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density among the options a to d. The options are labeled A to D, but I need to be careful because the letters are a bit mixed up. Let me parse each part step by step.

First, I remember that density is calculated as mass divided by volume. So, the formula is density = mass/volume. Volume for a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so if the radius is known, I can calculate the volume. But maybe I don't need exact numbers; perhaps I can reason it out with relative values.

Looking at each option:

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, right? Because Earth is made of rock and metal. So if this planet has Earth's mass and radius, its density would be the same as Earth's. So, density is 5.5 g/cm³.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, wait. This planet's density is given as 5.5 already. But its mass is double Earth's. So, if the density is same as Earth, but mass is higher, how does that affect anything? Oh wait, wait. The question is about which planet has the highest density, not necessarily the same as Earth. So, for option b, the density is 5.5, same as a. Hmm, but I need to check all options.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth. Same composition as Earth implies same density, right? Because composition affects the average density. If it's made of the same materials, density remains the same. So, Earth's density is 5.5, so this planet's density would also be 5.5.

Option d: A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth. Again, same composition means same density, so 5.5 g/cm³.

Wait, that's confusing. Are all the options a, b, c, d having density 5.5? No, wait. Let me reread the options.

Option b says the planet has 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5. So, this planet's density is 5.5. But, if a planet has the same
