Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Oh right, J is probably the coupling constant, like in the Ising model or something. And we need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So each state contributes its Boltzmann factor.

But wait, how many possible states are there for three spins each being +1 or -1? Since each has two options, total states are 2^3 = 8. Oh right, 8 states. So I need to list all possible combinations and calculate E for each, then sum the exp(-βE) terms.

But maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Because that could take a while. Let me think. The energy expression is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So that's -J times the sum of all pairwise products. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let me call that sum H for Hamiltonian terms.

Wait, each term is the product of two spins. So for each pair, if the spins are the same, the product is +1, if opposite, -1. So the sum H would be the sum of these three products.

So each term contributes either +1 or -1. So the sum H can be 3, 1, or -3? Wait, let me think. Each term is ±1, and there are three terms. The maximum sum is when all three are +1: 3. The minimum is when all are -1: -3. But there are other possibilities, like two +1 and one -1, which would sum to 1, or two -1 and one +1, which sums to -1.

Wait, but what are all the possible values of H? Let me see:

If all three products are +1: H = 3. So E = -J * 3 = -3J.

If two products are +1 and one -1: H = 1. E = -J *1 = -J.

If one product is +1 and two -1: H = -1. E = J.

If all three products are -1: H = -3. E = 3J.

Wait, no. Wait, the energy E is -J times H. So when H is 3, E is -3J. When H is 1, E is -J. When H is -1, E is J. When H is -3, E is 3J.

So the possible energies are -3J, -J, J, 3J.

But how many states correspond to each H value?

Wait, maybe I can group the states based on how many pairs have the same spin. Because each product S_i S_j is +1 if the spins are same, -1 otherwise.

So for three spins, how many pairs are aligned?

Wait, let me define the number of aligned pairs. Let me say m is the number of pairs that are aligned (so S_i = S_j). Then each aligned pair contributes +1, others contribute -1. So m can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.

Wait, but for three spins, how many aligned pairs are possible?

Wait, for three spins, there are three pairs: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3).

So when all three spins are the same, say +1, then all three pairs are aligned: m=3.

If two spins are +1 and one is -1, then how many aligned pairs? Let's
