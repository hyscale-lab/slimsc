Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and try to figure out what's going on.

The question describes a series of reactions, and then asks about the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. Hmm, I remember that these are symmetry groups from molecular symmetry, probably related to point groups.

Let me break down the reactions:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids, F and G. F is strong, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

I think I'll need to figure out what each of these compounds is, starting from the reactions.

First reaction: A + 8 B → C. Since B is a gas and reacts in a 8:1 ratio, maybe B is a diatomic gas. Common diatomic gases are O2, N2, H2, Cl2, etc. Let's think about a reaction where a solid reacts with a gas in an 8:1 ratio. Maybe something like sulfur reacting with O2? Or perhaps a metal reacting with O2 or Cl2.

Wait, when I think of red products, I think of compounds like CuO (but that's black), or maybe something like iron(III) oxide, but that's reddish. Oh, or perhaps something like sodium oxide... wait, but sodium oxide is Na2O, which is white. Hmm.

Wait, maybe B is O2. If A is something that reacts with oxygen to form a red product. Wait, the reaction is A + 8 B → C. If B is O2, then 8 equivalents would be 8 moles. So perhaps the formula is A O8. But that seems a bit high. Alternatively, if B is another diatomic like Cl2, then A + 8 Cl2 → C.

Wait, solid A reacting with 8 moles of Cl2... Maybe it's a metal reacting with Cl2 to form a chloride. Let's think about how many equivalents that would take.

Wait, for example, let's say A is Fe. Fe reacts with Cl2 in combustion to form FeCl3. The reaction is 2 Fe + 3 Cl2 → 2 FeCl3. So 3 moles of Cl2 per 2 Fe. But in the problem, the ratio is 8 B to 1 A. So moles of B per A are 8. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur. Sulfur reacts with O2 to form SO3. Let's see: S + O2 → SO2 or SO3. Wait, but SO3 is a liquid or gas? Also, if the product C is bright red, perhaps it's something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is a metal oxide. For example, maybe A is Na2O. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is the formation of a compound like Fe3O4. Let's see, Fe3O4 is a mixture of FeO·Fe2O3, which is also known as magnetite. It's black, though, so not red. Maybe that's not it.

Wait, another red solid I can think of is mercury(II,II) oxide, HgO, but that's red. But then what would the reaction be? Let's think: HgO is formed from Hg and O2. The reaction is 2 Hg + O2 → 2 HgO. So for every mole of Hg, 0.5 moles of O2 are used. That's a 2:1 ratio, not 8:1. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe A is a metal that forms an 8:1 ratio with Cl2. Let's think about aluminum. Aluminum reacts with Cl2 under certain conditions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal.

Wait, another thought: maybe B is not a diatomic. Oh, wait, the question says gas B. So B is a diatomic gas. So possible options are O2, N2, H2, Cl2, F2, Br2 (but Br2 is a liquid at room temp), I2 is also a solid. So likely O2 or Cl2.

Let me think about the product C. Then, when C reacts with D, which is another gas, in a 2:1 ratio, to produce E. Also, C reacts with water to produce A plus two different acids, one strong (F) and one weak (G). So when C is reacted with water, it produces A, F, and G.

Hmm. Let's think about possible C compounds. Maybe C is a metal oxide. Then, when it reacts with H2O, it would produce a metal hydroxide. But wait, that would give a base, not acids. So perhaps C is a non-metal oxide.

Wait, if C is a non-metal oxide, reacting with water would produce an acid. So if C is, say, SO3, then reacting with water gives H2SO4. But that's a strong acid. So perhaps F is H2SO4 and G is something else? Or maybe C is a mixed oxide, like NO2? No, that's a gas.

Wait, when C (a solid) reacts with water, it gives A (solid), and two different acids. So perhaps C is a salt that's decomposed in water into a metal and two acids. Wait, that doesn't quite make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound that can be decomposed into a metal and an acid when reacted with water. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the reaction of C with D produces E. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio
