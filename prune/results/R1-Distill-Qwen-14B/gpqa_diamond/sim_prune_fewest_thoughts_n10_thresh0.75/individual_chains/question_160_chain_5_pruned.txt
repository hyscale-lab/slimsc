Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like a polygon. Hmm, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima when the number of sides N is infinitely large. All apothems are the same length a. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is hitting it, and we're to consider the far field region. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, let me think. I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts and creates a pattern of bright and dark regions called interference maxima and minima. For a single slit, the minima occur at certain angles which depend on the slit width. But this isn't a single slit; it's a polygonal aperture. Oh, but when N is really large, the polygon becomes almost like a circle, right? Because with infinite sides, it's indistinguishable from a circle. So maybe this problem is similar to a circular aperture.

But wait, the question says it's a polygon with all apothems same. An apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular polygon, the apothem is the same for all sides. When N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius equal to the apothem 'a'? Or wait, is the apothem the same as the radius? No, wait, for a regular polygon, the apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle. So if the apothem is 'a', the radius R of the polygon is a. So when N is very large, the shape approximates a circle of radius a.

So the problem reduces to diffraction through a circular aperture, but wait, I'm not sure. No, wait, a circular aperture's diffraction pattern is the Airy disk. The minima in the far field (Fraunhofer diffraction) for a circular aperture occur at angles given by the equation a sin θ = λ m, where m is the order of the minimum. The first minimum is m=1, so sin θ = λ/(a). But wait, for small angles, sin θ is approximately θ, so θ ≈ λ/(a). But that's just the first minimum.

Wait, but the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So the first minimum is at m=1, the second at m=2. So the angles would be θ1 = λ/(a) and θ2= 2
