Okay, so I need to find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in the spin state (3i, 4). Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator matrix, multiplied by the state vector again. So, the formula is ⟨S_y⟩ = ψ† σ_y ψ, where σ_y is the Pauli y-matrix and ψ is the spin state.

The given spin state is (3i, 4). So, ψ is a column vector: [3i; 4]. The conjugate transpose ψ† would be [ -3i , 4 ] because I take the complex conjugate of each component and transpose it.

The Pauli y-matrix σ_y is given as:
[0  -i]
[i   0]

Now, I need to compute ψ† * σ_y * ψ. Let me break this down into steps.

First, compute σ_y multiplied by ψ. Let's do the matrix multiplication:

σ_y * ψ = [0*(-3i) + (-i)*4 , i*(3i) + 0*4 ]^T? Wait, no, wait. Wait, matrix multiplication is done row by column. Oh wait, no, more accurately, the matrix is 2x2, and ψ is a 2x1 column vector. So:

First component:
Row 1 of σ_y: [0, -i]
Multiply by ψ: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i

Second component:
Row 2 of σ_y: [i, 0]
Multiply by ψ: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = i*3i + 0 = 3i². Since i² is -1, this becomes 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y * ψ is the vector:
[-4i]
[-3]

Now, I need to multiply ψ† with this result. ψ† is [ -3i , 4 ].

So, ψ† * (σ_y ψ) = [ -3i , 4 ] * [ -4i ; -3 ]

Dot product calculation:
(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)

Let's compute each term.

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i². i² is -1, so 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

Adding them together: -12 + (-12) = -24.

Then, the expectation value is ⟨S_y⟩ = (-24) * (ħ/2), because the spin angular momentum operator S is (ħ/2) σ_y. Oh wait, right! The operator S_y is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix σ_y. So the expectation value is not just the matrix product, but multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The spin operator S_y is (ħ/2)σ_y. So when we calculate the expectation value, it's (ψ† σ_y ψ) * (ħ/2).

So, from the calculation above
