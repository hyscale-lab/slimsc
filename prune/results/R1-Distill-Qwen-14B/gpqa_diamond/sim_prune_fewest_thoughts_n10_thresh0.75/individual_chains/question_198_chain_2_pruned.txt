Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I'm not super confident about this, but let me think it through.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, what's a stability constant again? Oh right, it's the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex ion. So for each complex, the higher the β, the more stable the complex is.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would be [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, I think. So that's the third complex, because the β3 is 63. Or wait, maybe I should check the numbering.

Wait, the complexes are probably [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n), right? Because Co^2+ with each SCN^- contributes. So n can be 1, 2, 3, 4.

So the complexes would be:

- [CoSCN]^+ (n=1, charge 2+ -1 = +1)
- [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (n=2, 2+ -2 = 0)
- [Co(SCN)_3]^- (n=3, 2+ -3 = -1)
- [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} (n=4, 2+ -4 = -2)

Wait, but the problem mentions dithiocyanato, which is two SCN groups. So that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex, which is β2=40. Oh wait, no, the options are about the third complex? Wait, the question says "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." Hmm, I'm a bit confused about which complex is which.

Wait, but the problem gives β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So
