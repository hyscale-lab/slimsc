Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about the uncertainty in an electron's energy based on the uncertainty in its position. Hmm, I think this has to do with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Yeah, that's right. I remember that the principle relates the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp), and through that, we can find the uncertainty in energy.

Wait, the problem says the electron is moving along the x-direction with speed v = 2e8 m/s. Oh wait, but the uncertainty in position is Δx = 0.1 nm. So, I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE.

I think the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, Δp would be approximately ħ/(2Δx). Right, because the minimum uncertainty is when it's equal to that.

Momentum p is mass times velocity. Oh wait, but here we're dealing with the uncertainty in momentum. So, Δp ≈ mΔv, but wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the uncertainty principle formula.

Let me jot down the formula: Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So, Δp is at least ħ/(2Δx). Once I have Δp, I can find the uncertainty in energy. But wait, energy is related to momentum for a particle. For a non-relativistic particle, the kinetic energy E is (p²)/(2m). Alternatively, since the electron is moving at a speed v, the kinetic energy can be written as (1/2)mv².

Wait, but here we're dealing with the uncertainty in energy, not the exact energy. So perhaps I need to find the uncertainty in momentum and then relate that to the uncertainty in kinetic energy.

Wait, another thought. The uncertainty principle gives us ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, but I don't think time uncertainty is given here. So maybe I should stick with the position and momentum relation.

So, let me get back to the momentum uncertainty. The uncertainty in momentum Δp is ħ/(2Δx). Let me compute that.

First, let's compute Δp. The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Δx is 0.1 nm, which is 0.1e-9 meters.

So Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 0.1e-9) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-10) ≈ (1.05e-34)/(2e-10) = roughly 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, let me calculate that again. 2*0.1 is 0.2, so 2Δx is 0.2e-9 m, right? So denominator is 0.2e-9 m.

So 1.05e-34 / 0.2e-9 = 1.05e-34 / 2e-10 = (1.05 / 2) * 1e-24. Wait, because 1e-34 divided by 1e-10 is 1e-24. So 1.05 / 2 is about 0.525, so 0.525e-24 kg·m/s. So Δp ≈ 5.25e-25 kg·m/s.

Now, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), but since we have an uncertainty in p, the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be (Δp²)/(2m). Wait, but maybe I should think in terms of differentials. The energy E = p²/(2m), so the uncertainty ΔE would be (2p Δp)/(2m) ) = (p Δp)/m. Hmm, no, that's the derivative. Alternatively, using the relation for uncertainty, since E is a function of p, the uncertainty in E is approximately dE/dp * Δp. Since E = p²/(2m), dE/dp = p/m. So ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can write ΔE in terms of the uncertainty in momentum.

Wait, let's think in terms of the product. Since ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, and E is p²/(2m), the uncertainty in E would be approximately (Δp)^2/(2m), perhaps. Let me check that.

Yes, because E = p²/(2m), so ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m). Because if p changes by Δp, then E changes by (p + Δp)^2/(2m) - p²/(2m) = (2p Δp + (Δp)^2)/(2m). The dominant term is the 2pΔp/(2m) which is pΔp/m, but that's for the change if p is much larger than Δp. But since we're looking for the uncertainty, maybe using ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m) is a better approximation when Δp is small compared to p. Or perhaps that's not the case here.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time, but I don't have Δt here. So perhaps that's not the way.

Wait, another approach: The minimum uncertainty in energy would correspond to the minimum uncertainty in momentum. So, using the relation from the kinetic energy, perhaps the uncertainty in energy ΔE is approximately (Δp)^2/(2m). Let me try that.

So with Δp being 5.25e-25 kg·m/s, let's compute (Δp)^2/(2m). The mass m of an electron is 9.10938356e-31 kg.

So let's compute (5.25e-25)^2 = (5.25)^2 * (1e-25)^2 = 27.56 * 1e-50 = 2.756e-49.

Then divide by (2 * 9.109e-31) → 2 * 9.1e-31 = 1.82e-30.

So 2.756e-49 / 1.82e-30 ≈ (2.756 / 1.82) * (1e-49 / 1e-30) → Approximately 1.515 * 1e-19 → 1.515e-19 J.

Wait, that's about 1.5e-19 J. Let me check that calculation again.

Wait, 5.25e-25 squared is 2.756e-49. Divided by (2 * 9.1e-31) is 1.82e-30. So 2.756e-49 / 1.82e-30 = ?

Let me compute 2.756e-49 / 1.82e-30 = (2.756 / 1.82) ) * 1e-19. Because 1e-49 divided by 1e-30 is 1e-19.

2.756 / 1.82 is approximately 1.514. So 1.514e-19 J. So the uncertainty in energy is approximately 1.5e-19 J.

Looking at the options, option C is ~1e-19 J, which is the closest. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach could be to compute the momentum p from the given speed v and then compute the fractional uncertainty. Because sometimes the uncertainty in energy is estimated using the relative uncertainty in momentum over the momentum itself.

Wait, the speed given is v = 2e8 m/s. Let's compute the momentum p = mv. So m is 9.1e-31 kg. So p = 9.1e-31 kg * 2e8 m/s = 1.82e-22 kg·m/s.

Wait, but that's the momentum. The uncertainty in momentum is 5.25e-25 kg·m/s as calculated earlier. So the fractional uncertainty in momentum is Δp/p = (5.25e-25)/(1.82e-22) ≈ (5.25/1820) ≈ 0.00288, so about 0.29%.

Wait, but how does that relate to the energy uncertainty? The kinetic energy is E = p²/(2m) = ( (1.82e-22)^2 ) / (2 * 9.1e-31 ). Let me compute that.

(1.82e-22)^2 = (1.82)^2 * 1e-44 → approx 3.31 * 1e-44 = 3.31e-44.

Divide by (2 * 9.1e-31) → 18.2e-31 = 1.82e-30.

So E = 3.31e-44 / 1.82e-30 = approx 1.81e-14 J.

Now, the relative uncertainty in E would come from the relative uncertainty in p. Since E is proportional to p squared, the relative uncertainty in E is approximately 2 times the relative uncertainty in p.

So, the relative uncertainty in p is about 0.288%, so the relative uncertainty in E is around 0.576%. So the absolute uncertainty in E would be 0.576% of 1.81e-14 J.

0.576% is 0.00576. So 1.81e-14 * 0.00576 ≈ (1.81 * 0.00576) * 1e-14 → approx 0.01037e-14 = 1.037e-16 J. Hmm, that's around 1e-16 J, which is option D. But wait, this contradicts my earlier calculation. So now I'm confused.

Wait, where am I going wrong? Let me re-examine. The first approach gave me ~1.5e-19 J via ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m), and the second approach via relative uncertainty gave me ~1e-16 J. These are two different results.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider which approach is more appropriate. The first approach uses the Heisenberg principle to find Δp, and then computes the resulting ΔE based on the kinetic energy equation. The second approach calculates the relative uncertainty based on the given speed and the momentum uncertainty.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that the electron is traveling at speed v, but the uncertainty in position is Δx. The question is about the minimum uncertainty in energy, so perhaps ΔE is found using the Heisenberg principle directly.

Wait, another thought: the energy-time uncertainty principle says ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/(2), but I don't have Δt, so that's not helpful here. So I should stick with the position-momentum approach.

Wait, in the first approach, I got ΔE ≈ 1.5e-19 J, which is option C. But in the second approach, using relative uncertainties, I got about 1e-16 J, which is option D. So which one is correct?

I think the first approach is correct because it uses the Heisenberg principle directly to find Δp, then relates that to ΔE via the kinetic energy formula. The second approach may not be the correct way because it's using the given speed v, which might not be the same as the uncertainty in velocity Δv. Oh wait, but the given speed is the average speed, and the uncertainty in momentum comes from the position uncertainty, which is via the Heisenberg principle. So perhaps the correct approach is the first one.

Wait, let's re-examine the first approach. Δp is ħ/(2Δx). Then, the kinetic energy uncertainty is (Δp)^2/(2m). Wait, but is that correct? Because E is p²/(2m), so the uncertainty in E would be approximately (2p Δp)/(2m) ) = p Δp/(m) ) → but that's for a small Δp. Alternatively, is it (Δp)^2/(2m)? I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, let me think about it differently. The energy E is (p²)/(2m), so the differential dE = (2p dp)/(2m) ) = (p dp)/m. So the uncertainty in energy ΔE is approximately (p Δp)/m. Since Δp is approximately ħ/(2Δx), then ΔE ≈ (p * ħ )/(2 m Δx).

So let me plug in the numbers again.

p is m v = 9.1e-31 kg * 2e8 m/s = 1.82e-22 kg·m/s.

So ΔE ≈ (1.82e-22 kg·m/s * 1.05e-34 J·s ) / (2 * 9.1e-31 kg * 0.1e-9 m )

Wait, let me compute each part:

Numerator: 1.82e-22 * 1.05e-34 = approx 1.91e-56 J·m²/s.

Wait, but wait, 1.82e-22 * 1.05e-34 = (1.82 * 1.05) * 1e-22-34 → 1.911 * 1e-56. So 1.911e-56.

Denominator: 2 * 9.1e-31 * 0.1e-9 = 2 *9.1e-31 * 1e-10 → 2 *9.1e-41 = 1.82e-40.

So ΔE ≈ (1.911e-56) / (1.82e-40) ) → (1.911/1.82) * 1e-16 → approx 1.05e-16 J.

Wait, that's about 1e-16 J, which is option D. But wait, earlier I thought this approach gave me 1.5e-19 J. Hmm.

Wait, this approach is using ΔE ≈ (p Δp)/m. So that's a different formula.

Wait, but which is correct? Let me think about the derivation.

E = p²/(2m)
Taking the uncertainty, ΔE = |dE/dp| * Δp = (p/m) * Δp.

So yes, ΔE ≈ (p Δp)/m.

In that case, Δp is ħ/(2Δx), so plugging that in:

ΔE ≈ (p * ħ )/(2 m Δx )

Which is what I just did.

So p is 1.82e-22 kg·m/s.

So plugging in the numbers again:

(1.82e-22) * (1.05e-34) = 1.911e-56.

Divide by (2 * 9.1e-31 * 0.1e-9) → 2 * 9.1e-31 * 1e-10 → 2 *9.1e-41 = 1.82e-40.

So 1.911e-56 / 1.82e-40 = approx 1.05e-16 J.

That's 1.05e-16 J, which is about 1e-16 J, option D.

Wait, but earlier when I used the other approach (ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m)), I got 1.5e-19 J. So which approach is correct?

I think I need to clarify. The first approach, when I used (Δp)^2/(2m), I think that's incorrect because E is proportional to p squared. So the uncertainty in E isn't just (Δp)^2/(2m), because that would ignore the p term. The correct approach is to take the differential, which gives ΔE ≈ (p Δp)/m.

So the correct value is around 1e-16 J, which is option D.

Wait, but why did the first approach give me 1.5e-19 J? Let me check that again.

In the first approach, I computed Δp as 5.25e-25 kg·m/s. Then I thought ΔE is (Δp)^2/(2m) → (5.25e-25)^2/(2*9.1e-31) → 2.756e-49 / 1.82e-30 → 1.515e-19 J.

But that seems to be wrong because the correct approach involves using the derivative of E with respect to p. So that first approach was incorrect. I should have used the differential approach, leading to option D.

But wait, the problem is asking for the minimum uncertainty in energy. The Heisenberg principle gives the minimum uncertainty in position and momentum, so perhaps the approach using ΔE = p Δp / (m) is the right way.

So according to that, the answer should be approximately 1e-16 J, which is option D.

But wait, let me compute the numbers more accurately.

Compute Δp: ħ/(2Δx) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 0.1e-9) = 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-10 → 5.272859e-25 kg·m/s.

Then, p = m v = 9.10938356e-31 kg * 2e8 m/s = 1.8218767e-22 kg·m/s.

So ΔE = (p * Δp) / m = (1.8218767e-22 * 5.272859e-25) / 9.10938356e-31.

Let me compute numerator first: 1.8218767e-22 *5.272859e-25 = (1.8218767 *5.272859) * 1e-47 → approx (9.62) * 1e-47 → 9.62e-47.

Denominator: 9.10938356e-31.

So ΔE = 9.62e-47 / 9.109e-31 ≈ 1.055e-16 J.

Which is approximately 1.055e-16 J. So that's around 1e-16 J, which is option D.

So the correct answer should be option D.


To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy \( \Delta E \) of an electron traveling with speed \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and an uncertainty in position \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the kinetic energy formula.

### Step 1: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states:
\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]
where \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) is the reduced Planck's constant. Solving for \( \Delta p \), the uncertainty in momentum:
\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x}.
\]
Substituting \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 0.1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \):
\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 0.1 \times 10^{-9}} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

### Step 2: Relating Momentum Uncertainty to Energy Uncertainty
The kinetic energy of a particle is given by:
\[
E = \frac{p^2}{2m},
\]
where \( m = 9.10938356 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) is the mass of the electron. The uncertainty in energy \( \Delta E \) can be approximated using the differential:
\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{p \cdot \Delta p}{m}.
\]
First, calculate the momentum \( p \) of the electron:
\[
p = m \cdot v = 9.10938356 \times 10^{-31} \cdot 2 \times 10^8 = 1.82 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]
Now substitute \( p = 1.82 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{kg·m/s} \) and \( \Delta p = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s} \) into the formula for \( \Delta E \):
\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{(1.82 \times 10^{-22}) \cdot (5.27 \times 10^{-25})}{9.10938356 \times 10^{-31}}.
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the Calculation
The numerator is:
\[
(1.82 \times 10^{-22}) \cdot (5.27 \times 10^{-25}) = 9.62 \times 10^{-47}.
\]
The denominator is:
\[
9.10938356 \times 10^{-31}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{9.62 \times 10^{-47}}{9.10938356 \times 10^{-31}} \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Final Answer
The minimum uncertainty in the energy \( \Delta E \) is approximately \( 1 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to **option D**.

Answer: D
