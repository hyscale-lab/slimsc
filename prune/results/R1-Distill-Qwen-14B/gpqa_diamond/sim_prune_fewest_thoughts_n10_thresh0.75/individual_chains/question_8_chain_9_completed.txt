Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about white lupine and their resistance to anthracnose. Hmm. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the setup is that they did a high-throughput experiment and found three candidate genes, G1, G2, G3. They created knock-out mutants for each and some double mutants. The goal is to figure out the interaction between these genes based on their resistance to the fungus.

The key point is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, transcription factors usually regulate other genes by binding to DNA and controlling their transcription.

The results are given as the resistance percentage compared to the wild-type control. Wild-type is 100%, so higher percentages mean more resistance. Let me jot down the data:

- g1: 75% → less resistant, so it's worse than wild-type. So knocking out G1 makes them more susceptible.
- g2: 0% → completely susceptible. So knocking out G2 is bad for resistance.
- g3: 50% → more susceptible than wild-type, but not as bad as g2.
- Double mutants:
  - g1g3: 10% → really bad, almost no resistance.
  - g2g3: 0% → same as g2 alone.
  - g1g2: 0% → same as g2 alone.

Wait, so when you have g2 in any double mutant, the resistance is 0%. Interesting. Let me think about what that means.

In genetics, when a double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, it suggests that those two genes are in the same pathway. Because if the pathway is blocked at one point, adding another mutation doesn't make it worse—because the pathway is already blocked. So the gene that when knocked out alone gives the extreme phenotype (like 0% resistance) is probably downstream.

Wait, but the phenotypes here are about resistance. So higher resistance is better. So a lower percentage is worse. So g2 is the worst. The double mutants that include g2 are also the worst. So perhaps G2 is downstream of the others.

Wait, but how do the double mutants work? Let's think about epistasis. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So, if g2's resistance is 0%, and in the double mutants where g2 is present (g1g2, g2g3), the resistance is also 0%, which is the same as g2 alone. This suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Wait, but what's the direction here?

Wait, actually, in epistasis, if a mutation in gene B masks the phenotype of gene A, then B is epistatic to A. So if the double mutant (g1g2) has the same phenotype as g2, then G2 is epistatic to G1. Because the presence of the g2 mutation (which is epistatic) masks whatever effect g1 has.

So from the data, any double mutant that includes g2 (g2g3 and g1g2) have 0% resistance, same as g2 alone. So that suggests that G2 is downstream. Because if G2 is downstream, then knocking it out would block the pathway, making everything worse. And if G1 and G3 are upstream, their knockouts might not have as severe an effect unless the downstream gene is also knocked out.

Wait, but wait. Let's think of a pathway. Suppose you have a pathway where G2 is a transcription factor (since at least one is a TF upstream of others). So G2 activates other genes, perhaps G1 and G3. Or maybe G2 is the last step.

Wait, the data shows that knocking out G2 completely abolishes resistance (0%). So without G2, the plant can't resist the fungus at all. So G2's product is essential for resistance. So if G2 is a transcription factor, it's activating some genes that are part of the resistance pathway.

So, G2 is necessary. Now, in the double mutants:

- g1g2 → 0% resistance. Same as g2.
- g2g3 → 0% same as g2.
So, when you have g2, the other mutations don't matter because the pathway is already blocked at G2.

So that suggests that G2 is downstream of G1 and G3. Because G1 and G3's functions are only necessary if G2 is present.

Wait, but G1's knockout alone gives 75% resistance. So when G1 is missing, the resistance is reduced, but not gone. So G1 is contributing to resistance, but it's not the only factor.

G3's knockout alone gives 50% resistance. So when G3 is missing, the resistance is halved.

But when both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance drops to 10%. So combining the two makes the situation worse than either single knockout. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are not redundant, because their combined effect is worse than either alone. Wait, but what about gene redundancy?

Wait, gene redundancy is when two genes perform the same function. So knocking out both would have the same effect as knocking out one. But here, the effect is more severe when both are knocked out. So that suggests they are not redundant. Alternatively, perhaps they are in parallel pathways, and knocking both out removes all the redundancy.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are both upstream of G2, and their activities contribute to G2's function. So if both are missing, G2 can't function as well, leading to more severe resistance issues.

Wait, but the single mutants for G1 and G3 are not as bad as G2's. So G2 is more critical. So perhaps G2 is downstream of both G1 and G3. So if you have a problem with G2, the downstream gene, the pathway stops. But if you have a problem with either G1 or G3 (upstream), the pathway is affected but perhaps other upstream factors can compensate.

Wait, but looking at the data again, the single mutants' resistance levels are:

G1: 75% → 25% less than wild type.
G3: 50% → 50% less.
G2: 0% → completely gone.

So knocking out G2 is worse than either G1 or G3. So G2 is more critical. So G2 must be downstream. Because if a downstream gene is knocked out, the pathway is blocked, so the phenotype is worse.

So the pathway might look like G1 and G3 are upstream of G2. So G2 is a transcription factor that's activated by G1 and G3. Or G2 is the transcription factor, and it activates other downstream genes (which could be G1 and G3? Or other genes).

Alternatively, G2 could be the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are target genes that it activates. So if G2 is knocked out, then G1 and G3 aren't expressed, leading to no resistance. But that can't be because the single mutants g1 and g3 have some resistance. So that suggests that G1 and G3 can be expressed without G2.

Wait, but perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes. Let me think.

If G2 is a transcription factor, and it's necessary for the expression of other genes that contribute to resistance, then knocking out G2 would mean those downstream genes aren't expressed, leading to no resistance. So in the single mutant g2, no resistance.

But the single mutants g1 and g3 still have some resistance. So for example, G1 and G3 might be involved in other pathways or have some function that doesn't require G2.

Wait, but when G2 is present, the function of G1 and G3 is important. So, for instance, G2 is a TF that activates G1 and G3, which in turn have their own functions in resistance. But that seems a bit circular.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is part of a signaling pathway. If G2 is knocked out, the entire resistance mechanism is disabled, but if only G1 or G3 is knocked out, the pathway can compensate a bit.

But then the double mutants: when both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. So that suggests that G1 and G3 have additive effects. So their functions are not redundant, but perhaps they contribute in some additive way to the resistance.

Wait, but let me think about the possible options.

The options are A to D. Let me read them again.

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. Not sure if that's relevant here.

Option B: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter would suggest they are part of a gene cluster or something. Not sure.

Option C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Hmm. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the phenotype of g1g3 would be same as g1. But in the data, g1g3 is 10% which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So that doesn't fit. Because if G1 is epistatic, the double mutant should have the same as the more severe of the two singles. But here, it's worse. So that suggests that G1 and G3 have additive effects, meaning they're in parallel pathways, perhaps.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy is when two genes do the same thing. So knocking out both would have the same effect as knocking out one. But in our case, the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single, which suggests redundancy isn't the case. So D might not be correct.

Wait, but let me think again. If G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out one (g1 or g3) would have a certain effect, but knocking out both would have the same effect as each single. But in our data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either single (75% or 50%). So gene redundancy doesn't fit. So D is likely incorrect.

So let's look back at the options.

The question says that at least one is a transcription factor upstream of others. So from the data, G2's knockout is the most severe. So perhaps G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream. Because without G2, the resistance is completely gone. So G2 is a TF that is necessary for resistance.

If G2 is a TF, then the other genes (G1 and G3) might be targets of G2, or they might be upstream of G2.

Wait, but when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%, but G1 and G3's knockouts are less severe. So perhaps G2 is downstream of G1 and G3, and G1 and G3 are upstream. So if G2 is a TF, it's possible that it's activated by G1 and/or G3. Or perhaps G2 is an enzyme that is necessary for a step in the resistance pathway.

Wait, let's think about the double mutants. The g1g3 double mutant has 10%, which is worse than either single. So if the two genes contribute additively to the resistance, their combined knockout is worse than either alone. So this suggests that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, perhaps, each contributing a part to the resistance.

But then in the presence of G2, their combined absence makes the resistance very low. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is downstream and requires both G1 and G3. But that doesn't quite fit because the g2 single mutant is 0%, which is worse than the double g1g3 (10%).

Wait, maybe the pathway is such that G2 is the main component, and G1 and G3 are backup systems. So when G2 is absent, the backup systems don't help, leading to 0% resistance. When G1 is absent, the backup (G3) provides some resistance, but not full. Similarly, when G3 is absent, G1 provides some, but not as much as when both are present. When both G1 and G3 are absent, the backup systems are gone, but since G2 is present, does that matter? Wait, but in the g1g3 mutant, G2 is present. Wait, but in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is much worse than g2's 0%. Wait no, 10% is worse than even g2's 0%? No, 0% is all infected, so 10% is much worse. Wait, no, 10% is 10% of the control's 100%, so much worse than G2's 0% which is no resistance. Wait, that can't be because 0% is all infected, so 10% is a small amount of resistance. So perhaps I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, the control is 100% resistant. So 0% is completely susceptible. 10% is a very low resistance. So in the g1g3 double mutant, the plant has only 10% resistance, which is worse (more susceptible) than g1 (75%) or g3 (50%).

So perhaps G1 and G3 are both necessary for a certain part of the resistance pathway, and when both are knocked out, even with G2 present, the resistance is compromised more. So this suggests that G2 is a separate pathway.

Wait, but the double mutants involving G2 (g1g2 and g2g3) have 0% resistance. So when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is completely gone, regardless of the status of G1 or G3. So that suggests that G2 is downstream of both G1 and G3.

So putting this together: G2 is downstream and is essential. G1 and G3 are upstream and contribute to the pathway. So when G2 is knocked out, the pathway is blocked, and resistance is lost. If only G1 is knocked out, the pathway is partially affected, but perhaps G3 can compensate, leading to 75% resistance. Similarly, if G3 is knocked out, G1 can compensate a bit, leading to 50% resistance. But when both are knocked out, even though G2 is still present, the upstream factors are gone, leading to very low resistance (10%).

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because G2 is downstream. If G2 is present but both upstream genes are gone, the resistance shouldn't be high. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So if G2 is present, G1 and G3 are expressed. If G2 is knocked out, G1 and G3 can't be expressed, so no resistance. But in the data, the single mutants of G1 and G3 still have some resistance. So that contradicts this, because if G2 is necessary for their expression, then their single knockouts shouldn't have any expression of those genes, but they do have some resistance.

Wait, unless G1 and G3 are expressed through other means as well. Like, perhaps they have another promoter that doesn't require G2. So their expression isn't solely dependent on G2.

So, G2 is a transcription factor that enhances the expression of G1 and G3, but they can be expressed at some level without G2. So when G2 is knocked out, their expression is lower, leading to lower resistance. But that doesn't fit with the data because when G2 is knocked out, resistance is zero, which suggests that without G2's activation, G1 and G3 can't contribute anything.

Wait, but perhaps G2 is a TF that activates other downstream genes necessary for resistance. So if G2 is knocked out, the downstream genes aren't expressed, and resistance is completely lost. But then, what about the single knockouts of G1 and G3?

If G1 and G3 are downstream of G2, then their knockouts wouldn't affect the pathway as much. But in the data, their knockouts have some effect—g1 has 75% and g3 has 50%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are upstream of G2. So G1 and G3 activate G2. If that's the case, then knocking out G1 or G3 would reduce the activation of G2, leading to lower resistance. But if G2 is absent, then no activation, so no resistance.

Wait, but the data shows that when G2 is knocked out, resistance is zero. So if G2 is a TF that's necessary for the resistance pathway, then any mutation in G2 would completely block the pathway.

So, considering that, let's model the possible interactions.

Possibility:

G1 and G3 are upstream of G2. G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes necessary for resistance. So, if G2 isn't working, those downstream genes aren't expressed, and resistance is gone. But if G2 is working, but G1 or G3 is missing, perhaps the function of G2 is reduced, leading to lower resistance.

Wait, but that doesn't directly explain the data. Let me try to model it with the data.

If G2 is a TF, and it's necessary for the expression of both G1 and G3. Then, in a wild-type, G2 is expressed, leading to G1 and G3 being expressed. If G1 is knocked out, then only G3 is expressed. But without G1, perhaps the resistance is lower because G3 alone isn't enough. Similarly, if G3 is knocked out, G1 might still contribute, but not as much. But when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, even though G2 is expressed, without G1 and G3, the downstream resistance genes aren't expressed, leading to low resistance. But wait, in our data, g1g3 is 10% resistance, which is lower than the wild-type but not zero. So that can't be the case, unless G2 has another function.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the only gene involved in the resistance pathway, but that can't be because the single mutants of G1 and G3 have partial resistance.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are part of separate pathways that contribute to the overall resistance. So, when G2 is knocked out, both pathways are affected, leading to no resistance. But when only G1 is knocked out, another pathway (through G3) is still functional but less efficient, leading to 75% resistance. Similarly, when G3 is knocked out, the G1 pathway provides 50% resistance. When both G1 and G3 are knocked out, even though G2 is present, there's nothing to contribute, leading to 10% resistance.

Wait, but in that case, G2 isn't part of those pathways, but the data says that when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%, implying that G2 is necessary for the pathways.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a master regulator that activates both G1 and G3, which in turn activate other genes. So without G2, G1 and G3 aren't expressed, and the downstream genes aren't either. But if G1 is knocked out, G3 is still expressed, leading to some activation of downstream genes, hence 75% resistance. Similarly, if G3 is knocked out, G1 is still expressed, leading to 50% resistance. If both are knocked out, then even though G2 is present, no downstream activation occurs, leading to 10% resistance.

But wait, in that scenario, the double mutant g1g3 would have 10% resistance, which is worse than each single.

So, putting that together:

G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 each activate other genes (maybe redundant or additive) that contribute to resistance. So when G2 is knocked out, G1 and G3 aren't expressed, so no resistance (0%). When G1 is knocked out, G3 is expressed and activates some resistance genes, leading to 75% resistance. When G3 is knocked out, G1 is expressed and activates less, leading to 50% resistance. When both G1 and G3 are knocked out, even though G2 is present and active, there are no downstream genes expressed because both G1 and G3 are absent, leading to 10% resistance.

But wait, if G2 is present, why isn't G1 and G3 expressed? Because if G2 is a TF that activates G1 and G3, then in the double mutant g1g3, G2 is present and should activate G1 and G3. But since G1 and G3 are knocked out, their expression is zero. So the downstream effect is minimal.

Wait, that makes sense. So in the g1g3 mutant, G2 is expressed, but G1 and G3 are not. So G2 can't activate anything because G1 and G3 are gone. So the resistance is very low.

Wait, but the data shows that the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is lower than the individual knockouts. So that fits this model.

But let's see what the options say. The options involve whether G1 or G2 or G3 is a TF, and relationships between them.

Looking again at the options:

Option A) G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But according to the data, G2's knockout is worse, so G2 would be downstream. So G2 is epistatic to G1, meaning that G2's mutation masks the effect of G1's mutation. So that would fit if G2 is downstream.

But the option says G1 is a TF, which contradicts our earlier analysis that G2 is the TF.

Option B) G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter suggests they're co-regulated, perhaps by G2. But the epistasis would mean that G3 mutation masks G1. But in the data, when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either single. So if G3 is epistatic to G1, the double mutant should have the same as G3. But in data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than G3's 50%. So that doesn't fit.

Option C) G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. Not sure how that applies here. Also, G1 being epistatic towards G3 would mean that in the double mutant, the phenotype is same as G1. But in data, the double is worse, so this doesn't fit.

Option D) G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy would mean that the double mutant has the same as the single. But in data, it's worse, so D is out.

Hmm, so only option B and C have G2 as a TF. Let's re-examine.

Option B says G1 and G3 have the same promoter. So G2, being a TF, could be regulating them. If the promoter is the same, then G2's regulation would affect both. But the data shows that g1 and g3 have different resistance levels. If they have the same promoter, knocking out G1 would not affect G3's expression. Wait, but the knockouts are of the genes themselves, not the promoter. So if the promoter is the same, then G2's regulation would affect both. But their single knockouts have different resistances, so that might not fit.

Option B also says G3 is epistatic towards G1. So the double mutant would have the same phenotype as G3. But in reality, the double is worse. So that doesn't fit.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy—maybe G1 and G3 affect other traits. Not directly relevant to the resistance data. G1 being epistatic suggests that the double mutant would have same as G1. But in data, double has 10%, which is worse than either. So option C is not correct.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I should think about the epistatic relationships differently.

In the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is 0% (same as g2). So when G2 is not working, the resistance is gone, regardless of G1. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, in the double mutant g2g3, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3.

In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is the same as neither single. So this suggests that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. So their effects are additive. So when both are knocked out, the effect is worse.

So, putting this together:

G2 is downstream of G1 and G3. Because when G2 is knocked out, the phenotype is worse than either G1 or G3. But wait, the data shows that when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%, which is worse than either single. So perhaps G2 is a gene that, when not functioning, causes no resistance, regardless of G1 and G3.

Wait, but in that case, why do G1 and G3 knockouts have partial resistance? Because perhaps G2 is part of a more critical pathway, and without G2, the resistance is completely gone. But when G2 is present, G1 and G3 contribute to the resistance.

So, G2 is a TF that's required for the main pathway, and G1 and G3 are in auxiliary pathways that contribute when G2 is present.

Wait, but the data for the g1g3 double mutant shows 10% resistance. So even when G2 is present, but G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is low. So perhaps G1 and G3 are part of the same pathway as G2, and their functions contribute to the same pathway.

Alternatively, let me think of the genes as operating in a linear pathway. If G2 is the last step, then any mutation in G2 would block the pathway, leading to no resistance. But if G1 and G3 are upstream of G2, their mutations would reduce the input to G2, leading to less resistance.

But the data shows that when G2 is knocked out, resistance is 0%. When G1 is knocked out, it's 75%, and G3 is 50%. So G1's knockout has a smaller effect than G3's knockout. So perhaps G1 has a smaller role than G3.

Wait, but that doesn't fit with the double mutant g1g3 having 10%, which is worse than either. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways that feed into G2.

So, G2 is the main gene for resistance, but G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that also contribute. So if G2 is knocked out, resistance is zero. If G1 is knocked out, the remaining pathway via G3 provides 75% resistance. If G3 is knocked out, the remaining pathway via G1 provides 50% resistance. If both are knocked out, there's no alternative pathways, so resistance is 10%.

But why is the resistance 10% when both G1 and G3 are knocked out? Maybe there's a minor pathway that neither G1 nor G3 is part of, which only contributes 10% resistance.

Hmm. That might fit. So G2 is the main gene, and G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways that contribute to G2's function. So, when G2 is knocked out, no resistance. When G1 is knocked out, G3's pathway provides 75% resistance. When G3 is knocked out, G1's pathway provides 50%. When both are knocked out, only the minor pathway is left, providing 10%.

But then, what's the role of G2 being a transcription factor? If G2 is a TF, perhaps it's activating other downstream genes that are part of the resistance pathway. So, G2 being a TF, and the main pathway, when G2 is knocked out, no activation, so no resistance. G1 and G3 might be part of secondary pathways that are less efficient but still contribute some resistance.

So, putting this together, G2 is a TF acting upstream, and G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways that are part of the resistance mechanism. So their individual knockouts reduce resistance, but not as much as G2's knockout.

Looking at the options again, which one aligns with this?

Option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Hmm, same promoter suggests they are co-regulated. If G2 is a TF that activates both, then knocking out G2 would prevent both G1 and G3 from being expressed. But in the data, when G2 is knocked out, resistance is 0%, which fits. But when G1 is knocked out, G3 is still expressed (since same promoter would mean same regulation), leading to 75% resistance. Similarly, when G3 is knocked out, G1 is still expressed, leading to 50% resistance. When both are knocked out, G2 is expressed but can't activate anything, leading to 10% resistance. But wait, if G1 and G3 have the same promoter, their expression would be co-regulated. So if G2 is a TF that activates their promoter, then knocking out G2 would prevent both from being expressed. But in the data, when G2 is knocked out, resistance is 0%, which would fit. But when only G1 is knocked out, G3 would still be expressed, as their promoter is intact. So their single knockouts would have some resistance.

But what does this model say about the double mutant g1g3? If both are knocked out, but G2 is present, their promoter is active, but both genes are knocked out, so no expression. So resistance is 10%, which is the case in the data.

Wait, but the data shows that when G2 is knocked out, resistance is 0%, which is consistent with G2 being necessary for their expression. So perhaps G2 is a TF that activates the promoter of G1 and G3. So in that case, the option B suggests G1 and G3 have the same promoter, which is regulated by G2.

So in the case of G2 being a TF, and G1 and G3 having the same promoter, then knocking out G2 would prevent both from being expressed. But the data shows that the single mutants have some resistance, which would require that G1 and G3 are expressed through another promoter or another regulatory mechanism.

But this contradicts because if G2 is necessary for their expression, then their single knockouts shouldn't have any expression.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think about the epistatic relationships.

G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3 because any double mutant involving G2 has the same phenotype as G2. So G2 is downstream.

So the pathway is G1 and G3 → G2 → resistance.

So, G2 is a TF that acts downstream of G1 and G3. So when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is gone, regardless of G1 and G3.

But when G1 is knocked out, G3 can somehow compensate, leading to 75% resistance. When G3 is knocked out, G1 compensates less, leading to 50% resistance.

In the double mutant g1g3, G2 is still present but can't get input from G1 or G3, leading to 10% resistance.

So, G1 and G3 are upstream of G2 and contribute to its function. When both are knocked out, G2 can't function, leading to low resistance.

But how does that fit with the data? Because the data shows that when G2 is knocked out, resistance is zero, which would happen if G2 is essential for the entire pathway.

Wait, perhaps G2 is the only gene that's directly involved in the resistance pathway, and G1 and G3 are redundant upstream regulators of G2. So, G1 and G3 activate G2, and if either is present, G2 is active. But if both are knocked out, G2 isn't activated, leading to low resistance.

But that doesn't fit because in the data, when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is zero, regardless of G1 and G3.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF that activates G1 and G3, which in turn activate other genes. So without G2, G1 and G3 can't be expressed, leading to no resistance. But then, in the single mutants of G1 and G3, their expression would be lower, but G2 can still activate the other gene. Wait, but G1 and G3 are downstream of G2, so if G2 is present, but G1 is knocked out, G3 can be expressed, leading to some resistance.

But the data shows that the single mutant of G1 has 75% resistance, which is higher than G3's 50%, so perhaps G1 contributes more to the pathway than G3.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways that both activate G2. So, if either is present, G2 is sufficiently active. But if both are knocked out, G2 isn't active enough, leading to low resistance.

Wait, but the data shows that when G2 is knocked out, resistance is zero, which would make sense if G2 is the only active gene in the pathway.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to align with the options.

The correct answer must involve G2 being the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 being in some relationship. The given data suggests that G1 and G3 are not redundant because their double mutant is worse than either single. So the options that have G2 as TF and G1 and G3 not redundant are options C and D.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But the double mutant is worse than either, which doesn't fit with G1 being epistatic. So probably not.

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But again, their double is worse, so redundancy is out. So D is out.

So that leaves option B and C. But option B says G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than G3's 50% and G1's 75%. So the double is worse than either, which doesn't fit with G3 being epistatic.

Wait, maybe I should think about the concept of recessive and dominant epistasis.

Wait, if G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, then any mutation in G2 masks the effect of G1 and G3. So in the double mutants with G2, the resistance is 0%, same as G2. So G2 is epistatic.

Now, looking at the data for g1g3 = 10% which is worse than either single.

In the case of additive effects, the double mutant's phenotype is worse than either single, which suggests that the two genes function in parallel pathways.

So, G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to the resistance. G2 is in a separate, more critical pathway.

But the data shows that when G2 is knocked out, resistance is zero. So perhaps G2 is the main pathway, and G1 and G3 are minor contributors.

Wait, perhaps G2 is the only gene in the main resistance pathway, and G1 and G3 are in a minor, backup pathway. So, if G2 is knocked out, resistance is zero. If either G1 or G3 is knocked out, the backup pathway is partially functional. If both are knocked out, the backup is gone, leading to 10% resistance (maybe some other minor mechanism).

But how does that fit the data?

g1: backup via G3 → 75% resistance.

g3: backup via G1 → 50% resistance.

g1g3: backup is gone, but perhaps there's a tiny bit left → 10%.

But then, G2 would be the main gene, and G1 and G3 are part of a backup. But in that case, G2 is a TF, and it's the main gene. So G2's knockout is 0%, which is correct.

So, in this case, G1 and G3 are in a backup pathway. So their single knockouts have some effect, but not as much as G2's knockout. Their double knockout makes the backup worse, leading to even lower resistance.

So, putting the options into this model.

Which option fits?

Option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter (maybe part of backup), G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Not sure.

Option A: G1 is a TF, which is not correct as per data.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Not sure.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are not in the same pathway as G2, but in separate pathways. And G2 is a critical gene. So the interaction is that G2 is downstream of G1 and G3.

Wait, but without G2, there's no resistance. So G2 must be in a pathway that is essential for resistance, and G1 and G3 are in other pathways.

But in that case, the double mutant g1g3 would have 10% resistance, which would be due to another pathway not involving G2. But according to the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is lower than either single, suggesting that their combined absence makes the resistance worse.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible answer.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF. Doesn't fit because G2's knockout is worse.

Option B: G2 is TF. So correct.

G1 and G3 have same promoter. So their expression is co-regulated. So if G2 is a TF, it may activate their promoter. So when G2 is knocked out, G1 and G3 are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But then, the single knockouts of G1 and G3 would still have the other expressed, leading to some resistance.

But in the data, when G1 is knocked out, G3 is expressed, so resistance is 75%. Similarly, when G3 is knocked out, G1 is expressed, leading to 50% resistance. So this would fit if G2 is the TF that activates both.

But when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, even though G2 is present, their promoter is activated, but both genes are not expressed. So their downstream effects are minimal, leading to 10% resistance. So that would fit.

So in this case, G2 is a TF. G1 and G3 have the same promoter, so they're co-regulated. G3 is epistatic towards G1 because in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than G3's 50% but better than G1's 75%. So that doesn't fit the epistatic part.

Wait, no, epistasis is about the masking of phenotypes. So if G3 is epistatic to G1, then the double mutant would have the same as G3. But in reality, the double is worse than either.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look for the option that correctly identifies G2 as the TF and the epistatic relationships.

Looking back, the double mutants involving G2 have 0%, so G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. So this suggests that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each providing some resistance, and their combined knockout makes it worse.

So, G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways that contribute to the resistance. So their combined knockout reduces the resistance more.

So, which option says that G2 is a TF and G1 and G3 are additive (not redundant)?

The options don't directly say anything about additivity. Let's see.

Option B and C are the only ones with G2 as TF.

Option B says G3 is epistatic towards G1. So in the double mutant g1g3, the phenotype would be same as G3. But in the data, it's worse. So B is incorrect.

Option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So the double would have the same as G1. But data shows worse than either. So no.

So perhaps none of the options perfectly fit, but the best fit is option B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but another approach: the resistance levels.

In the double mutants involving G2, the resistance is 0% (same as G2). So G2 is epistatic. So G2 is downstream.

In the double mutant g1g3, resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. So G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways.

So the model is that G2 is a TF acting downstream of G1 and G3, which are in parallel pathways.

So G1 and G3 contribute to the same pathway, which is regulated by G2.

Wait, but how?

If G2 is a TF that activates both G1 and G3, then when G2 is knocked out, G1 and G3 aren't expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But when G1 is knocked out, G3 is expressed, leading to 75% resistance, and when G3 is knocked out, G1 is expressed, leading to 50% resistance.

Wait, but why would G3's expression lead to 75% resistance when G1 is knocked out?

Because perhaps G3 contributes more to resistance, or perhaps it's part of a more efficient pathway.

But why, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10%? Because G2 is present, but G1 and G3 are absent, so the downstream resistance genes aren't getting activated, leading to very low resistance.

So in this model, G2 is a TF that activates G1 and G3, which in turn activate other genes. So G1 and G3 are part of the same pathway, but their contributions are additive.

But then, their single knockouts would each reduce the activation of the downstream genes, leading to lower resistance. The double knockout would reduce it even more.

So this fits with the data.

In terms of the options, which one fits?

The correct conclusion would be that G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, with their effects being additive. So their combined knockout results in a more severe phenotype than either alone.

Looking at the options:

Option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 same promoter (so same regulation by G2), G3 is epistatic towards G1.

But the data doesn't support G3 being epistatic. Because in double mutant, the resistance is worse than either.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

No, as the double mutant doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is A. Let's re-look.

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

No, because G2's knockout is worse, so G2 is downstream.

So the correct option is B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter (so same regulation), and G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but the epistasis part doesn't fit. Because in the double mutant, the resistance is worse than either. So perhaps the correct option is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, because G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 have the same promoter (so same regulation), leading to their expression being dependent on G2. So when G2 is knocked out, they aren't expressed. When G1 is knocked out, G3 is expressed, leading to 75% resistance. When G3 is knocked out, G1 is expressed, leading to 50% resistance. When both are knocked out, G2 is present but can't activate either, leading to 10% resistance.

So this seems to fit the data. So the option that states G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but why would G3 be epistatic towards G1? Because in the double mutant, the phenotype is worse than either. So maybe it's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the term 'epistatic' in the options is referring to the position in the pathway. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3 because it's downstream. So in the options, the correct statement is that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, option A says G2 is epistatic towards G1. So that's correct for the interaction between G2 and G1. But option A has G1 as the TF, which is incorrect.

Hmm. Perhaps the correct answer is option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps none of the options perfectly fit, but the best fit is option B.

Wait, another angle: The gene interactions can be modeled as a pathway where G2 is the last step. G1 and G3 are upstream and in parallel. So, when G2 is knocked out, it doesn't matter what happens upstream—resistance is zero. When G1 is knocked out, G3 can compensate a little, leading to 75% resistance. When G3 is knocked out, G1 compensates less, leading to 50% resistance. When both are knocked out, the upstream is gone, so even though G2 is present, the input is missing, leading to 10% resistance.

So, this suggests that G2 is a TF that is the main gene in the pathway, and G1 and G3 are in parallel upstream pathways that contribute to G2's function.

In this case, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So any mutation in G2 masks the effect of G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, the correct one would have G2 as a TF and G2 epistatic to others.

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1 → correct, but G1 is a TF → incorrect.

Option B: G2 is TF, and G3 is epistatic towards G1 → incorrect.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 is epistatic towards G3 → incorrect.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are redundant → incorrect.

Hmm. None of the options perfectly fit, but the correct conclusion is that G2 is a TF and epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, only option A and B have G2 as TF in part of their description.

Wait, looking again:

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

So, if G2 is epistatic to G1, then when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%, which is correct. But option A says G1 is a TF, which can't be correct because the data shows that G2's knockout is more severe.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but that would require G1 being the TF, which doesn't fit the data.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B. Because G2 is a TF and G1 and G3 are co-regulated. Their single knockouts have some resistance, and the double is worse.

So, the correct answer is option B.


The question involves analyzing the interaction of three genes (G1, G2, G3) in white lupine resistance to anthracnose. The experimental data provides resistance levels for single and double mutants, and the goal is to determine the gene interactions and their roles based on the resistance percentages.

### Key Observations:
1. **Single Mutants**:
   - **g1**: 75% resistance (moderate reduction).
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (completely susceptible).
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (significant reduction).

2. **Double Mutants**:
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2).
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2).
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either single mutant).

3. **Epistasis and Pathway Inference**:
   - The resistance of double mutants involving **g2** (g1g2 and g2g3) is identical to g2 alone (0%), indicating that **G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3**. This suggests that G2 is downstream in the pathway.
   - The resistance of the double mutant **g1g3** is worse than either single mutant (10% vs. 75% and 50%), indicating that **G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways** and their contributions are additive.

4. **Role of G2**:
   - G2's knockout results in 0% resistance, making it the most critical gene. This strongly suggests that **G2 is a transcription factor (TF) acting upstream of other genes** in the resistance pathway.

5. **Role of G1 and G3**:
   - The single mutants g1 (75%) and g3 (50%) show partial resistance, indicating that they contribute to the resistance pathway but are not as critical as G2.
   - The double mutant g1g3 (10%) suggests that G1 and G3 are not redundant but rather function in parallel pathways, each contributing partially to resistance.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: States that G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic towards G1. This is incorrect because the data shows that G2 is not pleiotropic, and G1 is not a transcription factor (G2 is the TF).
- **Option B**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic towards G1. This partially fits the data:
  - G2 is correctly identified as the TF.
  - G1 and G3 having the same promoter aligns with their co-regulation by G2.
  - However, G3 is not epistatic towards G1, as the double mutant g1g3 has a worse phenotype than either single mutant.
- **Option C**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. This is incorrect because the data does not support pleiotropy or G1 being epistatic to G3.
- **Option D**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. This is incorrect because the data shows that G1 and G3 are not redundant (their double mutant has a worse phenotype than either single mutant).

### Conclusion:
The best fit is **Option B**, as it correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and aligns with the co-regulation of G1 and G3. While the claim that G3 is epistatic towards G1 does not fully fit the data, it is the most accurate among the given options.
