Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me see what the question says.

Alright, the question is about observing the decay of a single atom. They gave some information: the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Wait, so that means if we have a bunch of these atoms, 32% of them would decay in 100 minutes? Or wait, maybe it's different. The question says "the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes." Oh wait, but wait, when dealing with individual atoms, we talk about probabilities, and it's a continuous process. So I think this relates to the concept of half-life, but maybe not exactly half-life because the decay constant is what we'll need here.

So the setup: we have a single atom. Initially, we knew that within 100 minutes, the probability it decays is 32%. So in other words, the probability that it hasn't decayed after 100 minutes is 68% (since 100% - 32% = 68%). Wait, no, wait, the wording says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that would mean that the survival probability after 100 minutes is 68%, right?

Wait, no. Let me think again. For a radioactive decay, the probability of decay by time t is 1 minus the exponential term. So the decay follows an exponential decay law
