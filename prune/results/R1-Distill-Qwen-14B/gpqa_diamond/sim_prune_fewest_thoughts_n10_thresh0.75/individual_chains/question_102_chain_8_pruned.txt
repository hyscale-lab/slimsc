Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about a ligand-receptor pair and a mouse model. Let me go through it step by step. 

So, the setup is that they've identified a new ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They want to understand their developmental fate. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets. The ligand is a coiled-coil made of two alpha helices. 

They made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Hmm, bicistronic means it has two genes in one vector. The vector has the ligand's ORF (open reading frame) at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. Then, the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor is preceded by an IRES regulatory element. IRES is involved in internal ribosome entry, so maybe it allows for the receptor to be expressed without the need for a second promoter? 

Between the ligand and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between the receptor and eGFP, there's a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on how these work. I think that loxP sites are recognition sites for Cre recombinase. When Cre is present, it excises the stop cassette. So, in the absence of Cre, the stop codons would prevent expression of the downstream fluorescent proteins. 

So, if the vector is transfected into cells, but without Cre, the ligand would be expressed because the CBA promoter is strong, but the stop cassette would prevent mCherry from being expressed. Similarly, the receptor would be expressed with the IRES, but the stop before eGFP would prevent its expression. But wait, wait. If the ligand is first, with a stop, and the receptor is after an IRES, which allows for internal initiation. So without Cre, the ligand would be expressed along with mCherry? No, wait. The ligand is fused to mCherry, but the stop cassette is in between. So for the ligand, the ORF would have a stop before mCherry. So the ligand ORF is followed by a stop, then mCherry, but in a loxP cassette. So without Cre, the stop is present, meaning the ligand is expressed but not mCherry. Similarly, for the receptor, the IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed, but the stop before eGFP would prevent eGFP expression unless Cre is present. 

Wait, maybe the vector is set up so that the ligand and receptor are co-expressed, but the fluorescent proteins are under the control of Cre. Because the loxP and lox2272 sites are different, so they can't recombine with each other but can each recombine with Cre. So, in the presence of Cre,
