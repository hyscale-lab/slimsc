Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the final product's NMR spectrum. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, looking at the reaction steps:

1. Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. So, what's that reaction? Oh, wait, I remember that when acetic acid is treated with a brominating agent like Br2 in the presence of a base like pyridine, it's probably undergoing a substitution reaction. Acetic acid has an -OH group. Bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride... Oh, right! That's the conditions for forming an acyl bromide. So the -OH gets replaced by Br. So product 1 would be acetyl bromide, which is CH3COBr.

2. Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid. Hmm. Heating an acyl bromide with ethanol and H2SO4. That sounds like an esterification reaction. Wait, no, wait. Wait, acyl bromide and ethanol would undergo nucleophilic acyl substitution. So the Br is replaced by the ethoxide ion. So product 2 would be ethyl acetate, right? Because when an acyl bromide reacts with an alcohol (like ethanol), it forms an ester. So ethyl acetate would be CH3COOCH2CH3.

3. Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide. Sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a nucleophile. So the ester (ethyl acetate) would undergo nucleophilic acyl substitution. The CN- would attack the carbonyl, replacing the OR group. So product 3 would be CH3CON-CN. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Ethyl acetate is CH3CO-OCH2CH3. When treated with NaCN, which is a good nucleophile, the -OCH2CH3 group would be replaced by CN. So product 3 would be CH3CO-N(C) something. Wait, no. Wait, cyanide replaces the OR group in esters. So the product is CH3CO-CN, which is acrylonitrile? Wait, no. Wait, acrylonitrile is CH2=CH-Câ‰¡N. Oh wait, no, I think I'm getting mixed up. Alternatively, the product is CH3CON-CN? No, wait. No, the ester is CH3COOEt. When you substitute the OEt with CN, you get CH3COCN. Oh, wait, no, wait. The structure of ethyl acetate is O=C-OEt. So substitution with CN gives O=C-CN. Wait, that's acetonitrile? No, wait, acetonitrile is CH3CN. Oh, wait: ethyl acetate is CH3CO-OEt. When you do a substitution with CN-, it becomes CH3CO-CN. So that's acetyl cyanide. So product 3 is CH3C(O)CN.

4. Product 3 is treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane. Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base and a good deprotonating agent. But in what context? Also, 1,5-dibromopentane is a dihalide. So perhaps this is a dehydrohalogenation reaction, but in what way?

Wait, product 3 is CH3C(O)CN. So, first, what's the structure? It's acetylnitrile, right? Or is it methyl acrylonitrile? Wait, maybe the structure is CH2(CO)CN? No, no, no, product 3 is CH3C(O)CN. So, the structure is:

O
||
C(CN)-CH3

Wait, no. Wait, ethyl acetate is CH3CO-OEt. Replacing OEt with CN gives CH3CO-CN. So that's (CH3)CO-CN. So the structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CN

So, that's acetonitrile with an acetyl group attached? Wait, no, wait. Acetonitrile is CH3CN. So CH3C(O)CN would be a ketone with a nitr
