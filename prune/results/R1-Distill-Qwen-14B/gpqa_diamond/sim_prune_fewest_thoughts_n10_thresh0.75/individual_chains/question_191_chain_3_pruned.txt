Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, it's a bit intimidating, but I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question is about and figure out what each step does to the molecule.

The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw that out. So, it's a cyclohexanone ring. The substituents are a hydroxymethyl group on carbon 3 and a prop-1-en-2-yl group on carbon 5. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like a vinyl group attached to the cyclohexane. So, the structure is a cyclohexanone with a hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) on C3 and a CH2CH2CH2 group but wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CHCH2 where the double bond is between C1 and C2. So it's CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CHCH2- attached through the second carbon? Or wait, the structure of prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C(CH2)- where the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me think: prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CHCH2-? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So the substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, which would be the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the group is CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that's propane. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=CHCH2- attached at the second carbon. So, the substituent on C5 is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2? Hmm, maybe I should think of it as CH2-CH(CH2) attached via the central carbon? Wait, maybe it's actually CH2=CH-CH2- but attached at the middle carbon? No, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH2- attached via the first carbon. I'm getting confused. Let me think of prop-1
