Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, is reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's NMR spectra are given. My task is to identify what compound X is from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the formation of epoxides. Oh wait, no, wait. Actually, I think it's used in the ring-opening of epoxides. Or maybe it's in some kind of elimination reaction? Wait, no, I'm mixing things up. Let's think again. Oh right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong base. It's commonly used as a catalyst in the epoxidation of alkenes, but wait, no, that's another reagent. Oh wait, no, I think that's right. Maybe it's used in olefin epoxidation.

Wait, wait, no. I think I'm getting this confused with another reaction. Oh, wait! When you have an epoxide, reacting it with a strong base can cause it to ring-open. But the reagent here is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a bicyclic amine, a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It's used in the epoxide ring-opening, but wait, no, wait. Alternatively, perhaps it's used for elimination reactions, like in the formation of alkenes from epoxides through base-induced ring-opening with a strong base.

Wait, but in this case, the product is the result of reacting compound X with this base. So, perhaps compound X is an epoxide that undergoes some kind of reaction, maybe ring-opening. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is to form an epoxide from a diene.

Wait, the product's NMR is given. Let me look at that. The 1H-NMR shows:
