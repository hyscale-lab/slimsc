Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics, right? I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum of a particle.

The problem says an electron is moving along the x-direction with a speed v of 2*10^8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. The options are given in different orders of magnitude, so probably I can figure it out by estimating.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The question mentions the uncertainty in space, Δx, which relates to the uncertainty in momentum, Δp. Because Heisenberg's principle states that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. So I think the first step is to find Δp.

But wait, the electron's speed is given. Hmm, so maybe I can find the momentum from the given speed. Momentum p is m*v, right? But since we're dealing with uncertainties, perhaps I should relate Δx and Δp. Oh, right, because if the position is uncertain by Δx, the momentum can't be known precisely, so Δp is at least ħ/(2Δx). Or wait, is it ħ/(2Δx) or something else? I think the uncertainty principle is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2
