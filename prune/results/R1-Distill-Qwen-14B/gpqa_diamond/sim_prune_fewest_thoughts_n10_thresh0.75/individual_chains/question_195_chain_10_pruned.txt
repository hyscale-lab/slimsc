Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem is about two planets orbiting a star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and transits its star. The star has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. The orbital period of this first planet is 3 days. The second planet has a radius of 2.5 Earth radii. We need to find the maximum orbital period of the second planet such that both transit and occultation events occur. And the options are given as A to D.

Hmm, transit and occultation events. I remember that a transit happens when the planet passes in front of the star from our perspective, causing a dip in brightness. An occultation is when the planet is behind the star, so we can't see its light (if it reflects any), but in terms of events, it's when the planet is hidden by the star.

Wait, but for both events to happen, the planet must pass in front and behind the star. So the planet's orbital plane must be aligned so that it can both transit (front) and be occulted (behind). So the orbital inclination needs to be just right—not too edge-on, because if it's exactly edge-on, maybe it only transits but doesn't occult. Or maybe the opposite. Let me think.

Oh wait, to have both events, the planet's orbit must be such that when it's in front (transit), we see that. And when it's behind (occultation), we also see that. So the line of sight needs to intersect the star at certain points. But for both to occur, the planet must be moving in an orbit where it can pass both in front and behind the star's disk as seen from Earth.

But wait, if the planet's orbit is such that it transits, then the inclination is high—edge-on. Because if it's too low, we wouldn't see the transit. So I think the inclination is close to 90 degrees. But how does that affect the occultation?

Wait, when a planet transits, it's moving in front of the star. For occultation, it's the opposite—behind the star. So if the orbit is edge-on, from our point of view, when the planet is on the far side of the star (relative to us), it will be occulted. So both events can happen if the orbit is edge-on.

But the question is about the maximum orbital period. So I think it's about the Hill sphere or the Roche limit, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's about the orbital distance; the second planet must be in a stable orbit, but why would the period affect whether both events happen?

Wait, perhaps it's more about the orbital mechanics regarding when the two planets are on the same side or opposite sides. Wait, no, because the question is about the second planet's period, not the first.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The first planet has a 3-day period. The second has a longer period, since it's bigger. But wait, a bigger planet would have a larger radius, but not necessarily a
