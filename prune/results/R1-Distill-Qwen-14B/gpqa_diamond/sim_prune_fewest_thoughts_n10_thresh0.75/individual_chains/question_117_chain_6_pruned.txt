Okay, so I have this question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when a compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups, which makes the compound have stereoisomersâ€”like enantiomers. These enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images, so they can rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions.

The question gives four compounds, and I need to determine which of them show optical isomerism. Let me go through each one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected at positions 1 and 1', right? The substituents are nitro groups at 6 and 6', and carboxylate groups at 2 and 2'. So each phenyl ring has two substituents. Wait, but does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are in positions that make the molecule symmetric, then maybe there's no chirality. Wait, [1,1'-biphenyl] means the rings are connected in such a way that each substituent is on the same side? Or maybe opposite? I think in biphenyls, if the substituents are in symmetrical positions, the molecule might not be chiral. Wait, but if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then maybe it can have optical isomers. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl itself could have some kind of stereoisomerism. Oh wait, biphenyls can have cis or trans isomers if the substituents are on adjacent carbons. Wait, but this is a 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Are the nitro and carboxylate positions on each ring making the substituents in a way that creates chirality?

Wait, each phenyl ring is connected to the biphenyl. So each ring's substituents are at 2 and 6 positions. So if the substituents are arranged such that each ring is symmetrical, maybe the molecule isn't chiral. Alternatively, the biphenyl linkage might allow for some kind of stereogenic centers. Or perhaps the molecule has a center where four different groups are attached. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should think about it another way. If the molecule has a center with four different groups, then it's chiral. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry or an axis of symmetry which would make it achiral. Let me visualize the structure. The biphenyl has two rings connected at position 1 and 1'. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. So the substituents are on opposite positions. Wait, would that make each ring have two substituents opposite each other? Then maybe the molecule is symmetrical. So perhaps each ring is symmetrical, making the whole molecule achiral. But wait, maybe the entire biphenyl system is such that the substituents are arranged
