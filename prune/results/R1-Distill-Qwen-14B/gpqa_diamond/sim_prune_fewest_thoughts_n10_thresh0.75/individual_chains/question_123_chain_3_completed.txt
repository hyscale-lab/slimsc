Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's see if I can work through this.

The question says that both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. So, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at the same speed, right? Because in inertial frames, the velocities are just the negatives of each other.

The problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh wait, so time is different in each frame because of time dilation. I remember that moving clocks run slower from the perspective of the other frame.

So, the key here is to find out how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Then, distance would be speed multiplied by that time.

Wait, to calculate the time dilation factor, I need the Lorentz gamma factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, v here is 60,000 km/s. Wait, let me convert that into meters per second to make calculations easier. Because the speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. Oh wait, 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s, which is 6e7 m/s. Wait, no: 60,000 km is 6e4; km is 1e3 meters, so 6e4 km/s is 6e7 m/s. Wait, but the speed of light is roughly 3e8 m/s. So 6e7 is 60% of the speed of light. Hmm.

So, v = 6e7 m/s. Let's compute beta, which is v/c. So beta = (6e7) / (3e8) = 0.2. Oh wait, wait, wait. 6e7 divided by 3e8 is 0.6e-1? Wait, no, 6e7 is 60 million, 3e8 is 300 million. So 60/300 is 0.2. Oh wait, no, 6e7 is 60 million, 3e8 is 300 million. So 60 million divided by 300 million is 0.2. So beta is 0.2.

So gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96). Let me calculate that. Hmm, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.98. Because 0.98^2 is 0.9604, which is about 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.98. So gamma ≈ 1 / 0.98 ≈ 1.0204. Wait, but precise calculation might be better.

Wait, 0.96 is 24/25. So sqrt(24/25) is sqrt(24)/5. sqrt(24) is about 4.89898. So 4.89898/5 ≈ 0.9798. So gamma is 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0204.

So gamma is approximately 1.0204. So, how does that affect the time?

In special relativity, time dilation means that the moving clock (ejecta's frame) runs slower. So from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta's clock is running slow. So, if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how much time passes in the galaxy's frame?

Wait, the proper time is the time measured in the frame where the events happen at the same place. Wait, wait, but in this case, the events are the start and end of the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So from the galaxy's frame, these are two moving events.

So the relation between the time intervals is delta_t = gamma * (delta_t' + (v x delta_x') / c² ). But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, no, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at 6e4 km/s. But the question says that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at v = 6e4 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at -6e4 km/s.

Wait, but when considering the time in the Galaxy's frame, which is the rest frame, and the time in the ejecta's frame, which is moving at speed v relative to the Galaxy.

So time dilation: when you have a moving clock, from your frame, their clock runs slow. So if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame?

Wait, if the ejecta's clock is moving at speed v relative to the Galaxy, then from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock is running slow. So the time experienced in the Galaxy's frame is longer.

Wait, let me clarify. The proper time (tau) is the time measured in the rest frame of the event. Wait, but in this case, the two events (start and end of the 50 seconds) are happening in the ejecta's frame. So from the Galaxy's perspective, these two events (the clock starting and stopping) are happening in a moving frame. So the time between them in the Galaxy's frame would be longer.

The formula for time dilation is:

delta_t = gamma (delta_t' + (v delta_x') / c² )

But delta_x' is the displacement in the ejecta's frame. Wait, but in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them. So during the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy has moved some distance towards the ejecta.

Wait, no. Wait, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at 6e4 km/s. So the distance the Galaxy moves in the ejecta's frame during 50 seconds is v * delta_t' = 6e4 km/s * 50 s = 3e6 km. So delta_x' is 3e6 km.

So plugging into the formula:

delta_t = gamma (delta_t' + (v delta_x') / c^2 )

But wait, delta_x' is 3e6 km. Wait, but we need to make sure that the units are consistent. Let me convert everything into meters and seconds.

v = 6e4 km/s = 6e7 m/s.

delta_t' = 50 s.

delta_x' = v * delta_t' = 6e7 m/s * 50 s = 3e9 meters. Wait, 3e9 m is 3e6 km, which matches the earlier calculation.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So,

delta_t = gamma * [delta_t' + (v delta_x') / (c^2) ]

Compute each part:

v delta_x' = (6e7 m/s) * (3e9 m) = 1.8e17 (m²/s)

c^2 = (3e8 m/s)^2 = 9e16 m²/s².

So, (v delta_x') / c² = 1.8e17 / 9e16 = 2 seconds.

So, delta_t' is 50 s, so:

delta_t = gamma * (50 + 2) = gamma * 52.

We found gamma was approximately 1.0204, so delta_t ≈ 1.0204 * 52 ≈ 53.06 seconds.

Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, v delta_x' = (6e7 m/s) * (3e9 m) = 6e7 * 3e9 = 1.8e17 m²/s.

Divide by c^2 (9e16 m²/s²):

1.8e17 / 9e16 = 2. So yes, 2 seconds.

So delta_t = gamma * (50 + 2) = gamma * 52.

Gamma is approximately 1.0204, so 52 *1.0204 ≈ 52 *1.02 = 53.04 seconds.

So approximately 53.04 seconds in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, but the question is, what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame during the time that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, no. The question says, when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, what is the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, but in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at velocity v towards the center. So the distance would be v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame, delta_t.

Wait, but wait, v is 60,000 km/s, which is 6e4 km/s.

So distance = v * delta_t.

v is 6e4 km/s.

delta_t is 53.04 seconds.

So distance = 6e4 km/s * 53.04 s = 3,182,400 km.

Wait, that's approximately 3.18 million km.

Looking at the options:

A) 2,940,000 km.

B)3,000,000 km.

C)2,880,000 km.

D)3,060,000 km.

Hmm, 3.18 million isn't exactly among the options. Hmm. So perhaps I made an error in calculation.

Wait, maybe I should calculate gamma more precisely.

Let me re-calculate gamma.

v = 6e4 km/s = 6e7 m/s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

beta = v/c = 6e7 /3e8 = 0.2.

So beta squared is 0.04.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96).

Calculating sqrt(0.96):

0.96 = 24/25. So sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/5.

sqrt(24) is about 4.89898. So 4.89898 /5 = 0.979795.

So 1 / 0.979795 ≈ 1.0203.

So gamma ≈ 1.0203.

So delta_t = gamma * (50 + 2) = 1.0203 *52 ≈ ?

52 *1.0203 = 52 *1 + 52 *0.0203.

52 *1 =52.

52 *0.0203 ≈ 1.0556.

So total is approximately 53.0556 seconds.

So delta_t ≈ 53.0556 seconds.

So distance is 6e4 km/s *53.0556 s.

6e4 is 60,000 km/s.

60,000 km/s *53.0556 s = 60,000 *53.0556 km.

60,000 *53 = 3,180,000 km.

60,000 *0.0556 = 3,336 km.

So total is approximately 3,183,336 km.

Which is about 3.183 million km.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D)3,060,000 km. Hmm, that's not very close. Maybe I messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using length contraction instead.

Wait, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at 6e4 km/s. So, in the ejecta's frame, the distance the Galaxy travels is v * delta_t' =6e4 km/s *50 s =3e6 km.

But from the Galaxy's frame, the distance is length-contracted. Wait, no, length contraction is for objects at rest in the frame. The Galaxy is not an object; the ejecta is moving.

Wait, maybe another approach: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at 6e4 km/s. They observe the Galaxy approaching for 50 seconds, so the distance the galaxy moves is 6e4 *50 =3e6 km.

But in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy. So during the same proper time, what's the time experienced in the galaxy's frame?

Wait, proper time is the time measured in the rest frame where both events (start and end) occur at the same place. So in this case, the proper time would be in the ejecta's frame, because the two events (start and end of the 50 seconds) happen at the same place in the ejecta's frame.

So, the proper time tau is 50 seconds.

Then, in the Galaxy's frame, the time is delta_t = gamma * tau.

Wait, wait, but earlier we had a different formula because we considered delta_x' as well. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should use the relation between proper time and coordinate time.

The proper time tau is given by:

tau^2 = delta_t^2 - (delta_x / c)^2.

Wait, but in the ejecta's frame, the events occur at the same place, so delta_x' =0. So tau = delta_t'.

In the Galaxy's frame, delta_t is longer, and delta_x is something else.

Wait, but from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving, so the distance it travels is v * delta_t.

Wait, but tau is the proper time, so tau = sqrt( delta_t^2 - (delta_x /c)^2 ) )

So, tau^2 = delta_t^2 - (delta_x^2)/(c^2).

So, delta_x = v * delta_t.

So, substituting into the equation:

tau^2 = delta_t^2 - ( (v * delta_t )^2 ) / c^2.

Factor delta_t^2:

tau^2 = delta_t^2 ( 1 - (v^2)/(c^2) )

So,

delta_t = tau / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = tau * gamma.

Wait, so this suggests delta_t = tau * gamma.

But earlier, when we had the time dilation formula, we considered that delta_t = gamma ( delta_t' + (v delta_x') / c^2 )

Wait, but in this approach, delta_x' is zero because in the ejecta's frame, the events are at the same place.

Wait, so if delta_x' is zero, then delta_t = gamma delta_t'.

Ah, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier by including the (v delta_x') term.

Wait, because in the ejecta's frame, the two events (start and end) happen at the same place, so delta_x' =0.

So, delta_t = gamma delta_t'.

Which would make it delta_t = 1.0203 *50 =51.015 seconds.

Then, the distance the ejecta travels is v * delta_t.

v is 6e4 km/s.

So, 6e4 *51.015 ≈ 60,000 *51.015 = 3,060,900 km.

Which is approximately 3,060,000 km, matching option D.

Ah! So I think I confused myself earlier by not realizing that delta_x' is zero because the events happen at the same location in the ejecta's frame. So the correct formula is delta_t = gamma * delta_t', with no other terms.

So the time in the Galaxy's frame is approximately 51.015 seconds. So the distance is 6e4 km/s *51.015 s.

Which is 60,000 *51.015 = 3,060,900 km, about 3,060,000 km, so option D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the situation using special relativity. The ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames, with the ejecta moving at a speed of \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) relative to the Galaxy. In the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass, and we need to determine the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during this time.

### Key Steps:
1. **Relating Time in Different Frames**:  
   In special relativity, the time dilation relationship is given by:  
   \[
   \Delta t = \gamma \Delta t'
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} \), \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} \), \( \Delta t' = 50 \, \text{s} \) (time in the ejecta's frame), and \( \Delta t \) is the time in the Galaxy's frame.

2. **Calculate \( \gamma \)**:  
   Convert \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) to meters per second:  
   \[
   v = 6 \times 10^7 \, \text{m/s}.
   \]  
   The speed of light is \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), so:  
   \[
   \beta = \frac{v}{c} = \frac{6 \times 10^7}{3 \times 10^8} = 0.2.
   \]  
   Then:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0203.
   \]

3. **Time in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   Using the time dilation formula:  
   \[
   \Delta t = \gamma \Delta t' = 1.0203 \times 50 \approx 51.015 \, \text{s}.
   \]

4. **Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is:  
   \[
   d = v \Delta t.
   \]  
   Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( \Delta t = 51.015 \, \text{s} \):  
   \[
   d = 60,000 \times 51.015 \approx 3,060,900 \, \text{km}.
   \]  
   This rounds to approximately \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \).

### Conclusion:
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame is approximately \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \), which corresponds to **option D**.

Answer: D
