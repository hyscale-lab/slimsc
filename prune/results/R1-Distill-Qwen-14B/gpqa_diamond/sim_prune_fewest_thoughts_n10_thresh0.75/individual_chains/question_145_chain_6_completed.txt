Okay, so I've got this question about stereoisomers, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it. The compound in question is 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the compound. The parent chain is undecane, which has 11 carbons. The substituents are a chlorine at position 6, an ethyl group at position 9, a methyl at position 2, and an alcohol (-ol) group at position 5. Also, there are double bonds at positions 3 and 7. Wait, wait, undeca-3,7-dien-5-ol... So the parent chain is 11 carbons long with double bonds starting at carbons 3 and 7.

Let me draw this out mentally. The structure would be:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-Cl-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe not. Wait, the parent chain is 11 carbons. Let me number them. Position 1, then 2, up to 11.

Wait, the substituents are at positions 2 (methyl), 5 (OH), 6 (Cl), and 9 (ethyl). So the structure is:

1: CH2-

2: CH(CH3)-

3: CH2-

4: CH2-

5: C(OH)H-

6: CCl-

7: CH2-

8: CH2-

9: CH(CH2CH3)-

10: CH2-

11: CH3?

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to write it more clearly. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to sketch the structure step by step.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the structure from the alcohol group since that's often a good starting point for numbering in alcohols. Wait, no, the numbering in IUPAC starts from the end that gives the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So, the parent chain is undecane, so 11 carbons.

Wait, the double bonds are at 3 and 7. So the structure is undeca-3,7-diene. So the chain is 11 carbons with double bonds between 3-4 and 7-8. So, the structure would be:

1: CH2-

2: CH2-

3: CH2-CH2- (Wait, no. If it's 3,7-diene, then the double bonds are between 3-4 and 7-8.)

Wait, maybe the structure is:

1   2   3(4)   5   6   7(8)   9   10   11

So positions 3-4 are double bond, then single bonds, then 7-8 double bond.

Now, substituents are at 2 (methyl), 5 (OH), 6 (Cl), 9 (ethyl). Let me try to arrange that.

So position 2 is a methyl group attached. Position 5 is an -OH group. Position 6 is Cl. Position 9 is ethyl.

Wait, so the structure would look like this:

1: CH2-

2: C(CH3)-

3: CH2-

4: CH-

5: C(OH)-

6: CCl-

7: CH2-

8: CH-

9: C(CH2CH3)-

10: CH2-

11: CH3

Wait, but wait. The double bonds are at 3,4 and 7,8. So positions 3 and 4 are a double bond, and positions 7 and 8 are another.

So positions 3 and 4: double bond between them. Similarly, 7 and 8.

Now, the substituents are on carbons 2 (methyl), 5 (OH), 6 (Cl), 9 (ethyl).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think about whether any of these substituents are on the same carbon as a double bond.

Wait, position 2 is CH(CH3), then position 3 is CH2 which is part of the double bond. So position 3 is CH2=CH-CH2-... Wait, no. Wait, the double bonds are between 3-4 and 7-8. So position 3 is part of the first double bond.

So the structure is:

1: CH2-

2: C(CH3)-

3: CH2-

But wait, no, because the double bonds are starting at 3 and 7. So if it's 3,7-diene, the first double bond is between 3 and 4, and the second between 7 and 8.

So the chain would be:

1: CH2-

2: CH(CH3)-

3: CH2-

4: CH-

Wait, no, that can't be right because the double bonds would be between 3-4 (so 3 and 4 are double bonded) and 7-8.

Wait, perhaps a better way to write it is:

Positions 3 and 4 are double bond (so between C3 and C4), and positions 7 and 8 are another double bond.

So the structure is:

1: CH2-

2: C(CH3)-

3: CH2-

But wait, if 3 and 4 are double-bonded, then position 3 would be CH2, but that can't be if it's double bonded. Wait, no, perhaps it's:

1: CH2-

2: C(CH3)-

3: CH2-

4: CH-

But wait, no, because the double bonds would extend over. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the actual structure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should draw the structure as follows.

The parent chain is 11 carbons with double bonds at positions 3,4 and 7,8.

So:

1: CH2-

2: CH(CH3)-

3: CH2-

4: CH2-

Wait, no. Wait, the double bonds are between 3-4 and 7-8.

So, positions 3 and 4 are double bonded. So, C3 and C4 are connected by a double bond. Similarly, C7 and C8 are connected by a double bond.

So the structure would be:

1: CH2-

2: C(CH3)-

3: CH2-

Wait, no. Let me try again.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

Carbon 1: CH2-

Carbon 2: C(CH3)-CH2-

Carbon 3: CH2-

Wait, no. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating the structure. Maybe it's better to focus on the stereogenic centers and double bonds, which influence the number of stereoisomers.

So the question is about stereoisomers, which includes both enantiomers and diastereomers, but for that, we need to find the number of stereogenic centers and any possible geometric isomerism due to double bonds.

Wait, so first, I need to determine if the molecule has any chiral centers (stereogenic centers) and any double bonds that could lead to geometric isomerism.

So, looking at the substituents, the OH group is at position 5. Is that a chiral center?

A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's check carbon 5.

At C5, what are the substituents?

C5 is connected to:

- C4 (which has a double bond to C3, so perhaps C4 is CH2-)

Wait, no. Let me think: C5 is in the middle of the chain. So, the structure around C5 would be:

C4 is connected via a single bond to C5, which is connected to C6. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, the double bonds are at 3,4 and 7,8. So position 3 is double bonded to 4, which means that C3 is CH2, C4 is CH, and C5 is a single bond to C4.

Wait, no. Let me try to sketch the structure.

Positions:

1: CH2-

2: C(CH3)-

3: CH2-

4: CH-

But wait, since 3 and 4 are double-bonded, so perhaps C3 is CH2, but wait, that can't form a double bond. Hmm, perhaps I need to correct that.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

1: CH2-

2: C(CH3)-

3: CH2-

4: C=CH-

5: CH(OH)-

6: CCl-

7: CH2-

8: C=CH-

9: CH(CH2CH3)-

10: CH2-

11: CH3

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but maybe it's better to proceed with the analysis.

So, at position 5, the structure is: C5 is connected to C4 (which is part of the double bond, so C4 is CH?), C5 is connected to C6 (Cl), and has an -OH group, and another substituent.

Wait, perhaps I should better imagine the structure with the double bonds.

Let me try.

The parent chain is 11 carbons, with double bonds between 3-4 and 7-8.

So, the structure would be:

1: CH2-

2: CH(CH3)-

3: CH2-

4: CH-

5: CH(OH)-

6: CH2-

7: CH2-

8: CH-

9: CH(CH2CH3)-

10: CH2-

11: CH3

Wait, but the double bonds are between 3-4 and 7-8. So, C3 is connected to C4 via a double bond, and C7 is connected to C8 via a double bond.

So, for C3 (from the left), the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-... but wait, no. Maybe I should write it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

1: CH2-

2: CH(CH3)-

3: CH2-

4: C=C-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-Cl-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3?

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should look for the stereogenic centers and the double bonds.

So, stereogenic centers (chiral centers) are carbons bonded to four different groups. Let's check each position with substituents:

Positions with substituents are 2 (methyl), 5 (OH), 6 (Cl), 9 (ethyl).

Let's check each of these positions for chirality.

At position 2: The structure is CH(CH3). What are the substituents?

- The carbon at position 2 is attached to:

1. The previous carbon (position 1: CH2-CH(CH3)-)

2. The next carbon (position 3: which is part of a double bond?)

Wait, if position 3 is part of a double bond (between 3-4), then position 3 is CH2, but no, because in a double bond, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2... Wait, no. Let's think about it.

Wait, if the chain has double bonds at 3,4 and 7,8, then the structure around those positions would have the double bonds.

At position 3: it's connected via a double bond to position 4, meaning that C3 and C4 are each double-bonded. So, C3 would be CH2? No, because a double bond requires each carbon to have two substituents.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as:

Positions 1-2: single bonds.

Position 2: CH(CH3)-.

Position 3: CH2- (but connected via double bond to position 4).

Position 4: CH- (connected via double bond to 3), then connected to position 5.

Wait, perhaps the structure around C5 is:

C4 is CH (since it's part of the double bond), and C5 is attached to an OH group, Cl at C6, and so on.

So, let's focus on each substituent's position.

At C2: substituents are CH(CH3). Let's see the groups attached to C2.

C2 is connected to:

- C1: CH2- group.

- C3: which is a CH2 (since it's a double bond between C3 and C4). Wait, no, because if C3 and C4 are double bonded, then C3 is CH2 and C4 is CH?

Wait, perhaps I should think that C3 and C4 are each connected to two other carbons. But maybe it's getting too complicated. Let me try to determine if any of the substituent positions (2,5,6,9) are chiral.

At C5: substituents are:

- The OH group.

- The Cl group at C6.

- The previous carbon (C4), which is part of the double bond.

Wait, so the structure of C5 would be:

C5 is connected to:

- C4 (which is CH2, perhaps? Or maybe it's CH because of the double bond.)

Hmm, perhaps I need to think of it as a tetrahedral carbon. For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents.

At C5:

- One substituent is the OH group.

- Another is the Cl group at C6.

- The third is the double bond (since C5 is connected to C4, which is part of a double bond, perhaps making C5 a double bond as well? No, because the double bonds are at 3-4 and 7-8.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that C5 is a single bond to C4 and C6.

So, substituents on C5 would be:

- OH group.

- Cl group (from C6).

- Two other substituents from the chain.

Wait, let me imagine C5 as a CH(OH)- group connected to C4 and C6.

So, C5 is connected to:

- C4 (which is part of a double bond, so perhaps a CH- group).

- C6 (which is Cl).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C5 is a secondary alcohol, making it a chiral center.

Wait, let me think again. If C5 has four different substituents, then it's a chiral center. So substituents would be:

1. -OH.

2. The substituents from the chain on either side.

Wait, perhaps C5 is connected to:

- A CH2 group on the left (from C4).

- A CCl group on the right (from C6).

- Two other different substituents.

Wait, but I'm not seeing it clearly. Maybe it's better to proceed step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can count the stereogenic centers and the possible double bond configurations.

The compound has two double bonds (3,7-diene). Each double bond can contribute to geometric isomerism if the substituents on either side are different.

So, each double bond can be either cis or trans. So for two double bonds, that's 2^2 = 4 possibilities.

Now, any chiral centers would add to the number of stereoisomers. Each chiral center would contribute a factor of 2.

So, first, let's find the number of chiral centers.

Looking at the substituents:

- At position 2, there's a methyl group. Is that a chiral center?

For C2, the substituents are:

- CH3 (methyl).

- The chain towards C1: CH2-.

- The chain towards C3: which is part of a double bond. So, perhaps C3 is CH2-CH2... No, that can't be. Wait, maybe the substituents around C2 are:

- Two CH2 groups (from C1 and C3), a methyl, and the main chain.

If that's the case, then the groups on C2 would be:

- CH2- (to C1).

- CH2- (to C3, which is part of a double bond, so maybe a CH group?).

Wait, perhaps the substituents on C2 are:

- CH(CH3) attached to C1 (CH2-), and also to C3 (which is CH2-CH2...). Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's better to determine whether each substituent is a chiral center.

Looking at C5: the OH group is here. Let's see.

At C5, the substituents are:

- OH.

- Cl (on C6).

- Two other groups from the chain.

Wait, let's imagine C5 is connected to:

- C4 (which is CH2, perhaps).

- C6 (which is CCl).

- And two CH2 groups on either side.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps C5 is connected to:

- The OH group.

- The Cl at C6.

- A CH2 group from C4.

- A CH2 group from C6 (but that would make two identical substituents, making it not a chiral center).

Hmm, perhaps C5 is a chiral center. If so, that's one.

C6 has a Cl substituent. Let's see the substituents around C6.

At C6: substituents are Cl, and the chains towards C5 and C7.

If C6 is connected to:

- Cl.

- C5 (which is the OH-bearing carbon).

- C7 (part of a double bond, so perhaps CH2?).

Wait, but that would be three substituents. Wait, each carbon in a chain must have four bonds. So, perhaps C6 is CHCl connected to C5 and C7.

Wait, maybe the substituents on C6 are:

- Cl.

- CH2 group towards C5 (since C5 is CH(OH)-).

- CH2 group towards C7 (since C7 is part of a double bond, so perhaps it's CH2?).

- And a hydrogen.

Wait, if that's the case, then the substituents are Cl, CH2-C5, CH2-C7, and H. Are any of those identical?

If C5 is CH(OH)CH2Cl, and C7 is CH2CH2..., then the substituents on C6 are all different: Cl, two different CH2 groups, and H. So, four different substituents, making C6 a chiral center.

Wait, but wait. The CH2 groups adjacent to C5 and C7 might be the same if the chain is symmetric. Let me think. The chain from C6 to C5 is CH2-C(OH)H-CHCl...? No, perhaps not. Let me try to think.

Alternatively, perhaps C6 is not a chiral center because two substituents are the same. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C6 is attached to:

- Cl.

- C5 (which has an OH group).

- C7 (which is part of a double bond, perhaps as CH2).

- And a hydrogen.

So, substituents are Cl, C5 (which is a CH(OH)...), C7 (CH2-CH2...), and H.

Wait, but then, are any substituents the same? For example, is the substituent from C5 the same as any other? I don't think so. So, four different groups, meaning C6 is a chiral center.

Wait, if C6 is a chiral center, that's another stereogenic center.

Then, C9 has an ethyl group. Is that a chiral center?

At C9, substituents are:

- Ethyl (CH2CH3).

- The chain towards C8: which is part of a double bond (C7-C8).

- The chain towards C10: CH2.

- And a hydrogen?

Wait, let me think. If C9 is attached to:

- CH2CH3 (ethyl).

- C8 (which is part of a double bond, so perhaps CH2).

- C10: CH2.

- And a hydrogen.

So, substituents are ethyl, CH2 (from C8), CH2 (from C10), and H.

If C8's substituent (CH2) is connected to a double bond, perhaps that makes it different from the other CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps C9 is connected to:

- Ethyl.

- A CH2 group that is part of a double bond (so the structure is CH2-CH2... perhaps).

Wait, perhaps the substituents are:

- Ethyl.

- CH2-CH2 (but that's not possible; each substituent must be connected via a single bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck again. Alternatively, perhaps C9 is not a chiral center because the substituents are not all different.

Alternatively, perhaps C9 is a chiral center.

Wait, another approach: if the molecule has N stereogenic centers, the maximum number of stereoisomers would be 2^N, multiplied by the number of geometric isomers from double bonds.

So, let's count the possible stereogenic centers and the double bonds.

So, first, the double bonds:

There are two double bonds, each can be cis or trans. So, 2^2 =4 possibilities.

Now, the stereogenic centers:

Looking for any carbon with four different substituents.

Which substituents are present?

At position 5 (OH group):

If C5 is connected to:

- OH.

- Cl (C6).

- CH2 (from C4).

- CH2 (from C6? No, perhaps C6 is Cl, so C5 is connected to C6, which has Cl.

Wait, perhaps C5 has substituents:

- OH.

- CH2Cl (if C6 is a Cl and a CH2 group).

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps C5 is connected to C4 (which is part of a double bond), and C6 (Cl), and two other groups.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that C5 is connected to:

- C4 (CH2-).

- C6 (CHCl-).

- Two hydrogens.

If that's the case, then the substituents would be:

- CH2- (C4).

- CHCl- (C6).

- Two Hs.

But that would mean two substituents are the same (H), so C5 can't be a chiral center. Hmm, that's a possibility.

Wait, but if C5 has an OH group, and is connected to C4 and C6, perhaps the substituents are:

- OH.

- CH2- (from C4, which is part of a double bond, so perhaps CH2 is attached to a double bond, making it a CH group).

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's better to imagine that C5 has two different substituents from the chain and the OH and Cl.

Alternatively, perhaps C5 is a chiral center, and C6 is another.

Wait, let me think: if the structure is such that C5 has four different substituents, then it's a chiral center. Similarly for C6.

If I assume both C5 and C6 are chiral centers, then that's two stereogenic centers.

So, each contributes a factor of 2, so 2^2 =4.

Plus, the two double bonds contributing 2^2=4.

Total stereoisomers would be 4 (from double bonds) * 4 (from stereocenters) =16.

Wait, but wait. Are there any other stereogenic centers?

At position 2, the methyl group. Let's see.

C2 has a methyl group, and the substituents are:

- CH3.

- Two CH2 groups (from C1 and C3).

- And the main chain.

Wait, if C2 is attached to:

- CH3.

- CH2 (C1).

- CH2 (C3).

- And another CH2 group.

Wait, that would mean that it's attached to two identical groups, so C2 can't be a chiral center.

Similarly, C9 has an ethyl group. Let's see.

C9 is attached to:

- CH2CH3 (ethyl).

- CH2 (C8, which is part of a double bond).

- CH2 (C10).

- And another substituent.

Wait, perhaps C9 is connected to:

- CH2CH3.

- CH2 (from C8, which is part of a double bond, so perhaps a CH group).

- CH2 (from C10).

- And a hydrogen.

In that case, the substituents are:

- Ethyl.

- CH (from C8).

- CH2 (from C10).

- H.

So, four different substituents would make C9 a chiral center.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again.

If C9 is a chiral center, that adds another factor of 2.

So, with three stereogenic centers (C5, C6, C9), and two double bonds, the number would be 2^3 (8) * 2^2 (4) = 32. But that's option C.

But wait, I'm not sure if C9 is a chiral center. Let's think again.

The substituents on C9 would be:

- Ethyl (CH2CH3).

- The chain towards C8, which is a CH2 (since C8 is part of a double bond; perhaps it's a CH2 group connected to a double bond).

Wait, but I'm getting more confused. Maybe it's better to proceed with the assumption that C5 is a chiral center and C6 is another, and perhaps C9 isn't.

So, two stereogenic centers, and two double bonds.

So, 2^2 (from stereogenic centers) * 2^2 (from double bonds) = 4*4=16.

Which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps C9 is also a stereogenic center, adding another factor of 2, leading to 2^(stereogenic centers + double bonds) = 2^(3+2) = 32.

But I'm not certain. Let me think again.

Wait, the substituents on C9 are:

- Ethyl (CH2CH3).

- The chain towards C8: which is a CH (since C8 is part of a double bond, so perhaps it's a CH group).

- The chain towards C10: which is CH2.

- And a hydrogen.

So, substituents are:

- CH2CH3.

- CH (from C8).

- CH2 (from C10).

- H.

All four are different, so C9 is a chiral center.

If that's the case, then three stereogenic centers.

So, 2^3 =8 from stereogenic centers.

Plus, two double bonds giving 2^2=4.

Total stereoisomers: 8 *4=32.

That would be option C.

But wait, the options are A)4, B)16, C)32, D)8.

But wait, what about the possibility of any of the double bonds not contributing to geometric isomerism? That is, are any of the double bonds symmetrical, making them not contribute to isomerism?

Looking at the double bonds at 3,4 and 7,8.

At 3,4: what substituents are on each side?

C3 is part of a double bond. To the left of C3 is C2 (CH(CH3)), and to the right is C4 (CH-...).

Similarly, at 7,8: C7 is CH2, and C8 is CH-... So, are the substituents on each side of the double bonds different, making them capable of geometric isomerism?

Yes, because each double bond is flanked by different groups on each side. So each double bond contributes two possible configurations.

Thus, two double bonds contribute 4 possibilities.

If there are three stereogenic centers (C5, C6, C9), that's 8 possibilities.

So total would be 8 *4=32.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the molecule has internal planes of symmetry, reducing the number of stereoisomers. But I think for such a long chain, that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps C6 is not a stereogenic center.

Wait, let's reevaluate C6.

At C6, substituents are:

- Cl.

- C5 (which is a chiral center, perhaps with substituents).

- C7 (which is part of a double bond, so perhaps it's a CH2 group.

- And a hydrogen.

Wait, substituents would be:

Cl, C5 (which is a CH(OH)...), C7 (CH2), and H.

Are any of these substituents the same?

If C5 is connected to C6, which has Cl and H, then perhaps the substituents on C6 are Cl, C5 (CH(OH)CH2?), C7 (CH2), and H.

All four are distinct, so C6 would be a chiral center.

So, that makes three stereogenic centers.

Thus, the total number is 32.

But wait, looking back at the options, option C is 32. But perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the structure.

The compound is 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol.

So the substituents are:

- Cl at C6.

- Ethyl at C9.

- Methyl at C2.

- OH at C5.

The double bonds are at 3,4 and 7,8.

So, the structure is:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

Subs:       - CH3 (C2), -OH (C5), Cl (C6), CH2CH3 (C9)

So, the structure around C5 is:

C5 is attached to:

- C4: which is part of a double bond (C3=C4). So C4's structure is CH-CH2... maybe.

Wait, perhaps the groups around C5 are:

- C4 (CH-).

- C6 (Cl).

- Two other substituents.

But I'm not certain. Perhaps an alternative approach would help.

Alternatively, perhaps the best way is to count the number of stereogenic centers and double bonds.

Number of stereogenic centers:

Looking for carbons with four different substituents.

At C2: substituents are CH3, two CH2 groups, and the main chain. So, substituents are CH3, CH2CH2..., CH2..., and main chain. But if two of the CH2 groups are identical, then C2 is not a chiral center.

At C5: substituents are OH, Cl, and two other groups.

If those two other groups are different, then C5 is a chiral center.

At C6: substituents are Cl, two different chains, and H.

At C9: substituents are ethyl, two different chains, and H.

So, perhaps C5, C6, and C9 are chiral centers.

So, 3 stereogenic centers.

Double bonds: two, each with two configurations.

So, total stereoisomers = 2^3 (from centers) * 2^2 (from double bonds) = 8 *4=32.

But wait, looking back, the options are A)4, B)16, C)32, D)8.

So, option C is 32.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in considering the substituents on C6 and C9.

Another approach: each double bond can have cis or trans configuration, so 2^2=4.

Each chiral center adds a factor of 2.

So, let's recount the chiral centers.

At C5: attached to OH, Cl, and two different carbons (C4 and C6). So, four different substituents. Chiral.

At C6: attached to Cl, C5 (which has OH and Cl), C7 (double bond), and another substituent. So, four different substituents. Chiral.

At C9: attached to ethyl, C8 (double bond), C10, and H. So, four different substituents. Chiral.

So, three chiral centers.

Double bonds: two, each with two options.

Total stereoisomers: 2^3 *2^2 =8 *4=32.

So, the answer would be C)32.


To determine the number of stereoisomers for the compound 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol, we analyze the structural features contributing to stereoisomerism:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Parent Chain and Substituents**:
   - The parent chain is undecane (11 carbons).
   - Substituents:
     - Methyl group at position 2.
     - Hydroxyl (-OH) group at position 5.
     - Chlorine (Cl) at position 6.
     - Ethyl group at position 9.
   - Double bonds at positions 3,4 and 7,8.

2. **Double Bonds**:
   - The two double bonds (C3=C4 and C7=C8) can each exist in either a cis or trans configuration.
   - Total configurations from double bonds: \( 2^2 = 4 \).

3. **Chiral Centers**:
   - A chiral center is a carbon bonded to four different groups. We evaluate each substituent position:
     - **C2 (methyl)**: Substituents include two identical CH2 groups, so C2 is **not** a chiral center.
     - **C5 (OH)**: Substituents are OH, Cl, CH2 (from C4), and CH2 (from C6). These are all different, so C5 is a **chiral center**.
     - **C6 (Cl)**: Substituents are Cl, CH2 (from C5), CH2 (from C7), and H. These are all different, so C6 is a **chiral center**.
     - **C9 (ethyl)**: Substituents are CH2CH3, CH2 (from C8), CH2 (from C10), and H. These are all different, so C9 is a **chiral center**.
   - Total chiral centers: 3.

### Calculation of Stereoisomers:
- The total number of stereoisomers is determined by combining the contributions from chiral centers and double bonds:
  \[
  \text{Total Stereoisomers} = 2^{\text{number of chiral centers}} \times 2^{\text{number of double bonds}} = 2^3 \times 2^2 = 8 \times 4 = 32.
  \]

### Final Answer:
The compound has 32 stereoisomers.
