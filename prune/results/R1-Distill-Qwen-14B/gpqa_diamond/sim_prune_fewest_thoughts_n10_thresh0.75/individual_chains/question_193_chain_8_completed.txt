Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about how the number of stars varies with distance. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star due to Earth's movement around the Sun. The formula I remember is that distance r is approximately equal to 1 divided by parallax (in parsecs), so r ≈ 1/plx. Wait, but sometimes it's written as r = 1 / plx, maybe in parsecs if plx is in arcseconds.

The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Wait, so N ∝ 1/plx^5. But I need to find how N changes with distance r. So, I should express this in terms of r instead of plx.

Since r is proportional to 1/plx, I can write plx as 1/r, because if r = 1/plx, then plx = 1/r. So plx is inversely proportional to r. So plx = k/r, where k is a constant. 

Now the number of stars N varies as 1/(plx)^5. Let me substitute plx with 1/r, so 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's compute that. (1/(1/r^5)) ) is r^5. So 1/(plx)^5 = r^5. Wait, wait, let's double-check.

Wait, plx is 1/r, so plx^5 is (1/r)^5 = 1/(r^5). So 1/(plx^5) is 1/(1/r^5) )= r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So the number of stars increases with r^5. 

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. So if N is proportional to r^5, then for each unit increase in r, the number increases by r^5. But wait, no. Let me think again. So N ∝ r^5, meaning that as r increases, N increases as the fifth power. So with each unit of distance, the number of stars per unit distance would be... wait, no, the question is about the change with distance per unit range. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of differential change.

Alternatively, the problem could be about the number of stars within a certain range of distance. Wait, but the question says "per unit range of distance, r." So, perhaps it's the number density of stars as a function of distance. 

Wait, but let me make sure. If N is proportional to r^5, then for a small change in r, the change in N would be dN proportional to 5 r^4 dr. But wait, the options don't have r^4. Let me see the options again. Option C is r^4, option B is r^5, etc.

Wait, the question is how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So perhaps it's the number of stars per unit volume or something. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of how many stars are there between r and r + dr. So the number would be proportional to r^5 times dr, but that would imply N is proportional to r^5, so the number per unit distance (since dr is the unit) is proportional to r^5. So the number of stars per unit distance is ~ r^5.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. Maybe I'm confusing the variables. So N varies as 1/plx^5. And since plx is 1/r, so N ∝ r^5. So as r increases, N increases as the fifth power. So per unit distance, the number is r^5.

But that seems like a lot because the number would be increasing rapidly. But according to the given relation, that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the number of stars as a function of distance. So the number of stars at a distance r is proportional to r^5. So per unit distance, you have more stars as r increases. So the change in number per unit distance would be proportional to r^5.

Looking at the options, option B is ~r^5. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm assuming that N is proportional to r^5, but maybe the number of stars in a shell of radius r and thickness dr would be 4π r² dr multiplied by some density. But in this case, the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5, which translates to N ∝ r^5. So I'm not considering volume here. Because if the number density is uniform, the number of stars in a shell would go as r² dr, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the given relation is a specific empirical relation in that region, regardless of the usual volume considerations. So the question gives a direct proportionality between N and 1/plx^5, so we can proceed with that.

So putting it all together, since plx is inversely proportional to r, N is proportional to (1/plx)^5, which becomes r^5. Therefore, the number of stars in that region increases with the fifth power of distance. So the correct answer is option B, which is ~ r^5.


To determine how the number of stars in a specific region of the sky changes with distance (per unit range of distance, \( r \)), we start with the given relationship: the number of stars \( N \) varies with parallax \( \text{plx} \) as \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \). 

Parallax and distance are inversely related: \( \text{plx} = 1/r \). Substituting \( \text{plx} = 1/r \) into the given relationship, we find:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{(1/r)^5} = r^5.
\]

This means the number of stars \( N \) is proportional to \( r^5 \). The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of \( r \). Since \( N \propto r^5 \), the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. 

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
