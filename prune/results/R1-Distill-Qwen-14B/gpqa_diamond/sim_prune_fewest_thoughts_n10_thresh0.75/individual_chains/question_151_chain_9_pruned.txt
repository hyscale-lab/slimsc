Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a particular observable, P, and getting zero. Hmm.

Alright, from what I remember, observables in quantum mechanics are represented by Hermitian matrices. The eigenvalues of these matrices are the possible outcomes of measurements. So, the first thing I think I should do is find the eigenvalues of matrix P because those will give me the possible values I can get when I measure the system.

Let me write down matrix P. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Wait, so it's a 3x3 matrix. I need to find its eigenvalues.

Eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation, which is det(P - λI) = 0. Let's set that up. The matrix P - λI will have elements (0-λ), (1/sqrt(2)), 0; (1/sqrt(2)), (-λ), (1/sqrt(2)); and 0, (1/sqrt(2)), (0-λ). So the matrix looks like:

[ -λ    1/sqrt(2)     0   ]
[1/sqrt(2)   -λ    1/sqrt(2)]
[ 0     1/sqrt(2)    -λ   ]

Calculating the determinant of this matrix. Hmm, I'm not great at calculating 3x3 determinants, but let me try. The determinant for a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. Maybe I'll expand along the first row.

So, the determinant would be:
-λ * det( [ -λ    1/sqrt(2) ]
           [1/sqrt(2)    -λ ] )

minus (1/sqrt(2)) * det( [1/sqrt(2)  1/sqrt(2) ]
                          [0          -λ ] )

plus 0 * det( ... which is zero, so I can ignore that term.
