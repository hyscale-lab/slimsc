Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what clues I can gather.

The question says that we have an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. This mixture X decolorizes bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form another equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids. Importantly, this Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So, reaction X → Y involves some change where the decolorizing property is lost.

Hydrogenation of both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon. The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Also, Z is a constituent of Y and is widely used as a solvent. Furthermore, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, which probably means it's fully saturated—so no double bonds left.

Another point is that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X. So, the starting mixture has two liquids with non-conjugated double bonds or something else that allows decolorizing bromine water.

Let me break this down.

First, I need to figure out what X and Y are. X is a mixture that decolorizes bromine water, so that suggests it has compounds with unsaturated bonds, like alkenes or alkynes. Because when bromine water reacts with alkenes, it adds across the double bond, causing the solution to decolorize.

But wait, wait. Decolorizing bromine water could also be due to reduction, but I think more commonly it's addition to alkenes. So, perhaps X contains alkenes or maybe something that can react with bromine, like maybe dienes or other unsaturated compounds.

Then, when heated with platinum, which is a catalyst for various reactions. Platinum is used for hydrogenation, but also maybe for dehydrohalogenation or perhaps for some kind of decomposition. Wait, but X is treated with Pt when heated, and Y is formed. Y is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids. Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, so their compounds don't have unsaturation that reacts with bromine. But Y's compounds have Z as a constituent.

When X and Y undergo hydrogenation, they both give the same product Z. So, Z must be a product that both X and Y can hydrogenate into. Since Z is a hydrocarbon, perhaps it's an alkane. The fact that Z doesn't react further with hydrogen means it's fully saturated—so maybe a saturated hydrocarbon like propane or butane? But wait, let's calculate the hydrogen percentage.

The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let me calculate what that implies. Let's suppose Z is a hydrocarbon with formula CnH2m. The mass fraction of H is (2m * 1)/(12n + 2m) = 14.28% which is 0.1428.

Let me try to find n and m.

Let me set up the equation:

(2m)/(12n + 2m) = 0.1428
