Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle annihilation. Hmm, the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Wait, wait, no, wait a second. Oh no, wait, the product is two A+ and two A-. So that must mean each A is neutral? Or wait, no, that's not possible. Wait, protons and antiprotons annihilate, and produce two positive and two negative particles. Oh, right, maybe each A is a charged pion or something. But the exact identity might not matter here; the question gives the mass of A as 300 MeV/c². Oh, right, because mc² is 300 MeV for A.

The question is about finding the velocity of particle A. The options are given as fractions of the speed of light. So I need to relate the energy or momentum of A to find its velocity.

Wait, the setup says the antiproton is slowly moving. So, maybe it's moving at a low speed compared to the speed of light, so kinetic energy is much smaller than rest mass energy? Or wait, no, when they say "slowly moving," it could mean that the velocity is low, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so the collision is at rest? Or maybe the antiproton is moving slowly, so the initial system's velocity is low.

Wait, the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Let's think about conservation of energy and momentum. Because the initial particles are a proton and
