Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spin-1/2 particles and magnetic moments. Hmm, I need to figure out the oscillation frequency when the magnetic field changes direction. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equals gamma times S_z. So mu = γSz. The magnetic field is initially along the +Z direction. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, and both have the same magnitude B.

Wait, so initially, when the field is along +Z, the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with it. But when the field switches to +Y, I guess the system's Hamiltonian changes, which affects the energy levels and the time evolution of the state.

The question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillating. So <Sz> oscillates with some frequency. I need to find what that frequency is.

I remember that in such cases, when the Hamiltonian of a quantum system changes, the state doesn't change instantly—it's an eigenstate of the previous Hamiltonian. But when the Hamiltonian changes, the state can evolve over time, leading to oscillations in observable quantities.

Let me recall how spin states evolve under different magnetic fields. The original magnetic field is along Z, so the Hamiltonian before the switch is H_initial = -μ·B. Since mu is along Z, H_initial = -γ B S_z.

Wait, wait. Oh wait, no: the magnetic moment is μ = γ S_z. The energy is given by μ·B, so H_initial = -μ·B = -γ B S_z.

Wait, no: the energy of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is U = -μ·B. So yeah, H = -μ·B. So H_initial = -γ B S_z.

Then, when the field is switched to Y, the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -μ·B_new, where B_new is along Y. So μ is still along Z because the magnetic moment is proportional to spin, which is a vector. Wait, no—wait, when the spin is in a certain state, the magnetic moment is in the direction of the spin. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, mu is a vector operator, so μ = γ S, so its components are μ_x = γ S_x, μ_y = γ S_y,
