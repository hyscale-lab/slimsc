Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, mass probably isn't directly relevant here, but maybe it's a red herring. Then, the astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Also, their radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. 

The question is about the luminosity factor of Star_1 compared to Star_2. The options are all around 2.2 to 2.35, so I'm thinking the answer is one of these.

Wait, the stars are treated as black bodies. Oh right, the black body radiation law—Stefan-Boltzmann law. Luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power. So L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since both stars have the same wavelength where they peak, that's the peak wavelength of their black body radiation. The peak wavelength λ_max is related to temperature by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.8977719×10^-3 m·K). So if λ_max is the same for both, then their temperatures must be the same because T inversely depends on λ_max. So T1 = T2.

Wait, that's interesting because if their temperatures are the same, then the luminosity depends on radius squared. Because L is proportional to R² T^4, and T is same, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

But wait, R1 is 1.5 R2. So R1/R2 = 1.5. Squared is 2.25. So L1/L2 would be 2.25, right? So the answer would be option A) ~2.25.

Wait, but then why is radial velocity given? Because the problem states that they computed the luminosity based
