Okay, so I've got this physics question about oscillating charge distributions and radiation. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says we've got an oscillating charge that's spheroid-shaped, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, and also possible forms of f as a function of λ.

So first, I remember that when a charge distribution oscillates, it radiates electromagnetic waves. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the charge distribution. Since it's spheroidal along the z-axis, the symmetry suggests that the radiation might have a particular angular dependence.

Wait, spheroidal distributions are like ellipsoids, so maybe this is similar to a dipole antenna. Oh right, a dipole's radiation pattern is donut-shaped, with maxima at θ=90 degrees (in the plane perpendicular to the dipole axis) and nodes along the axis (θ=0 and 180). But wait, in the case of a dipole, the radiation pattern is sinθ dependence. So the power radiated per unit solid angle is proportional to sinθ. But wait, I think the exact form depends on the multipole expansion. For a dipole, the radiation is at the dipole frequency, and the angular dependence is sinθ.

Wait, but the question is about the maximum power. So the maximum power would be when sinθ is maximum. Wait, sinθ is maximum when θ is 90 degrees, so that's the maximum. But wait, the question is asking about θ=30 degrees. So the fraction would be f(30)/A, where A is the maximum value of f.

Wait, but let's think about the function f(θ). For a dipole, the radiation pattern is proportional to |sinθ|, but wait, for a dipole, the electric field is proportional to sinθ, but wait, isn't the power proportional to E squared? So maybe f(θ) would be proportional to sin²θ. Let me think: the power radiated in a particular direction is proportional to
