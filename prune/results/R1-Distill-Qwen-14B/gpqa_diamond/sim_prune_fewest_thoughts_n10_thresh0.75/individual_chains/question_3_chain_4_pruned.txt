Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's try to unpack it step by step. I remember that expectation values involve some inner product stuff. The question is about a spin-half particle in a specific superposition state. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And we're supposed to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx.

Wait, I think σz and σx are the Pauli matrices. Right, σz is diagonal with eigenvalues +1 and -1, and σx is the Pauli X matrix, which is off-diagonal. The expectation value of an operator is the average measurement you'd expect. So for any operator O, the expectation is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩.

So the given operator is 10σz +5σx. The expectation value would be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. Because expectation is linear, I can split it like that.

Alright, first let's find each expectation separately. Let's start with σz, since it's easier because the given state is already a combination of σz eigenstates. For σz, the expectation value is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

The state is ψ = 0.5|↑> + sqrt(3)/2 |↓>. Let me check the normalization. The coefficients squared should add to 1. So (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4). Adding them gives 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. So it's normalized, good.

For σz, the eigenvalues are +1 for |↑> and -1 for |↓>. So the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1). That's (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Wait, wait, is that right? Because the state is ψ = a|↑> + b|↓>, so when computing ⟨σz⟩, it's |a|^2*(+1) + |b|^2*(-1). So a is 0.5, so |a|^2 is 0.25, and |b|^2 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4. So 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Yep, correct.

Now, onto σx. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. The eigenstates for σx are different, like |+x⟩ and |−x⟩, but maybe there's a smarter way to compute the expectation without going into that.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩. Let me compute that. Let me write ψ as a vector. Since |↑
