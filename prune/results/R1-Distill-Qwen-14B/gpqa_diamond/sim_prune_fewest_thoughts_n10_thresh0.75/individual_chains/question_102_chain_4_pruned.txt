Alright, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about a genetic construct and why the eGFP isn't showing up under the microscope. Hmm. Okay, let's start by going through the setup.

So, they've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs, right? So the ligand and the receptor each have their own ORFs. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end and fused to eGFP at its C-terminus. 

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. I think the CBA promoter is a strong, constitutive promoter, so that should drive the ligand's expression. Then, for the receptor, upstream is the IRES element. Oh, IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry, so they can drive expression of the downstream gene, which in this case is the receptor. So both ligand and receptor should be expressed, right?

But wait, there are stop cassettes in between. The ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between it and mCherry. Similarly, the receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 between it and eGFP. So under normal conditions, without Cre, the stop cassette would block expression. But when Cre is present, it would excise the stop cassette, allowing the fluorescent proteins to be expressed.

So in the mouse model, they're using SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, so the Cre should be active there. When the Cre is introduced, it should recombine the loxP sites, removing the stop cassette, allowing mCherry and eGFP to be expressed. The question is why the eGFP isn't showing up.

The problem is that in the offspring, when they're visualized under the confocal, there's no green signal. So the eGFP isn't being expressed. Let's think about the possibilities.

Looking at the options:

A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the construct is about their expression, not their function. Plus, the issue here is expression, not signaling. So probably not A.

B) Receptor-eGFP construct stuck in the Golgi. If the eGFP wasn't transported properly, maybe it wouldn't fluoresce. But why wouldn't it be expressed? Also, the antibodies were used in Western blot, but the question doesn't mention those results. Wait, after transfection, they did a Western blot and presumably saw expression? Or didn't? Wait, the question says they tested expression with Western. Oh, but it says they used the antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if the constructs were properly expressed, the Western would show the proteins. But the problem says that in the mouse model, the eGFP isn't expressed. Hmm.

C) The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a constitutive promoter, so
