Okay, so I've got this science question here about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I remember that rotavirus is a virus that causes gastroenteritis, right? And I think it's known for having a pretty tough capsid, which is the outer protein shell. But the question is about tagging the inner capsid proteins with GFP. Oh wait, GFP is green fluorescent protein, used for tracking stuff under a microscope.

So the experiment involves delivering these tagged proteins to mice via oral gavage. Oral delivery probably means they're going through the digestive system. Stomach acid is harsh, so some fluorescence getting destroyed makes sense because the acid might break down the proteins or the GFP could denature. But then, some of them made it through the stomach and got to the intestines. But there, they got entangled in mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. Wait, secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches, right? Those are in the intestinal wall and are sites where immune responses start.

They identified the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated proliferating cells. Then they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes of these cells and saw high variability. High variability in variable regions suggests that something is causing the genes to change, making each cell's antibodies different. 

Now, the question is asking what process is happening. The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

Let me think about each option. 

VDJ recombination is something that happens during the development of B cells in the bone marrow. It's when the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments are combined to form the heavy chain of the B cell receptor. This happens early on, during maturation, and creates the initial diversity of antibodies. But in this case, the cells are in Peyer's patches, which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). So if the B cells have already gone through VDJ, maybe this isn't the process happening here.

Somatic hypermutation is a process that occurs after the B cell has been activated, typically in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues. Here, the variable regions of the B cell receptors are mutated, increasing the diversity and affinity of the antibodies. This happens during the immune response and leads to the high variability in the variable heavy chains, which is exactly what the question describes. So this sounds like a possibility.

Class switching recombination is about changing the type of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), which involves replacing the constant region. But the question is about the variable heavy chain, so that's more about the antigen-binding part. So class switching isn't about the variable region, so probably not the answer.

Complement activation is part of the immune response, but it's a different process. It's about the complement proteins binding to the antigen-antibody complex and causing lysis or inflammation. It doesn't relate directly to the genetic variability in the B cells' variable regions.

Putting it all together: The GFP-tagged capsid proteins were ingested, some survived stomach acid, made it to the intestines and Peyer's patches. The cells there are proliferating, and their variable heavy chains are highly variable. This suggests that the B cells are undergoing somatic hypermutation to increase diversity and affinity of their antibodies. So the process here is somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, while other tagged proteins reached the intestinal mucus and eventually the Peyer patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs. Proliferating cells isolated from these patches showed high variability in their variable heavy chain genes upon sequencing. This variability suggests a process that increases diversity in the antigen-binding regions of antibodies.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in germinal centers during the immune response, where mutations are introduced into the variable regions of B cell receptors to increase diversity and affinity. This matches the observed high variability in the variable heavy chains.
- **B) Complement activation**: This involves the complement system binding to antigen-antibody complexes and is unrelated to the genetic variability in the variable heavy chains.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This process changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) by altering the constant region, not the variable region. Thus, it does not explain the observed variability.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow, combining V, D, and J gene segments to form the heavy chain. However, this process has already occurred by the time B cells reach secondary lymphoid tissues like Peyer patches.

The high variability in the variable heavy chains observed in the experiment is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs in germinal centers to diversify and refine antibody specificity.

Answer: A
