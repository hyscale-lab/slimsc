Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to break it down.

The question is about an electron's state, denoted as |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> states are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. This operator has a matrix representation A where A_ij = hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Also, I need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay. Let me start by understanding each part.

First, the state |alpha> is given, but it's proportional. That means it's not necessarily normalized. So I'll probably have to normalize it before I can find probabilities.

The operator in question has a matrix A. Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because it's acting on spin-up and spin-down states), the elements are hbar/2 when i≠j and zero otherwise. So the matrix would look like this:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, no, because for a 2x2 matrix, i and j can be 1 and 2. So A_12 and A_21 are hbar/2, and the diagonal elements A_11 and A_22 are zero. So yes, that's correct.

But wait, I'm supposed to find the eigenstates of this operator A. Because the measurement probabilities are based on the eigenstates of the operator. Oh right, when you measure an operator, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes when the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of that operator.

So, my first task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A. Then, I can express |alpha> in terms of these eigenvectors to find the probabilities.

Wait, no. Let me think again. To find the probabilities, I need to expand the state |alpha> in the eigenbasis of operator A. The coefficients squared will be the probabilities. Alternatively, I can find the projection of |alpha> onto each eigenvector of A.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to diagonalize operator A and then compute the projections.

So, let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.

The matrix A is:

A = [[0, ħ/2],
     [ħ/2, 0]]

This is a 2x2 anti-diagonal matrix, which is a common form. Its eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0.

The determinant is (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (ħ/2)^2 = λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0.

So λ² = (ħ²)/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Next, find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

For λ = ħ/2:

(A - λI) v = 0 → [[-λ, ħ/2],
                 [ħ/2, -λ]] = [[-ħ/2, ħ/2],
                               [ħ/2, -ħ/2]]

The equations are:

- (ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvectors are all scalar multiples of [1, 1]^T. I can normalize this if needed, but perhaps I'll just keep it as [1,1] for now.

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2:

The matrix becomes [[ħ/2, ħ/2],
                  [ħ/2, ħ/2]]

The equations are:

(ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 = 0 → v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = -v1.

So the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of [1, -1]^T.

So the eigenstates are |e1> = (1/√2)(|up> + |down>) and |e2> = (1/√2)(|up> - |down>), because any eigenvector can be written as a combination of |up> and |down>.

Wait, because our original basis states are |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of S_z. So in that basis, the eigenstates of A are those combinations.

So the eigenstates of A are |e1> and |e2>, as I just wrote.

Now, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

Let me write |alpha> = K ( (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ), where K is the normalization constant.

To find K, compute the norm of the vector (1+i, 2 -i). The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2.

Compute each modulus squared:

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.
|2-i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.

So total is 2+5=7.

So the normalization constant K is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

Now, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates |e1> and |e2> of operator A.

Because the measurement probabilities depend on the expansion in the eigenbasis of A.

So, |e1> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|e2> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Let me express |alpha> as a linear combination of |e1> and |e2>.

Let me denote |alpha> = c1 |e1> + c2 |e2>.

So, substituting the expressions for |e1> and |e2>:

|alpha> = c1 (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c2 (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Group the terms:

= [ (c1 + c2)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (c1 - c2)/sqrt(2) ] |down>

But we also know that |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

So matching the coefficients:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) = (c1 + c2)/sqrt(2) → equation 1
(2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (c1 - c2)/sqrt(2) → equation 2

Let me solve these equations for c1 and c2.

Let me write equation 1 as:
c1 + c2 = (1+i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Equation 2:
c1 - c2 = (2 - i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Now, adding equation 1 and 2:
2 c1 = [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= (3) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
→ c1 = (3/2) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:
2 c2 = [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
→ c2 = ( (-1 + 2i) / 2 ) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to compute c1 and c2 by substituting.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express |alpha> as a combination of |e1> and |e2> from the start.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate |e1> and |e2>, because the coefficients c1 and c2 are the inner products.

So,

c1 = <e1 | alpha>

c2 = <e2 | alpha>

Since |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

Compute c1:

c1 = <e1| alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) <e1|up> + (2 -i) <e1|down> ]

But <e1| up> is < (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2
