Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Then the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude. We need to find the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, I remember that when a magnetic field is applied, the spin precesses around the field. But here, the field is changing direction suddenly. So initially, the magnetic field is along +Z, and the particle is in the Sz eigenstate. Then the field switches to +Y. I think this is a problem about spin precession under a different field direction.

The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma * S_z. Oh, wait, no, wait—mu is usually gamma times the spin, right? So maybe mu = gamma * S, where S is the spin operator. But in this question, they specify mu equals gamma times S_z. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Oh, maybe it's a typo, but I'll go with what's given. So mu = gamma * S_z. But the question is about the z-component of the moment, so perhaps mu_z = gamma * S_z?

Wait, but S is a vector, so S_z is just the z-component. So if mu equals gamma * S, then mu_z is gamma * S_z. But in the problem statement, it's written as mu = gamma * S_z. Maybe I should just treat mu as the vector, but I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should think in terms of energy levels instead.

When the magnetic field is along +Z, the energy levels are determined by the interaction of the magnetic moment with the field. The energy is E = - mu · B. Since mu is proportional to S_z, the energy levels are quantized. Initially, the spin is aligned with the field, so it's in the state |+z> or |-z>, depending on the initial condition. But the problem says it's aligned, so I think it's in the |+z> state.

Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y. So the new field is along Y. The question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, so when the field
