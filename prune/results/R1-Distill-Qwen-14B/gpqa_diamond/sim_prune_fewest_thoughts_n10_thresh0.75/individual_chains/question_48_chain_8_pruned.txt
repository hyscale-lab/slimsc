Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that cyclohexanone is treated with bromine to form product 1. Then product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide to form product 2. Next, product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride to form product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on product 4. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

Hmm. I think I need to figure out what each step does and then determine the structure of product 4. Let me break it down.

First step: cyclohexanone treated with bromine. I remember that ketones can undergo various reactions. Wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. When a ketone reacts with bromine, I think it might be an addition reaction. Oh wait, but cyclohexanone is cyclic. I recall that the alpha position (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl) are more reactive. So bromine could add in an alpha position. Wait, no, wait. Another possibility is that it's a dienophile in some Diels-Alder reaction? Or maybe it's a bromination via the enol mechanism.

Wait, no. Alternatively, cyclohex
