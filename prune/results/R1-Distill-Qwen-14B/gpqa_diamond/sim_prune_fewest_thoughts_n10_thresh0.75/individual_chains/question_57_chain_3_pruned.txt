Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question gives me some phase shifts: δ₀ is 90 degrees, δ₁ is 67 degrees, δ₂ is 55, δ₃ is 30, and δ₄ is 13 degrees. Oh, wait, I think those are the phase shifts for different angular momentum states, like l=0,1,2,3,4. And the problem says to ignore the rest, so maybe beyond l=4 we don't consider any phase shifts. 

The problem is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ,φ) has a dependence on the phase shifts. Oh right, the formula involves a sum over l of (2l+1)e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l multiplied by some spherical harmonics or Legendre polynomials, I think. 

Wait, more specifically, the scattering amplitude f(θ,φ) is given by the sum from l=0 to infinity of (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) multiplied by e^{i (l+1)φ}, because the dependence on φ comes from the angular momentum projection. But since the question is about the direction along the incident beam, I think that means φ is zero. Or wait, maybe it's along the direction of the beam, which usually is considered at φ=0. So when we evaluate at φ=0, that e^{i(l+1)φ} becomes 1, right? So only the terms involving (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) matter, but since the question is about the imaginary part, I might need to extract that.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The scattering amplitude f has both real and imaginary parts. But the question specifically asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Hmm. Let's think about the form of f. 

I recall that the scattering amplitude can be written as f(θ,φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1 ]/(2i) P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ}. Wait, no,
