Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem states that we have a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential V(r) = (1/2)mω²r². Wait, I remember that this potential is like a 3D harmonic oscillator. Oh right, because the potential is quadratic in r, and it's the same in all directions, so it's isotropic.

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy eigenvalue. Hmm. So I need to find both the energy value and the degeneracy (the number of eigenfunctions with the same energy).

I think each direction (x, y, z) contributes a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. So the 3D oscillator can be considered as three 1D oscillators in each direction. The energy levels in each direction are given by E_n = (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is the quantum number (n=0,1,2,...).

The total energy in 3D would be the sum of energies in each direction. So E = E_x + E_y + E_z. Or more generally, E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so adding them up gives (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. 

Now, the energy levels are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers. So for a given total quantum number N = n_x + n_y + n_z. Then the energy is E = (N + 3/2) ħω.

Wait, so the energy depends on N, and each different combination of (n_x, n_y, n_z) that gives the same N will have the same energy, leading to degeneracy.

The question is about the third excited state. Wait, what defines the excited state? The ground state is the lowest energy, which is N=0. The first excited state would be the first higher energy, which is N=1. Second excited is N=2, third excited is N=3. So third excited state corresponds to N=3.

So the energy is E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. Wait, because 3 + 3/2 is 9/2. So that's (9/2) ħω. Looking at the options, that's option A and C.

Now, the next part is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (i.e., the degeneracy) for this energy level. The degeneracy is the number of ways to write N = n_x + n_y + n_z where each n_i is a non-negative integer.

So for N=3, how many ordered triplets (n_x, n_y, n_z) are there where each n_i is ≥0 and their sum is 3.

This is a combinatorial problem. The number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z =3 is given by the combination formula (n + k -1 choose k-1), where n is the
