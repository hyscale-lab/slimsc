Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again.

The question says: Find the KE of the product particles in the reaction Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. The Pi(+) is stationary. The rest masses are given as 139.6 MeV for Pi(+) and 105.7 MeV for mu(+). The options are A, B, C, D with different pairs of energies.

Hmm. So I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I remember that in such reactions, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, I think the products must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. But wait, the products are a muon and a neutrino. Oh right, neutrinos have very small mass, sometimes considered massless in these kinds of problems.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem states the rest mass of Pi(+) and mu(+). What about the neutrino? Since neutrinos are leptons but their masses are negligible for most problems, maybe the neutrino's rest mass is considered zero here. Or perhaps it's given? The question doesn't mention it, so I think we can treat the neutrino as having negligible mass. So the neutrino's energy would be approximately equal to its kinetic energy, but I'm not sure yet.

So, the initial setup: the pion is at rest, so its momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

But wait, the neutrino's mass is negligible, so its energy E_nu is approximately equal to its momentum p_nu multiplied by c, but since we're working in units where c=1 (as is common in particle physics), E_nu = p_nu. Similarly, the muon has mass m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c², so its energy E_mu is sqrt(p_mu² c^4 + m_mu² c^4) / c²? Wait, no, units get a bit tricky here. Wait, in natural units (where c=1), E = sqrt(p² + m²). So for the muon, E_mu = sqrt(p_mu² + m_mu²). For the neutrino, E_nu = p_nu.

Since the momentum magnitudes are equal, p_mu = p_nu.

So the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The initial energy is just the rest energy of the pion, which is m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV. But again, using c=1, E_initial = m_pi = 139.6 MeV.

So, E_initial = E_mu + E_nu.

Substituting:

139.6 = sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p.

Because E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu²), E_nu = p.

Hmm, so I can set up this equation: sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Let me call this equation (1). I need to solve for p.

Let me rearrange equation (1):

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - p.

Now square both sides to eliminate the square root:

p
