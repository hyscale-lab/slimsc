Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR of the crude sample looks mostly right except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar shifts and equal integrals, adding up to 1H. So each is about half a proton? And the coupling pattern doesn't suggest spin-spin coupling because it's ruled out.

Then the LC-MS at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. The mass spec is consistent with the expected molecule. Hmm.

Wait, so what could cause NMR to show two peaks for the same proton? If it's the same environment, shouldn't they be a singlet? Or maybe if there's some kind of splitting or if the molecule is exchanging between environments.

The options are A to D. Let's think about each.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Then the NMR would have more peaks, not just two for the same proton. Plus, the LC-MS would show a different mass. But in the question, the mass is the same, so probably not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers would have identical NMR spectra because they're mirror images. So the NMR would look the same, no extra peaks. Unless the compound is a racemic mixture with a plane of symmetry that causes some protons to split. Wait, but if it's a racemic mix, the alpha-proton in each enantiomer would be equivalent. So maybe that doesn't explain the two peaks. Or wait, maybe if the alpha-proton is in a position where the two enantiomers cause a different environment? Hmm, not sure. Also, for NMR, if it's a racemic mix, the NMR would look like a single peak because the environments are mirror images, so same chemical shift.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not very familiar with this term. Double coupling might happen in some reactions where two bonds are formed. Wait, maybe it's a case where the amide bond is formed, but another group isn't, leading to some byproduct. Or perhaps it's a situation where there's some coupling between two
