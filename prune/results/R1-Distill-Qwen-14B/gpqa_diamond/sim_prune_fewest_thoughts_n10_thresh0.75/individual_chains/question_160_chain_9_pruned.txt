Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light, wavelength λ, is shining along the z-axis, and it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. I need to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Also, we can use the small angle approximation where tan θ is approximately θ.

Hmm. So, I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, and the resulting pattern on a screen (far away) is called the diffraction pattern. The intensity varies with the angle, giving maxima and minima. The positions of these maxima and minima depend on the shape and size of the aperture.

Wait, the aperture is a regular N-sided polygon with all apothems equal. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So, for a regular polygon, the apothem 'a' would relate to the side length and the number of sides N.

But since N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle. Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle. So, in the limit as N approaches infinity, the aperture is a circular aperture. Oh, wait, but wait, the apothem 'a'—in a circle, the apothem would be the same as the radius, right? Because for a regular polygon, the apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle. So when N is large, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a.

Wait, no. Wait, in a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the side. For a circle, every point is the same distance from the center, so the apothem would be the radius. So in this case, as N becomes very large, the polygon's apothem is a, so the radius of the circular aperture would be a. So the diameter is 2a.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, no. Let me think again. For a regular polygon, the apothem (a) is the distance from the center to a side. The radius (R) is the distance from the center to a vertex. The relationship between apothem (a), radius (R), and the number of sides N is something like a = R * cos(π/N). Hmm. Because each side subtends an angle of 2π/N at the center. The apothem is adjacent to the angle π/N in a right triangle where the hypotenuse is R. So yes, a = R cos(π/N). So when N is large, π/N is small, so cos(π/N) ≈ 1 - (π²)/(2N²), but in the limit as N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1. So a ≈ R. So R ≈ a.

Oh, wait, but in our case, all apothems are the same length 'a'. So the radius R of the polygon (the distance from the center to each vertex) would be a / cos(π/N). For large N, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R ≈ a. So the polygon becomes a circle with radius a.

Wait, but that would mean the diameter is 2a. But in the case of a circular aperture, the first minimum in the diffraction pattern occurs at an angle θ where sin θ = λ / (π * D), where D is the diameter. Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think.

In the single-slit diffraction pattern, the intensity minima occur at angles θ where d sin θ = m λ, with m being ±1, ±2, etc., and d is the width of the slit. The first minimum is at m=1, so sin θ = λ / d. For a circular aperture, things are a bit different. The diffraction pattern is described by a Bessel function, and the minima occur at specific angles.

Wait, right, the minima for a circular aperture are given by the zeros of the B
