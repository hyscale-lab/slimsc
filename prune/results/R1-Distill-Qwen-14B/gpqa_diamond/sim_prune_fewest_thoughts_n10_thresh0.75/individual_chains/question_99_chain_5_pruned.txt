Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. I need to figure out which compound is the correct one based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's see, the question provides FTIR and 1H NMR information, and I have to choose between four options. 

First, I'll start by looking at the FTIR data. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, especially for alcohols or carboxylic acids. Since carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H stretch, that's probably what's happening here. Another peak at 1700 cm^-1 is strong. That's a typical carbonyl group (C=O) stretch. So, the compound likely has a carboxylic acid group because that has both the broad O-H and the strong C=O absorption.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. The problem says none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens, so there's no double bonds. That rules out any possibility of unsaturated structures, which none of the options seem to have. 

In the NMR, two specific signals are mentioned. One is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, complex splitting patterns usually arise from neighboring protons. Let's break those down.

A doublet of triplets suggests that each proton is split by two different sets of neighboring protons. The first split (the doublet) comes from coupling with one neighboring set, and the triplet comes from another. So each proton is next to two different groups of protons.

Similarly, a doublet of triplets of triplets is even more complex. Each proton is coupled with three different groups of protons. Or perhaps, each split comes from two different neighboring groups.

So we have a molecule with several distinct proton environments. Let's look at the options and their structures.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. Wait, let me parse that. The structure is CH2COOH, so the carboxylic acid is at the end. The central part is a geminal di-substituted carbon, with each H attached to a carbon that's connected to a CH3 and a C2H5 group. So the structure would be something like:

CH2-C(C2H5)(H)-C(C2H5)(H)-CH2COOH?

Wait, maybe I should draw it out. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH.

So the structure has two CH groups, each attached to a C2H5 and a CH3, and connected to another CH group. Wait, perhaps it's more like:

The molecule is CH2CH2... no, perhaps it's:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So the central part is two CH groups, each attached to two different substituents.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

CH3
