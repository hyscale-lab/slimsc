Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating non-Gaussianity using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question gives a specific state, the Schrödinger cat state. The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. Oh wait, I remember that |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, right? And phi is the phase, alpha is the amplitude, and N is the normalization constant.

The normalization constant N is provided as sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)). So, I need to plug in phi and alpha to compute N. Let me note down the values: phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5.

Wait, let's compute sin(2 phi) first. 2 phi is 2*(-pi/4) = -pi/2. The sine of -pi/2 is -1. So sin(2 phi) = -1. Then exp(-2 alpha^2) would be exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5) which is approximately 1/sqrt(e) ≈ 0.6065.

So N squared is 1 + (-1)*0.6065. Wait, that would be 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.627 or something. But maybe keeping it symbolic for now would be better.

The next part is the relative entropy measure, del_b, which is trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). Oh, right, relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (nG) would be the difference between the entropy of the state and the entropy of the closest Gaussian state. Because Gaussian states have their own entropy, and the non-Gaussian part is the difference.

But wait, the problem is to calculate the non-Gaussianity, which is del_b. So I need to compute this expression.

Wait, but how do I find rho and tau? Rho is the density matrix of the given state, and tau is the density matrix of the reference Gaussian state. I'm not exactly sure which Gaussian state is the reference here,
