Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of product 4 after a series of reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize that. So, cyclohexanone with substituents at the 3 and 5 positions. The 3 position has a hydroxymethyl group (so -CH2OH), and the 5 position has a propenyl group, specifically prop-1-en-2-yl. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like CH2-C(CH2)-, no, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C(CH3)-? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CHCH2-? No, wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is prop-1-en-2-yl, which is actually CH2=C(CH2)-. Wait, no. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3. So, prop-1-en-2-yl would be the substituent where the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2- but attached where? Oh wait, no. Wait, if it's prop-1-en-2-yl, the substituent is attached to carbon 2. So the group is CH2-CH2-CH2 with double bond between 1 and 2. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: prop-1-en-2-yl would be the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached to C2. So, structure is CH2=C(CH2R)-, but wait, for prop-1-en-2-yl, it's CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH3, but with the double bond at 1. Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond from C1 to C2, and the substituent is attached to C2. So
