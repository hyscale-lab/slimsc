Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe. The question says that in this universe, a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, which is different from our real world. I remember that in our world, magnets always have both poles; you can't isolate them. But how does that affect Maxwell's equations?

Maxwell's equations are four fundamental laws of electromagnetism. Let me recall them. The four are:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: The divergence of E is proportional to the charge density.
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: The divergence of B is zero.
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: The curl of E is proportional to the negative rate of change of B.
4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: The curl of B is proportional to the current plus the displacement current.

In our universe, the divergence of B is zero, which means there are no isolated magnetic charges—no monopoles. So Gauss's Law for Magnetism (the second equation) is ∇·B = 0. If in this alternate universe, magnets can have isolated poles, that would mean magnetic monopoles exist. 

So if magnetic monopoles exist, the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. Because each monopole would contribute to the divergence. So in that case, the second equation would change. But wait, the question is about which equations are different. So the second equation, Gauss's Law for magnetism, would change.

Wait, but wait—what about Faraday's Law? In our world, the curl of E is -dB/dt. Does that equation change if magnetic monopoles exist?

Hmm, I think when magnetic monopoles exist, the form of Maxwell's equations changes in another way. Because if you have a magnetic current, like a current made of magnetic charges moving, that should affect something else.

In our world, the divergence of B is zero, so that equation is different. Also, Ampère's Law includes the displacement current, but that's about how changing E fields create B fields. But what about if there's a magnetic current? I think that would affect the equation for the curl of H or something like that.

Wait, Maxwell's equations in the presence of magnetic monopoles would modify two of
