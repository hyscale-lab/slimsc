Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the CERN Bubble Chamber and particle decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is tau_0 = 8e-16 seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. Right. But when the particle is moving, we have to consider time dilation due to special relativity. So the lifetime observed in the lab frame would be longer.

The formula for time dilation is tau = gamma * tau_0. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is the ratio of the total energy to the rest mass energy. So gamma = E / (m c²). But wait, energy E is given as 27 GeV, and the mass m is 3.41 GeV. Since c² is in units that make E in GeV, I don't need to convert anything else here.

Wait, actually, the energy E is the total energy of the particle, which includes both rest mass and kinetic energy. So gamma = E / (m c²) = (27 GeV) / (3.41 GeV) because m c² is 3.41 GeV. So gamma is about 27 / 3.41. Let me compute that.

27 divided by 3.41. Hmm, 3.41 * 7 is about 23.87, and 3.41*8=27.28. Oh wait, 3.41 *7.9 = let's see, 3.41*7=23.87, 3.41*.9=3.069, so 23.87+3.069=26.939. So 27 / 3.41 is approximately 7.915. So gamma is about 7.915.

So the lifetime tau is gamma * tau_0, which is 7.915 *
