Okay, so I've got this question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both poles; you can't isolate a single pole. That's why, in reality, the divergence of the magnetic field is zero everywhere because there are no magnetic monopoles. 

Maxwell's equations are four in total. Let me recap them as I remember. The first one is Gauss's Law for electric fields: the divergence of E is rho over epsilon zero. The second is Gauss's Law for magnetism: divergence of B is zero. The third is Faraday's Law of induction, which involves the curl of E being equal to the negative rate of change of B. The fourth is Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition, which says the curl of B is mu zero times the current plus the displacement current.

Wait, but in this parallel universe, magnetic monopoles exist. So the situation must be different. If you can have isolated North and South poles, then the divergence of the magnetic field wouldn't be zero anymore. Because divergence of B represents the 'source' of the magnetic field, kinda like how divergence of E represents electric charge density. So if there are magnetic monopoles, then divergence of B would be proportional to the magnetic charge density.

So looking at Maxwell's equations, the second equation would change. In our universe, equation two is div B = 0. But here, it would be div B = some constant times the magnetic charge density (like rho_m or something).

What about the other equations? Faraday's Law (third equation) and Ampère's Law (fourth) are about how changing magnetic fields create electric fields and how currents and changing electric fields create magnetic fields. Those wouldn't directly be affected by the existence of magnetic monopoles, unless there's some other factor.

Wait, but if there are magnetic currents, like a current made of moving magnetic charges, that would affect another equation. Oh wait, Maxwell's equations as we know them don't account for magnetic current because they don't exist. So in our universe, the curl of H is J + dD/dt. But if magnetic current exists, perhaps the equations would have to change in another way.

Wait, let me think again. The original equations:

1. div E = rho / epsilon_0.
2. div B = 0.
3. curl E = -dB/dt.
4. curl H = J + dD/dt.

But if there are magnetic monopoles, then div B isn't zero. So equation 2 changes. Also, what about equation 4? Because if there's a magnetic current, maybe the equation for the curl of E would have a term involving that.

Wait, in the standard equations, equation 3 is about the curl of E. If magnetic monopoles exist, maybe there's a current associated with them. So would there be an additional term in equation 3?

Wait, in the standard scenario, equation 3 is curl E = -dB/dt. If there's a magnetic current, I think another term would be involved. Let me recall: in the presence of magnetic monopoles, there's another term in Faraday's Law. Or perhaps in Ampère's Law?

Wait, maybe I should think about the full set. Let me list the equations again:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0 (electric charge)
2. div B = rho_m (if magnetic monopoles exist)
3. curl E = - dB/dt - J_m (if there's a magnetic current)
4. curl B = mu_0 ( J_e + epsilon_0 dE/dt ) 

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's think about how each equation behaves when magnetic monopoles are present. 

In our universe, equation 2 is div B = 0. In this universe, it would be div B = rho
