Okay, so I've got this question about absorption lines in the Milky Way. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

The question says that observations are being made of structures about 2.1 gigaparsecs away. Wait, but the absorption line they detected has an energy equivalent of 3.9 micro electron volts. Micro is 10^-6, so 3.9e-6 eV. I'm trying to remember what energy corresponds to what kind of interstellar medium.

I remember that the interstellar medium (ISM) is divided into different phases based on temperature and density. There's the cold neutral medium (CNM), warm neutral medium (WNM), and hot ionized medium. Oh, and there are also molecular clouds, which are cold.

Absorption lines are usually from transitions in atoms or molecules. The energy of the line depends on the temperature, I think. Like, higher temperature means higher energy transitions. Wait, no, the energy corresponds to the transition itself. So the ionization potential would relate to the energy needed to ionize atoms.

Wait, the absorption line energy of 3.9 micro eV. Micro is really small. Let me think in terms of electron volts. 3.9e-6 eV is like 3.9 milli-eV, maybe? Or wait, no, 1 micro is 1e-6, so 3.9e-6 eV is 0.0039 eV. That's a very low energy.

Ionization energies are usually higher, like for hydrogen, the ionization energy is about 13.6 eV. So 0.0039 eV is way below that. So maybe it's not ionization, but something else. Oh, right, it's probably from rotational or vibrational transitions in molecules. Or maybe from neutral atoms but lower energy transitions, like in the ultraviolet or visible spectrum.

Wait, but wait, the interstellar medium has different regions. The cold molecular medium is at very low temperatures, maybe around 10-100 K. The warm atomic is about a few thousand K. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me remember the typical temperatures.

The cold neutral medium (CNM) is about 70-150 K. The warm neutral medium (WNM) is about 4000-10000 K. Oh wait, but wait, that's for neutral hydrogen. So the 2
