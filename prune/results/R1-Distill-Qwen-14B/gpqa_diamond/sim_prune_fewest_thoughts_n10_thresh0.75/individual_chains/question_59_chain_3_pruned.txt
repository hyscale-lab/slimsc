Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are given as A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So maybe I should think about the moles of H+ and OH- ions here. Acetic acid is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Oh wait, Ba(OH)2 dissociates completely into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions.

Let me calculate the moles of each component.

Starting with CH3COOH. The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.1 M, so moles = M * V = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, it won't dissociate completely, but maybe that's not the first thing to worry about. I'll keep that in mind.

Next, HCl. Volume is 400 mL = 0.4 L, concentration 0.2 M. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it'll fully dissociate into H+ and Cl^-.

Then Ba(OH)2. Volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L, concentration 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-, so total OH- moles would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but how do I combine these? So the HCl and Ba(OH)2 will react because they're acid and base. The acetic acid, being weak, might not react as much, but maybe it's part of the solution after the neutralization.

So let's think about the strong acid and strong base first. The HCl contributes H+ ions, and Ba(OH)2 contributes OH- ions. They will neutralize each other in a 1:1 ratio.

The moles of H+ from HCl is 0.08. The moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18. So the reaction is H+ + OH- â†’ H2O.

Which one is in excess? Let's subtract. OH- is more: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- remaining. So after the
