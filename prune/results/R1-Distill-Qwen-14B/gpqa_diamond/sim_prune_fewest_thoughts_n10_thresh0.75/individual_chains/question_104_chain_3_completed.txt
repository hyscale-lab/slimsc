Okay, so I have this astronomy question in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two stars with the same mass, both similar to the Sun. Each has a planet, and both are Neptune-like in mass. The orbits are circular.

Planet #1 caused a periodic shift of 5 milliangstroms in a spectral line. Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on the RV method, but I think it's all about the Doppler shift. The star moves because of the planet's gravity, and we measure the shift in the spectral lines. The bigger the shift, the higher the velocity of the star.

Wait, but the RV method gives us the velocity of the star due to the planet. I remember the formula involves velocity, the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, and the orbital period or semi-major axis.

Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by a formula. Let me recall. Oh right, the formula is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) / (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (P)^(1/3) )) ) * ( ( (2π)/P )^(1/3) ) ) wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the Doppler shift and how it relates to the planet's orbital period. I think the Doppler shift is proportional to the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's orbit.

Wait, the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The velocity semi-amplitude K is given by (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * ( (1) / ( ( (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) ) ) ) )^(1/3) )

But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies. Also, the orbits are circular, so e=0, so that term goes away.

So K = ( (G * M_p ) / (M_star^(2/3)) )^(1/3) * ( (1) / (P^(1/3)) )

Wait, maybe I have it wrong. Let me think again. The formula I remember is K = ( (2π G) / (c * P) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) )

But I'm getting confused. Alternatively, I've heard that the RV signal K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / a) )^(something), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) divided by the mass. But wait, in the case of a star and planet, the period P depends on a^3/(M_star + M_planet). But M_planet is much less than M_star, so P² ∝ a^3 / M_star.

But how does that relate to the RV shift? The RV shift depends on the velocity of the star in its orbit around the barycenter. The velocity is determined by the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, and the distance between them.

Wait, the star orbits the barycenter, so its velocity is v = (2π a_star) / P, where a_star is the star's orbit radius, and a_planet is the planet's orbit radius. Since a_planet = a (the semi-major axis), and a_star = (M_planet / (M_star + M_planet)) ) * a ≈ (M_p / M_star) * a.

So v = (2π * (M_p a) / (M_star) ) / P )

But from Kepler's third law, P² = (4π² a³)/(G(M_star + M_p)) ) ≈ (4π² a³)/(G M_star).

So a³ = (G M_star P² )/(4 π² )

Putting it back into the velocity equation:

v = (2 π * (M_p / M_star) * a ) ) / P

Substituting a from Kepler's law:

a = [ (G M_star P² )/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

So substitute that into v:

v = [ 2 π (M_p / M_star) * ( (G M_star P² / (4 π²)) )^(1/3) ) ] / P

Let me simplify this. Let's write it step by step.

v = (2 π) * (M_p / M_star) * [ (G M_star P² / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3) / P

Hmm. Let's compute the exponents. Let me factor the terms.

First, let's compute [ (G M_star P² / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3):

= [ G^(1/3) M_star^(1/3) P^(2/3) (4 π²)^(-1/3) ) ]

So plugging back into v:

v = 2 π * (M_p / M_star) * G^(1/3) M_star^(1/3) P^(2/3) (4 π²)^(-1/3) ) / P

Simplify the terms:

M_p is in numerator. M_star is denominator only in (M_p / M_star) term. Let's see:

(M_p / M_star) * M_star^(1/3) = M_p * M_star^(-1 + (1/3)) ) = M_p * M_star^(-2/3)

So v becomes:

v = 2 π * M_p * M_star^(-2/3) * G^(1/3) * P^(2/3) * (4 π²)^(-1/3) ) / P

Now, P is in numerator as P^(2/3) and denominator as P^1, so overall P^(2/3 - 1) = P^(-1/3).

So:

v = 2 π * M_p * G^(1/3) * (4 π²)^(-1/3) ) * M_star^(-2/3) * P^(-1/3)

Now, 2 π and (4 π²)^(-1/3) can be combined.

Let me compute (4 π²)^(-1/3) = (2^2 π^2 )^(-1/3) ) = 2^(-2/3) π^(-2/3)

So,

v = 2 π * ( M_p G^(1/3) ) *  2^(-2/3) π^(-2/3) ) * M_star^(-2/3) P^(-1/3 )

Multiply the terms:

2 * 2^(-2/3) = 2^(1 - 2/3) )= 2^(1/3 )

π * π^(-2/3) ) = π^(1 - 2/3) )= π^(1/3 )

So now,

v = (2^(1/3) π^(1/3) ) * M_p G^(1/3) * M_star^(-2/3) P^(-1/3 )

Factor out the 2^(1/3) π^(1/3) G^(1/3) as (2 π G )^(1/3 )

So,

v = (2 π G )^(1/3) * ( M_p ) * ( M_star^(-2/3) ) * ( P^(-1/3) )

Or,

v = (2 π G )^(1/3) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Hmm, so v is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Wait, let's see. So v = K, the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity. So K = [ (2 π G )^(1/3) ) * M_p ] / [ M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) ]

So, K is proportional to ( M_p / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) )

But in the problem, both planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), so M_p is same for both planets. The stars have same mass, so M_star is same for both stars.

Therefore, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because M_p and M_star are the same for both cases.

So, K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)) )

Which can be rewritten as P ∝ 1/(K^(3) )

Wait, wait, since K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), then P^(1/3) is proportional to 1/K. So P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

Wait, let me think. If K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then K = C / P^(1/3), where C is a constant. So, P^(1/3) = C / K → P = (C / K )^3.

So P is proportional to (1/K)^3. Therefore, the period is inversely proportional to K^3.

So, for two planets, we have:

P1 = K1 → No, wait, P1 is proportional to (1/K1)^3. Similarly, P2 is proportional to (1/K2)^3.

Thus, the ratio P2/P1 = [ (1/K2)^3 ] / [ (1/K1)^3 ] = (K1/K2)^3.

So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1.

Wait, in the problem, Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstrom, Planet #2 has 7. So K2 is larger than K1. Because the shift is the velocity, right? So K2 = 7, K1 =5.

So, P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.7143)^3 ≈ approx 0.364.

Wait, 5/7 is approximately 0.714. Cubing that: 0.714^3.

Calculating 0.7^3 is 0.343, 0.71^3 would be about 0.358, 0.714^3 is 0.714 * 0.714 = 0.509796, multiplied by 0.714 again: 0.509796 * 0.714 ≈ 0.364, yes.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1's period. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1.

The question is, how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's? So P2/P1 is 0.36, which is 0.36 times longer? Wait, no, that's the opposite. Wait, wait. Let's think again.

Wait, P2 is 0.36 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1. The question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So it's 0.36 times, which is shorter, so the period of P2 is 0.36 times P1, meaning it's shorter.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then the period of P2 is shorter by a factor of ~0.36. So it's 0.36 times as long.

So the correct ratio is 0.36, which is option A.

But wait, wait. Let me confirm the reasoning again. Because sometimes when you have K proportional to 1/P^(1/3), the relation is P proportional to 1/K^3. So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is ( (K1)/(K2) )^3 times P1.

Wait, K2 =7, K1=5. So (5/7)^3 is (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1 → P2 = 0.364 P1. So P2 is 0.364 times P1, which is shorter. So P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of 0.364. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1. Therefore, planet #2's period is shorter, so the answer is option A, which is ~0.36.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't get the K and P relation wrong. Because higher K means higher velocity, which could mean a shorter period. But let's think about it: if a planet is close to the star, it has a shorter orbital period and the star moves more quickly (higher K). So yes, higher K implies shorter period. So if K2 is higher than K1, P2 is shorter than P1.

So the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364. So the answer is 0.36 times as long, so P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1.


The radial velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift caused by the motion of a star due to an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity, \( K \), is proportional to \( \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet. Since \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), the orbital period \( P \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{K^3} \).

For two planets with similar masses orbiting stars of the same mass, the ratio of their orbital periods can be determined by the ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes. Planet #1 has a radial velocity shift of 5 milliangstroms (\( K_1 = 5 \)), and Planet #2 has a shift of 7 milliangstroms (\( K_2 = 7 \)). The ratio of their orbital periods is given by:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{K_1}{K_2} \right)^3 = \left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1, meaning it is shorter. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
