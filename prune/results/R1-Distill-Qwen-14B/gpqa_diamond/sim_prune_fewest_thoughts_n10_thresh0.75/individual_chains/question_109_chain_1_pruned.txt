Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this physics problem about particle emission and quantum numbers. Let me start by breaking down what the question is asking. 

The problem involves two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. So, the initial state is 1S0, and the final state is the NN system plus the emitted particle X. 

Pauli statistics are in play here, which means we have to consider the symmetry of the wavefunction when dealing with identical particles. But wait, in this case, the nucleons are part of the same system, so maybe it's more about the conservation laws than Pauli's exclusion principle directly. The problem gives a formula: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Hmm, I need to figure out what each of these represents.

T(NN) is the isospin quantum number of the final NN state. S(NN) is the total spin, L(NN) the orbital angular momentum. So the formula is saying that the sum of spin, orbital angular momentum, and isospin for the NN must add up to an even or odd number, considering mod 2. 

The question states that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So plugging into the formula: 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. Which means S + L ≡ 1 mod 2. So S and L must have opposite parity; one is even, the other odd. 

Now, the problem is about determining which partial wave is not permitted when the NN system emits a particle X. The options are labeled A to D, each showing the initial state (1S0) transitioning to a state with some angular momentum and a particle (p, etc.). 

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. Let me parse this. The notation 1S0 would mean (2S+1)LJ. So for 1S0, S is 0 (since 2*0+1=1), L is the orbital part. Wait, no, wait. The S in 1S0 is the spin, which is 0 because it's 1S0. So the initial spin S_initial is 0. The L is the orbital angular momentum, but wait, the term is 1S0. Wait, the notation is (2S+1)L J. So 1S0: (2*0+1) = 1, so the first part is 1, then S is 0, then L? Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me get this straight. 

In atomic terms, a term symbol is written as 2S+1 L J. So for 1S0, 2S+1=1 → S=0. Then the orbital part is S (so S here refers to the orbital angular momentum, but that's confusing because S is usually spin). Wait, no, wait—no, the term symbol is (2S+1) L J, where S is the total spin, L is the orbital angular momentum, and J is the total angular momentum. So 1S0: 2S+1 =1 → S=0
