Okay, so I'm looking at this quantum mechanics problem here. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

First, the density matrix given is rho equals 1/2 times (|0><0| + |1><1|). Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. So this rho is a density matrix for a qubit.

Wait, what does this particular rho represent? If I break it down, |0><0| is the outer product of the basis state |0> with itself. Similarly for |1><1|. Adding them together and dividing by 2 means each term has a coefficient of 1/2. So rho is an equal mixture of the states |0> and |1>.

Oh right, this is the maximally mixed state for a qubit. It's like saying the qubit is in a completely mixed state, 50%|0> and 50%|1>. So when you measure it, you have an equal probability of getting 0 or 1.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm a bit confused about what that refers to. Wait, I think I remember that qubit states are often represented in the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of a qubit state, where the state is a point on the surface of a unit sphere in 3D space.

In the Bloch sphere, the pure states |0> and |1> correspond to the north and south poles, respectively. The state |0> is at (0,0,1), and |1> is at (0,0,-1). But wait, the density matrix here isn't a pure state. It's a mixed state because it's a statistical mixture of |0> and |1>.

So how is a mixed state represented on the Bloch sphere? I think that for a mixed state, especially a completely mixed one, the density matrix is represented by the maximally mixed state which is at the center of the Bloch sphere. Because each outcome has equal probability, the state doesn't have any direction—it's in the middle.

Wait, the pure states are on the surface, but the completely mixed state is in the center. The center of the Bloch sphere is at the origin, right? So the coordinates would be (0,0,0).

Looking at the options given:

Option A: (1,1,0) — That's somewhere on the equator, but not the center.

Option B: (0,0,1) — That's the |0> state, but that's a pure state. Our rho isn't pure.

Option C: (0,0,0) — That's the center. That makes sense for a completely mixed state.

Option D: (1,1,1) — That's a point in the positive octant, but its distance from the origin is sqrt(3), which is larger than 1. But the Bloch sphere only has points with distance 1, so I think this isn't possible.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The density matrix for a mixed state would correspond to a point inside the Bloch sphere. The completely mixed state is indeed the center because it's equally likely to be in any pure state, but the state is maximally uncertain. So the vector would have zero components because it's the origin.

So the correct answer should be option C, (0,0,0).


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a qubit, where the qubit is in an equal statistical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states like \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\) are located at the north pole \((0,0,1)\) and south pole \((0,0,-1)\), respectively. However, mixed states are represented as points inside the Bloch sphere, with the completely mixed state being at the center of the sphere.

For the given density matrix, which is a maximally mixed state, the corresponding point in the Bloch sphere is at the origin, \((0,0,0)\). This is because the state has no preferential direction and represents maximum uncertainty.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A** \((1,1,0)\): This corresponds to a point on the equator of the Bloch sphere, not the center.
- **Option B** \((0,0,1)\): This is the pure state \(|0\rangle\), not a mixed state.
- **Option C** \((0,0,0)\): This is the center of the Bloch sphere, representing the completely mixed state.
- **Option D** \((1,1,1)\): This is outside the Bloch sphere and not a valid representation.

Thus, the correct geometrical position of the given density matrix in the qubit space is \((0,0,0)\).

Answer: C
