Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency in the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in some kind of elimination or maybe addition reaction. Wait, I think red phosphorus with HI is used for the hydrolysis of certain functional groups, like maybe in the Wolff-Kishner reaction or something similar. Or wait, no, Wolff-Kishner uses hydrazine and then heat. Oh right, red phosphorus with HI is used to remove carbonyl groups, like in the case of the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes using Zn(HI)/red P. So that reaction would break a carbonyl group into a single bond.

So the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to draw its structure mentally. The base structure is a cyclohexene ring. The numbering starts at the cyclohexene part. So, position 3 is a double bond (cyclohex-3-ene), position 2 has a formyl group (CHO), and position 5 has a vinyl group (CH2CH2, but wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so it's a substituent on the ring.

Wait, the structure would be a cyclohexene ring. Let me think: cyclohex-3-ene means the double bond is between C3 and C4 (assuming the numbering is such that the double bond is between adjacent carbons). So positions 2, 3, 4, 5 are around the ring. So at C2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at C5, a vinyl group (CH2=CH- attached to the ring).

And the molecule also has a carboxylic acid group. Wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Oh wait, the "carboxylic acid" part is the main substituent. So the parent is cyclohex-3-ene carboxylic acid. So the substit
