Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two parts, reactions A and B, and I need to find the major products based on the given conditions. Then, I have to choose the correct option from A to D.

First, let's look at Reaction A:

1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol + (THF, KH, H+) â†’ A

Hmm, I remember that THF is a solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, which is a strong base. The presence of H+ at the end probably means some acidic work-up. 

So, the starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, which in this case is the spiro alcohol. The structure must be a spiro compound with two rings: one probably a five-membered and the other a six or seven-membered ring. The 1-vinyl group is attached to the spiro position, so maybe the structure is something like a bicyclic system with a double bond.

I think what's happening here is an elimination reaction. When a strong base like KH is used, it typically deprotonates the alcohol to form an alkoxide, which can then undergo elimination. But wait, the starting material is a spiro alcohol. When you deprotonate the hydroxyl group, you get an alkoxide, which can lead to an elimination, forming a double bond. But wait, the starting molecule already has a double bond in the ring (non-5-en). So perhaps this is a pinacol rearrangement or some kind of electrocyclic ring-opening?

Wait, no, the structure is a spiro alcohol. Another possibility is a Robinson annulation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the reaction might involve the formation of a ketone or another cyclic compound.

Wait, another thought: When you have a spiro alcohol treated with a strong base, it can undergo an elimination to form a bicyclic ketone. Because the base can abstract a proton leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. Remember, in some cases, the spiro alcohol can undergo deprotonation and elimination to form a bridge, leading to a bicyclic compound.

Wait, the starting material is 1-vinylspiro, so maybe the reaction forms a bridge. Let me visualize the structure. The spiro alcohol has two rings: one cyclopropane (3-membered) and another cyclopentane (5-membered), but wait, the numbering is non-5-en, which is a nine-membered ring with a double bond at position 5. Wait, no, the spiro indicates that two rings are connected at one carbon. So, spiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. The "non" part is 9 carbons, so the two rings are 3 and 5, maybe a five-membered and a four-membered ring? Wait, no, spiro[m.n] means the two rings have m and n carbons, but the total is
