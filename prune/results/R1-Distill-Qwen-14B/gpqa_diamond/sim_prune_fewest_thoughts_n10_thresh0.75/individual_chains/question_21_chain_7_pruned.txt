Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says.

The question is about isomers and some specific compounds. The main points are about tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that isomers can be constitutional or stereoisomers, and stereoisomers include things like geometric and optical isomerism.

Alright, the question has two parts, A and B. Let me tackle each part one by one.

Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism? The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and the shift of a bond, usually involving the movement of a hydrogen from one atom to another adjacent one, leading to different structures. This is common in compounds with adjacent double bonds and hydrogens, like in carbonyl compounds.

Benzoquinone has two ketone groups, I think. Benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O, right? Wait, no, benzoquinone is a cyclic di-ketone. So the structure is a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms as ketones, probably at positions 1,2, or 1,4? Benzoquinone can be either 1,2 (ortho) or 1,4 (para) isomers. But wait, does it have adjacent double bonds that can allow for keto-enol tautomerism?

Wait, tautomerism usually occurs when there's a hydrogen adjacent to a double bond. For example, in compounds with alpha hydrogens to carbonyl groups. Like in a diketone, if the carbonyl groups are conjugated, but spaced in a way that allows for hydrogen shift.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups. Let me visualize it. The structure is a cyclohexane ring with ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. So, each ketone is separated by a CH2 group. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO. So, each carbonyl is separated by two carbons. Hmm, wait, in that case, can there be any conjugated double bonds? Or are the carbonyl groups isolated?

Wait, if the ring is six-membered, 1,3,5-trione would have alternating carbonyl and methylene groups. So, maybe O=C-CH2-CH2-CO... Wait no, 1,3,5-trione would have carbonyls at positions 1,3,5, so the structure would be O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2? No, maybe that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe it's O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about whether these compounds can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Benzoquinone, as a di-ketone, if the two ketones are adjacent, then the structure would be O=C6H4=O or perhaps O=C-C6H4-O? No, wait, benzoquinone is more likely to
