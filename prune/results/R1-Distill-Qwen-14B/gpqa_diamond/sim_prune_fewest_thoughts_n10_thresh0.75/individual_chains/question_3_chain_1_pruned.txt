Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me think through it step by step. Alright, the question is about expectation values of an operator applied to a spin-half particle.

The particle is in a superposition state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, which is the Pauli z-matrix. The operator we're looking at is 10σz +5σx. We need to find the expectation value of this operator.

First, I remember that expectation value of an operator is given by ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator and ψ is the state. So I need to compute this expectation value for the given operator.

Let me break this down. The operator is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value ⟨O⟩ will be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I can compute ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ separately.

I know that σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively. Since the state is a linear combination of these eigenstates, the expectation value of σz should be straightforward.

Wait, the state is ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2. So a² is 0.25 and b² is (3/4) because (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4. So |a|² + |b|² = 1, which makes sense.

For σz, since |↑⟩ has eigenvalue +1 and |↓⟩ eigenvalue -1, the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is |a|²*(+1) + |b|²*(-1). Let's compute that.

a² is 0.25, so 0.25*(1) = 0.25. b² is 0.75, so 0.75*(-1) = -0.75. Adding them together: 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

So the first term in the expectation value of O is 10 times that: 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now for the second part, ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. The expectation value of σx is a bit trickier because σx doesn't have the same eigenstates as σz.

I remember that for a state in the σz basis, the expectation value of σx can be found using the coefficients of the state. Let me think about the formula. Oh right, for a spin-½ particle in state ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, ⟨σx⟩ is 2*(a b* - a* b) ) / (a² + b²), but wait, since a and b are real here (they are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2, which are real numbers), this simplifies.

Wait, maybe I should compute it directly. The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

Expressed in terms of the components, since σx in the σz basis can be written as [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when I apply σx to |ψ⟩, which is a column vector [a; b], I get [b; a]. Then the inner product ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is a b* + b a*, but since a and b are real, this becomes ab + ba = 2ab.

Wait, let me compute that:

ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. So when we apply σx, it's [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. Then ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is the dot product of ψ and σx|ψ⟩.

So ψ · σx|ψ⟩ = 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5) = (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) )= 2*( sqrt(3)/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, wait, that seems right. So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, but another way to compute ⟨σx⟩ is considering the general formula for a spin in a state ψ = α |↑⟩ + β |↓⟩. The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is 2 * (α β* - α* β ) / (|α|² + |β|²) ), but if α and β are real, then it's 2*(α β ) / (α² + β²) ). Because α β* - α* β = 2i Im(α β*) but if they are real, Im is zero. Wait wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Alternatively, another approach: since σx is a Hermitian operator, and for a state expressed in the σz basis, the expectation value can be found as 2*(a b - a b ), wait no. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The Pauli matrices: σx = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|, which is the same as [[0 1],[1 0]]. So when you compute the expectation, it's the sum over the states.

Wait, no, the expansion is correct. So for ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, ⟨σx⟩ = a²⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ + a b ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ + b a ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ + b² ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩.

But σx|↑⟩ is |↓⟩, so ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ is ⟨↑|↓⟩ =0.

Similarly, σx|↓⟩ is |↑⟩, so ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩ is 0.

The cross terms are a b ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ = a b ⟨↑|↓⟩ = a b * 0 = 0?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, σx|↑⟩ is |↓⟩, so ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ is 0. Similarly, σx|↓⟩ is |↑⟩, so ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩ is 0.

The cross terms: a b ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ = a b * ⟨↑|↓⟩ = 0. And similarly, b a ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ = b a * ⟨↓|↑⟩ = 0. Wait, that can't be right because earlier when I computed using matrix elements, I got sqrt(3)/2.

Hmm, I must be missing something here. Wait, perhaps I should compute it using the matrix representation.

Let me write ψ as a column vector: [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. The σx matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx |ψ⟩ is [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. Now, the inner product ⟨
