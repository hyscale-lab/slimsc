Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and based on that, I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, Dâˆžh, C2v. Hmm, symmetry groups... I think these are referring to the point groups in molecular symmetry. So, I need to figure out what molecule E is and then determine its point group.

Let me break down the reactions given.

First, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents is a lot. So, maybe it's something like a metal reacting with a halogen? Wait, metals reacting with halogens often form binary compounds. For example, sodium and chlorine form NaCl. But 8 equivalents? Maybe it's something like sulfur and another element. Wait, sulfur is bright red when it's in certain forms. Oh! Maybe C is a compound like FeS or something else. Or perhaps it's a nitrate? I'm not sure yet.

Moving on, when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces product E, which is extremely hazardous. So, E is a dangerous substance. Common hazardous chemicals include things like sarin gas, or maybe something like phosgene, or perhaps even something like chlorine gas, but that's a gas. Wait, but E is produced from a reaction with D. Alternatively, maybe E is something like a cyanide compound. Alternatively, if D is a halogen, perhaps E is a highly toxic compound like hydrogen cyanide? Hmm, not sure.

Next, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C (which is maybe a salt) reacts with water, it undergoes hydrolysis to produce the original solid A and two acids. Since F is strong and G is weak, perhaps F is HCl (strong) and G is something like H2S (which is weak). Or maybe F is H2SO4 and G is H2S? Wait, but H2S is a weak acid. Alternatively, if C is a sulfide, like FeS, then reacting with water would produce Fe(OH)2 (which might decompose, but wait, maybe it's more like a metal sulfide reacting with water
