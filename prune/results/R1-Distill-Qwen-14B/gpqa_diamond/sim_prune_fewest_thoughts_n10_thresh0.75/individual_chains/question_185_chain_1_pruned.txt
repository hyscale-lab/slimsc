Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the Hamiltonian operator H, and I need to find its eigenvalues. Hmm, I remember that the Hamiltonian is an operator that represents the total energy of the system.

The given Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n. Oh wait, σ is the Pauli vector, right? So the components of σ are the Pauli spin matrices. And n is a unit vector, so its magnitude is 1. ε is an energy constant.

I think the eigenvalues of a spin operator are related to the magnitude of the spin. Since σ is a vector of Pauli matrices, each component squared should give the identity matrix times something. Wait, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, and each squared is the identity matrix times 1. So, σ · n would be n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. 

But wait, when you square σ · n, what do you get? Let me think. (σ · n)^2 would be n_x² σ_x² + n_y² σ_y² + n_z² σ_z² + cross terms. But each σ_i squared is I (identity matrix), so that's (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) I, but since n is a unit vector, n_x² + ... equals 1. So (σ · n)^2 = I. 

But wait, the Hamiltonian is ε times σ · n. So H = ε (σ · n), and the square of
