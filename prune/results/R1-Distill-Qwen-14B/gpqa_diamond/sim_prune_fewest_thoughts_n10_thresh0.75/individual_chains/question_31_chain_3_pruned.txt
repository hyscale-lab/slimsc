Okay, so I'm looking at this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product 3. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question describes a series of reactions starting with toluene. I remember that toluene is methylbenzene, so it's a benzene ring with a methyl group attached.

The first reaction is treating toluene with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. I think that's a nitration reaction. Nitric acid is a nitrating agent, and sulfuric acid acts as a catalyst. Toluene undergoes nitration typically at the para position because the methyl group is an activating group, and the ring is electron-rich. So product 1 is probably para-nitrotoluene. Wait, but wait, where does nitration occur? Toluene is an activating group, so the nitro group should enter at the para position. So yes, product 1 is 4-nitro toluene, also known as para-nitrotoluene.

Next, product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent, especially in acidic conditions. I remember that when a nitro group is attached to a benzene ring, like in nitrotoluene, the nitro group is a meta-directing group. But more importantly, under certain conditions, nitro groups can be reduced or oxidized. Wait, wait, MnO2 is usually a oxidizing agent. So maybe in this case, it's an oxidation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nitration followed by something else. Wait, no, product 1 is the nitro compound. So product 2 comes from treating that with MnO2 and H2SO4. I think when nitrotoluene is treated with a strong oxidizing agent like hot concentrated sulfuric acid and MnO2, the methyl group attached to the benzene ring (toluene) can get oxidized. Wait, because toluene's methyl group is attached to benzene, when you have nitro groups, the substituent affects oxidation.

Wait, so product 1 is para-nitrotoluene. Now, treating that with MnO2 and H2SO4. H2SO4 is a strong acid and a dehydrating agent. I think MnO2 in H2SO4 can act as an oxidizing agent. The methyl group in para-nitrotoluene is attached to the benzene ring. When we oxidize a methyl group attached to benzene, what happens? The methyl group becomes a carboxylic acid group. So the methyl (CH3) becomes COOH. So product 2 would be 4-nitrobenzoic acid. Because the methyl group on the benzene becomes a carboxylic acid, so substituting the methyl in para-nitrotoluene with a carboxylic acid.

Wait wait, but wait. Toluene is methyl benzene. So product 1 is benzene with a nitro group and a methyl group, both in para positions. Then, oxidizing the methyl group to COOH would make it benzoic acid with a nitro group in the para position. So product 2 is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

Now, product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide. Acetone is a ketone
