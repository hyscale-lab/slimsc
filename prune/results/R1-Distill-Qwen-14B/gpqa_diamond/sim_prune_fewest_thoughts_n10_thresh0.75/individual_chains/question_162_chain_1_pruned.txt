Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let's try to think this through.

The given metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that doesn't look like a standard metric I'm familiar with. I remember that in general relativity, the metric describes the geometry of spacetime, and the area of a sphere can be calculated using surface integrals based on that metric.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But wait, what's the metric for a pseudosphere? I think it's related to hyperbolic space. Or is this a 2-dimensional space, so it's like a surface in 3D? Not sure, but maybe the metric can give me clues.

Looking at the metric, the coefficients depend on x and y. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), and the numerator is 32. So the line element is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dx² + dy²), where r² = x² + y². That looks like a function of r.

Wait, maybe this is a 2-dimensional metric, so it's describing a surface in two dimensions. I'm trying to recall what kind of metric this is. It resembles the metric of a space with constant curvature. Oh, right! The metric for a space of negative curvature, like a hyperbolic plane, can be written
