Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks like a pretty complex molecule. I think it's a diene or something with multiple double bonds. Wait, looking again, it has two double bonds. Each part has a C=C, so maybe it's a molecule with two conjugated double bonds or something like that.

The question gives me some bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. The goal is to find the enthalpy of formation of this compound. I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.

But wait, the problem gives bond energies. So I think the approach here is to calculate the enthalpy change using bond energies. The formula I remember is something like:

Enthalpy of formation (Î”Hf) = (sum of bond energies broken) - (sum of bond energies formed)

Wait, no. Actually, the standard approach is to consider the energy required to break all bonds in the reactants and the energy released when bonds form in the products. So for enthalpy of formation, if we're considering the formation from elements, all the bonds in the elements (like C-C, C-H, H
