Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this NMR problem. Let me read it carefully again.

The question says that the 1H NMR of a solution with a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, both with the formula C10H14, shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. And then there are three signals around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four possible pairs of compounds.

Wait, the compounds are all tetramethylbenzenes except one option which is diethyl. Let me think about their structures.

The molecular formula is C10H14. For a benzene ring with substituents, the formula would be C6H5R, where R contributes 4 carbons and 9 hydrogens? Because C10H14 is same as C6H5(C4H9), like if benzene has four substituents each with a methyl, perhaps. Wait, wait, let's calculate.

Benzene is C6H6. So C10H14 would be C6H6 plus four substituents. Each substituent would be a methyl group because 4 methyl groups add 4 carbons and 4*(3) = 12 H, but wait, each CH3 adds 3 H, but when attached to benzene, each would lose one H so each substituent contributes 2 H per group? Wait, maybe better to think in terms of molecular formula.

Each benzene ring with n substituents (like methyl) would have the formula C6H6- (each substituent replaces a H). So for a tetramethylbenzene (four methyl groups), the formula would be C6H6 + 4*(CH3) = C6 + 4C = C10, and H: 6 - 4 = 2, plus 4*3 = 12, so total H=14. Yes, that gives C10H14. So all four options are tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which has diethyl groups.

Wait, option C is 1,4-diethylbenzene. Let me check its formula. Benzene has 6 carbons. Each ethyl group is C2H5. So two ethyl groups would be
