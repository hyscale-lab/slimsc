Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to think this through. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X =8 GeV, mass m_X=1.2 GeV, and width Gamma_X=320 MeV. The options are A to D with different distances.

Wait, mean decay distance... right, that's related to how far the particle travels before decaying. So I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. The formula I think is tau = hbar / Gamma, where Gamma is the total decay width. But wait, decay width is in energy units, so I have to make sure the units are compatible.

But decay distance is velocity multiplied by lifetime. Oh right, because the particle is moving, so distance is v * tau. So the formula should be (v * c) * tau, but I'm a bit confused about the factors here.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the lifetime tau using the width Gamma.
2. Find the velocity v of the meson.
3. Multiply v (in terms of c) by c to get velocity in m/s, then multiply by tau to get the decay length.

Wait, actually, for relativistic particles, velocity can be approximated based on their energy and mass. Since the production energy is 8 GeV, and mass is 1.2 GeV, that's much bigger than rest mass, so it's moving at a high speed
