Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) tell us about the stability of complexes. Higher β means a more stable complex. Each β corresponds to a complex with a certain number of SCN- ligands. So β1 is probably the complex with one SCN-, β2 with two, and so on.

Wait, but the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato implies two SCN- ligands. So that would be the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, right? So we need to find the fraction of Co that's in the form [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

The total cobalt concentration includes all the species: Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, [Co(SCN)_3]^3-, [Co(SCN)_4]^4-? Or wait, wait. Wait, the charges might vary. Let me think. Co^2+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN^- is -1. So [CoSCN]^+ would be Co^2+ + SCN^- (charge +1). [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ would have charge 0? No, wait: Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- gives Co(SCN)_2^0? No, because 2+ + 2*(-1) is 0. So the neutral complex? Or wait, but in solution, complexes can have counterions. Hmm, but maybe the charge isn't super important here because the problem is about the distribution based on stability constants.

But wait, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β corresponds to the formation from the previous complex. So the formation of [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) from [Co(SCN)_{n-1}]^{3-(n-1)} + SCN^- would have a stability constant βn.

But in any case, the way to approach this problem is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex, given the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^- and the stability constants.

The formula for the fraction of each complex is determined by the stability constants and the concentrations.

I remember that the fraction of each complex can be found using the formula:

f_n = (β_n [SCN^-]^n) / (sum over k of β_k [SCN^-]^k)

Wait, but wait, no. Because each complex is formed stepwise. So the fraction of the complex with n SCN- ligands is determined by the product of the previous βs up to n.

Alternatively, the fraction for each species is given by (β1 * β2 * ... * βn) * [SCN]^n / K_total, where K_total is the sum of all possible species' terms.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the stepwise formation. The general approach is to consider the formation of each complex step by step. The total concentration of Co is the sum of all the species: free Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, etc.

The formation of each complex is given by the stability constants. So, for example:

β1 = [CoSCN^+] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-])

β2 = [Co(SCN)_2^2+] / ([CoSCN^+][SCN^-])

β3 = [Co(SCN)_3^3-] / ([Co(SCN)_2^2+][SCN^-])

β4 = [Co(SCN)_4^4-] / ([Co(SCN)_3^3-][SCN^-])

Wait, but the problem gives β1 to β4 as 9,40,63,16. So each β is for the step from n-1 to n ligands.

But to find the fraction of each complex, I can model the distribution using these stepwise β values.

Let me denote the concentration of Co^2+ as [Co], and SCN^- as [S] = 0.1 M.

The total cobalt concentration is c_total = [Co] + [CoS] + [CoS2] + [CoS3] + [CoS4] = 0.01 M.

We can express all these concentrations in terms of [Co].

Let me think about the formation step by step.

First, let’s define:

[CoS] = β1 [Co][S]

[CoS2] = β2 [CoS][S] = β2 β1 [Co][S]^2

[CoS3] = β3 [CoS2][S] = β3 β2 β1 [Co][S]^3

[CoS4] = β4 [CoS3][S] = β4 β3 β2 β1 [Co][S]^4

So the sum is [Co] (1 + β1 [S] + β1 β2 [S]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4 )

Set this equal to c_total = 0.01 M.

So,

[Co]
