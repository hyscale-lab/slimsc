Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a reaction involving a specific compound and hydrogen bromide. The reaction is observed using TLC, and the results show that the reactant spot has diminished, with two new spots formed. I need to determine which of the given options correctly identifies the products.

First, I'll try to understand the structure of the starting material. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me draw that out. The benzene ring has an ether group (O-) attached. The ether is linked to a but-3-en-1-yl group, which is a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at the third carbon. Also, there are two methyl groups on the second carbon of this chain. So, the structure is like benzene-O-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but wait, noâ€”the substituents are on the butenyl group. So the but-3-en-1-yl group would be CH2-CH(C(CH3)2)-CH2? Hmm, maybe I should write it more clearly.

But-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, wait. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl: the double bond is between C3 and C4? No, because but has four carbons. So numbering starts from the point of attachment. So the structure is OCH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2? Wait, maybe I should think again. Alternatively, perhaps it's OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, the double bond is in the structure. Oh right, the substituent is a but-3-en-1-yl group. So the structure is OCH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. Let's think. But-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No. Wait, the position of the double bond. For but-3-en-1-yl, the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, but wait, but has four carbons, so the possible double bonds are between 1-2,
