Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it again and think about what's being asked.

So, the setup is that particles are being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles produce new types that decay quickly. They travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm, okay. So I think this has to do with how the particles' speed and their decay time affect how far they travel before decaying. Since the detector is spherical and they're produced at the center, the maximum distance a particle can travel is the radius, which is 30 meters.

Wait, I remember that the distance a particle travels before decaying is related to its lifetime as observed in the lab frame. Because particles moving at relativistic speeds have their lifetimes dilated due to time dilation. So the proper lifetime (the lifetime in their rest frame) is gamma times shorter than the observed lifetime in the lab frame. Wait, no, wait. No, time dilation is gamma. So if the proper lifetime is tau, then in the lab frame, it's gamma * tau.

But the distance the particle moves before decaying depends on its speed and the time it takes. So the distance L is equal to speed v multiplied by the lifetime gamma tau, but since it's ultra-relativistic, v is approximately the speed of light, c. So L â‰ˆ c * gamma tau.

But wait, the problem says that the particles are produced at the center, and we're looking at how many reach the inner walls. So the radius is 30 meters. So particles that reach the wall have traveled a distance of 30 meters. Those that don't decay in time will reach the wall.

Wait, but the fraction that reach the wall depends on the average lifetime. So when the lifetime is longer, more particles can travel the 30 meters before decaying, so a higher fraction will reach the wall.

Wait, in the initial case, the Lorentz factor is gamma = 20, and one third of the particles reach the wall. We need to find the gamma that gives two-thirds.

So, I think the key is to relate the fraction of particles that
