Okay, so I've got this question here about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is asking which exoplanet among the options has the highest density. The options are a, b, c, d, and the choices given are A to D, each corresponding to one of these options.

Wait, the options are a bit confusing because the letters are the same. So the options are labeled A, B, C, D, each pointing to a different a-d option. Let me make sure I get that straight.

So each option (a, b, c, d) describes a different planet. The question is to pick which one has the highest density.

I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So density = mass/volume. So for each planet, I need to find (mass)/(volume).

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So mass is Earth's mass, radius is Earth's radius. So density would be same as Earth's, which is approximately 5.5 g/cm³. I think Earth's density is about that. So a's density is 5.5.

Option b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but wait—the question says which has the highest density. Option b's density is given as 5.5, same as Earth. So if that's the case, then a and b have the same density. But wait, the question is which has the highest. So maybe this isn't the highest, but let me check the others.

Option c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth. So same composition implies same density, right? Because composition affects density. So if it's same composition, density is same. So same as Earth, 5.5. But wait, wait. Wait, more mass but same composition—so same density. So mass is 5 times Earth's, but density is same. So what's the question asking? Highest density. So option c's density is same as a and b, right?

Wait, but wait, option d is a planet with same composition as Earth but half the mass. Same composition, so same density as Earth—5.5. So all options a, b, c, d have the same density? No, wait, because option a
