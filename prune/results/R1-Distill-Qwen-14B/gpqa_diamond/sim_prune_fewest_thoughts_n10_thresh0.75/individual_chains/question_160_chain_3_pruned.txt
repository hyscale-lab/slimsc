Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about diffraction. Hmm. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length a. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. We need to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Oh right, and the angles are small, so tanθ ≈ θ.

Wait, I remember that when the number of sides N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. Because as N increases, a regular polygon looks more like a circle. So the aperture becomes a circular one. That makes sense because the first thing that comes to mind is the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture, which produces a series of rings known as the Airy pattern.

In the case of a circular aperture, the minima (dark rings) occur at specific angles. The first minimum is the first dark ring outside the central bright spot. I think the formula for the angular position of these minima involves something with the wavelength and the radius of the aperture.

Wait, the apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular N-gon, the apothem 'a' is related to the radius 'R' of the circumscribed circle. But if N is very large, the apothem approaches the radius of the circle, right? Because the polygon becomes a circle, so the apothem a would be equal to the radius R of the circle. So in this case, R = a.

So the problem reduces to finding the angular distance between the first two minima for a circular aperture with radius a.

I remember that for a circular aperture, the minima occur at angles θ where the path difference between light diffracted from the edges is an integer multiple of the wavelength. Specifically, the condition for the minima (destructive interference) is given by:

a * sinθ = m * λ, where m is an integer (m=1,2,3,...). But wait, wait, I think that's for the primary minima. Or is it for the first minimum when m=1?

Wait no, I think the first minimum for a circular aperture is when m=1. So the formula is a sinθ ≈ a θ (since θ is small) equals m λ. So for the first minimum, m=1,
