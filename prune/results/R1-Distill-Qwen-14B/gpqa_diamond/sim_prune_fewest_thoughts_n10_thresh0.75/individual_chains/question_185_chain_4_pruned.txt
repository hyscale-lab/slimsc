Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Let me read it again carefully.

The Hamiltonian is given as H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n. Sigma is the vector of Pauli spin matrices, and n is an arbitrary unit vector. Epsilon is an energy constant. I need to find the eigenvalues of H.

Hmm, I remember that the Pauli spin matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. So when they write sigma·n, that's like sigma_x n_x plus sigma_y n_y plus sigma_z n_z, right? And since n is a unit vector, n_x squared plus n_y squared plus n_z squared equals 1.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices, each with trace zero and determinant -1. The dot product sigma·n would therefore be a 2x2 matrix. The Hamiltonian H is this matrix multiplied by epsilon.

Eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation. For a 2x2 matrix, that's determinant of (H - lambda I) equals zero.

But wait, sigma·n is a matrix. Let me think about what the eigenvalues of sigma·n would be without the epsilon. Because when you have a scalar multiplied by a matrix, the eigenvalues just get scaled by that scalar. So if I can find the eigenvalues of sigma·n, then multiplying them by epsilon will give me the eigenvalues of H.

So, what's the trace and determinant of sigma·n? The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. Each Pauli matrix, like sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z, has trace zero. Because, for example, sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so trace is 0. Similarly for sigma_y and sigma_z. So sigma·n is a sum of these matrices scaled by n_x, n_y, n_z, respectively. Hence, the trace of sigma·n is n_x*Tr(sigma_x) + n_y*Tr(sigma_y) + n_z*Tr(sigma_z) which is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.

The determinant of sigma·n... Hmm, each Pauli matrix has determinant -1, right? Because sigma_x^2 is the identity matrix, so determinant is 1, but wait, no, sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so determinant is (0)(0) - (1)(1) = -1. So sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z each have determinant -1.

But sigma·n is a sum of these matrices. How does that affect the determinant? Wait, but for any 2x2 matrix A, the determinant of A is (Tr(A)^2 - Tr(A^2)) / 2. Since Tr(A) is zero in this case, the determinant is (-Tr(A^2))/2.

So what's A squared for A = sigma·n? Let me compute A^2. A^2 = (sigma·n)^2. Let's expand that. (sigma·n)(sigma·n) = sigma·n · sigma·n.

Wait, sigma·n is a vector of matrices, so when you multiply them, you have to consider the
