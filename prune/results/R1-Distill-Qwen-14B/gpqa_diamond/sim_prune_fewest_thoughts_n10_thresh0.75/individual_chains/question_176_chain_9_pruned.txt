Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm. The question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence. We need to find the probability of getting a specific outcome: 0 for P and -1 for Q.

First, I remember that when you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of the corresponding operator. So, the state after measuring P will be an eigenstate of P, and then measuring Q will be done on that new state.

The initial state is given as a column vector with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but wait, in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors in a Hilbert space, but they also need to be normalized. Let me check: the norm of the vector is the square root of the sum of the squares of the components. So, (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, and 1^2 is 1. Adding them up gives 6. So the norm is sqrt(6). That means the state is not normalized. Oh, but wait, sometimes in problems, people don't normalize the state because the probability calculations will take care of it. Hmm, I'll proceed keeping that in mind.

The operator P has a specific matrix. Let me write it down. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm, that looks a bit like a symmetric matrix. Now, operator Q is diagonal: first row is 1, 0, 0; second row is 0, 0, 0; third row is 0, 0, -1. So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

The question asks for the probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1. Wait, no, actually, it's the probability of getting P=0 and then Q=-1 in the respective measurements. So first measuring P gives 0, then the state collapses to an eigenstate of P corresponding to 0. Then measuring Q on that state gives -1. So the overall probability is the product of the probability of the first event (
