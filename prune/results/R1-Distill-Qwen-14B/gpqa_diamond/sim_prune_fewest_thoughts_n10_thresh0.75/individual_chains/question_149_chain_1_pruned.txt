Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my spectroscopy, but let's think through this.

So, the scenario is that I analyzed a small peptidic compound. The 1H NMR shows everything as expected except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar shifts and equal integrals adding up to 1H. And the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Oh right, because if it were coupling, the peaks would split each other, leading to a different pattern like a doublet of doublets or something. But since the coupling is ruled out, maybe it's something else causing the doublet.

Then the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum as expected. So same molecular weight, but why two peaks?

Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, if the compound is a precursor, the mass would be different because it's either the starting material before a reaction. But the question says both peaks have the same mass as expected. So the crude compound's peaks have the same mass as the target, so if there's a precursor, it would have a different mass. So A might not be right.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight, so the mass spec would match. In NMR, enantiomers would give the same spectrum because they're mirror images. But wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. Oh wait, no. Enantiomers would have identical NMR spectra, so the integrals and shifts should be the same. But here, we have two peaks with similar shifts but same integral. But wait, if it's a racemic mix, the NMR would show same as pure because the signals average. So this doesn't fit. So B is probably not the answer.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond formation. Double coupling... like maybe if a hydrogen is coupled to two different protons? But wait, the question says we can rule out spin-spin coupling. So it's not that. Also, double coupling in organic reactions usually refers to something else, like when a proton is coupled to two different sets, but that would show as a more complex splitting. I'm not too sure about this option.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties. So in NMR, they would show different shifts because the environments are different. But wait, the question says the two peaks have similar shifts. Hmm. But diastereomers can sometimes have very similar shifts, maybe in certain cases. Also, the integrals add up to 1H. So if you have a mixture of diastereomers where each has an alpha proton, but in each isomer, that proton is split into a doublet because of coupling, but no, the question says the coupling is ruled out. Wait, but the integral adds to 1H, so maybe each isomer contributes a peak for the same proton. Wait, if there are two diastereomers, each with one alpha proton, then in the NMR you would see two separate peaks, each integrating to 0.
