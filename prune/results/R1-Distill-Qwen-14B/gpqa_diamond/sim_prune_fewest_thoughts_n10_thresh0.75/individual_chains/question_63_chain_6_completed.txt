Okay, so I've got this question about the quantum rotation-vibration model, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The molecule is diatomic, made of elements X and Y. The masses are given: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms. The angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The question is about a photon being absorbed to switch the molecule to the next lowest energy state from the fundamental state. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Hmm, so the molecule's modeled using the non-rigid rotor model, which means it accounts for both rotation and vibration. But wait, the question is about the transition when a photon is absorbed, so I think this involves either rotational or vibrational energy levels.

Wait, the initial state is the fundamental state. In the quantum harmonic oscillator model (vibrational), the fundamental state is n=0. The next state would be n=1, but that's a vibrational transition. Alternatively, for rotation, the fundamental state is usually the lowest rotational state, but the question doesn't specify if it's referring to rotation or vibration. But the options are about momentum, which relates to energy via E=pc for photons. So the photon's energy would be the energy difference between two states.

Wait, but the molecule is in the fundamental state. So maybe it's referring to the ground state of the vibration, and the next state is the first excited vibrational state. Because for rotation, the ground state is J=0, and the next is J=1, but I'm not sure if that's involved here.

Alternatively, the question might be combining both rotation and vibration. But the non-rigid rotor model usually includes both. Hmm. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which in the rotation-vibration model would be the lowest energy state, so both rotation and vibration are in their ground states. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be either a transition to the next vibrational level (n=1) from n=0, or the next rotational level (J=1) from J=0, whichever requires less energy.

I need to calculate the energy differences for both and see which transition is lower. Because the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy, it's the transition with the smallest energy increase.

Wait, but the photon needs to be absorbed to switch to the next state. So the energy of the photon must match the energy difference between the current state and the next state.

Let me think about the energy levels for vibration and rotation.

For a diatomic molecule, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. And the vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w. So the total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational parts.

Wait, but the fundamental state would be n=0 and J=0, right? So the energy would be E = (0 + 1/2) h w + B * 0 (0+1) = (1/2) h w.

The next state with the lowest possible energy would be either increasing n to 1 (vibrational transition) or increasing J to 1 (rotational transition). Which one requires less energy? Let's calculate the energy differences.

The rotational energy when J=1 is E_rot = B * 1*(1+1)= 2B. So the energy difference from J=0 to J=1 is 2B.

The vibrational energy when n=1 is E_vib = (1 + 1/2) h w - (0 + 1/2) h w = h w.

So the photon's energy needs to match the smaller of these two. So which is smaller: h w or 2B?

Wait, I need to compute B. The rotational constant B is given by B = (h)/(8 pi^2 c I), where I is the moment of inertia. I = mu R^2, where mu is the reduced mass, and R is the bond length.

Let me compute mu first. The reduced mass mu is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu, so mu = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = approximately 1.818 amu.

Wait, 20 + 2 is 22, so mu is 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, atomic mass units (amu) need to be converted into kilograms. 1 amu is about 1.660539e-27 kg. So mu is approximately 1.818 * 1.660539e-27 kg.

Calculating that: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

I is mu R^2. R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

I = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2072e-46 kg m^2.

Now, B = h/(8 pi^2 c I). Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J s. c is the speed of light, about 3e8 m/s.

Let's compute denominator: 8 pi^2 c I.

8 pi^2 ≈ 8 * (9.8696) ≈ 78.957.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So denominator: 78.957 * 3e8 m/s * 1.2072e-46 kg m^2.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

8 pi^2 c I = 78.957 * 3e8 * 1.2072e-46.

Wait, no: denominator is 8 pi^2 c I, which is 78.957 * 3e8 * (1.2072e-46) kg m^2/s.

Wait, no:

Wait, denominator is 8 pi^2 * c * I.

I is in kg m^2. c is m/s. So 8 pi^2 c I would have units (m/s) * (kg m^2) ) = kg m^3/s.

But B is in cm^-1 or energy units? Wait, no, rotational energy is in terms of B, which has units of cm^-1 when expressed as wavenumbers, but here perhaps I should compute it in terms of Joules.

Wait, no, B is in Joules. Let me compute B.

So B = h / (8 pi^2 c I).

Plugging numbers:

h = 6.626e-34 J s

I = 1.2072e-46 kg m^2.

So denominator: 8 pi^2 c I = 78.957 * 3e8 m/s * 1.2072e-46 kg m^2.

Wait, 78.957 * 3e8 = approx 2.3687e10.

Multiply by 1.2072e-46: 2.3687e10 * 1.2072e-46 = approximately 2.863e-36.

So denominator is 2.863e-36 kg m^3/s.

B = h / denominator = 6.626e-34 / 2.863e-36.

Dividing 6.626e-34 by 2.863e-36: 6.626 / 2.863 ≈ 2.313, and 1e-34 /1e-36 = 1e2. So 2.313 * 1e2 = 231.3.

So B ≈ 231.3 J.

Wait, wait that can't be right. Because J is the unit of energy. So if B is 231 J, that's a lot. But for rotational energy levels, B is usually on the order of cm^-1, but perhaps not. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the units. I think I might have messed up the formula.

Wait, the rotational constant B is usually given by B = ħ²/(2I), but that's for the rotational energy in terms of J. Alternatively, another formula is B = (h)/(8 π² c I). Let me confirm this.

Wait, I might have confused the formula. Another formula for rotational energy levels is E_rot = B J (J + 1), where B is in cm^-1. B is related to the rotational constant, which is given in terms of the moment of inertia.

Wait, maybe I should calculate B in terms of cm^-1. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy E_rot in terms of Joules.

Let me think again. The rotational constant B is given by B = h/(8 pi^2 c I), but wait, I think I made a mistake in the formula. Because the moment of inertia I is in kg m^2, and when you plug into that formula, B would have units of s^-1. Because h has units of J s, and I is kg m^2, so denominator is kg m^2 * m/s = kg m^3/s. So h / denominator would be J s / (kg m^3/s) ) = J s^2/(kg m^3). Hmm, maybe the formula is wrong. Maybe I should use the simplified version.

Wait, another approach: The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1))/(2 I). So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is E_rot = (ħ² * 2)/(2 I) - 0 = ħ²/(I).

So the energy difference for rotation is ħ² / I.

Similarly, the vibrational energy difference is h w, since it's from n=0 to n=1.

So I can compute both and see which is smaller.

So let me compute ħ²/I.

Hmm, ħ is h/(2 pi), so ħ² is h²/(4 pi²).

I is 1.2072e-46 kg m^2.

So ħ²/I = ( (6.626e-34)^2 ) / (4 pi^2 * 1.2072e-46 kg m^2 )

Let me compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

Denominator: 4 pi² * 1.2072e-46 = 4 * 9.8696 * 1.2072e-46 ≈ 4 * 11.905e-46 = 47.62e-46 ≈ 4.762e-45.

So ħ²/I = (4.39e-67) / (4.762e-45) ) = approx 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, 4.39 /4.762 is about 0.921, and 1e-67 / 1e-45 = 1e-22. So 0.921e-22 = 9.21e-23 J.

So the energy required for rotational transition (J=0→1) is ~9e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference is h w. h is 6.626e-34 J s, w is 4e14 rad/s.

So E_vib = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Comparing the two: 9.21e-23 J (rotational) vs 2.65e-19 J (vibrational). So the rotational transition requires much less energy. Therefore, the molecule can absorb a photon with energy corresponding to the rotational transition.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state, implying both rotational and vibrational ground states. So the next state with the lowest energy would be the first rotational state (J=1), since that requires less energy than the first vibrational state.

So the photon must supply the energy difference of approximately 9.21e-23 J.

But the options are in terms of momentum (p), not energy. So I need to relate the energy of the photon to its momentum.

Since the photon's energy E_photon = p c, where c is the speed of light (approx 3e8 m/s). So p = E_photon / c.

So E_photon = ħ²/(I) = 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, no, wait. The energy difference is 9.21e-23 J, so the photon's energy must be E_photon = 9.21e-23 J.

So p = (9.21e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but none of the options are around 3e-31. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) 1.9e-28 Ns
B) 2.3e-27 Ns
C) 1.1e-27 Ns
D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, wait, units are Ns, which is kg m/s, so p is in kg m/s.

Wait, 3.07e-31 kg m/s is 3.07e-31 N s.

Looking at the options, the closest is D) 1.4e-28 Ns, but that's much larger than our calculated value. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in my calculations?

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of B again, maybe I messed up earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy for the rotational transition is in the microwave region, and the vibrational in infrared, but the question is about which transition is possible with the least energy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in choosing between the rotational and vibrational transitions. Because the problem states that the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model, which might imply that it's considering both rotation and vibration. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the Raman transition, which involves simultaneous rotational and vibrational changes. But that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the vibrational energy, as that's a higher energy transition, but the question is about the next possible state. Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to consider the fundamental state as having both vibrational and rotational in ground state, and the next state being a transition to the first vibrational state. Because in some contexts, the 'fundamental' state refers to the vibrational ground state, and the next state is the first vibrational excited state.

Wait, but earlier calculation showed that the rotational transition requires less energy. So why would the photon be absorbed for a higher energy transition?

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Let me recalculate B. Let's go through it again step by step.

Reduced mass mu = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 * 2)/(22) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert mu to kg: 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

Bond length R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

Moment of inertia I = mu * R^2 = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m^2.

Now, B = h/(8 pi^2 c I).

h is 6.626e-34 J s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So denominator: 8 pi^2 c I = 8 * (pi^2) * 3e8 * 1.207e-46.

Calculate 8 * pi^2: 8 * (approx 9.8696) = 78.9568.

Multiply by 3e8: 78.9568 * 3e8 ≈ 2.3687e10.

Multiply by I =1.207e-46: 2.3687e10 * 1.207e-46 ≈ 2.863e-36.

So denominator is 2.863e-36.

B = 6.626e-34 / 2.863e-36 ≈ (6.626 / 2.863) * 1e2.

6.626 / 2.863 ≈ 2.313. So B ≈ 231.3 J.

Wait, that's a huge value for B. That can't be right because in rotational spectroscopy, B is on the order of 1e-23 J or so. Did I mess up the formula?

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is B = ħ^2/(2 I), which would make more sense. Let me compute that.

B = (h/(2 pi))^2 / (2 I) = h²/(4 pi² * 2 I) = h²/(8 pi² I).

Wait, no, that's the same as the previous formula. Oh, no, because I think I missed a factor.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are given by E = (ħ² J (J+1))/(2I), so the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is (2 ħ²)/(2I) ) = ħ²/I.

So perhaps E = ħ²/(I) = (h²/(4 pi² I)).

Wait, let me compute that.

h is 6.626e-34 J s.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J² s².

Divide by (4 pi² I): 4 pi² is about 39.478.

So denominator: 39.478 * 1.207e-46 = 47.6e-46 = 4.76e-45.

So E = 4.39e-67 / 4.76e-45 ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

So that's the same result as before, about 9.22e-23 J.

So the rotational transition requires this energy. Now, the vibrational transition is E = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So the rotational transition is much lower in energy. So the photon's energy must be about 9.22e-23 J.

The momentum p is given by E = p c, so p = E/(c).

c is 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.22e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Which is 3.07e-31 Ns (since 1 Ns = 1 kg m/s).

Looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns → 1.9e-28 kg m/s. Larger by several orders than our calculation.

B) 2.3e-27 Ns → even larger.

C) 1.1e-27 Ns → 1.1e-27 kg m/s.

D) 1.4e-28 Ns → 1.4e-28 kg m/s.

Hmm, none of these match 3.07e-31 Ns. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe the question isn't about the rotational transition. Maybe it's about the vibrational transition. Because the vibrational energy is much higher, but perhaps the question is about the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational state, and the next state is the first vibrational state, so the photon's energy would be h w.

Let me compute p for that. E = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 ≈ 8.83e-28 kg m/s → 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, none exactly match, but option A is 1.9e-28, which is about a fifth of this. Option D is 1.4e-28, about half.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking about which transition is considered. Because the fundamental state (n=0) in vibration would require the photon to have energy h w to go to n=1.

But earlier calculation shows that the rotational transition is lower. But perhaps the question is only considering the rotational state. Wait, the question says the molecule is modeled as a non-rigid rotor, which includes vibrations. So maybe the correct model is that the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (n=0) and ground rotational state (J=0), and the next state with the lowest energy is J=1. So the energy difference is about 9e-23 J.

But the options don't have anything near 3e-31 Ns. So perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state, but considering that the rotational and vibrational states are considered together. So perhaps the next state is a combination of J=1 and n=0, which is lower in energy than n=1 and J=0.

Wait, that would make sense. Because the energy needed for J=1 would be about 9e-23 J, which is much lower than the vibrational transition.

So the photon's momentum would be 3e-31 kg m/s, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me check again.

Wait, alternative approach: Perhaps B is in terms of cm^-1. Because in spectroscopy, rotational constants are often given in wavenumbers (cm^-1). So perhaps I should compute B in cm^-1.

B (in cm^-1) is given by B = h/(8 pi^2 c I), but with c in cm/s.

Wait, let me recalculate B with c in cm/s.

c = 3e8 m/s = 3e10 cm/s.

I = 1.207e-46 kg m^2.

Wait, but to compute B in cm^-1, the formula is:

B (cm^-1) = (h / (8 pi^2 I)) / c,

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula B = h/(8 pi^2 c I), but with I in g cm^2. Because sometimes constants are expressed in cgs units.

Wait, perhaps I should convert I into g cm^2. Let me do that.

I = 1.207e-46 kg m^2.

1 kg = 1000 g, so I = 1.207e-46 kg *1e3 g/kg * (1e2 cm/m)^2.

Wait, 1 m = 100 cm, so (1 m)^2 = (100 cm)^2 = 1e4 cm^2.

So I = 1.207e-46 kg *1e3 g/kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, no, perhaps better to compute I in g cm^2.

I = mu R^2. mu is 20/22 amu =1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-24 grams. So mu = 1.818 *1.6605e-24 g ≈3.018e-24 g.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-8 cm.

So I = mu * R^2 = 3.018e-24 g * (2e-8 cm)^2.

(2e-8 cm)^2 =4e-16 cm^2.

So I = 3.018e-24 g * 4e-16 cm^2 = 1.207e-40 g cm^2.

Now, B (in cm^-1) is given by B = h/(8 pi^2 c I), where h is Planck's constant in erg s.

h = 6.626e-27 erg s.

c =3e10 cm/s.

So B = (6.626e-27 erg s) / (8 pi^2 *3e10 cm/s * 1.207e-40 g cm^2 )

Wait, 8 pi^2 is about 78.956.

Compute denominator: 78.956 *3e10 *1.207e-40.

78.956 *3 = approx 236.87.

236.87e10 *1.207e-40 = 236.87 *1.207e-30 = approx 286e-30 = 2.86e-28.

So denominator is 2.86e-28 erg cm.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it more accurately.

Denominator: 8 pi² c I = 78.956 * 3e10 cm/s * 1.207e-40 g cm².

Wait, so:

78.956 *3e10 = 2.36868e12.

Multiply by 1.207e-40: 2.36868e12 *1.207e-40 = 2.863e-28.

So denominator is 2.863e-28 erg cm.

Wait, no, the units are (cm/s * g cm^2) = (g cm^3/s).

But B is in cm^-1, so let's see.

Wait, the formula gives B in cm^-1.

So, B = 6.626e-27 erg s / (2.863e-28 erg cm) )

Erg s / erg cm = s/cm.

So B = 6.626e-27 / 2.863e-28 = approx 23.13 cm^-1.

So B is about 23 cm^-1.

Which is about 23 cm^-1. That makes sense for a rotational constant.

Now, the energy difference for rotational transition (from J=0 to J=1) is 2B, because E_rot = B J (J+1). So delta E = 2B.

So delta E = 2 * 23 cm^-1 = 46 cm^-1.

But how does this relate to the photon's energy?

Each cm^-1 corresponds to about 1.986e-23 J. So 46 cm^-1 * 1.986e-23 J/cm^-1 ≈ 9.13e-22 J.

Wait, so the energy needed is about 9e-22 J.

p = E/c = 9e-22 J /3e8 m/s = 3e-30 kg m/s = 3e-30 N s.

Again, none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the question refers to the transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the first excited vibrational state (n=1, J=0). So the photon's energy is E = h w.

h w = 6.626e-34 Js *4e14 rad/s = 2.65e-19 J.

So p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A (1.9e-28) and option D (1.4e-28). Hmm, 8.8e-28 is about 5 times larger than option B (2.3e-27 is 23e-28, which is even larger) and 8 times larger than option C (1.1e-27 is 11e-28). Wait, no: 8.8e-28 is 0.88e-27, so it's between option C (1.1e-27) and D (1.4e-28).

Wait, but none of the options exactly match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the next possible state, which could be a combination of J and n. But that's more complicated, and the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So it's the transition requiring the least energy, which is the rotational.

But earlier calculations for E_rot are about 9e-23 J, leading to p=3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the rotational energy. Maybe I should use the rigid rotor model's energy levels.

Wait, the rigid rotor model's energy levels are E_J = (ħ²/(2I)) J(J+1).

So the difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2*(ħ²/(2I)) )= ħ²/(I).

Which is what I did earlier.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the fundamental vibrational state (n=0) and the next vibrational state (n=1), which would require photon energy h w.

So E_photon = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 Ns.

But none of the options match. The closest is option A (1.9e-28) and option D (1.4e-28). Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a factor. Let's recheck the calculation of E_photon for the vibrational transition.

E_photon = h w = 6.626e-34 Js * 4e14 s^-1 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E_photon / c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = approx 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 → 1.9e-28 kg m/s.

C)1.1e-27 → 1.1e-27 kg m/s =11e-28.

Hmm, 8.8e-28 is between A and C, but not exactly matching any.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the transition from J=0 to J=1 when in the vibrational ground state.

Hmm, but I've tried both approaches, and the numbers don't match the options. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational constant in terms of frequency, not energy.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), where B is in terms of energy (Joules). So E_J = B J (J+1).

But B is ħ²/(2I).

Wait, let me compute B again.

I =1.207e-46 kg m^2.

ħ is h/(2pi) = 6.626e-34/(2pi) ≈ 1.055e-34 J s.

So ħ² = (1.055e-34)^2 ≈ 1.113e-68 J² s².

So B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.113e-68)/(2 *1.207e-46) = 1.113e-68 / 2.414e-46 ≈ 4.61e-23 J.

So the energy difference for J=0 → J=1 is 2B = 9.22e-23 J.

So the photon energy is 9.22e-23 J. So p = 9.22e-23 /3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Again, no matching option.

Wait, but the options are in the range of 1e-27 to 2e-27. That's much larger than my calculated 3e-31.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the question's units. Wait, the bond length is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. But perhaps it's 2e-8 cm, which would change I.

Wait, no. 1 angstrom is 1e-8 cm, so 2 angstroms is 2e-8 cm. So when I computed I earlier, I used R in cm.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of I. Let me recompute I correctly.

I = mu R^2.

mu is 3.018e-27 kg.

R is 2e-10 m → 2e-10 m.

So R^2 is 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.018e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.207e-46 kg m². That part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B when using the formula with c in m/s.

Wait, another approach: compute the rotational energy in terms of frequency.

The rotational energy levels are E_J = h c B J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1.

Wait, because B (cm^-1) is about 23 cm^-1, so E_J = h c B J (J+1).

h c is 1.986e-25 J cm.

So E_J =1.986e-25 * 23 * J (J+1).

For J=1, E_rot =1.986e-25 *23 *2 = 9.13e-24 J.

Which is about 9e-24 J, as before.

So p = E/c =9.13e-24 /3e8 = 3.04e-32 kg m/s.

Even smaller, but still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from n=0 (vibrational) to n=1, which requires E = h w.

So p = (h w)/c = (6.626e-34 *4e14)/3e8.

Let me compute that again.

6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

Divide by 3e8: 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

So 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option C is 1.1e-27 Ns, which is 11e-28, and option A is 1.9e-28.

Hmm, 8.8e-28 isn't an option, but option D is 1.4e-28, which is 1.4e-28 Ns.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h w. Let me check:

h =6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E = h *w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

Yes, that's correct.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s.

But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the first vibrational state (n=1, J=0), which would require energy h w.

Alternatively, another possibility: the question refers to the transition to the next state, which could be a combination of rotation and vibration, but that's more complex and I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the rotational transition, but I'm miscalculating something.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy in terms of the vibrational and rotational contributions and find the smallest possible.

But I've already determined that the rotational transition is much lower in energy than the vibrational.

So why isn't that matching any options?

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the first vibrational state (n=1, J=0), but that would require the vibrational energy. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the first excited state as the first rotational state.

But the options don't match either way.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look at the options and see if any of them correspond to either the rotational or vibrational transition.

Earlier, for the rotational transition, p is about 3e-31 kg m/s, which is 3e-31 Ns. None of the options are close to that.

For the vibrational transition, p is about 8.8e-28 Ns. Option D is 1.4e-28, which is about 1/6th of that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the vibrational energy. Let me check again.

E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Yes.

p = E/c =2.6504e-19 /3e8 = 8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

So 8.83e-28 Ns.

No option exactly matches this. The closest is option D: 1.4e-28 Ns, which is about 1/6th of 8.8e-28.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. The problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. So the next state is the first excited vibrational state. So p should be 8.8e-28 Ns, but there's no option for that.

Wait, looking back, perhaps the question is about the transition from J=0 to J=1, but the energy is 2B. So E=2B= 2*23 cm^-1 * 1.986e-23 J/cm^-1 =46*1.986e-23 =9.11e-22 J.

p=9.11e-22 /3e8 =3.04e-30 kg m/s → 3.04e-30 Ns. Still not matching options.

Hmm. I'm stuck, but perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option C:1.1e-27 Ns.

Wait, 1.1e-27 Ns is 1.1e-27 kg m/s.

E = p c =1.1e-27 *3e8 =3.3e-19 J.

Which would correspond to a vibrational energy of about 3.3e-19 J, but w is 4e14 rad/s. Let me compute E: h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J. So 3.3e-19 is a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option B:2.3e-27 Ns.

E =2.3e-27 *3e8 =6.9e-19 J.

Which would be about 6.9e-19 J. But h w is 2.65e-19 J, so this doesn't add up.

Hmm. I'm not sure. Based on the calculations, the rotational transition would require a photon with momentum about 3e-31 Ns, but that's not an option. The vibrational transition requires 8.8e-28 Ns, which is also not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state considering both rotational and vibrational changes, but that's beyond the scope of the given information.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the photon's momentum when the molecule absorbs a photon to go to the next vibrational state, which would be option D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me recheck.

I think the mistake might be in the calculation of B. Earlier, I found B ≈ 231 J, which can't be right because B should be on the order of 1e-23 J. But when I computed B using the formula with I in g cm², I got B≈23 cm^-1, which is reasonable.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of frequency.

The rotational energy for J=1 is E_rot = h c B J (J+1).

h c is 1.986e-25 J cm.

B is 23 cm^-1.

J=1: E_rot =1.986e-25 *23 *2 =9.13e-24 J.

So p = E_rot/c =9.13e-24 /3e8 =3.04e-32 kg m/s.

Which is 3.04e-32 Ns. Still no matching option.

I'm stuck. I think the intended answer is option C:1.1e-27 Ns. But I'm not confident.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the rotational and vibrational energy differences.

### Key Information:
- **Masses**: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}, M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
- **Bond length**: \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
- **Angular frequency**: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)
- **Reduced mass**: \( \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = 1.818 \, \text{amu} \)
- \( 1 \, \text{amu} = 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \), so \( \mu = 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)
- **Moment of inertia**: \( I = \mu R^2 = (3.018 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \)

### Rotational Energy:
The rotational energy levels are given by:
\[
E_{\text{rot}} = B J (J+1), \quad B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I}
\]
where \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} = 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s} \). Substituting:
\[
B = \frac{(1.055 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \cdot 1.207 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.61 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
\]
The energy difference for a transition from \( J=0 \) to \( J=1 \) is:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
\]
The corresponding photon momentum is:
\[
p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s} = 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}
\]
This value is far smaller than any of the provided options.

### Vibrational Energy:
The vibrational energy levels are given by:
\[
E_{\text{vib}} = (n + \frac{1}{2}) h \omega
\]
For a transition from \( n=0 \) to \( n=1 \), the energy difference is:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
\]
The corresponding photon momentum is:
\[
p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s} = 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}
\]
This value is also not directly matched by the options, but it is closer to the range of the given choices.

### Comparison of Options:
- **Option A**: \( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)
- **Option B**: \( 2.3 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)
- **Option C**: \( 1.1 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)
- **Option D**: \( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)

The calculated vibrational momentum (\( 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)) is closest to **Option D** (\( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)), though it is not an exact match. Given the options, **Option C** (\( 1.1 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)) is the most reasonable choice based on the vibrational transition.

### Conclusion:
The photon's momentum required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy is best approximated by **Option C**.
