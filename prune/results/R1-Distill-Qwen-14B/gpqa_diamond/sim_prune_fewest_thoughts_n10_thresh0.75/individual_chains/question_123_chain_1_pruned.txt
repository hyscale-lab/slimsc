Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's see what I can remember.

Alright, the question says that the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. So, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, that's a pretty high speed. I remember that at such velocities, relativistic effects might come into play. Oh, but wait, the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, so I don't have to worry about those complicating factors. Just pure kinematics, probably with special relativity involved.

The question is asking, when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's reference frame, how much distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame? Oh, so it's a matter of time dilation maybe, because the two frames are moving relative to each other.

Let me think. If the ejecta's frame is S', and the Galaxy's frame is S, then according to the problem, in S' (the ejecta's frame), the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So, the relative speed between S and S' is 60,000 km/s. Wait, noâ€”wait, the problem states that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at that speed. So, the speed between the two frames is v = 60,000 km/s.

But wait, in relativity, the speed between two inertial frames is the same as seen from both frames, right? Because if S' is moving at v as per S, then S would appear to be moving at -v in S'. So, the relative speed is 60,000 km/s in each other's frames.

So, the time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame (S'). I need to find how much distance the ejecta has moved in the Galaxy's frame (S) during that time. But wait, in S, the ejecta is moving towards the center, so we're to find the distance it travels in S's frame over the time that has passed in S'.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says: when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta (S') frame, what is the distance the ejecta
