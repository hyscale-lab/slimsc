Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the potentials in electromagnetism. Hmm, I need to find the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a certain point and time. Let me think.

The setup: There's a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and there's another vector d which is from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. The velocity of the charge at the generating time tr is v. And I need to find V and A at time t, where t is after tr.

Wait, right, because the electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light. So the field at time t is due to the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr, which is such that the light takes time (t - tr) to reach from the charge's position to the observation point r. So tr would be t - (distance)/(c), but maybe I don't need to get into that right now.

I remember that the potentials are solutions to Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential V is related to the electric field E, and the vector potential A is related to the magnetic field B.

The scalar potential V is usually given by something like Coulomb's law, but considering retarded times. The vector potential comes from the current due to the charge's motion.

Wait, let me think about the expressions. The scalar potential V for a point charge is typically (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/r, where r is the distance from the charge to the point where the potential is being measured. But wait, since the charge is moving, we have to consider the retarded position. So the distance here is d, which is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So the magnitude of d is the actual distance at the time the field was generated, but for the potential at later time t, it's the same d as the separation.

Wait, no. The scalar potential is V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r')], where r' is the distance at the retarded time. But in this problem, d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, so the distance is |d|. So V would be (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/
