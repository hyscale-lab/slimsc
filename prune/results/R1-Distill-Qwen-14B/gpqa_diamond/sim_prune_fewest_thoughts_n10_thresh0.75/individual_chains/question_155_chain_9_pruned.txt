Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. We have a system in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z.

So, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I need to find the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared, then compute this.

Wait, but wait. Since the state is given, I can compute these expectation values directly. But first, I need to make sure about the operator P_z and how it acts on the state.

Looking at the matrix form of P_z:

P_z matrix is:
[ ħ   0    0 ]
[ 0   0    0 ]
[ 0   0  -ħ ]

So it's a diagonal matrix because the basis vectors are eigenvectors of P_z. The eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ for each diagonal element.

The state vector is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. But wait, I should check if this is a normalized vector. Let's compute the norm: (-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. So it's normalized. Good.

Now, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is ψ† P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, the expectation value is the sum of each component squared multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

Let me write the components as ψ₁, ψ₂, ψ₃.

So ψ₁ = -1/2, ψ₂ = 1/√2, ψ₃ = -1/2.

Each component squared is |ψ_i|². So,

⟨P_z⟩ = (|ψ₁|² * ħ) + (|ψ₂|² * 0) + (|ψ₃|² * (-ħ)).

Compute each term:

|ψ₁|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 → 1/4 * ħ = ħ/4.

|ψ₂|² = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2 → 1/2 * 0 = 0.

|ψ₃|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 → 1/4 * (-ħ) = -ħ/4.

Adding these: ħ/4 + (-ħ/4) = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is 0.

Now, for ⟨P_z²⟩
