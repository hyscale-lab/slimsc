Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm not entirely sure where to start, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting from compound A and ending with compound E. My goal is to identify what compound E is from the given options. The question also provides some hints, which I'll need to consider carefully.

First, let's outline the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints provided:

a) When compound A is reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of compound A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while compound E's IR has a strong peak around 1715 cm^-1.

Okay, let's start by analyzing the information given in hint a). The reaction of compound A with a phosphorous ylide gives 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes by reacting with ylides. So, compound A must be a carbonyl compound because that's what the Wittig reaction targets.

Looking at the product of the Wittig reaction: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The structure here is a cyclopentane ring with substituents. Let me try to draw this mentally. The cyclopentane ring has methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, and a propan-2-ylidene group at position 4. Propan-2-ylidene is a group like CH2-C(CH3)= which would make it an alkylidene group attached to the ring.

Wait, when we form an alkene via Wittig, the ylide adds to the carbonyl, so the carbonyl group (C=O) becomes a CH2 group connected to the new double bond. So, the product's structure suggests that the starting carbonyl compound (compound A) must have been a cyclic ketone because the Wittig product is an alkene in the ring.

Hmm, so compound A is a cyclic ketone. Let's think about the structure. The product is a cyclopentane with substituents, so the starting ketone would have been a cyclopentanone derivative.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the substituents on the ring are methyl at positions 1 and 2, and the propan-2-ylidene group is at position 4. The propan
