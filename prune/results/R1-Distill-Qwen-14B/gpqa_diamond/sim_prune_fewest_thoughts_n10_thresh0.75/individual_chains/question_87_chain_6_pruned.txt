Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbons in total. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to pick the correct 1H NMR data from the options given.

First, I need to figure out what the structure of the compound could be. Let's break down the information.

The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. So, two substituents on the benzene. The ring itself has 6 carbons, but the total is 8. That means the substituents contribute 2 more carbons. Wait, noâ€”wait, wait. Wait, if the benzene is 6 carbons, and the substituents add 2 carbons, but the total is 8. So each substituent adds one carbon each? Hmm, no, wait. Let me think. The benzene has 6 carbons. Each substituent is attached to the ring. So, for example, if each substituent is a methyl group, that would be 6 + 2*1 =8. But wait, wait, wait. No. Wait, the substituents are attached to the ring, so their carbons are part of the substituent, not the ring. So the benzene is 6 carbons, substituents add 2 more, making total 8. So substituents must be two groups each with 1 carbon, or one substituent with two carbons.

But wait, the question says it's di-substituted. So two substituents, each could have 1 carbon. So, for example, two methyl groups. But wait, but we have a carbonyl and a halogen. So the substituents must include a carbonyl group and a halogen.

Wait, no. Because the IR shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So in the structure, the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen atom. Oh wait, wait. The carbonyl group could be part of a substituent. For example, a ketone, or an aldehyde, or a carboxylic acid, etc.

Wait,
