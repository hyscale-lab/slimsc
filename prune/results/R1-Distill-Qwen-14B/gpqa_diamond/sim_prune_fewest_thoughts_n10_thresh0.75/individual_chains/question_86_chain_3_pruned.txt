Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents. The first reaction uses LiBH4 and H+ as reagents, and the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The second reaction uses BH3 and H+, and the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. We need to figure out what the starting materials A and B are from the given options.

Hmm, okay. I remember that reducing agents like LiBH4 and BH3 are typically used in the reduction of carbonyl groups. Wait, but LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. Oh wait, no, actually, BH3 is a stronger reducing agent when it comes to ketals and such. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing that up.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and is commonly used to reduce ketones and aldehydes to their corresponding alcohols. BH3, especially when used as BH3Â·THF (tetrahydrofuran), is also a reducing agent. But I think BH3 is a milder reducing agent compared to LiAlH4, but maybe in some contexts it's different. Oh wait, another thought: sometimes when it's about ketals or acetals, BH3 might be used for specific reductions, like in the case of epoxides or perhaps in the opening of epoxides. Or maybe in the context of the reduction of a hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, but looking at the product, it's a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That's a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar. Wait, pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen, right? Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would be a cyclic ether with a ketone at position 2. So the structure would be a five-membered ring? Wait, no, pyran is six-membered. So 2H-pyran-2-one is a cyclic ketone. So the structure is a six-membered ring with an oxygen, and a ketone group at position 2.

Wait, but the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H
