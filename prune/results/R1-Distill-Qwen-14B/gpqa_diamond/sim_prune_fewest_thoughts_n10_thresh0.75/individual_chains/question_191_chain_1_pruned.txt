Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, the question involves several reaction steps, and I need to track the structure through each step to find out what product 4 is. Let me start by breaking down each step.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. I can imagine the structure: a cyclohexanone ring with substituents at the 3 and 5 positions. The 3 position has a hydroxymethyl group (like -CH2OH), and the 5 position has a prop-1-en-2-yl group, which is like a CH2 connected to a double bond—so that's an allyl group attached as CH2-C(CH2) maybe? Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C=CH2, right? So the substituent at C5 is CH2CH2 with a double bond—actually, wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. The prop-1-en-2-yl group would be CH2CH2CH3 where the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the substituent is CH2CH2CH3 with the double bond between the first and second carbons. So it's CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait no, maybe I should draw it. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CH-CH2-, but wait, the structure is actually the substituent is at position 2. So wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2, so the group is CH2=CH-CH2-? No, wait. No, wait: the numbering for propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the group where the point of attachment is the second carbon of propene. So that would be CH2-CH2-CH3 where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached to C2. So the structure is CH2-C(CH2)-, but wait, that's getting a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH2- attached to the ring at the middle carbon. So that's CH2-CH2-CH2 with
