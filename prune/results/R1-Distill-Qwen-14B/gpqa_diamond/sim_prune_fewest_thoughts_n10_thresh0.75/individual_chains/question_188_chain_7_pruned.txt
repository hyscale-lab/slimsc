Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal and finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let's try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that the interplanar distance in a crystal is calculated using the formula derived from the structure of the crystal. For a cubic system, it's straightforward because all the lattice parameters are the same. But rhombohedral is a bit more complex since all the angles are equal but it's not necessarily cubic.

Wait, the question gives me that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, no, interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, but in a crystal structure, that's the lattice parameter 'a' for a cubic system. But rhombohedral has the same lattice parameter 'a' along all axes, but the angles are different. Oh wait, in this case, the angles are all 30 degrees. So this is a special case of a rhombohedral structure where all the angles are equal to 30°, which I think is called a trigonal or maybe a primitive rhombohedral system.

The formula for interplanar spacing (d) in a crystal is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos γ) ) ), but wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the general formula for interplanar distances in a crystal lattice.

Wait, no, the general formula I remember is d_{hkl} = a/(sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) * cosθ )) ), but that's for a cubic system where all angles are 90 degrees. But for non-cubic systems, the formula must be adjusted because the cosines of the angles come into play.

Alternatively, I think the correct formula for any triclinic crystal is:

d^2 = (a^2)(h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ) )^{-1}

Wait, no, wait: for a general triclinic system, the interplanar distance is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares and cross terms involving the cosines of the angles. So the formula is:

d_{h
