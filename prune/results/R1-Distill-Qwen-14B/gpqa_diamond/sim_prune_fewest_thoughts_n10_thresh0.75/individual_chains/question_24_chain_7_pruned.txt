Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question starts by talking about an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Hmm, decolorizing bromine water usually means the mixture has something that can reduce bromine, like unsaturated compounds. So maybe it's alkenes or maybe something else with double bonds, like conjugated dienes or something.

Then, when X is treated with platinum when heated, it forms mixture Y, which is a result of a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation is when an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. So, the same species is acting as both oxidizing and reducing agent. So, for example, in the case of H2O2, it can decompose into H2O and O2, where O is both gaining and losing electrons.

Mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So whatever is in Y doesn't have the ability to reduce bromine. That suggests that Y might have fully saturated bonds, no double bonds or triple bonds, maybe.

Hydrogenation of both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance Z. Z is a certain hydrocarbon, and its mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let me calculate the molecular formula for Z. 

Wait, 14.28% hydrogen by mass. Let's assume the molecular weight is M. So, (mass of H)/(M) = 0.1428. Hydrocarbons are made of C and H. Suppose the formula is CnHm.

But wait, Z is a constituent of Y. Since Y is formed by the disproportionation of X, and X contains two liquids which decolorize bromine (so maybe alkenes), Y is the product after a reaction that breaks down the alkenes into something else. And upon hydrogenation, both X and Y give the same Z.

Wait, but if X and Y hydrogenate to the same thing, that suggests that perhaps X has some unsaturated bonds that, when hydrogenated, become the same as the hydrogenated Y. But Y didn't have the ability to decolorize bromine, so maybe Y is a saturated compound. 

So, let's think: when X is treated with Pt and heat, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction. So maybe some of the alkenes in X are being split into smaller molecules. Like, for example, maybe something like ethylene (ethene) undergoing a reaction to form something else. But wait, ethylene is C2H4. If it disproportionates, what products could it form?

Wait, another thought: maybe X is a mixture of alkenes, and upon heating with Pt, one of them undergoes a reaction. But the problem says it's a mixture of two liquids in equimolar amounts that undergoes disproportionation to give another equimolar mixture Y of two liquids.

Wait, perhaps X is a diene and another molecule. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of two alkenes, one of which is more substituted than the other. But when they undergo disproportionation, maybe one gets hydrogenated and the other perhaps gets something else.

Wait, but the key is that when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z, and Y when hydrogenated also gives Z. So, Z must be a product of hydrogenation of both X and Y. Which suggests that both X and Y have unsaturated bonds that, when hydrogenated, give the same product. Maybe Z is a more saturated compound.

Wait, but Y doesn't have any ability to reduce bromine, so Y must be fully saturated, no double bonds. So, when Y is hydrogenated, since it doesn't have any double bonds, perhaps nothing happens? But the problem says that both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give only Z. So perhaps Z is a product of hydrogenation of X's components, and Y's components are already saturated, so hydrogenation may not do anything. But the problem states that hydrogenation of Y gives Z too, which suggests that Y has some unsaturated bonds, but maybe not enough to decolorize bromine. Hmm, but then why would Y not decolorize bromine? Because perhaps Y's unsaturated bonds are conjugated, which might not react as strongly, but the question says there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X's compounds. Oh wait, the question says "there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X." So X's components have isolated double bonds, perhaps.

Wait, but Y is a product of X's disproportionation, so maybe Y's components have different structures. Let me think about the hydrogenation part. So both X and Y, when hydrogenated, yield Z. That suggests that Z is the fully saturated version of both X and Y's components. So maybe X's components are alkenes, which upon hydrogenation become alkanes (saturated). Y's components might be something else, perhaps with triple bonds or something
