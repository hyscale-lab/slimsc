Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution and the radiation it emits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the charge distribution is spheroid and oscillates, so it radiates at a wavelength λ. We're looking at the radiation zone, and the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, as well as the possible form of f.

Wait, I remember that for dipole radiation, the power radiated depends on the angle θ. The radiation pattern for a dipole is such that the intensity is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the axis (θ=90 degrees) and falls off as you move towards the poles (θ=0 or 180 degrees). Oh, right, the formula for the intensity in dipole radiation is something like proportional to (sinθ)^2, but wait, no, wait. Wait, I think it's more like the intensity varies as sin²θ. Wait, no, wait: no, wait, no: the radiation pattern for a dipole is actually that the intensity is maximum at θ=90 degrees, and the intensity falls off as (sinθ)^2 when θ approaches 0 or 180 degrees.

Wait, no, wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. The dipole radiation pattern in terms of the electric field is maximum in the equatorial plane, meaning θ=90 degrees. The intensity, which is proportional to the square of the electric field, would then have a sin²θ dependence. So the maximum is at θ=90, and the intensity is zero at θ=0 and θ=180. No, wait, actually, the intensity varies as (sinθ)^2, which is maximum at θ=90, and zero at 0 and 180. So for a dipole, the power per unit solid angle is maximum in the equatorial direction.

But wait, the problem says the charge distribution is spheroidal with symmetry along the z-axis. So it's oscillating along the z-axis, I suppose. So the dipole moment would
