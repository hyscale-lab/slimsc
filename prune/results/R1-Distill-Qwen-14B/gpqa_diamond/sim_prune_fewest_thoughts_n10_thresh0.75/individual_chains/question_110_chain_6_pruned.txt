Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. The options are Star1 to Star5, and I have to choose the correct pair from the options given.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations. But the key here is their brightness detection limits. From the question, I see that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, actually, wait: it says "brighter than 17 mag." Wait, in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So, a star with V magnitude less than 17 is brighter than 17. So ESPRESSO can observe stars where V < 17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with V < 16.5, because it's brighter than 16 mag, I think. Wait, the question states: ESPRESSO observes stars with V mag brighter than 17, so V < 17? Or wait, no, because magnitude scale is tricky. Lower magnitudes are brighter, so a star that's brighter than magnitude 17 means it's magnitude is less than 17. So, a star with V magnitude 16 is brighter than 17, so it would be detected by ESPRESSO which can go up to 17. Similarly, HIRES can go up to 16. So, the star must have V mag â‰¤ 16 for HIRES, but wait, the question says "brighter than 16 mag", so V < 16. So for a star to be detected by both, it must have V < 17 (as ESPRESSO requires) and V < 16 (as HIRES requires). Wait, wait, no. Let me get this straight.

Wait, the question says: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So brighter than 17 means apparent V magnitude less than 17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter
