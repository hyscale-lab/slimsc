Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The scenario is about analyzing a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR of the crude compound usually matches what's expected, except there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, they're both integrating to a total of one proton, which is what we expect. The question rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause. That's important because if coupling were the issue, like a doublet of doublets or something, the splitting would be more complex, but maybe not two separate peaks. Hmm.

Then, looking at the LC-MS results. The crude compound was analyzed at elevated temperature, showing two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected molecule. So, the mass is correct, but there are two peaks. What could cause that?

Let me think about the options given:

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, if it's a precursor, the mass would be different. The question says both peaks have the same mass. So probably not this. Because a precursor would have a higher mass, right? Like, the starting material before the last step.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers would have the same molecular weight, so LC-MS would show two peaks if they are present. But in NMR, enantiomers would look identical because NMR can't distinguish them in a racemic mixture. So the NMR would show a single peak because the two enantiomers would average out. But in this case, the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. So this might not explain the NMR part. Unless it's a diastereomer, not enantiomer.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Double coupling might refer to some type of coupling during the reaction, perhaps leading to by-products. But wait, the question says the NMR is consistent except for these two alpha-proton peaks. Alternatively, maybe it's a side reaction? I'm not too sure. I'll have to think more about this.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would show up as separate peaks in both NMR and LC-MS. In NMR, diastereomers would have different chemical shifts. So in the NMR, each diastereomer's protons would split into different peaks, but since each is a diastereomer, their alpha-protons would have slightly different shifts. Wait, but the question says that the two NMR peaks have similar shifts and equal integrals. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. So the same proton in two different environments? Oh, because diastereomers might have the same proton in different environments. So each diastereomer would have a different chemical shift for that alpha-proton. So in the NMR, each would show as a separate peak. But the integrals would add up because each is a different molecule. So if there are two diastereomers, each contributes one peak for the same proton, leading to two peaks in the NMR. That matches the question's scenario.

In the LC-MS part, if there are two diastereomers, they would elute at different times, hence two peaks. The masses would be the same because they have the same molecular formula. So LC-MS would show two peaks of same mass, same intensity if the diastereomers are present in equal amounts.

So, the two peaks in NMR are from two different diastereomers, each contributing a peak for the same proton. So the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but the coupling pattern ruled out spin-spin coupling. So perhaps it's not that the peaks are split due to coupling, but that they're separate due to being in different molecules (like diastereomers). So each molecule contributes its own peak, hence two peaks
