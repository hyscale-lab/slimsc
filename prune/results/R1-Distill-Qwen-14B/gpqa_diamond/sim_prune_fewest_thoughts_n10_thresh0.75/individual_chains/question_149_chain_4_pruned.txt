Okay, so I'm trying to solve this NMR and LC-MS question. Let me read through the problem again and think through what's going on.

The scenario is that there's a small peptidic compound synthesized, and the 1H NMR isn't quite what's expected. The main issue is two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, which is the expected value. Also, it's ruled out that this is due to spin-spin coupling. Then, the LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass, and consistent with the expected molecule.

Hmm. So what could cause two peaks for the same proton in the NMR? Well, if it's not coupling, maybe it's something else. Splitting due to coupling would have different shifts and perhaps a more complex pattern, but that's ruled out. So maybe the molecule is exchanging between different structures, or maybe it's a diastereomer situation.

Wait, the problem mentions the compound is crude. So perhaps it's not pure, but the LC-MS shows two peaks, same mass. Oh, because in LC-MS, if it's a mixture of two isomers, each would have the same molecular weight but different retention times. So same mass, same intensityâ€”maybe they're diastereomers?

Wait, but what about enantiomers? Enantiomers would have same mass, same retention time because they're not chiral in a chiral column? Or wait, no, if the LC column is achiral, then enantiomers might come out together. But if it's a chiral column, they'd separate. But the question says LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity. So if the column is chiral, and they're enantiomers, they'd split into two, each with same mass and same retention time? Or wait, no. Wait, enantiomers have same mass, same physical properties except in chiral environments. So if the LC column is chiral, then the two enantiomers would elute at different times, hence two peaks. But if the column is achiral, they would come out together.

But the question says the LC-MS has two peaks. So, if the LC is using a chiral column, then maybe the sample is a racemic mixture, showing two en
