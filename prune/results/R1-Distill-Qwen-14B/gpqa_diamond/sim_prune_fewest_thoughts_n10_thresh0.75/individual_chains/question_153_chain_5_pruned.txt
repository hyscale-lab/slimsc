Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this Michael addition problem. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, which is also called the electrophilic part. The nucleophile is usually an enolate ion. 

Looking at the first reaction (A): it's between dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. NaOEt is a base, so I think it deprotonates the malonate to form an enolate. 

Dimethyl malonate has two methyl groups and two ester groups. The structure is O=C(CO2Me)2. When the base abstracts a proton from the alpha carbon, it forms a conjugate base (enolate) at one of the carbonyl carbons. This enolate should attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an acrylate ester. The structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Or maybe it's CH2-C(O)OCH3 with a substituent on the double bond. Wait, the formula is E-configuration, so the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite each other.

So the acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but the 3-(p-tolyl) would be that the substituent is on the third carbon. Wait, maybe it's CH2-CH-CO-OCH3 but with a p-tolyl group on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(O-p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, the (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the p-tolyl is on carbon 3? Wait, maybe I'm getting the
