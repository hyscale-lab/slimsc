Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star whose properties change when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots. They give the star's radius as 1.5 solar radii and mass as 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Specifically, when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. The task is to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, and the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm, okay. So I remember that in LTE, the populations of different energy levels in an atom are determined by the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels, say level 2 and level 1, is given by the formula:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where:
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the two levels.
- E2 and E1 are their respective energies.
- k is the Boltzmann constant.
- T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K instead of 6000 K), and the ratio n1/n2 (since the ratio is given as decreasing, maybe I should think about n1/n2 or n2/n1) goes down. Wait, the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases. So (n1/n2)_spots < (n1/n2)_no_spots.

Wait, let me clarify. The observed ratio (number in level 1 over level 2) decreases when spots are present. So, when the star has spots, (n1/n2) is smaller than when it doesn't. So the ratio without spots is higher.

Since the ratio is (n1/n2) = [g1/g2 * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k*T) ) ]

Wait, no. Let me get the formula right. The ratio of n2 to n1 is (g2/g1) * exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1. So if E2 > E1, then the exponential is less than 1, so higher energy level has fewer atoms. So n2 < n1.

If the star's temperature changes, the ratio changes. So when the temperature decreases, what happens to (n1/n2)?

Wait, let's compute (n1/n2) in terms of T.

n1/n2 = [g1/g2] / [exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) ] 

So if E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive. So as T decreases, the exponent (positive number)/(kT) becomes larger, making the exponential bigger. So 1/exp(...) gets smaller. So n1/n2 = [g1/g2] * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). So when T decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller, so n1
