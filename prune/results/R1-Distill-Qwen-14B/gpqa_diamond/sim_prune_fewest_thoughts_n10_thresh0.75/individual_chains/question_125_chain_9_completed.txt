Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think through this.

The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r². I remember that the isotropic 3D harmonic oscillator can be solved by separating the Schrödinger equation into radial and angular parts because of the spherical symmetry.

The problem is asking for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to that energy eigenvalue.

First, let's tackle the energy part. I know that in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the principal quantum number n, which is related to the quantum numbers in each direction. Wait, no, wait. Actually, I think the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer (n=0,1,2,...) . Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed in terms of the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh right, in 3D, the energy is E = (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) ħω. Alternatively, since each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, the total is the sum.

Wait, no, let me get this right. For a 3D isotropic oscillator, each degree of freedom (x, y, z) contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so the total energy is E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħ ω. Alternatively, if we define a total quantum number n such that n = n_x + n_y + n_z, then E = (n + 3/2) ħ ω.

Now, the energy levels are degenerate because different sets of (n_x, n_y, n_z) can give the same n. So the degeneracy (the number of states with the same energy) depends on the number of ways to write n as the sum of three non-negative integers.

The question is about the third excited state. Wait, what's the ground state and how do excited states work here?

In the 3D harmonic oscillator, the ground state is the lowest energy, which corresponds to n=0 (n_x = n_y = n_z = 0). So E_ground = (0 + 3/2) ħ ω = (3/2) ħ ω.

The first excited state would be the next energy level, which is the lowest possible n=1. The energy is (1 + 3/2) ħ ω = (5/2) ħ ω.

Wait, but wait. No, wait a second. Let me think again. The ground state is the lowest, and each increment in n increases the energy by ħ ω. So the levels are E(n) = (n + 3/2) ħ ω.

So the ground state is n=0, E=(3/2)ħω.

First excited would be n=1, E=(5/2)ħω.

Second excited is n=2, E=(7/2)ħω.

Third excited is n=3, E=(9/2)ħω. So the energy for the third excited state is (9/2) ħω. So looking at the options, option A and C have (9/2) ħω as the energy part.

Now, the second part of the question is about the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the same energy eigenvalue. That is, the degeneracy of the level.

The degeneracy for each n is given by (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The number of ways to write n as the sum of three non-negative integers is the same as the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = n. The formula for this is (n + 2 choose 2) = (n+2)(n+1)/2.

Wait, let me verify. For example, n=0: only (0,0,0), so 1 state. (0+2)(0+1)/2 = 2*1/2 = 1. Correct.

n=1: (1+2)(1+1)/2 = 3*2/2=3. So 3 states. Indeed, n_x can be 1, others 0 in 3 ways.

n=2: (2+2)(2+1)/2 =4*3/2=6. So 6 states.

n=3: (3+2)(3+1)/2 =5*4/2=10. So 10 states.

So for the third excited state, which is n=3, the degeneracy is 10.

Looking back at the options, option A says energy (9/2) ħω and 10 eigenfunctions. Option C says 3 eigenfunctions, which can't be right because for n=3, it's 10.

So the correct choice between A and C is A.

Wait, but the options are:

Option A: (9/2) ħ ω, 10 

Option C: (9/2) ħ ω, 3 

So the second part is 10, which matches option A. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me make sure. The third excited state is n=3, yes?

Because the ground state is n=0 (first state), first excited is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3.

Yes, correct.

So the energy is (3 + 3/2) ħω = 9/2 ħω, and the degeneracy is 10. So option A is correct.


The problem involves a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, where the potential is given by \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels for such a system are quantized and depend on the total quantum number \( n \), which is the sum of the quantum numbers in the three spatial directions (\( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \)). The energy eigenvalues are given by:

\[
E = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega
\]

The degeneracy of each energy level, i.e., the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the same energy eigenvalue, is determined by the number of ways to write \( n \) as the sum of three non-negative integers (\( n_x, n_y, n_z \)). This is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{n + 2}{2} = \frac{(n + 2)(n + 1)}{2}
\]

### Step 1: Energy of the third excited state
The ground state corresponds to \( n = 0 \), with energy \( E = \frac{3}{2} \hbar \omega \). The first excited state corresponds to \( n = 1 \), with energy \( E = \frac{5}{2} \hbar \omega \), and the second excited state corresponds to \( n = 2 \), with energy \( E = \frac{7}{2} \hbar \omega \). The third excited state corresponds to \( n = 3 \), with energy:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega
\]

### Step 2: Degeneracy of the third excited state
For \( n = 3 \), the degeneracy is calculated as:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \frac{(3 + 2)(3 + 1)}{2} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} = 10
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \), and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy eigenvalue is 10.

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10 \) — This matches the calculated energy and degeneracy.
- **Option B**: \( \frac{11 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2 m r^2}, 10 \) — The energy is incorrect.
- **Option C**: \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 3 \) — The degeneracy is incorrect.
- **Option D**: \( \frac{11 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2 m r^2}, 3 \) — Both the energy and degeneracy are incorrect.

### Final Answer
The correct choice is **A**.

Answer: A
