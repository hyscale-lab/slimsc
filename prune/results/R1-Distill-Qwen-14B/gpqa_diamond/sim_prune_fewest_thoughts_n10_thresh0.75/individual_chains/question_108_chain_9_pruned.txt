Okay, so I have this physics problem about paramagnetic coupling and the hydrogen atom's transition energy. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

First, the question says that the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 T. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the orbital magnetic quantum number m can take values from -l to +l, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. Since m is small, maybe l is also small, like in the case of the hydrogen atom where the electron's orbital is an s-orbital (l=0) or p-orbital (l=1), perhaps.

Wait, the question is comparing the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field) with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The transition energy is given by the wavelength λ=0.4861 μm, which is the Balmer series wavelength for hydrogen. That's the wavelength for the transition from n=2 to n=1, I think, which is the Balmer-alpha line. Or wait, no, the Balmer series is when an electron transitions down to n=2, so maybe λ=0.4861 μm is the H-alpha line, which is the transition from n=3 to n=2. But I'm not entirely sure about that, but the exact transition might not matter for the order of magnitude.

The paramagnetic term in the Hamiltonian for a magnetic field is usually given by the Zeeman term, which is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For electrons, the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -(e/(2m)) * l̄, where l̄ is the orbital angular momentum. So the Hamiltonian would be proportional to the magnetic field B and the orbital angular momentum.

But wait, since we're dealing with small m, maybe we're considering the perturbation due to the magnetic field on the hydrogen atom. The transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two states, which is given by ΔE = hc/λ. Let me calculate that.

Given λ = 0.4861 μm = 0.4861e-6 meters. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6) ≈ (1.9878e-25) / (0.4861e-6) ≈ 4.089e-19 J. Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Dividing by 0.4861e-6 m gives (1.9878e-25) / (0.4861e-6) ≈ 4.089e-19 J. To convert this into electron volts, since 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J, so 4.089e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV. So ΔE is about 2.55 eV. Wait, but wait a second, the Balmer-alpha line is at around 0.486 μm, which corresponds to a transition from n=3 to n=2. So the energy difference is E32 = ΔE ≈ 2.55 eV? Hmm, but I thought the energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So E_2 is -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV, E_3 is -13.6/9 ≈ -1.51 eV. The difference between E_3 and E_2 is 1.89 eV. Oh wait, so maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the ΔE.

Wait, using E = hc/(λ) in eV·nm. Let me compute it differently because I might have messed up the units. The wavelength λ is 486.1 nm. So hc is approximately 1240 eV·nm (since 1240 eV·nm = 1240 * 1e-9 m * 6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s → but I'm more familiar with using hc ≈ 1240 eV·nm for calculation purposes).

So ΔE = hc / λ =
