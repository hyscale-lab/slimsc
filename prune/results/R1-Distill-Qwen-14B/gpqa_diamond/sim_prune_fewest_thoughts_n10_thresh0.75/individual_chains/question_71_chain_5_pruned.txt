Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but let's try to work through it. The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of exoplanets using the TTV method. Hmm, right, TTV stands for Transit Timing Variations. But I think that's more about how the planets' orbits affect each other, causing changes in the timing of their transits in front of their star. But for this problem, I don't think the TTV method's specifics are directly relevant to the temperature calculation. So perhaps I can set that aside.

The question states that there are five exoplanets with circular orbits, all in orbital resonance. Their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So let me note that down:

- Planet_1: Period P1 = 1 unit
- Planet_2: P2 = 2
- Planet_3: P3 = 2.5
- Planet_4: P4 = 3.5
- Planet_5: P5 =5

They all have the same albedo, which I remember is the measure of how much light is reflected by a surface. Since the albedo is the same, it won't affect the temperature ratio. Good, so I don't have to worry about that in my calculations.

The question is asking for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So T4 over T2, I think.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the incoming stellar energy and the outgoing thermal radiation. The formula I recall is:

T = T_star * ( (L / (16 * π * σ * a² )) )^0.25

Wait, no, maybe a simpler formula. Oh right, the effective temperature formula is:

T = T_earth * ( (L / L_sun) )^(1/4) * (a / a_earth)^(-0.5)

But wait, all these planets are orbiting the same star, right? So L (the star's luminosity) is the same for all of them. So the ratio of their temperatures depends on the inverse square root of their orbital distances.

Wait, but in the formula, a is the orbital radius. So the temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital radius.

So the ratio of temperatures T4/T2 is
