Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which one is more likely to transit. Hmm, I think transiting means when the planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, right? That's when we can detect it via the transit method, which causes a dip in brightness.

The question says that two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, are Earth-like. Both have already been detected using the Radial Velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. But the RV method doesn't tell us about the inclination of the orbit, so the probability of a transit is important here because transits depend on the orbital plane being edge-on relative to us.

The researchers have limited time and want to observe the planet with the higher probability of transiting. So I need to figure out which planet has a higher transit probability.

Given data:
- Both planets have the same mass.
- Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Period P1 = P2 /3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says P1 is three times shorter, meaning P1 = P2 /3. So P2 is three times longer than P1. So P1 is smaller, meaning it's closer to the star, since orbital period relates to distance via Kepler's third law.

- Both have circular orbits.
- Host stars:
   - Star 1 (Planet_1's host) has twice the mass of Star 2 (Planet_2's host).
   - Both stars have the same radius. Interesting, so even though Star 1 is more massive, it's not larger in radius. Maybe it's a main-sequence star and Star 2 is a slightly evolved one, which might have expanded a bit, but same radius. Hmm, that's a bit confusing because more massive stars are usually larger, but maybe they're in different stages or something. But for our calculations, we just take the given data.

So, transit probability depends on a few factors. The main formula for transit probability is roughly:

Probability ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_s / R_s))^{1/2} ?

Wait, no, I think the transit probability is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (a_s / R_s))^{1/2}.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the geometric probability. The probability that a planet transits is given by the ratio of the size of the star to the size of the orbit, but wait, more precisely, it's the probability that the orbital plane's inclination is such that the planet's orbit crosses our line of sight to the star.

The probability of a transit is approximately (R_p + R_s) / a, but wait, actually, for a planet with semi-major axis a, the probability that the inclination is just right for a transit is roughly (R_s / a) * (something). Let me think.

Wait, the correct formula for the
