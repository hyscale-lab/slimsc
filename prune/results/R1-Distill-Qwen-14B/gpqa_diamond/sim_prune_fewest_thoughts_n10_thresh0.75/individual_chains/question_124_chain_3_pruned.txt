Okay, so I have a physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see.

The question says that particles are collided in a spherical detector. When they produce new particles, these are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. Now, the radius of the detector is 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Wait, okay, so initially, with a gamma (Lorentz factor) of 20, only one third reach the walls. We need to find the gamma that makes two-thirds reach. Hmm. I think this has to do with the time it takes for the particles to decay versus the time it takes them to reach the detector walls.

So, the particles are moving at a high speed, but they also decay quickly. The decay time is probably related to their lifetime as measured in the lab frame. If the particles' lifetime is such that they decay before reaching the detector walls, then fewer particles will make it. If the lifetime is longer, more particles will reach the walls.

Wait, but the problem says that the particles are fast-decaying. So maybe their proper lifetime is very short, but due to time dilation, their lifetime in the lab frame is longer. The Lorentz factor affects this.

Let me think. The proper
