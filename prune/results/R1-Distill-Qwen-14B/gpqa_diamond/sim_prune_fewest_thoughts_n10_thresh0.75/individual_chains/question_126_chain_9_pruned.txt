Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question involves two reactions, each starting with a different compound, and then analyzing the products after combining them. The key here is probably figuring out what each reaction does and then determining the number of peaks in the HPLC chromatograms.

So, the first reaction is Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce ketones. Hexan-3-one has a ketone group at position 3. So when LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) is used, it should reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol. But wait, the compound is (S) configuration at the 5-methoxy group. Hmm, wait, no: the molecule is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So structure-wise, the carbonyl is at C3, and there's a methoxy group at C5.

Let me draw this mentally. Hexan-3-one is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but the substituents might change. Wait, no, wait: hexan-3-one is CH2CH2CH2... wait, perhaps I should think of it as:

The structure is: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the carbon chain is six carbons long. The ketone is on C3, so the structure is:

CH2CH2CO(CH2)3-OCH3? Wait, no. Wait, let's number the carbons. Carbon 1: CH3, carbon 2: CH2, carbon 3: C=O, then carbon 4: CH2, carbon 5: OCH3, and carbon 6: CH3? Wait, no, wait: the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: OCH3 attached perhaps? Wait, maybe it's like this: the structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

So the molecule is:

(CH2)2CO-CH(O
