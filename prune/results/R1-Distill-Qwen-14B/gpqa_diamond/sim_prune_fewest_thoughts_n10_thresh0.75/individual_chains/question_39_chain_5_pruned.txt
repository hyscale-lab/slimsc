Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of wave functions and normalization. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem says we have a large ensemble of identical systems, each with a particle moving along the x-axis. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, and when they measured the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So we're told that the wave function exists only between x=1 and x=3, and we need to find the value of 'a' that normalizes the wave function.

Wait, normalization. Right, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Oh, because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 100%.

But wait, the wave function given is a complex function. So the general form is ψ(x) = something real + something imaginary. The absolute square would be the square of the real part plus the square of the imaginary part, right? Because when you take the complex conjugate and multiply, the cross terms (like real*imaginary) would disappear.

Let me write down the wave function properly. It's (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) and the imaginary part is (-0.5). So when I compute |ψ(x)|², it should be [ (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ]² + [ (-0.5) ]².

So that's (a²)/(1 + x) + 0.25. And we need to integrate this from x=1 to x=3 because the wave function is zero outside this region. So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx must equal 1.

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i.
