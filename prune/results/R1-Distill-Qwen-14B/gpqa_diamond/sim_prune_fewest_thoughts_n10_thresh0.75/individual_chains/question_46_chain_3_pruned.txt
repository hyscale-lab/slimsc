Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because Grubbs catalyst is involved. I've studied some about olefin metathesis, but let me try to think this through step by step.

The question says racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products are formed, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

First, let me visualize the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, pent-1-ene is a five-carbon chain with a double bond starting at the first carbon. So numbering from left to right, it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait no, wait. Wait, wait. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH3? No, wait again. Because pent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH3. Oh, but wait, 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. Wait no, that's not possible because in pent-1-ene, the double bond is between 1 and 2. So the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Hmm, wait, no, wait. Let's count the carbons again.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. The main chain is five carbons long, with a double bond between C1 and C2. The substituent is a methyl group on C3. So the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, that's five carbons. So the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Wait, but wait—the pent-1-ene would make the double bond between C1 and C2, so the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, but that's actually 3-methylpent-1-ene.

But wait, wait another thing—Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal catalyst used in olefin metathesis reactions. Specifically, it's used
