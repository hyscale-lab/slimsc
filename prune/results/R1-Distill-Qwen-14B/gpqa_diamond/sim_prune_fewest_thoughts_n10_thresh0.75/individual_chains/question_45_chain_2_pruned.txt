Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember from my studies that particles in a box have quantized energy levels. Let me think about what I know.

The question asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. Oh wait, and the particles are identical spin-1/2, which means they are fermions, right? So they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That principle states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state in a system. Each has to have a unique set of quantum numbers.

The system is a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy levels for a particle in such a well are given by the formula E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), where n is the principal quantum number. Oh, right, and the problem defines E as E = π²ħ²/(2mL²). So each E_n is just n² times E. So, E_n = n² E.

But wait, with four particles in the well, each in different quantum states. Since they're fermions, their spin also comes into play. Spin-1/2 particles have two possible spin states: up and down. So for each spatial state (each n), we can have up to two particles with opposite spins without violating the Pauli exclusion principle.

So the particles will fill up the lowest available energy levels, each with their spin states. Let me figure out how they'll be filled.

The ground state is the lowest energy configuration. So the first two particles would go into n=1, each with opposite spins. Then the next two would go into n=2, each with opposite spins. Wait, but wait, can we have two particles in the same n? Oh yeah, because they can have different spins. So the first two particles are in n=1 and spin up and down. The next two will be in n=2, same thing.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. For four particles, each with spin 1/2. Each spatial state (n) can hold 2 particles. So n=1 holds 2 particles, n=2 holds 2 particles. So the four particles would occupy n=1 and n=2, each with two particles.

So the total energy would be the sum of their individual energies. Each particle in n=1 contributes E_1 = 1² E = E
