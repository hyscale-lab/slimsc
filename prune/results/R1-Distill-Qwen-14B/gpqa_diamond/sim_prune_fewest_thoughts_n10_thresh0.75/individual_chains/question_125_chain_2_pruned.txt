Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident about all the concepts yet. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that in such a system, the potential is the same in all directions, so it's symmetric. The force here obeys Hooke's law, which makes me think of a spring, but in three dimensions.

The problem is asking for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for that same energy eigenvalue. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

First, I need to recall the energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I remember that in three dimensions, the energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. But wait, for an isotropic 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy is given by E = ħω(n + 3/2), where n is a non-negative integer (n=0,1,2,...). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh, right, the formula is E_n = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers nx, ny, nz, each of which can be 0,1,2,... So, n = nx + ny + nz. So each state is defined by these three quantum numbers.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Wait, another approach: for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels depend on the total number of quanta in each direction. Each of the three directions contributes energy levels, and the total energy is the sum. So, the energy is E = ħω(nx + ny + nz + 3/2). Alternatively, sometimes it's written as E = ħω(n + 3/2), where n = nx + ny + nz. So, n can be 0,1,2,... and each time n increases by 1, the energy increases by ħω.

Wait, no, wait: No, because each quantum number increases by 1 when you add a quantum in that direction. So for each unit of n, the energy increases by ħω. So, for
