Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when a state is given like this, it's a linear combination of the basis states. Since |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, their corresponding spin matrices are diagonal, right?

Wait, the question is about another operator whose matrix elements are Aij. The operator is such that Aij = hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and zero otherwise. Oh, right, so the matrix would be a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles. Let me think: for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix would look like:

[  0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0  ]

Wait, no, wait. The definition is Aij = hbar/2 if i != j, else zero. So yeah, the diagonal is zero, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. So the matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. That looks familiar. I think that's the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this operator is (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

Now, the first part of the problem is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of this operator. So I need to find the eigenstates of A, which is (hbar/2) sigma_x. Since sigma_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1), so hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Wait, but the eigenstates are the same as sigma_x's because scaling the operator by a scalar doesn't change the eigenvectors, only the eigenvalues. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of sigma_x. The eigenstates of sigma_x
