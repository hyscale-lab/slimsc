Okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation happens. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says these aliens are traveling at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's super fast, almost light speed. So time dilation effects will be significant. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip takes from their perspective.

Wait, wait. Wait, no, no, no. Wait, the question says, how long will it take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their own point of view. So we're looking at the proper time experienced by the astronaut, right? Because when you're moving at high speeds, your own time (proper time) is shorter compared to the time measured by someone else not moving relative to you.

But first, maybe I should calculate the distance they need to cover. The Large Magellanic Cloud is a dwarf galaxy; I think it's about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away from Earth. Let me pick an average value, say 170,000 light-years. Hmm, but wait, the exact distance might not matter because the options are in the hundreds of years. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the distance is measured in the Earth's frame, perhaps? Or in the spacecraft's frame?

Wait, the problem says the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c. So, in the Earth's frame, the distance is D. The time taken from Earth's perspective would be D divided by speed. But the astronaut's experienced time is less because of time dilation.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the astronaut's own experienced time. So I need to calculate the proper time for the journey. Proper time is the shortest time experienced by the traveler due to time dilation.

The formula for proper time is tau equals T multiplied by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Or wait, more accurately, tau = T * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Wait, no, no, actually, it's tau = T * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Because T is the time measured in the Earth's frame, and tau is the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, from
