Okay, so I've got this question about the redshift of objects observed using optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, I remember that redshift is related to how much the wavelength of light is stretched as it travels through the expanding universe. The Lyman alpha line is a specific emission or absorption line in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. For hydrogen, Lyman alpha is at about 121.6 nm (which is 1216 Angstroms, since 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm). But wait, observing this line in absorption would mean that the quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen cloud.

So when the hydrogen cloud has a higher redshift than the quasar, it would absorb the quasar's own Lyman alpha emission, right? But wait, no, wait. I might be mixing it up. Let me think again. The quasar emits light, and the hydrogen cloud is in front of it. So the cloud would absorb the quasar's light at a certain wavelength. If the cloud is at a redshift z, the absorbed wavelength would be longer than 1216 Angstroms because of the redshift.

But optical ground-based telescopes can't observe wavelengths much beyond the visible spectrum. So the observed wavelength after redshift needs to be within the range that optical telescopes can detect. The Lyman alpha line is in the ultraviolet, so if the cloud is too close (low redshift), the observed wavelength would still be in the UV, which ground-based telescopes can't see because the atmosphere blocks UV light. So the redshift needs to be high enough that the observed Lyman alpha line moves into the visible spectrum.

So the basic formula is: observed wavelength lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + z). Here, lambda_emit is 1216 Angstroms. So lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z).

What's the maximum wavelength that optical telescopes can observe? I think optical typically goes up to about 1 micrometer (1000 nm or 10,000 Angstroms) or maybe a bit more. Wait, visible light is roughly 400-700 nm, but some optical telescopes can go into the near-infrared, which is up to about 1.1 micrometers or so. Let's say the upper limit is around 1000 nm (10,000 Angstroms) because anything beyond that is infrared and might not be captured by a typical optical setup without IR instruments.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So I need the minimum z where the observed wavelength is just entering the optical range. So when lambda_obs is about equal to the maximum wavelength that optical telescopes can detect. Let's assume that optical can go up to about 1000 nm, which is 10,000 Angstroms. So setting lambda_obs = 10
