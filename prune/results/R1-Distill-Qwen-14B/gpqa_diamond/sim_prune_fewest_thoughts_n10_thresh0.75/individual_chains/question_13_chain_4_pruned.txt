Okay, let's tackle this organic chemistry problem. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So, the starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic compound, right? It's a cyclic ether or maybe a cyclic monoterpene hydrocarbon. Wait, no, limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene. Oh wait, no, limonene is actually a cyclic monoterpene, but I think it's a bicyclic structure. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think. Citrus limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, I think it's a bicyclic monoterpene. So it's a bicyclic structure with a double bond.

The first reaction is hydrogenation. The solution is in methanol with Pd/C under hydrogen. So, what's happening here? Hydrogenation of a double bond. Since it's Pd/C and H2, it's probably hydrogenation of the double bond in limonene. So, limonene has a double bond, perhaps in a ring structure. Hydrogenation would add hydrogen across the double bond, making it a single bond. Since it's using 1 equivalent of H2, probably only one double bond is hydrogenated.

Wait, limonene has a structure more precisely. Let me recall: limonene has a structure where it's a six-membered ring with a methyl group and a double bond. So,
