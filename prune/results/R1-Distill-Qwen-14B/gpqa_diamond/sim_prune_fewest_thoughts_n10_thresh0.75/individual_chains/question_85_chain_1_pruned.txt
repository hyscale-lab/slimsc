Okay, so I've got this problem here about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me think about what I remember about equilibrium temperature and the factors that influence it.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on a few things: the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, the problem says both planets have the same albedo, so that part cancels out for the ratio. That's good because I don't have to worry about that variable.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A)/(sigma) )^(1/4) )... wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Let me get this right. The equilibrium temperature is given by the formula:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4)

Wait, no, that doesn't seem quite right. Let me think again. The star's flux at the planet's distance is L/(4πa²), where L is the star's luminosity. The planet absorbs (1 - A) times that flux because A is the albedo. The planet then radiates as a blackbody, so using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the equilibrium temperature would be such that the power absorbed equals the power radiated.

Alternatively, the formula I think is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4)

Wait, no, I think I might be getting this wrong. Let me break it down step by step.

The star's luminosity is L = 4πR_star² σ T_star^4. The planet is at a distance a from the star, so the flux at the planet's location is L/(4πa²). The planet's cross-sectional area is π R_planet², so the power absorbed is (L/(4πa²)) * π R_planet² (1 - A). That's the absorbed power.

The planet radiates as a blackbody with surface area 4π R_planet², so the power radiated is 4π R_planet² σ T_eq^4.

Setting them equal: (L/(4πa²)) * π R_planet² (1 - A) = 4π R_planet² σ T_eq^4.

Simplify this equation. Let's cancel out R_planet² on both sides. So:

(L/(4πa²)) * π (1 - A) = 4π σ T_eq^4.

Multiply both sides by 4π a²:

L (1 - A) = 16 π² a² σ T_eq^4.

Now, substitute L with 4π R_star² σ T_star^4.

4π R_star² σ T_star^4 (1 - A) = 16 π² a² σ T_eq^4.

Cancel out the σ from both sides:

4π R_star² T_star^4 (1 - A) = 16 π² a² T_eq^4.

Divide both sides by 4π:

R_star² T_star^4 (
