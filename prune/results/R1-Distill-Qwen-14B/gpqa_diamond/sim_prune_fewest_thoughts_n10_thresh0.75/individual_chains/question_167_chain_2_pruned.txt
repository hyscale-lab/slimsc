Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think through this step by step.

The state given is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. Oh right, and N is the normalisation constant which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) e^(-2 alpha²)). So the parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

Wait, non-Gaussianity is a measure of how non-Gaussian a state is. Gaussian states are those like coherent states or squeezed states, which have a certain structure in their Wigner functions, like being Gaussian distributions. Non-Gaussian states are things like Fock states or cat states, which have more complicated distributions, like those with multiple peaks.

The problem says to use the relative entropy measure. The formula given is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where tau is the density matrix of a Gaussian reference state, and rho is the non-Gaussian state's density matrix.

Wait, but wait a second. The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is calculated by comparing the state to a Gaussian one. So, the idea is that if the state is Gaussian, then rho and tau would be the same, so del_b would be zero. But if it's non-Gaussian, del_b would be positive.

But wait, the problem asks to calculate the non-Gaussianity nG for the given state. So, how do I proceed?

First, I need to find the density matrix rho of the state |psi>. Then, find the Gaussian state tau that is the closest to rho in some sense, perhaps in terms of minimizing the relative entropy. But actually, I might not need the exact form of tau because for the Schrödinger cat state, which is a superposition of coherent states, the most Gaussian reference state would probably be the maximally mixed Gaussian state, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the relative entropy is computed with tau being the Gaussian state that rho is closest to. But I'm not too familiar with the exact procedure here. Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is the relative entropy between the state's density matrix and the closest Gaussian state. But I'm not sure how to compute that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the non-Gaussianity in this case can be calculated directly using some known formula. I remember that for a cat state, the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity can sometimes be expressed in terms of the parameters like alpha and phi.

Wait, but let me think about the state more carefully. The state is |psi> = (cos phi |alpha> + sin phi |-alpha>)/N. When phi is pi/4, the superposition is symmetric in alpha and -alpha. But here phi is -pi/4, so let's compute cos(-pi/4) and sin(-pi/4). Cos is even, so cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2, and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2. So the state becomes [ (sqrt(2)/2) |alpha> + (-sqrt(2)/
