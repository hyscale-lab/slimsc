Alright, so I've got this question about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think through it step by step. Okay, the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, with masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But wait, I think the mass might not be directly relevant here because the question is about elemental abundances, so maybe the mass is just extra info.

The elemental abundances given are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex and [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0. Hmm, and the Sun's photospheric composition is provided: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5, and 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7. 

Wait, what do these [X/Y] notations mean? Oh right, [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithmic abundance ratio relative to the Sun.

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, need to find (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2).

Let me break down each star's composition.

Starting with Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 is 0. That means the ratio of Fe to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. So, n_Fe,1 / n_H,1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So [Si/Fe] = log(n_Si/n_Fe) - log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) = 0.3. So, log(n_Si,1/n_Fe,1) = log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) + 0.3. 

Wait, n_Si,1/n
