Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics. Hmm, let's go through it step by step. 

The scenario is about creating a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're using a plasmid with an inducible overexpression system, and they added a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus of the protein. But when they tried to express it in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected.

So, the problem is that the protein isn't being expressed, and the question is why based on the DNA sequence provided. The possible options are A to D.

First, I need to look at the DNA sequence given. It's the plus strand, so it's the coding (sense) strand. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then there's TAC, which is tyrosine, but wait, wait. Wait, the first few codons: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCA CCA ATG ACT CTG... Hmm, wait, that doesn't look right.

Wait, the first codon is ATG, which is methionine, start. The next is TAC, which is tyrosine. Then CCA is proline, TAC is tyrosine again. Hmm, but wait, the intended construct should have a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. So the first part should be the HA tag, followed by GADD45G coding sequence.

Wait, but looking at the sequence, the start is ATG (which is correct), then TAC. So the HA tag's sequence would be at the beginning. Wait, the HA tag is a specific sequence, right? Like YPYDHHVYIP... or something like that? But in the DNA sequence, the first few codons after ATG are TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT. Let me translate that into amino acids to see.

ATG is Methionine (start), TAC is Tyrosine, CCA is Proline, TAC is Tyrosine, GAT is Aspartic Acid, GTT is Valine, CCA is Proline, AGA is... wait, no, let me list them:

1. ATG → Met (start)
2. TAC → Tyr
3. CCA → Pro
4. TAC → Tyr
5. GAT → Asp
6. GTT → Val
7. CCA → Pro
8. AGA → Arg (AGA is a stop codon? No, wait, stop codons are TAG, TAA, and TGA. So AGA is arginine. Hmm. Wait, no, AGA is the same as AGG in terms of the mRNA codon, but in DNA, it's the complement. Wait, the DNA is the coding strand, so the mRNA would have the same sequence as the plus strand, except T becomes U. So the mRNA would be AUC... So for the DNA sequence TAC, the mRNA is AUC, which is Tyr. 

Wait, but if the construct was supposed to have the HA tag, perhaps the initial codons should be the HA sequence. Let's think about the HA tag. The HA tag is derived from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus, and it's usually a short peptide, like 11 amino acids. The exact sequence can vary, but a common one is YPYDHHVYIP. Let's see the DNA sequence for that.

Wait, but the question says they introduced the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant. So the construct should have the HA tag at the N-terminus. So the first part of the coding sequence should be the HA tag, then the GADD45G coding sequence.

But looking at the given sequence, the first few codons are ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC... Let me check what that translates to.

ATG: Met
TAC: Tyr
CCA: Pro
TAC: Tyr
GAT: Asp
GTT: Val
CCA: Pro
GAT: Asp
TAC: Tyr
GCA: Ala
CCA: Pro
ATG: Met
ACT: Thr
CTG: Leu
GAA: Glu
GAA: Glu
GCC: Ala
GCG: Ala
GCT: Ala
...
Wait, this doesn't make much sense. The HA tag should be much shorter, maybe a few codons. But here, the initial part is Met Tyr Pro Tyr Asp Val Pro Asp Tyr Ala Pro Met Thr Leu Glu Glu Ala Ala...

Wait, but the HA tag is probably a short sequence that's supposed to be added before the GADD45G. So perhaps the HA tag is missing, or perhaps there's a frameshift.

Wait, but the problem is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. So why?

Looking at the options:

A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. So perhaps the HA tag is mutated, making the tag incorrect. But if the tag is incorrect, would that prevent expression? Maybe if the tag is part of the expression vector's selection, but the question says the problem is with the construct.

B) The ribosome terminated the translation early. So perhaps there's a stop codon in the mRNA early on. Like, a UAA, UAG, or UGA in the mRNA. Let's look for that in the DNA sequence.

Wait, the construct's plus strand is 5' to 3', coding strand. So the mRNA would be the same as the plus strand, except T becomes U.

Looking for any of the stop codons in the mRNA (plus strand sequence, but
