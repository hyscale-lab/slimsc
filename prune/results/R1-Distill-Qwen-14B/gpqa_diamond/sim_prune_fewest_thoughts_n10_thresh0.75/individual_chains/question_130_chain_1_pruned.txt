Okay, so I've got this question here about quasars and neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my cosmology, but let me think this through.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. And the task is to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Wait, redshift and Lyman alpha... I remember the Lyman alpha emission line is at 121.6 nm, which is 1216 Angstroms. So when a quasar emits this line, if the quasar is at a high redshift, the wavelength gets stretched due to the expansion of the universe. But wait, wait, the question is about absorption, not emission. So these clouds absorb the quasar's light, causing a absorption line at Lyman alpha.

But how does redshift affect whether we can detect this absorption with optical telescopes? Oh right, optical telescopes can't detect wavelengths beyond the visible spectrum, like infrared or radio. So if the Lyman alpha line, which is in the ultraviolet, gets redshifted into the visible range, then it can be detected by optical telescopes.

Wait, wait. The rest wavelength is 1216 A (which is 121.6 nm, in the far ultraviolet). So if the object is at redshift z, the observed wavelength is 1216 * (1+z) Angstroms. But optical telescopes cover roughly 400-700 nm, which is 4000-7000 Angstroms.

So for the observed wavelength to be in the optical, 4000 <= 1216*(1+z) <=7000.

Let me solve for z. Let's find the minimum z where the wavelength is at least 4000 Angstroms.

4000 <= 1216*(1+z)
Divide both sides by 1216:

4000 / 1216 â‰ˆ 3.29 -> 3.29 <= 1+z
So z >= 2.29.

Hmm, so the lower
