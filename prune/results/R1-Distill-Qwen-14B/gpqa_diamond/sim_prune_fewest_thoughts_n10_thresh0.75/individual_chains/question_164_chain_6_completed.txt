Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, I remember that binary stars orbit a common center of mass, and their motion can tell us a lot about their masses. Let me try to unpack this.

The question says there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses. So, system_1 has a longer orbital period than system_2.

Then, the spectroscopic observations give radial velocity amplitudes. For system_1, the stars have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2's stars have 15 and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, considering the mass is the sum of the two stars.

Wait, I think this has to do with Kepler's laws and the concept of mass function in binary stars. Oh right, the radial velocity method gives us the velocities of the stars, which relate to their masses via Kepler's third law.

I remember that in a binary system, each star orbits the center of mass. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit, right? So the star with the smaller velocity amplitude will be more massive. Because the center of mass is closer to the more massive object.

Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the mass of the companion. The formula I think is K = (v1) and K2, where v1 and v2 are the velocities of the two stars. And from Kepler's third law, we have that (M1 + M2) * P^2 = (4π²/G) * (a1 + a2)^3.

But wait, a1 and a2 are the semi-major axes of the two stars' orbits. Also, since the stars orbit the same center of mass, M1*a1 = M2*a2. So a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) * a_total, and a2 = (M1/(M1+M2)) * a_total, where a_total is the separation between the two stars.

Another thing I remember is that the sum of their velocities is (v1 + v2) = (2π a_total)/P. Because the orbital circumference is 2πa, and period P. So, v1 = 2π a1 / P and v2 = 2π a2 / P. So adding them gives 2π (a1 + a2)/P = 2π a_total / P = orbital speed summed.

But wait, another approach is using the mass function. The mass function relates the observed velocity amplitudes to the masses. For a spectroscopic binary, you can only directly measure one of the velocities (your own star's Doppler shift), and the other is inferred. But in this problem, both stars' velocities are given. So maybe we can find the mass ratio.

Wait, in this problem, for each system, we have the RV amplitudes of both stars. So for system_1, the two stars have K1 = 10 km/s and K2 = 5 km/s. For system_2, K1=15, K2=10.

I think the ratio of the velocities is inversely proportional to the mass ratio. So M1/M2 = K2 / K1.

Because in the center of mass, M1*a1 = M2*a2, and since a1 = K1 * P/(2π), and a2 = K2 * P/(2π), then M1/(M2) = (a2)/(a1) = (K2 * P/(2π)) / (K1 * P/(2π)) )= K2/K1.

So M1/M2 = K2 / K1.

So for system_1, M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5.

Similarly, for system_2, M1/M2 = 10/15 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667.

Wait, but wait, in each system, the total mass is M1 + M2. So for each system, the mass ratio is known, and the total mass can be expressed in terms of the observed velocities and the period.

Alternatively, using the formula that relates the radial velocities to the masses. Let me think. The formula for each star's velocity is K1 = (2π G)^1/3 * (M2 / (M1 + M2))^(2/3) * (1/(P (1 year))^1/3) * (1/(1 + q)), where q is M2/M1.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the formula:

The mass function for each star is (M2 sin^3 i)/((1 + q)^2) ), but since we're dealing with edge-on orbits (eclipsing binaries), inclination i is 90 degrees, sin i = 1. So the mass function simplifies.

But wait, in the case where both stars' velocities are known, we can find the mass ratio directly. Because M1/M2 = K2/K1.

So for system_1: M1/M2 = 5 /10 = 0.5 → M1 = 0.5 M2.

So total mass for system_1: M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

Wait, but wait, system_1's M1 is 0.5 M2? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, wait, let's think again. The more massive star has a smaller orbit, so its velocity is smaller. So in system_1, the star with 5 km/s is more massive than the one with 10 km/s. So M1 is the more massive? Or maybe I got M1 and M2 mixed up.

Wait, in the problem statement, for system_1, the two stars have amplitudes of 10 and 5. So which one is which? Let's say Star A has 10 km/s, Star B has 5.

So the mass ratio M_A / M_B = K_B / K_A = 5/10 = 0.5.

So M_A = 0.5 M_B.

So M_B is twice as massive as M_A. So the total mass is M_A + M_B = 0.5 M_B + M_B = 1.5 M_B.

Similarly, for system_2, the velocities are 15 and 10. So K1=15, K2=10. So M1/M2 = K2/K1 =10/15=2/3.

Wait, but which is which? If K1=15, that star is moving faster. So it must be less massive. So M1 is less than M2. So M1/M2 = 10/15 → 2/3. So M1 = (2/3) M2.

The total mass for system_2 is M1 + M2 = (2/3 M2) + M2 = (5/3) M2.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should model each system.

System_1:

Star A: K_A=10 km/s → velocity semi-amplitude.

Star B: K_B=5 km/s.

So M_A / M_B = K_B / K_A =5/10= 0.5 → M_A=0.5 M_B.

So M_total_1 = M_A + M_B = 0.5 M_B + M_B = 1.5 M_B.

System_2:

Star C: K_C=15 km/s.

Star D: K_D=10 km/s.

M_C / M_D = K_D / K_C =10/15= 2/3 → M_C = (2/3) M_D.

M_total_2 = M_C + M_D = (2/3 M_D) + M_D = (5/3) M_D.

Now, the problem is to find the ratio of the total masses: M_total_1 / M_total_2.

But wait, I think I need to relate the masses to the orbital periods. Because the periods are different (2 years and 1 year), and that affects the total mass.

Wait, but Kepler's third law says that (M1 + M2) P^2 = (4π²/G) * a^3.

But without knowing the actual separation a, how can we relate the masses? Hmm.

But wait, for each system, the velocity semi-amplitudes and the period can be used to compute the mass.

Wait, the formula for the mass function is:

M2 sin³i = (K1 P (1 year) )² (1 + q)^-2 / (2π G),

where q is M2/M1.

But since both systems are eclipsing, sin i =1.

But maybe a better formula is:

The combined mass can be found using:

(M1 + M2) = (4 π² a³ )/( G P² )

But a is the separation between the stars. Alternatively, since a = a1 + a2, and a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) * a, a2= (M1/(M1+M2)) * a.

But, another approach is to use the fact that for each system:

v1 = 2π a1 / P,

v2 = 2π a2 / P.

But a1 + a2 = a, the separation.

From center of mass: M1 a1 = M2 a2 → a2 = (M1/M2) a1.

So a = a1 + a2 = a1 (1 + M1/M2) = a1 ( (M2 + M1)/M2 ) → a1 = a M2/(M1 + M2).

Similarly, v1 = 2π a1 / P.

So v1 = 2π (a M2/(M1 + M2)) ) / P.

Similarly, v2 = 2π a1 (M1/M2) / P = 2π a ( M1/(M1+M2) ) ) / P.

Wait, alternatively, since a1 = K1 * P/(2π), and a2 = K2 * P/(2π ), because velocity = 2π a / P, so a = velocity * P/(2π).

So a1 = K1 * P/(2π),

a2 = K2 * P/(2π).

But a1 + a2 = a.

But from the center of mass condition, M1 a1 = M2 a2.

So M1 (K1 P/(2π)) ) = M2 ( K2 P/(2π) )

The P/(2π) cancels out, so M1 K1 = M2 K2 → M1/M2 = K2/K1.

Which brings us back to the earlier conclusion: M1/M2 = K2/K1.

So the mass ratio is K2/K1 for each system.

So for system_1, M1 = (K2/K1) * M2 → M1 = (5/10) M2 = 0.5 M2.

So total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

For system_2: M1 = (K2/K1) * M2 = (10/15) M2 = (2/3) M2.

Total mass system_2: (2/3 M2) + M2 = (5/3) M2.

Wait, but this seems to suggest that the M2 here are different for each system. Oh wait, no, because M2 in system_1 and system_2 are different stars. So perhaps I should denote them as M1 and M2 for system_1, and M3 and M4 for system_2.

But perhaps it's better to express each system's total mass in terms of their own velocity amplitudes and periods.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the total mass.

We can write each system's total mass as:

(M1 + M2) = ( (K1 + K2) * P ) / (2π G) )^(1/3) * ( (K1 + K2) )^(1/3) )?

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the formula that relates the radial velocities to the masses.

The formula for each star's velocity in a binary is:

K1 = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( (M2) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) ) ) * ( P / (1 year) )^(-1/3) )

Similarly for K2:

K2 = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( (M1) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) ) ) * ( P / (1 year) )^(-1/3) )

So for each system, we can write:

K1/(K2) = M2 / M1 → which aligns with what we had earlier.

But to find the total mass (M1 + M2), we can rearrange the formula.

Let me take the ratio K1/K2 = M2/M1 → which is the same as M1/M2 = K2/K1.

So for system_1, M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5 → M2 = 2 M1.

So total mass system_1: M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1.

Similarly, for system_2: M1/M2 = 10/15 = 2/3 → M2 = 1.5 M1.

Total mass system_2: M1 + M2 = M1 + 1.5 M1 = 2.5 M1.

Wait, but M1 here is the mass of the star in system_2 with K=15, which is less than the other star in that system.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to combine the velocities and the period to find the mass.

The formula for the total mass is:

M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P^2 ) / (2 π G) )

Wait, no, not exactly, because I think the formula is:

(M1 + M2) = ( (4 π² ) / (G) ) * (a_total)^3 / (P² )

And a_total = a1 + a2 = (K1 P)/(2 π) + (K2 P)/(2 π ) = P (K1 + K2) / (2 π )

So a_total = (P (K1 + K2)) / (2 π )

So substituting into the mass formula:

M_total = (4 π² a_total^3 )/( G P² )

= (4 π² [ (P (K1 + K2) )/(2 π ) ]^3 ) / ( G P² )

Let me compute this.

Expand the cube:

= (4 π² * P^3 (K1 + K2)^3 ) / ( (2 π )^3 ) ) / ( G P² )

= [4 π² * P^3 (K1 + K2)^3 ] / (8 π^3 ) ) * (1/( G P² ) )

Simplify the numerator:

4 π² in numerator, denominator 8 π^3 → 4/(8) = 0.5, π²/π^3 = 1/π.

So numerator becomes 0.5 (K1 + K2)^3 P³.

Denominator: 8 π^3 → wait, no, I think I might have miscalculated.

Wait, let's compute step by step.

a_total = [ P (K1 + K2) ] / (2 π )

So a_total^3 = [ P (K1 + K2) / (2 π ) ]^3 = P^3 (K1+K2)^3 / (8 π^3 )

So substituting into M_total:

M_total = (4 π² * a_total^3 ) / (G P^2 )

= (4 π²) * [ P^3 (K1 + K2)^3 / (8 π^3 ) ] / ( G P^2 )

Simplify:

4 π² * P^3 (K+K)^3 / (8 π^3 ) → numerator:4 π² P^3 (K+K)^3, denominator:8 π^3.

Divide numerator and denominator:

4/8 = 0.5.

π² / π^3 = 1/ π.

So: 0.5 * P^3 (K1 + K2)^3 / ( π ) → but wait, divided by G P^2.

So,

M_total = [ (4 π² * a_total^3 ) / (G P²) ) ]

After substituting a_total:

= [4 π² * ( P^3 (K1+K2)^3 / (8 π^3 )) ) ] / ( G P² )

Simplify:

4 π² * P^3 (K1+K2)^3 / (8 π^3 ) →  (4/8) (π²/π^3) (P^3) (K+K)^3

= (0.5) (1/π) P^3 (K+K)^3.

Divided by G P² → multiply by 1/(G P^2).

So,

= (0.5) (1/π) P^3 (K+K)^3 / ( G P^2 )

= (0.5) (1/π) (P) (K+K)^3 / G.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write the formula in terms of K1 and K2.

Alternatively, let me find the expression for M_total in terms of K1, K2, and P.

So, M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( (2 π G) )

Wait, I think that's the formula, but let me check the units.

K is in m/s, P is in seconds, G is in m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

(K1 + K2)^3 → (m/s)^3.

Multiply by P (s): (m^3 s^-3) * s → m^3 s^-2.

Multiply by (1/(2 pi G)): G has units m^3 kg⁻¹ s⁻².

So 1/(G) is kg s² / m^3.

So, M_total: (m^3 s^-2) * (kg s² / m^3 )) → kg.

Yes, that makes sense.

So the formula is:

M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 π G )

But wait, is this correct? Let me think again.

Hmm, I think I might have made a mistake in the derivation. Let me check again.

We have:

a_total = (K1 + K2) * P / (2 π )

Because a = v * t / (2 π ), since v = 2 π a / P → a = v P/(2 π )

So,

a_total = (K1 + K2) * P / (2 π )

Then, the mass formula is:

M_total = (4 π² a_total^3 ) / ( G P^2 )

Substituting a_total:

M_total = (4 π² [ ( (K1 + K2) P )/(2 π ) ]^3 ) / ( G P^2 )

= (4 π² * ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π^3 ) )) / ( G P^2 )

= [4 π² (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ] / [8 π^3 G P^2 ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4 /8 = 0.5.

π² / π^3 = 1/π.

P^3 / P^2 = P.

So,

= [ 0.5 (K1 + K2)^3 P ] / ( π G )

Thus,

M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / ( 2 π G )

Wait, yes, because 0.5 / π is 1/(2 π).

So M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / ( 2 π G )

So that's the formula.

But wait, because K is in km/s, and P is in years, we'll need to convert units to SI units for G.

Alternatively, maybe we can find the ratio of the two systems' total masses without calculating the actual masses.

Because the question is about the ratio of the masses, system_1 to system_2.

So calculate M1_total / M2_total.

M1_total = ( (10 +5)^3 * 2 years ) / (2 π G )

M2_total = ( (15 +10)^3 * 1 year ) / (2 π G )

So the ratio M1/M2 = [ (15^3 * 2 ) ] / [ (25^3 *1 ) ) ]

Because the denominators (2 π G) are the same for both, they cancel out.

So,

M1/M2 = (15^3 * 2) / (25^3 *1 )

Compute 15^3 = 3375.

25^3 = 15625.

So,

M1/M2 = (3375 * 2 ) / 15625 = (6750) / 15625.

Calculate 6750 /15625.

Let me compute this:

Divide numerator and denominator by 25:

6750 ÷25=270.

15625 ÷25=625.

So 270 /625 = (270 ÷5)/(625 ÷5) =54/125.

54 divided by 125 is 0.432.

So M1_total is 0.432 times M2_total.

Wait, but the question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2.

Wait, no. The mass ratio is M1/M2 =0.432.

So system_1 is about 0.43 times the mass of system_2. So system_2 is more massive. So system_1 is less massive than system_2.

But the question is by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So the factor is 0.43, which is approximately 0.4, option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

15^3 = 3375, correct.

25^3=15625, correct.

(3375 *2) =6750.

6750 /15625 = 0.432.

Which is approximately 0.432, which is around 0.4. So option A is ~0.4.

But wait, wait a second. Let me recheck the formula.

I derived the formula M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 π G )

So for system_1, K1=10, K2=5, P=2 years.

system_1 M: (15)^3 * 2 / (2 pi G )

system_2 M: (25)^3 *1 / (2 pi G )

Wait, no, wait: K1 + K2 for system_1 is 10 +5=15.

Similarly, for system_2, 15 +10=25.

So the ratio M1/M2:

(15^3 *2 ) / (25^3 *1 ) = (3375 *2) / (15625 *1 ) = 6750 /15625 = 0.432.

So the factor is 0.432, which is approximately 0.4.

So the answer would be ~0.4, option A.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the mass is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P.

So for system_1: (15)^3 * 2.

System_2: (25)^3 *1.

So their ratio is (3375 *2 )/(15625 *1 ) = (6750)/(15625)=0.432.

Wait another thought: in the formula I derived, M_total is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P.

So the ratio of masses is ( (K1+K2)_1^3 * P1 ) / ( (K1+K2)_2^3 * P2 )

Which is (15^3 *2 )/(25^3 *1 )= (3375 *2 )/(15625 )=6750 /15625=0.432.

Which confirms the previous result.

So the factor is approximately 0.4. So system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2, meaning system_1 is less massive. But the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2.

Wait, so if system_1's mass is 0.4 times system_2's mass, then system_1 is 0.4 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive than system_2.

So the factor is 0.4, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another way to think: the mass of each system can be determined using the formula M = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 pi G )

But wait, I think the formula should be M = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * (P in seconds) ) / (2 pi G )

But since both periods are in years, maybe the formula needs to normalize for the period in seconds. Alternatively, perhaps the scaling factor is the same because we are taking the ratio.

But when we take the ratio, the units cancel out, so it's okay.

So the ratio is correct as 0.432, approximately 0.4.

So the answer should be option A.


To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data using the relationship between radial velocity amplitudes and total mass in binary systems. The total mass of a binary system can be expressed as:

\[
M_{\text{total}} \propto (K_1 + K_2)^3 \cdot P
\]

where \(K_1\) and \(K_2\) are the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars, and \(P\) is the orbital period of the system. The factor of proportionality cancels out when taking the ratio of the masses of the two systems.

### Step 1: Compute the total mass for each system
- **System_1**: \(K_1 = 10 \, \text{km/s}, K_2 = 5 \, \text{km/s}, P = 2 \, \text{years}\)
  \[
  M_{\text{total,1}} \propto (10 + 5)^3 \cdot 2 = 15^3 \cdot 2 = 3375 \cdot 2 = 6750
  \]

- **System_2**: \(K_1 = 15 \, \text{km/s}, K_2 = 10 \, \text{km/s}, P = 1 \, \text{year}\)
  \[
  M_{\text{total,2}} \propto (15 + 10)^3 \cdot 1 = 25^3 \cdot 1 = 15625 \cdot 1 = 15625
  \]

### Step 2: Compute the mass ratio
The ratio of the total masses is:
\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{6750}{15625} = 0.432
\]

### Step 3: Interpret the result
The ratio \(M_{\text{total,1}} / M_{\text{total,2}} = 0.432\) indicates that system_1 is approximately 0.4 times as massive as system_2. Therefore, system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of approximately 0.4.

### Final Answer
The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is **~0.4**.

Answer: A
