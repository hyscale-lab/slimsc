Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves reactions with mCPBA and then aqueous acid. Oh right, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is used for epoxidation of alkenes. Right, so when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. 

The question says that the chemist performs two reactions. Reaction 1 is with (E)-oct-4-ene, and Reaction 2 is with (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA and then aqueous acid. Both go to 100% completion. Then the products are combined and run on HPLC columnsâ€”both standard (achiral) and chiral ones. The question is about what the chromatograms would show.

Wait, so the first step is to figure out what each reaction produces. Let me think. mCPBA adds across the double bond in an epoxidation reaction. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the epoxide's stereochemistry.

For Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene. The double bond is in the trans configuration. So when mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide. Epoxidation via mCPBA proceeds through an electrocyclic opening, which is a concerted process and thus stereospecific. Wait, no, wait. I think the mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that forms an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. So the E geometry will become a trans epoxide? Or wait, perhaps the opposite. Let me think again. The starting alkene is E, so when mCPBA adds, the two new oxygen atoms will be added in a way that the endo transition state is followed. Oh wait, maybe I should think about the diastereomers.

Wait, no, wait. For an E-alkene, when epoxidized, the resulting epoxide has a certain configuration. Let me think about the actual structure.

Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but wait no. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2
