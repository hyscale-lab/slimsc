Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: There's a planet, let's call it Planet A, with a radius of 1 Earth radius. It's in a circular orbit and has a transit impact parameter of 0.2. It's around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The orbital period of Planet A is 3 days. Now, we're looking for the maximum orbital period of a second planet, Planet B, which has a radius of 2.5 Earth radii. Both planets share the same orbital plane and have circular orbits. The key thing is that Planet B must exhibit both transit and occultation events. So, we need to find the maximum possible period it can have to meet these conditions.

Hmm, okay. I remember that for a planet to transit, its orbit must be aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view. The impact parameter is the measure of how central the transit is. An impact parameter of 0 would mean it's right in front, but a higher value means it's further offâ€”so maybe it's the distance in units of the star's radius, or is it something else?

Wait, the impact parameter 'b' is actually the distance in units of the star's radius, measured at the star's limb. So a transit occurs when the planet's orbit is such that the planet passes in front of the star, but the impact parameter determines how close it is to the center.

But how does this relate to the orbital period and the other planet? Oh wait, the question is about both transit and occultation events. Occultation, as I recall, is when the planet passes behind the star from our perspective. So for both transit and occultation to happen, the orbital plane must be edge-on to us. So the inclination of the orbit needs to be 90 degrees. Because if the orbit is edge-on, we'll see both events.

But wait, both planets are in the same orbital plane, so their orbital planes are already aligned. So the inclination is the same for both. So the first planet's transit tells us something about the system.

Wait, the transit of the first planet occurs with an impact parameter of 0.2, which is the distance from the center of the star.
