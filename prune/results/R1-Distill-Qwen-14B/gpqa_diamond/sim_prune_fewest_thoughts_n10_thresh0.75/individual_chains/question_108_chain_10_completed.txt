Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Oh wait, the setup is that we have a magnetic field B that's parallel to the Oz axis, and it's given as 1 Tesla. The problem mentions small values of m, which I think refers to the orbital magnetic quantum number. Hmm, but wait, wait. The orbital magnetic quantum number is usually denoted by l, right? Or is it m_l? Or wait, maybe m is the magnetic quantum number for spin? No, I think m here refers to the orbital quantum number's magnetic component. Oh wait, no, wait. For orbital angular momentum, the quantum number is l, and m_l is the magnetic quantum number, which can take values from -l to +l in integer steps. But the question says small m, so maybe it's considering m being small, like m=0 or m=1 or something.

Wait, the problem is about paramagnetic coupling. Oh right, paramagnetism arises due to the interaction of an atom's electrons with an external magnetic field. The coupling term is the Zeeman term, which is the energy due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field.

So the paramagnetic coupling term would be something like H' = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = g * μ_B * m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. Wait, but wait, actually, the orbital contribution is μ_orbital = (eħ)/(2m_e) * (l(l+1))^(1/2) * m_l / something? Or is it more accurate to say that the energy shift due to the magnetic field is H' = -μ·B.

But wait, for the hydrogen atom, the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment is given by μ = (μ_B) * m_l, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_l is the magnetic quantum number for the orbital angular momentum. Alternatively, I might be mixing up spin and orbital contributions. The spin part is μ = γ_s S, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, but for orbital angular momentum, it's μ = γ_l L.

Wait, but in the context of the Zeeman effect, the Hamiltonian is H' = -μ·B. So for the orbital case, μ is proportional to L, and for spin, it's proportional to S. But in the problem statement, it's talking about the paramagnetic coupling, which I think refers to the spin-orbit coupling, but wait, no, paramagnetic coupling is due to the spin interacting with the external field. Wait no, paramagnetism is due to the electron's magnetic moment, which includes both orbital and spin contributions. But I think in the hydrogen atom, the predominant contribution comes from the spin, but for higher m, perhaps the orbital is significant. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem states that m is small. So, perhaps m_l is small, like m=0, but wait, no, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, so for hydrogen, the ground state is l=0, so m=0. But higher energy levels have l=1,2 etc. So if m is small, say, m=0, then the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment would be zero. So maybe the paramagnetic coupling term in this case is dominated by the spin part.

Wait, but the problem says "paramagnetic coupling term". Paramagnetic effects come from the spin of the electron, I think. Because the orbital contribution is diamagnetic, which is much smaller. Or wait, diamagnetic is a different effect. Wait. Electrons have both orbital angular momentum and spin. The magnetic moment due to orbital angular momentum is called the orbital magnetic moment, and the one due to spin is the spin magnetic moment. But for hydrogen, the spin magnetic moment is more significant because the 1s orbital has l=0, so the orbital contribution is zero. So in the ground state, the paramagnetic coupling is due to spin.

Wait, but the problem is referring to the paramagnetic coupling term in the general case, not necessarily in a specific state.

So the paramagnetic coupling term is given by the Zeeman Hamiltonian. Let's compute the expectation value of this Hamiltonian, which is H' = -μ·B.

But wait, for an electron, the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor, approximately 2. So for spin, the energy shift is H' = -μ·B = g μ_B B m_s.

But wait, wait, the exact expression for the paramagnetic coupling term is H' = μ_B * B * m_s * something. Alternatively, the energy shift due to the Zeeman effect is ΔE = μ_B * B * m_s.

Wait, but I need to compute the expectation value of H', which would be <H'> = μ_B * B * m_s, if the state is an eigenstate of m_s. Because the spin state in hydrogen can be either up or down, so m_s is ±1/2.

But wait, m is the orbital quantum number. Oh wait, now I'm getting confused. Because the problem mentions m as small. So perhaps it's considering the orbital magnetic quantum number, m_l, being small. But the spin quantum number m_s is either +1/2 or -1/2. So if the problem is considering orbital contributions, but m_l is small, perhaps zero.

Wait, but the question says "small values of m", so perhaps m is m_l, and it's small, like m=0. So for such a state, the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment is zero, but the spin contribution is still there.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the spin magnetic quantum number. But the notation in the problem is a bit unclear. Hmm.

Wait, the question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term (ΔE_p) with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The transition energy has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers, which is the Balmer wavelength, corresponding to a transition from n=2 to n=1, but wait, no, the Balmer series is transitions to n=2. Wait, the wavelength 0.4861 μm is the H-alpha line, which is the transition from n=3 to n=2, emitting a photon in the red part of the spectrum. Oh, wait, 0.4861 micrometers is about 486 nm, which is blue-green, right? Or wait, no, 480 nm is blue, 570 is green, 500 is cyan. So 486 is near the blue end.

Wait, but what's the exact energy corresponding to this wavelength? The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. Let's compute that.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is the speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nm, so 486.1e-9 meters.

So E = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (486.1e-9 m) ≈ (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (486.1e-9 m) ≈ 4.089e-17 J.

Wait, but wait, that's a very small energy. Alternatively, using eV units, since 1 eV ≈ 1.602e-19 J.

So E ≈ 4.089e-17 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 255 eV.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the energy levels of hydrogen are much smaller than that. Wait, wait, let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 1 eV ≈ 1.602e-19 J.

Compute E in eV:

E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9) ) / (1.602e-19)

= (1.9878e-25) / (486.1e-9) ) / (1.602e-19) 

Wait, numerator is 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = approximately 4.089e-19 J.

Then, 4.089e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV.

Wait, that's about 2.55 eV. But hydrogen's energy levels are much smaller. The ground state energy is about -13.6 eV, with transitions being differences of a few eV. So a transition of about 2.55 eV would correspond to a certain wavelength.

Wait, but the Balmer series is n=3 to n=2, which has energy difference about 1.89 eV (since E_n = -13.6 / n² eV). So E_2 = -3.4 eV, E_3 = -1.51 eV.

So the transition energy ΔE is E_2 - E_3 = (-3.4) - (-1.51) = -1.89 eV. The magnitude is 1.89 eV.

Wait, but my calculation earlier got E_photon ≈ 2.55 eV for λ=486 nm.

Wait, that's a discrepancy. Because the energy of the photon should match the transition energy. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, no. The energy of the photon is E_photon = hc/λ, which gives the photon's energy. But the transition energy is the difference between two energy levels. So for the transition from n_i to n_f, ΔE = E_i - E_f. For emission, E_i is higher (more negative), so ΔE is positive.

Wait, let's compute the transition energy for Balmer series, n=3 to n=2.

E_3 = -13.6 eV / (3)^2 = -1.511 eV

E_2 = -13.6 eV / (2)^2 = -3.4 eV

ΔE = E_2 - E_3 = (-3.4 ) - (-1.511 ) = -1.889 eV. The absolute value is 1.889 eV.

But the photon energy E_photon = hc/λ = (12400 eV·nm) / 486.1 nm ≈ 25.5 eV? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 12400 eV·nm is a common approximation for hc in eV·nm. So 12400 / 486.1 ≈ 25.5 eV.

Wait, that's a problem because the transition energy is 1.89 eV, but the photon energy is 25.5 eV. That can't be right. So I must be making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, the energy levels I just computed are in eV. So the transition energy is about 1.89 eV. So the photon emitted should have energy equal to that. So let's compute λ using E=hc/λ.

E = 1.89 eV.

So λ = hc/E = (12400 eV·nm)/(1.89 eV) ≈ 6565 nm, which is 0.6565 micrometers, which is the H-alpha line. Hmm, but the problem states that the wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which is about 486 nm, which corresponds to a higher energy (25.5 eV), which is way higher than the transition energy. That suggests I'm getting confused somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem's given wavelength is for the photon's wavelength, but the transition energy is in the 1.89 eV range. Or perhaps the problem is referring to the Lyman series. Let me think again.

Wait, the Balmer series is transitions to n=2. The first line is n=3→2, which is about 656 nm (red). The next is n=4→2, which is about 486 nm (blue-green). Ah, yes! So the 486 nm line is H-beta, which is n=4→2. So the transition energy would be E_4 - E_2.

E_4 = -13.6 /16 = -0.85 eV.

E_2 is -3.4 eV.

ΔE = (-3.4) - (-0.85) ) = -2.55 eV.

So the magnitude is 2.55 eV. So the energy difference is 2.55 eV. That matches the photon energy when λ is 486 nm: E=25.5 eV? No, wait, wait, no. Wait, 12400 / 486 = ~25.5 eV. But the transition energy is 2.55 eV. So I'm getting conflicting results.

Ah, wait, no, I think I messed up the calculation.

Wait, E = hc / λ. Let's compute it correctly.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

λ = 486.1e-9 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 486.1e-9.

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 486.1e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = 4.088e-19 J.

Convert to eV: 4.088e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV.

Ah, okay, so that matches the transition energy of 2.55 eV (from n=4 to n=2). So the transition energy ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term is given by H' = μ·B. The magnetic moment μ is μ = g μ_B m_s, where g is approximately 2, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is ±1/2.

Wait, but when the magnetic field is applied, the energy shift is ΔE_p = μ_B * B * m_s * g.

Wait, but actually, the Zeeman energy is given by ΔE = μ_B * B * m, where m is the magnetic quantum number. For spin, m can be ±1/2.

Wait, let me get the Bohr magneton value: μ_B = (eħ)/(2 m_e) ≈ 9.274e-24 J/T.

So the paramagnetic coupling term's energy shift is ΔE_p = μ_B * B * m.

But wait, m here is the magnetic quantum number. For spin, m can be ±1/2. So maximum ΔE_p would be μ_B * B * 0.5.

Wait, but the problem says "small values of m", so perhaps m is close to 0, like m=0 for orbital, but for spin, m=±1/2. Hmm, but the question is a bit ambiguous on what m refers to. Oh, wait, the problem says "small m (orbital magnetic quantum number)" — so m is m_l, the orbital magnetic quantum number. So m_l can be from -l to +l. So for small m, perhaps l is 0, making m=0, or l=1, making m=0, ±1.

In that case, for orbital m, the magnetic moment is proportional to m, so if m is small, the energy shift is small.

So, ΔE_p = μ_orbital * B.

But for orbital, μ_orbital = μ_B * m_l.

Wait, no, the orbital magnetic moment is given by μ_orbital = (μ_B) * m_l, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. So the energy shift is H' = -μ_orbital · B. Since B is along Oz, it's H' = -μ_B * m_l * B.

So, the expectation value of H' is μ_B * B * m_l.

Wait, no, it's negative, but the magnitude is what matters for the comparison. So |ΔE_p| = μ_B * B * |m_l|.

Given that B=1 T and m_l is small, say m_l=0 or 1.

Let me compute ΔE_p for m_l=1.

μ_B ≈ 9.274e-24 J/T.

B=1 T.

m_l=1.

So ΔE_p = 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T * 1 = 9.274e-24 J.

Convert that to eV: 9.274e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.79e-5 eV ≈ 5.8e-5 eV.

Wait, that's a very small energy shift compared to the transition energy of 2.55 eV.

Alternatively, if m_l is zero, then ΔE_p is zero, which is even smaller.

But wait, the problem says "small values of m", so even if m is 1, the paramagnetic coupling term is way smaller than the transition energy.

So now, putting it all together.

The transition energy is about 2.55 eV. The paramagnetic coupling term is about 5.8e-5 eV, which is about three orders of magnitude smaller.

So the paramagnetic coupling term is much less than the transition energy. So <H> (the expectation value of the paramagnetic term) is much less than ΔE.

Wait, but the question says "compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy ΔE of Hydrogen atom with wavelength λ=0.4861 μm."

So ΔE is the transition energy, which is 2.55 eV. The paramagnetic term is about 5.8e-5 eV, which is much smaller. So <H> << ΔE.

Looking at the options:

A) ⟨H⟩ = ΔE → Not the case.

B) ⟨H⟩ >> ΔE → No, it's smaller.

C) ⟨H⟩ << ΔE → Yes.

D) ⟨H⟩ > ΔE → No.

So the correct answer is C.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters and compute the relevant energies.

### Transition Energy
The transition energy \( \Delta E \) corresponds to the energy difference between two hydrogen atom energy levels. The wavelength of the emitted photon is given as \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 486.1 \, \text{nm} \). The energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

Using \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 486.1 \, \text{nm} = 486.1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{486.1 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 4.089 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{4.089 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}
\]

This matches the energy difference for the transition from \( n = 4 \) to \( n = 2 \) in the hydrogen atom.

### Paramagnetic Coupling Term
The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the electron's magnetic moment with the external magnetic field \( \vec{B} \). The energy shift due to this interaction is given by:

\[
\Delta E_p = \mu_B \cdot B \cdot m_l
\]

Here:
- \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton,
- \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \) is the magnetic field strength,
- \( m_l \) is the orbital magnetic quantum number.

For small values of \( m_l \), such as \( m_l = 0 \) or \( m_l = 1 \), the energy shift is:

\[
\Delta E_p = \mu_B \cdot B \cdot |m_l|
\]

Taking \( m_l = 1 \) (the maximum small value), we compute:

\[
\Delta E_p = (9.274 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}
\]

Converting to electron volts:

\[
\Delta E_p \approx \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Comparison
The transition energy \( \Delta E \) is approximately \( 2.55 \, \text{eV} \), while the paramagnetic coupling term \( \Delta E_p \) is approximately \( 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \). This shows that the paramagnetic coupling term is three orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy:

\[
\Delta E_p \ll \Delta E
\]

### Conclusion
The paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy of the hydrogen atom. Therefore, the correct option is:

**Answer: C**
