Okay, so I have this problem about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says there are two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, orbiting a star. Both detection methods, transit and radial velocity, found them. The star's parameters are given: mass 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. 

Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. 

The problem gives some data about the Doppler shifts they cause. Planet1 induces a shift of 0.03 Å, and Planet2 causes a 0.04 Å shift in the same forbidden line. The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. The options are A to D.

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors. The formula I remember is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo)/ (1 + epsilon) )^(1/2), but I might be mixing up some terms. Or wait, the basic formula for equilibrium temperature without considering albedo is T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (L / (16π²σ a²)) ... No, wait, maybe I should think in terms of the inverse square law and the planet's distance.

Alternatively, the equilibrium temperature is given by:

Te = T_s * (R_s / (2a)) ^ (1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recall. The star emits energy, and the planet absorbs some of it. The equilibrium temperature comes from the balance between absorbed energy and emitted energy.

The formula I think is:

Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4)

But wait, I think the correct formula is:

Te = T_s * sqrt( (R_s) / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4)

Wait, but wait. Another approach: The flux from the star at the planet's distance is F = L_s / (4π a²). The planet's cross-sectional area is π R_p², so the absorbed power is F * π R_p² * (1 - A) /4. Hmm, because the planet reflects A (albedo) of the light. So the absorbed power is (L_s/(4π a²)) * π R_p² (1 - A) /4.

The planet emits as a blackbody: 4π R_p² σ Te^4. So setting them equal:

(L_s/(4π a²)) * π R_p² (1 - A)/4 = 4π R_p² σ Te^4.

Simplify this:

L_s * (1 - A) / (16 a²) = 4 σ Te^4.

Wait, solving for Te:

Te^4 = (L_s (1 - A)) / (64 σ a² )

But L_s, the star's luminosity, can be expressed in terms of its radius and effective temperature: L_s = 4 π R_s² σ T_s^4.

So substituting:

Te^4 = (4 π R_s² σ T_s^4 (1 - A)) / (64 σ a² )

Simplify:

Te^4 = (π R_s² T_s^4 (1 - A) ) / (16 a² )

Take the fourth root:

Te = T_s * ( R_s / (2 a ) )^(1/2 ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

Ah, right. So the formula is:

Te = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

But wait, the problem states that both planets have the same albedo, so (1 - A) is the same for both
