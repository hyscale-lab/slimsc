Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal, so a, b, c are the same. But wait, no, I think that's actually a cubic system. No, wait, rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal crystal system? Or is it separate? Hmm, maybe I should clarify that. Oh right, rhombohedral is part of the cubic system when a = b = c but with angles different from 90 degrees. So in this case, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each. The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane.

I remember that the interplanar distance (d) in a crystal is calculated using the formula derived from the Bragg law, which relates the crystal's structure to the diffraction angles. The formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos β) + 2(hl cos γ) + 2(kl cos α) )) )... Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I should think of the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal lattice.

For a general crystal system, the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk\cos\beta) - 2(hl\cos\gamma) - 2(kl\cos\alpha) ) } }

Wait, wait, maybe I got the signs wrong. Alternatively, I think the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2hk \cos \alpha + 2hl \cos \beta + 2kl \cos \gamma } }

Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Because I remember that for a cubic system (where all angles are 90 degrees), the formula simplifies to d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²). So that must mean in the general case, the denominator is the square root
