Okay, let's try to figure out this astronomy problem. Hmm, so the question is about stars and the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels when the star has spots versus when it doesn't.

First, the star has 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When there's no spots, its Teff is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that happen? Oh, right, because the spots are cooler. So the presence of spots lowers the average effective temperature of the star.

Now, the key part is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—so when the star is spotless, what's the ratio compared to when it has spots?

In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Wait, but the question mentions the transition wavelength is about 1448 Å. Let me think about that. The energy difference between the two levels would be related to the photon's energy. Since wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is about 0.1448 nm. Using E = hc/λ. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. So E would be (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-10 m) = let's calculate that.

Wait, 1448 Å is 1.448e-7 meters. So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) ≈ (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.372e-18 J per photon. But to get it in terms of k*T, since k is Boltzmann's constant, about 1.38e-23 J/K.

So E/(k*T) = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * T). Let's compute that for T=6000 K and T=5500 K.

Wait, but wait. The ratio of the number of atoms in two levels depends on the temperature. Since the ratio is n1/n2, and the question says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. That suggests that when the spots are present (lower Teff), the ratio is lower than when spots are not present (higher Teff). So the ratio when without spots (higher T) is higher than when with spots (lower T).

So, R = (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1. So as T decreases, the exponential term decreases, so the ratio R decreases. Which matches the observation.

So, to find the factor, let's compute R1 (no spots) / R2 (with spots).

R1 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) )
R2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) )

So R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, let me see: because R1/R2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))]/[exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Because when you divide the exponents, you subtract them. So, -ΔE/(k T1) - (-ΔE/(k T2)) ) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1).

So, that's the exponent. Let's compute that.

But wait, because ΔE is E2 - E1. Let me get back to the energy. The transition from level 1 to level 2 is 1448 Å. So the photon emitted has energy E=hc/λ. But in the Boltzmann equation, the energy difference is E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

So, let's compute ΔE/(k) in units of temperature. Because we're interested in (ΔE/(k)) which is in Kelvin when divided by k.

Wait, actually, (E)/(k) would be in terms of K. Let me compute that.

E = hc/λ.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
λ = 1448e-10 m (since 1 Å = 1e-10 m)

E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

Now, E/(k) = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ (1.372 / 1.38 ) * 1e5 K ≈ approximately 1e5 K. Wait wait, 1.372e-18 / 1.38e-23 is (1.372/1.38) * 1e5 ≈
