Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let's try to work through it step by step. Hmm, alright, the question gives me a Lagrangian term and some mass information. My goal is to find out which decay channels are kinematically allowed.

First, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) [v + X(y)] ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse this more carefully. The term seems to describe the interaction between the boson X and some fermions. Oh right, in the Standard Model, the Yukawa interaction usually looks like L = -λ ψ̄ ϕ ψ, where ϕ is a scalar field, which in this case is X. So here, X is the boson, and the fermions ψ are interacting with it.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So I need to determine which fermions can be produced when X decays. Remember that for a decay to be allowed kinematically, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermions it's decaying into. Because when a particle decays into two particles, each must have energy at least equal to their rest mass energy, so the sum must be less than or equal to the mass of the decaying particle.

So the first thing I need to do is figure out the masses of all the possible fermions that could be decay products. Let's list the fermions and their masses:

- Up quark (u): mass about 2 MeV
- Down quark (d): around 4-5 MeV
- Strange quark (s): about 100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): approximately 1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): around 4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV. So X is only 6 GeV, so the top is out.

Then the leptons:
- Electron (e-): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ-): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ-): ~1.78 GeV
- The neutrinos are even lighter, but in this case, the interaction term doesn't have neutrinos, so maybe they're not considered here. Also, the problem doesn't list neutrinos in the options, so perhaps they're irrelevant.

Now, considering the decay X → f f̄, the maximum mass each fermion can be is m_f * 2 ≤ m_X. So m_X is 6 GeV. Let's see:

For quarks:
- u and d: even 2*(2 MeV) is 4 MeV, which is much less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, etc.
Wait, but wait about the s quark. The strange quark is around 100 MeV. So 2*100 MeV = 200 MeV, which is 0.2 GeV. 6 GeV is way larger than that. So s s-bar is allowed.

But the bottom quark is around 4.5 GeV. So 2 * 4.5 GeV = 9 GeV. But X is only 6 GeV. So 9 GeV > 6 GeV, so X can't decay into b b-bar. Similarly, top quark is way heavier, so no.

So possible quarks are u, d, s, c (since 2c is 3 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV). Wait, charm quarks are 1.5 GeV each, so 3 GeV total. So X can decay into c c-bar.

Wait, but what about the other fermions, like leptons? Let me check their masses.

Electron is 0.5 MeV → 2*0.5 = 1 MeV << 6 GeV → allowed.
Muon: ~105.7 MeV → 2*105.7 = 211.4 MeV, which is 0.2114 GeV << 6 GeV → allowed.
Tau: 1.78 GeV → 2*1.78 = 3.56 GeV < 6 GeV → so tau pairs are allowed.

So the possible decay channels would involve pairs of u, d, s, c, or leptons (e, mu, tau) plus their antiparticles.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A) X→b b-bar, s s-bar, u u, d d, tau, e+ e−
But wait, X
