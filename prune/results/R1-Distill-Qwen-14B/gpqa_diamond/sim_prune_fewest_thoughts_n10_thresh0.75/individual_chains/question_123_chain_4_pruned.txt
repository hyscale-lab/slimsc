Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a supernova and the motion of its ejecta. Hmm, let's see. Alright, let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The problem asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, wait. So, we have two frames here. The Galaxy's frame (let's call it S) and the ejecta's frame (S'). In S, the ejecta is moving towards the center. In S', the Galaxy's center is moving towards the ejecta. So it's like they're moving towards each other.

But wait, the problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So, in S', the Galaxy is approaching at v = 60,000 km/s. Since they are inertial frames, we can apply special relativity here, probably using the Lorentz transformations or the velocity addition formula.

Wait, but the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, time in S' is t' = 50 seconds. We need to find the distance in S
