Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that cyclohexanone undergoes a series of reactions, and I need to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product, product 4. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

Hmm, so let's break down each step. I'll take it one reaction at a time and figure out what's happening.

First reaction: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine to form product 1. I remember that ketones can undergo various additions, but bromine... wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. When you add bromine to a ketone, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. Oh wait, no, waitâ€”bromine is an electrophilic reagent. So in the presence of a ketone, like in the haloform reaction? Or maybe it's an alpha bromination.

Wait, no, the haloform reaction is when you have a methyl ketone, like acetone, and you treat it with a halogen in the presence of a base. But cyclohexanone isn't a methyl ketone; it's a cyclic ketone. So, maybe it's a different reaction.

Oh wait, when a ketone is treated with bromine, it can undergo a 1,2-addition or maybe a 1,4-addition. Or perhaps it's a conjugate addition. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromination at the alpha position. Oh right, the alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to the carbonyl) are more reactive because of the partial positive charge.

So cyclohexanone has alpha hydrogens. When treated with bromine (Br2), probably in an acidic condition, it undergoes alpha bromination. So product 1 is 1-bromocyclohexanone, but wait, the position of Br would be on one of the alpha carbons. Wait, cyclohexanone has two equivalent alpha positions because of the symmetry. So the product would have a Br on one of the two equivalent alpha carbons.

Wait, cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone group. The alpha carbons are the two adjacent to the carbonyl. Each has two H's (since it's a cyclohexane ring
