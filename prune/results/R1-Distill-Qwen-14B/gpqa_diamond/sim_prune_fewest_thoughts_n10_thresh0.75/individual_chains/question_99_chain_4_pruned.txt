Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. Hmm, I remember that different functional groups have characteristic peaks in IR, so I should start there.

The FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, carboxylic acids have a broad peak because the O-H is more acidic and easily dissociates, causing a broader and possibly stronger absorption. Also, the strong peak at 1700 cm^-1 is likely a carbonyl group, probably a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids also have a carbonyl around 1700. However, if the O-H is present, that would fit a carboxylic acid. So maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several peaks, but none are vinyl hydrogens. So no double bonds with adjacent hydrogens, which rules out any alkenes. The signals include a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets. Those splitting patterns suggest that the hydrogens are neighboring to multiple sets of neighboring hydrogens. Let me think about splitting patterns. Each split comes from neighboring Hs. So a doublet implies two neighboring groups, a triplet three, etc.

Wait, a quartet is four peaks, which comes from three neighboring Hs, like in a CH2 group next to another CH2. But the first signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Let's break that down. So each step is a split. So first, it's a doublet (maybe from one neighbor), then each of those splits into triplets (another neighbor?), and each of those splits into quartets (another set). That's a complex splitting, probably from being next to multiple different groups.

The second signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, similar idea but each step has a different split. So maybe each of these signals is from a CH group that's connected to different types of CH groups.

Looking at the options, all four compounds end with COOH, which is a carboxylic acid. So that explains the IR peaks. Let's look at their structures.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure is something like this: the central part is two CH groups, each attached to a methyl and an ethyl group. Then a CH2 connected to COOH. So perhaps the structure is CH2-C(CH3)(C2H5)-C(CH3)(C2H5)-CH2COOH? No, wait, the formula is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the main chain is CH2COOH, with two central CH groups each attached to a methyl and ethyl group.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(CH3)COOH. Wait, let me parse that. So maybe the structure is CH2CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no, maybe it's CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the main chain is CH2CH2, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's a four-carbon chain, with substituents.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So it's a central part where each CH is attached to two methyl groups. Then a CH2 connected to COOH. So maybe the structure is (CH(CH3)2)2-CH2-COOH.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So perhaps the structure is CH2CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. Wait, but that would be similar to B but with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structures are more about branching. Let me try to draw the structures.

Option A: The molecule is CH3-C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2COOH. So the central part is two CH groups, each connected to an ethyl and a methyl group, and the CH2 is at the end leading to COOH.

Option B: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(CH3) - COOH. So the main chain is longer, perhaps a three-carbon chain, with substituents.

Option C: CH3-C(H)(CH3
