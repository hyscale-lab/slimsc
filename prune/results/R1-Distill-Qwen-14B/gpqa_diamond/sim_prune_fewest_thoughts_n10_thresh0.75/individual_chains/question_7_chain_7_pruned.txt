Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with photons from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to produce electron-positron pairs. The process is gamma gamma → e+ e-. And the question is, from what energy gamma-rays would their lifetimes in the universe be limited by this process? The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV.

Hmm, I remember that high-energy particles can interact with the CMB photons. For very high-energy gamma-rays, their mean free path would be short because they annihilate with the CMB photons. So the lifetime of the gamma-rays would be limited by this process when the probability of annihilation becomes significant over the age of the universe.

Wait, the mean lifetime is related to the mean free path. The mean free path is the average distance a photon travels before interacting. So the lifetime τ is the mean free path λ divided by the speed of light c, right? Because lifetime is distance divided by speed.

But wait, actually, the mean free path is the average distance between interactions. So the time it takes is λ/c. So τ = λ/(c). But the question is about the energy where this process limits the lifetime. So I need to find the energy of the gamma-ray where the interaction rate is such that the mean free path becomes small enough that the gamma-ray can't travel far without annihilating.

The interaction rate Γ is the probability per unit time of annihilation. So τ is 1/Γ. So I need to calculate Γ for the process γ + γ → e+ + e-.

The cross-section for this process is a function of the center-of-mass energy. I remember that for pair production of e+ e- via γγ interactions, the threshold occurs when the center-of-mass energy is at least 2 m_e c^2, since you need to produce an electron and a positron. The electron mass is about 0.511 MeV, so 2 times that is about 1.022 MeV. But wait, the CMB photons have much lower energy than that, so how does that work?

Wait, no, the individual photons
