Okay, so I have this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-. So an antiproton and a proton annihilate each other and produce two A+ particles and two A- particles. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as 300 MeV. The question is asking for the velocity of particle A. The options are A) 0.77c, B) 0.96c, C) 0.91c, D) 0.86c.

Wait, let's break this down. Annihilation usually involves converting mass into energy, like in particle physics. But here, both the proton and antiproton are annihilating and producing these A particles. Since they're asking about the velocity of A, I think I need to use some relativity equations, probably involving energy and momentum conservation.

But wait, the antiproton is moving slowly. That probably means its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So maybe the problem is non-relativistic? Or perhaps it's just important in terms of the initial momentum.

Wait, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Proton's rest mass is about 938 MeV, I think. The antiproton should also have the same mass as the proton because they're antiparticles. So each has a rest energy of about 938 MeV. The A particles have mass 300 Me
