Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably E2, to form an alkene. So heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH would likely produce an alkene. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1.

Looking at the NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, the IR has an absorbance at 1720 cm-1. Wait, IR at 1720 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. But wait, the first reaction was elimination, so why a carbonyl?

Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Oh wait, another possibility: when dihalides react with excess KOH, especially in certain conditions, like maybe via a different mechanism. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but for a dihalide, perhaps it would form an epoxide? No, epoxides are from alkenes reacting with peracids.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the reagents. KOH in the presence of an alcohol could cause elimination, but if the dihalide is 1,3-dibromo, perhaps it's undergoing an elimination twice? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction. But with KOH, substitution would require a good leaving group, but I think in such a case, with two bromines, perhaps it's a double elimination or perhaps a ring-opening.

Wait, another thought: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is an adamantane derivative. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So 1,3-dibromo would have Brs on two adjacent carbons. When heated with KOH, maybe it's undergoing dehydrohalogenation twice to form a diene? No, because that would require two eliminations. But then the IR shows a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but rather a substitution. Wait, if KOH is in a certain condition, maybe it's an SN2 substitution. But with two Brs, perhaps it's an exchange reaction, but that would form a different structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that's for amines.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible products. The IR at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a ketone. So perhaps the product is an epoxide or a ketone. Oh wait, no, epoxides are from alkenes and peracids. Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a ketone. How?

Wait, adamant
