Okay, I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, so the setup is about an electron and a positron annihilating each other, producing two photons. I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and in this case, both photons have the same energy. Interesting.

Wait, the question is about the angle between the two photons. Both have the same energy, and their directions are measured as upper-right and lower-right. I think I remember something about conservation of momentum here. Because when particles annihilate, momentum must be conserved. Oh right, because in an isolated system, the total momentum before equals the total after.

Let me think about the initial setup. So, an electron is moving from the left along the horizontal axis with a Lorentz factor of 4. Lorentz factor, gamma, is the factor by which time and lengths dilate. The positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. Wait, but positron is the antimatter counterpart of the electron, so same mass but opposite charge.

Hmm, I should probably calculate their momenta. Oh, but wait, electrons and positrons have the same mass, so their relativistic momenta depend on their velocities.

Wait, the Lorentz factor gamma is equal to E/(m cÂ²). And the momentum p is gamma * m * v. So for each particle, I can write their momentum vectors.

Wait, but the electron and positron are moving in opposite directions along the horizontal axis. So their momenta are opposite in direction. So the total initial momentum would be the sum of their momenta.

Let me make sure I get the directions right. The electron is moving to the right (from left), and the positron is moving to the left (from right). Because they're moving towards each other. So if I take the positive x-direction as to the right, the electron has positive momentum, and the positron has negative momentum.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left. So it's going to the right. The positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right, so it's going to the left. So their momenta are in opposite directions.

But since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its momentum is
