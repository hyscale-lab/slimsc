Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule switching energy states when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Wait, wait. In the rotation-vibration model, the energy states are quantized, right? So the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be the first vibrational level and the lowest rotational level. Oh wait, wait! No, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) with the lowest rotational state (J=0). So when it absorbs a photon, it needs to move to the next possible state. But what's the next state? Because in these models, transitions can involve both vibrational and rotational changes.

Wait, the question says it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which suggests that the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. So the energy levels are given by the sum of the rotational energy and the vibrational energy.

In the fundamental state, the molecule is in the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So v=0 and J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would probably involve the first excited vibrational state (v=1), but maybe it could also involve a change in rotation. But I'm not sure. Oh wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the one with the next higher energy, which would be the first excited state, which could be either a change in vibration or rotation.

Wait, but in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are E_rot = (ħ² / (2I)) J(J+1), where I is the moment of inertia. And for the vibration, the energy levels are E_vib = (1/2) ħω + ħω v, where v is the vibrational quantum number (v=0,1,2...).

So the total energy would be the sum of these. The fundamental state is v=0 and J=0, so E_total = (1/2) ħω + 0 (since J=
