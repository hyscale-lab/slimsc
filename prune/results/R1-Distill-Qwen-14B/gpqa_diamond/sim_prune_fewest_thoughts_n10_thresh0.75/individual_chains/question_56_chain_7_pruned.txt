Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transition probabilities. Hmm, I remember that electrons can transition between energy levels, emitting or absorbing photons, and these transitions are described by quantum numbers. The question is about the |3,0,0> state decaying to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I need to find the correct transition route and the probability.

Wait, the notation is |n, l, m>, right? So the initial state has n=3, l=0 (which makes it an s orbital), and m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. So the electron is dropping from n=3 to n=1, but via two transitions. That means it goes through an intermediate state.

Dipole transitions have selection rules. I think the selection rules for the hydrogen atom are that Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So from l=0 (s orbital), the first transition must go to l=1 (p orbital). So the intermediate state will have l=1.

So the initial state is 3s (n=3, l=0). Possible transitions would go to 2p or 4p? Wait, but 4p is higher than 3s, so if we're decaying, it should go to lower states. So the first transition is from 3s to 2p or maybe 3p? Wait, but 3p would be same n, higher l. Hmm, no, wait, dipole transitions from 3s can go to any l=1 state with appropriate n. But since we're going from 3s to 1s, perhaps the intermediate is a 2p state. Because 3s→2p→1s.

So the first transition is 3s → 2p, then 2p → 1s. Now, what about the m values? The initial m is 0. For dipole transitions, the change in m can be -1, 0, +1.

So from m=0, the first transition can go to m= -1, 0, +1. But the second transition has to bring it back to m=0 in the final state.

Wait, but the final state is m=0. So the first transition can go to any m, but the second transition must adjust it back to m=0. Let's think about possible ways.

First transition: 3s (m=0) → 2p (m can be -1, 0, +1). Then, from 2p (say m = m1), go to 1s (m=0). So the second transition must have Δm = 0 - m1. So m1 can be 0, -1, +1.

Wait, but the second transition is from 2p to 1s. So the 2p state has l=1, so m can be -1, 0, +1. The 1s has l=0, so m must be 0. So, for the second transition, the m must change by Δm = 0 - m1. So the possible m1 values are -1, 0
