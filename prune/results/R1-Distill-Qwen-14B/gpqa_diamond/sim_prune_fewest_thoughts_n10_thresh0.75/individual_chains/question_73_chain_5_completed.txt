Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. So, I need to find two things: the relative speed and the total energy.

First, relative speed. Wait, in classical mechanics, relative speed would just be the difference, like 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. But wait, no, that's only true at non-relativistic speeds. At relativistic speeds, velocities don't just subtract like that. Oh right, I remember there's a formula for adding velocities in special relativity. The formula is v = (u - v') / (1 - (u*v')/c²). But wait, no, actually, I think I have that wrong. Let me get it right. Oh, right, if two objects are moving at speeds u and v in the same direction, the relative speed from the perspective of someone in the u frame is (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/(c^2)).

Wait no, no, wait another moment. The formula for velocity addition is for when you're adding two velocities. Like, if one object is moving at u relative to the other, which is moving at v relative to the observer. So the formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/c²). But in this case, both are moving in the same direction, so maybe I should subtract. Let me think.

Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the relative speed between the two astronauts. So we need to find how fast one is moving relative to the other. So let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, both in the same direction. From A's frame, what's B's speed?

In that case, the relative velocity formula would be (u' - v')/(1 - (u'v')/(c²)). Wait, wait no, no—actually, if A is moving at u relative to the lab frame, which is 0.6c, and B is moving at v relative to the lab frame, 0.5c, then in A's frame, B's speed is (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)).

Wait, wait, but if B is moving slower than A in the same direction, then from A's perspective, B is moving backwards? No, wait, no. Wait, both are moving in the same direction, so in the lab frame, A is faster. So from A's frame, B is moving at a speed that's 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c, but that would be in the opposite direction. Wait, but that's not right, because in relativity, the relative speed isn't just the difference.

So the correct approach is to use the velocity addition formula. So if the lab frame has A moving at u=0.6c and B moving at v=0.5c, then in A's frame, B's speed is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)).

Plugging in the numbers: (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, wait, the denominator: the product of u and v is 0.6c * 0.5c = 0.3 c². So denominator becomes 1 - (0.3 c² / c²) ) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

Numerators: 0.5 - 0.6 is -0.1 c. So overall, (-0.1 c)/0.7 = approximately -0.1428 c. But since speed is positive, the magnitude is 0.1428 c, so about 0.14c. So relative speed is 0.14c. Wait, but wait, why is it negative? Because in A's frame, B is moving backward if A is moving faster. But the relative speed would be the magnitude, so 0.14c.

So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Hmm. The total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut.

Each astronaut's energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c): gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the mass is 2m, so E1 = gamma * (2m) c². So yes, 1.25 * 2 = 2.5.

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma2 is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c², approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and relative speed 0.14c. So option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, what's the reference frame for the energies? Because the question says 'the total energy of the system.' Hmm, in relativity, the total energy depends on the reference frame. Oh wait, wait. The problem says 'the total energy of the system.' But in the absence of a specific frame, is it considering the center-of-momentum frame, or perhaps the lab frame? Hmm.

Wait, the problem doesn't specify the frame for the energy, but in the options, the energies are given in terms of mc². So it's probably taking the energies in the lab frame, since each astronaut's energy is considered in their own motion relative to the lab.

Wait, but the question says 'the total energy of the system.' Hmm, but in relativity, the total energy of a system is not just the sum of their energies unless you're considering a specific frame. So perhaps the question is considering the energies as measured in the lab frame.

Alternatively, perhaps it's considering the total rest mass plus their kinetic energies? But that's a bit unclear. But looking at the options, option C gives 5.96 mc². Let's calculate that again.

E1: 2m * gamma1.

Gamma1 for 0.6c: (0.6)^2 = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. So gamma1=1/0.8=1.25. So 2m * 1.25 = 2.5 m.

E2: 3m * gamma2. Gamma2 is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈1.1547. So 3 * 1.1547 ≈ 3.464 m.

Total E = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m. So 5.96 m c².

So the options: Option C is velocity 0.14c, E=5.96 mc². So that matches.

So looking back, the options are:

C) v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2.

So the correct answer should be C.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is not simply the difference of their speeds. Instead, the relativistic velocity addition formula is used:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v - u}{1 - \frac{vu}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( v = 0.6c \) (speed of the first astronaut) and \( u = 0.5c \) (speed of the second astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7
\]

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the magnitude of the relative speed is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of the First Astronaut
Mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of the Second Astronaut
Mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options:

- **A)** Incorrect: Relative speed is \( 1.1c \), which is not possible.
- **B)** Incorrect: Relative speed is \( 0.1c \), which is too low.
- **C)** Correct: Relative speed \( 0.14c \), total energy \( 5.96m c^2 \).
- **D)** Incorrect: Total energy \( 5m c^2 \), which is too low.

**Answer: C**
