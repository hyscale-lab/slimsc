Okay, so I have this question about a transmission electron microscope and the mean free path of gas molecules. Hmm, let me try to unpack this.

So, Mike created a ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, but some gas molecules are still there. He measures the mean free path as λ1. Then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices the mean free path changes to λ2. The question is, what can we conclude about λ2 compared to λ1?

Wait, mean free path... I remember that the mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the gas molecules. The formula I think is λ = 1/(√2 n π d²), where n is the number density and d is the diameter of the molecules.

In an electron microscope, the vacuum is super good, but not perfect. So when Mike starts the electron beam, what's happening? Oh, right, the electron beam has a high energy. High-energy electrons can interact with the gas molecules. So, maybe the gas molecules are getting charged?

Wait, electrons are being shot, right? So the gas molecules might get ionized. When a gas molecule is ionized, it becomes charged. Charged particles would interact more with the electric fields, but in this case, it's about scattering. Or maybe, since the ionized molecules are charged, they would have more collisions because like, they can stick to the walls or the sample more, or perhaps the electrons are causing them to change their movement.

Wait, the mean free path is inversely proportional to pressure. So if the pressure increases, the mean free path decreases. But in this case, the pressure was already at ultra-high vacuum. So why did the mean free path change when the electron beam was turned on?

Oh, I think when the electron beam is on, it can cause the gas molecules to ionize. So, the gas becomes a plasma? Or at least some of the molecules get ionized. If the gas is neutral, their mean free path is λ1. But when they're ionized, they might have a different behavior.

Wait, but the electron beam is moving through the gas. High-energy electrons can cause two things: one, ionization of the gas molecules, and two, scattering of the electrons off the gas molecules. But the question is about the mean free path of the
