Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let me try to think it through. So, the question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting the value 0. The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). And the matrix P is given too.

Wait, right, in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices because they have real eigenvalues, which correspond to the possible measurement results. So the first thing I should do is check if P is Hermitian. Oh wait, but maybe that's not necessary right now. The problem is about the probability, so I need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P, especially the eigenvalue 0, and then see the overlap with the given state.

The state vector is given as a column vector: let's denote it as |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. To find the probability of measuring 0, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 of the matrix P. Then, the probability is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between |ψ> and each eigenvector. Or wait, more accurately, for each eigenvector |v> corresponding to eigenvalue 0, compute |<v|ψ>|² and sum them up if there are multiple such eigenvectors.

So first, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Let's write down matrix P:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0
Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

Hmm, that's a 3x3 matrix. Let's denote P as:

[ 0      a       0 ]
[ a      0       a ]
[ 0      a       0 ]

where a = 1/√2. 

I need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. The characteristic equation is det(P - λI) = 0.

So let's compute the determinant of:

[ -λ    a      0   ]
[ a    -λ     a    ]
[ 0     a    -λ
