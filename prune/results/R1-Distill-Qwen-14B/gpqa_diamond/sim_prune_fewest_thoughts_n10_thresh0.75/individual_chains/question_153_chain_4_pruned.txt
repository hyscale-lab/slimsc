Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about the Michael addition reactions. I remember that the Michael addition involves the attack of a nucleophile on an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is usually an enolate ion. So, in each of these parts (A, B, C), I have to figure out what the reactants are and what the major products would be.

Let's look at the first reaction (A): dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, and the reagent is NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). So, this seems like a Michael addition setup.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. The structure of dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. When treated with a strong base like NaOEt, it would deprotonate to form an enolate. The enolate would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which in this case is the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but wait no. Wait, wait. Let me draw it out. (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but the substituents would be on the double bond. Wait, no. The correct structure is probably CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. Let's think: the acrylate is CH2=CH- something. Oh wait, the correct structure for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)COOCH3. So the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So the structure is CH2=CHâ€“C(O)OCH3, but actually, the substit
