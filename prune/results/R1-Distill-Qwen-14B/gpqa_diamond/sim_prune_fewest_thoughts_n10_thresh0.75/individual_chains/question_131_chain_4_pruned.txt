Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

Okay, the problem is about a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that's dehydrated to form an anhydride. Then this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products—a major and minor—both with molecular formula C13H16O3. The 2D NOESY NMR of the major has a cross-peak, but the minor doesn't. We need to find which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

Hmm. Let's break this down. First, the initial compound: a cis-dicarboxylic acid. When dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR data is given. 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. 13C NMR has peaks at 137 and 165 ppm. Wait, what do those carbons correspond to?

The 13C NMR: 165 ppm is probably a carbonyl group, like an anhydride or ester. 137 ppm is likely a carbon adjacent to a double bond. So maybe the anhydride has a structure where two carbonyl groups are present, perhaps with a conjugated double bond or similar.

Wait, wait. The 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, which is a region where aromatic protons or perhaps an alpha proton adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (like carbonyl) might appear. But since it's a singlet, maybe it's a group of equivalent protons near a carbonyl.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The anhydride's structure: a dicarboxylic anhydride. The starting material was a cis-dicarboxylic acid. Dehydration forms the cyclic anhydride. The structure would have two carbonyl groups connected by a bridge, maybe a five-membered ring? Or perhaps a six-membered? But wait, in the 13C NMR, there are two peaks: 1
