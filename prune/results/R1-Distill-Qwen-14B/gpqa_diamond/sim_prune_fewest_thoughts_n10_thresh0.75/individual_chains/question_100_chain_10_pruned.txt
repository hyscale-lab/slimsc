Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about a series of reactions starting with compound A, which is C3H6. I remember that C3H6 is propene or propylene. But wait, wait, propene is C3H6? No, wait, propene is C3H6? Let me check. Yeah, propene is CH₂=CHCH₃, so molecular formula is C3H6. So compound A is propene.

The first reaction is bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Oh, right, that's a typical bromination of alkenes using Br2 with CCl4 as a solvent. So propene (CH₂=CHCH₃) would undergo addition reaction with Br2. The reaction is a dibromination across the double bond. So compound B would be 1,2-dibromopropane? Or wait, propene has three carbons. So adding Br2 across the double bond would give 1,2-dibromopropane. So structure would be BrCH₂CHBrCH3? Wait, no, wait. Propene is CH₂=CH2CH3? No, wait, no, propene is CH₂=CHCH3. So adding Br2 would add across the double bond. So the product would be 1,2-dibromopropane: BrCH₂-CHBr-CH3? Or wait, maybe it's 1,2-dibromopentane. Wait, no. Wait, the formula: propene is C3H6. Adding Br2 (which is adding two Br atoms) would give C3H5Br2. So 1,2-dibromopropane is correct.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, so that's probably an elimination reaction. Oh wait, but wait, B is 1,2-dibromopropane. So when treated with alcoholic KOH, it would undergo dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but it's 1,2-dibromopropane. So elimination would occur between the two adjacent Br atoms. So removing H from one of the adjacent carbons and the Br from the other. So the product would be propene again, but wait, wait. Let me think. The structure is BrCH2-CHBr-CH3. If we eliminate H
