Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done with GFP-tagged proteins. Hmm, let me try to break this down. 

So the setup is that they've tagged inner capsid proteins with GFP and given them to mice orally. Then they observed fluorescence issues in the stomach and intestines. But they found the fluorescent Peyer's patches and isolated the proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain gene, there was high variability. The question is about which process is happening.

Wait, I remember that Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). They're specialized for sampling antigens from the intestinal lumen, right? So when you give something orally, the antigens are taken up by these patches.

The GFP is on the inner capsid proteins. Rotavirus is a virus that infects the small intestine, so the proteins would probably be processed in the gut. But in this experiment, some GFP was destroyed by stomach acid. Stomach acid is hydrochloric acid, which can break down proteins. So the proteins that survive might be the ones that reach the intestines and get taken up by the immune system.

The GFP-tagged proteins that made it to the Peyer's patches would be processed there. The isolated proliferating cells are likely B cells because Peyer's patches contain B cells that are part of the immune response. High variability in the variable heavy chain gene suggests that each B cell has a different antibody, which makes me think of the immune response process.

Wait, what processes cause variability in the variable regions of antibodies? I recall that during B cell development, there are a few key processes. The primary one is VDJ recombination, which happens during the early stages of B cell development in the bone marrow. This process creates the diversity in the antigen-binding site of the B cell receptor. But then, after the B cell is activated, especially in the germinal centers, there's another process called somatic hypermutation. This increases the diversity further by introducing point mutations in the variable region genes.

So in the question, the cells isolated are proliferating. Proliferation in an immune response usually happens in places like the germinal centers, where B cells undergo division and somatic hypermutation. That's when the variable regions are mutated to create a more diverse and specific response.

The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching, D) VDJ recombination.

VDJ recombination occurs early on, when the B cell is first forming its receptors in the bone marrow. Class switching is when the type of antibody is changed (like from IgM to IgG), which happens later in the immune response. Complement activation is part of the innate immune response, not directly related to the variability in the heavy chain.

So the high variability in the variable heavy chain gene must be due to somatic hypermutation, which happens in the germinal centers after the initial exposure. That's when B cells are activated, start proliferating, and mutate their genes to create a diverse set of antibodies. This process is part of the adaptive immune response, making the immune system more effective against the antigen.

So the correct answer should be A) somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. The GFP-tagged proteins are observed in the Peyer's patches, which are specialized structures in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) responsible for sampling antigens from the intestinal lumen. The fluorescence in the Peyer's patches suggests that the GFP-tagged proteins were successfully taken up by the immune system. The isolated proliferating cell population, likely B cells, shows high variability in the variable heavy chain gene after sequencing.

This variability is characteristic of processes that generate diversity in antibody repertoires. VDJ recombination occurs early in B cell development in the bone marrow and establishes initial diversity in the variable region of the B cell receptor. However, the high variability observed in this experiment is more consistent with somatic hypermutation, which introduces point mutations in the variable region genes during the germinal center reaction. This process occurs after B cell activation and proliferation, leading to further diversification of the antibody repertoire as part of the adaptive immune response.

Class switching recombination refers to the process of changing the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgG) and does not directly explain the variability in the variable heavy chain gene. Complement activation is part of the innate immune response and is unrelated to the observed variability. Therefore, the high variability in the variable heavy chain gene is best explained by somatic hypermutation.

Answer: A
