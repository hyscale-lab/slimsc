Okay, so I've got this cycloaddition problem to solve. It's a [4+2] reaction involving 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione under heat. The question is about identifying the exo product from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that [4+2] cycloadditions are Diels-Alder reactions. So the diene and the dienophile would combine here. Wait, but in this case, both reactants are aromatic compounds. Oh right, in some cases, especially under thermal conditions, these can undergo electrocyclic reactions, but wait, the problem is a cycloaddition, so it's a pericyclic reaction.

Wait, so the Diels-Alder requires a conjugated diene and a dienophile. Let me think: 2,5-dimethylthiophene has two methyl groups at positions 2 and 5. Thiophene is a five-membered ring with one sulfur. Furan-2,5-dione is a six-membered ring? No, wait, furan is a five-membered ring with two ketone groups at positions 2 and 5. So furan-2,5-dione would be similar to a cyclic diketone, with the structure O=C-(furan ring)-C=O.

Wait, so which is the diene and which is the dienophile here? Thiophenes are generally not great dienes because they're aromatic and not conjugated enough. But under certain conditions, maybe one of them could act as a dienophile. Alternatively, maybe this is an example of a hetero-Diels-Alder reaction.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. In the Diels-Alder, the diene is usually a conjugated, non-aromatic molecule that can form a six-membered transition state. The dienophile is typically something with a triple bond or a double bond that's electron-deficient, like a ketone, nitrile, etc.

So, furan-2,5-dione has two ketone groups. Those would make it a good dienophile because the electron-withdrawing groups (the ketones) activate the adjacent double bond, making it a better electrophile for the diene.

So the diene must be 2,5-d
