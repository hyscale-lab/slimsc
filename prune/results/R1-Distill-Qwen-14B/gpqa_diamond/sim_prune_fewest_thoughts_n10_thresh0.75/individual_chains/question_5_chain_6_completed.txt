Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So I think the operator P here is the spin operator, since spin operators have components like that. Spin operators usually have eigenvalues ±ħ/2 for their respective directions.

The direction n is in the x-z plane, which means it's in the x-z plane, so the direction vector will have components (x, 0, z), right? Oh wait, but the eigenvector is along this arbitrary direction n. So the operator we're considering is the component of P along n, which would be P·n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z, since the y-component is zero because n is in x-z plane.

Wait, but the problem says to calculate the eigenvector of the operator P along n. So I think I need to find the eigenvector of the operator (P · n), which is given by the dot product of the vector operator P and the direction vector n.

So, first, let me write down the components of P:

P_x is given as (ħ/2) * [[0, 1],[1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0],[0, -1]]

The direction vector n is in x-z plane, so let's say it's (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ)? Wait, no, wait. If it's in x-z plane, then the angle φ is either 0 or 180, but wait, no, in spherical coordinates, the azimuthal angle φ is measured in the x-y plane. So, if the direction is in x-z plane, that would mean that the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and φ could be 0 or π, but maybe not. Wait, perhaps an easier way is to represent n as a unit vector (a, 0, b), where a² + b² = 1.

So, n is (n_x, 0, n_z), and n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So the operator P·n would be n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Let me compute this operator. Let's denote S = P/ħ, so that S has components S_x = (1/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], and similar for S_y and S_z.

Wait, but maybe I can work directly with the given matrices.

So P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Substituting the given matrices:

n_x * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

This would be (ħ/2) multiplied by:

[[n_z, n_x],
 [n_x, -n_z]]

So the matrix is:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

We need to find the eigenvector of this matrix corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, because the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2, which would be the +1/2 when using S·n, since S has eigenvalues ±1/2.

Wait, no. Let me think. The operator P is given as P = ħ/2 S, where S is the Pauli matrices scaled by 1/2. So the eigenvalue for P·n would be (ħ/2) times the eigenvalue of S·n. So if the eigenvalue for S·n is +1/2, then P·n's eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Which is exactly the case here.

So the problem reduces to finding the eigenvector of the matrix [[n_z, n_x],[n_x, -n_z]] with eigenvalue +1.

Because when I factor out (ħ/2), the eigenvalue equation becomes (ħ/2) * matrix * |v> = (ħ/2) * |v>, so matrix |v> = |v>, so the matrix has eigenvalue +1.

So the matrix is:

[ n_z   n_x ]
[ n_x  -n_z ]

We need to find the eigenvector for eigenvalue +1.

The characteristic equation is det( (matrix) - I ) = 0.

So determinant of [n_z -1, n_x; n_x, -n_z -1] equals zero.

(n_z -1)(-n_z -1) - (n_x)^2 = 0

Multiply it out: (-n_z^2 -n_z + n_z +1) - n_x^2 = 0

Simplify: (-n_z^2 +1) - n_x^2 = 0 → 1 - (n_z^2 +n_x^2) =0 → But since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 +n_z^2 =1, so 1-1=0. So the determinant is zero, which makes sense because the matrix is 2x2 and we know it has eigenvalues ±1.

So the eigenvectors will satisfy (matrix - I)|v> =0.

So the equations are:

(n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 =0

n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 =0

We can write the first equation as (n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 =0.

Let me represent the eigenvector as (v1, v2).

We can solve this equation. Let's take the first equation:

(n_z -1)v1 + n_x v2 =0 → v2 = [ (1 - n_z)/n_x ] v1, assuming n_x ≠0.

Wait, but if n_x is zero, then the direction is purely along z. Let's think about that case.

If n_x =0, then the direction is along z, so n_z=±1. Then the matrix becomes [[1,0],[0,-1]], eigenvalues +1 and -1. The eigenvector for eigenvalue +1 would be (1, 0). But our eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so in this case, the normalized eigenvector would be (1,0), but that's a specific case. But the problem says it's an arbitrary direction in x-z plane, so n_x is not zero except for that case.

But let's proceed generally.

So, from the first equation, v2 = [ (1 - n_z) / n_x ] v1.

So the eigenvector can be written as (v1, [ (1-n_z)/n_x ] v1 ) = v1 (1, (1-n_z)/n_x )

We need to normalize this vector. Let's compute the normalization factor.

The squared magnitude is |v1|^2 [1^2 + ( (1-n_z)/n_x )^2 ].

So the normalized vector is [1, (1-n_z)/n_x ] divided by the square root of [1 + ( (1-n_z)/n_x )^2 ].

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to express this in terms of spherical coordinates.

Wait, since n is in the x-z plane, let me define the direction by an angle θ from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Because for a unit vector in x-z plane, the components are (sinθ, 0, cosθ), so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So for a vector in x-z plane, φ would be 0 or π, but for simplicity, let's take φ=0, so n_x = sinθ * cos0 = sinθ, n_z= cosθ.

So n_x = sinθ, n_z= cosθ.

So substituting into the expression for v2:

v2 = [ (1 - cosθ ) / sinθ ] v1.

Which is [ 2 sin^2 (θ/2) ) / (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) ] v1.

Wait, because 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So [ (2 sin²(θ/2)) ] / [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) ] = [ sin(θ/2) ] / [ cos(θ/2) ] = tan(θ/2).

So v2 = tan(θ/2) v1.

So the vector is (v1, tan(θ/2) v1 ) = v1 (1, tan(θ/2) )

The normalization factor is sqrt( 1 + tan²(θ/2) ) ) = sqrt( sec²(θ/2) ) ) = |sec(θ/2)| ) = 1/|cos(θ/2)|, since cos(θ/2) is positive for θ between 0 and π (as it's a polar angle).

So the normalized eigenvector is:

[ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, wait. Let me check.

If the vector is (v1, v2) = (v1, tan(θ/2) v1 ), then when normalized, it becomes:

(1, tan(θ/2) ) / sqrt(1 + tan²(θ/2)) )

Which is (1, tan(θ/2) ) / sec(θ/2) ) = (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).

Exactly. So the normalized eigenvector is ( cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ) as a column vector.

Wait, but let's check the other equation to see if this holds.

The second equation is n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 =0.

Substituting v2 = sin(θ/2) / cos(θ/2) * v1.

So n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) ( sin(θ/2)/cos(θ/2) v1 ) =0.

Wait, but since n_x = sinθ, n_z=cosθ.

Wait, let's compute it:

n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 =0.

Substituting v2 = [ (1 - n_z)/n_x ] v1.

So:

n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) [ (1 - n_z)/n_x ] v1 = 0.

Let me compute the terms.

Multiply through by n_x to eliminate the denominator:

n_x^2 v1 + (-n_z -1)(1 - n_z) v1 = 0.

Factor out v1:

[ n_x^2 + (-n_z -1)(1 -n_z) ] v1 =0.

Now, expand (-n_z -1)(1 -n_z ):

= (-n_z)(1 -n_z) -1(1 -n_z)
= -n_z + n_z^2 -1 +n_z
= ( -n_z +n_z ) + n_z^2 -1
= 0 + n_z^2 -1
= n_z^2 -1.

So the equation becomes:

[ n_x^2 + (n_z^2 -1) ] v1 =0.

But n_x^2 +n_z^2 =1, so substituting:

(1 -n_z^2) + (n_z^2 -1) =0 → 0=0.

So the equation holds, which is consistent.

So the eigenvector is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ), but wait, what about phase factors?

In quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors are defined up to a phase, so this is correct.

Now, looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

Wait, but let me look at all the options again.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which looks like spherical coordinates but not necessarily for an eigenvector.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D seems more complicated, involving sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), respectively, but those factors don't come from our calculation. Wait, where would those factors come from?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvector components.

Wait, wait, let me re-examine the eigenvector. So the eigenvector we found is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But let me think about the operator again.

Wait, the operator P·n = (n_x P_x + n_z P_z).

Wait, when we calculated, the eigenvalue was +1 for the matrix [[n_z, n_x],[n_x, -n_z]] (since the original operator is (ħ/2) times that matrix, and the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2, so the matrix has eigenvalue +1).

But when I computed the eigenvector, I got (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is the same as the spin-up state along the direction theta from the z-axis.

Hmm, but wait, what if I made an error in the initial setup? Let me double-check.

Wait, the problem states that the operator is P·n, so yes, that's correct.

Another approach: the spin-up state along any direction (n) can be written as (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)), but in our case, phi is zero because n is in x-z plane, so phi=0.

So the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking at the options, option C is exactly this.

But wait, option D looks more complicated, involving sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3). So why isn't that the case?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but let's think again. Wait, no, when the direction is in the x-z plane, the unit vector is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), so n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, which is correct.

Wait, but maybe the eigenvector is not just (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) but has some normalization factors.

Wait, when I normalized, I found that the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). So that's correct.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the spin states. The spin-up state in the z-direction is (1, 0), which would correspond to theta=0. Plugging into option C, cos(0)=1, sin(0)=0, so (1,0), correct.

Similarly, in the x-direction (theta=pi/2), the state would be (0,1), which is also correct.

So option C is right.

Wait, but what about the other options?

Option B is in terms of theta and phi, but since phi is zero, as n is in x-z plane, it reduces to (cos(theta), 0, sin(theta)), but the eigenvector for that case would be (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), so option B is more general but includes a phase factor e^{i phi}, which in our case is e^{i*0}=1, so it would reduce to (cos(theta), sin(theta)), but that doesn't match our result.

Option D has square roots of 2/3 and 1/3, which I don't see the justification for. So I think the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is given by:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z,
\]

where $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$ are the components of the spin operator $\vec{P}$, and $\vec{n} = (n_x, 0, n_z)$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane. Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the operator becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \, |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle,
\]

where the eigenvalue is $+\hbar/2$. Factoring out $\hbar/2$, the eigenvalue problem reduces to finding the eigenvector of the matrix:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}
\]

with eigenvalue $+1$. The eigenvector satisfies:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} n_z - 1 & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z - 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} = 0.
\]

From the first row, the equation is:

\[
(n_z - 1)v_1 + n_x v_2 = 0.
\]

Solving for $v_2$ in terms of $v_1$:

\[
v_2 = \frac{1 - n_z}{n_x} v_1.
\]

The eigenvector can thus be written as:

\[
|v\rangle = v_1 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \frac{1 - n_z}{n_x} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize, the squared magnitude is:

\[
|v_1|^2 \left( 1 + \left( \frac{1 - n_z}{n_x} \right)^2 \right) = 1.
\]

Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$ (since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane), we find:

\[
v_2 = \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) v_1.
\]

The normalized eigenvector becomes:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches the form of the spin-up state along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. Comparing with the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it introduces unnecessary factors of $\hbar$ and does not match the derived form.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it includes a phase factor $e^{i\phi}$, which is irrelevant for this problem since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane ($\phi = 0$).
- **Option C**: Correct, as it matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as it introduces extra normalization factors ($\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$) that are not justified by the calculation.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
