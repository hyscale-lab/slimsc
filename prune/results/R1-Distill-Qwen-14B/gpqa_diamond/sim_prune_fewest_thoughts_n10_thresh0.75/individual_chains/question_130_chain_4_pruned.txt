Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about astronomy, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says: Large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Hmm, I remember that the Lyman alpha line is a specific emission line in hydrogen. Since it's in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, I think it's at 121.6 nm, which is 1216 Angstroms. Right, because 1 nm is 10 Angstroms, so that makes sense.

So, when a quasar's light passes through a neutral hydrogen cloud, the hydrogen absorbs this specific wavelength. But since the cloud is moving away (due to the expansion of the universe), the wavelength gets redshifted. The quasar's light, when observed, would have a absorption line at a longer wavelength than 1216 Angstroms.

Wait, but ground-based optical telescopes can't observe certain wavelengths because Earth's atmosphere absorbs them. Specifically, the atmosphere is opaque to a lot of UV light. So the quasar's Lyman alpha emission would be in the UV, but if it's redshifted, the observed wavelength might be in the visible range, which optical telescopes can see.

So the key here is determining the redshift z such that the redshifted wavelength is just detectable by an optical telescope. I think optical telescopes can detect light from about 300 nm (ultraviolet) up to maybe 1000 nm (near-infrared), but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, the visible spectrum is roughly 400-700 nm. But optical telescopes might not be as good in the near-UV, maybe starting around 300 nm.

The observed wavelength 位_obs is given by 位_obs = 位_rest * (1 + z). Since the rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms (which is 121.6 nm), we can plug in values to find when 位_obs is still in the optical range, but as
