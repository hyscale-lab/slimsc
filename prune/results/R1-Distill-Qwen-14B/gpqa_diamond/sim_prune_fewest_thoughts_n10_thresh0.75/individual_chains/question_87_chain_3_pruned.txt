Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to identify the correct 1H NMR data from the options given.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. Di-substituted means there are two substituents attached to the benzene ring. The total number of carbon atoms is 8. Wait, the benzene ring itself has six carbons, so the substituents must add up to two more carbons? Because 6 (ring) + substituents = 8. So the substituents probably sum to two carbons each, or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other has none? But wait, no, each substituent is attached to the ring, so each substituent must have at least one carbon. Or maybe not, like maybe one substituent is a halogen, which doesn't add a carbon.

Oh right! The IR shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. Wait, but halogens like Cl, Br, etc., don't add any carbons. So the benzene is substituted with a carbonyl group (like a ketone or maybe an ester or something) and a halogen.

Wait, but the substituents are only two groups, right? Because it's di-substituted. So the benzene has two substituents: one is a carbonyl-containing group and the other is a halogen.

But wait, the carbonyl group could be part of another structure. Let me think about possible structures. For example, maybe it's a benzophenone derivative, but with a halogen as the other substituent. Or perhaps an acyl group attached to the ring, like an acetophenone.

Wait, acetophenone is a mono-substituted benzene with a ketone group. But this is di-substituted, so another group is present. Oh, but the question says two substituents, so each substituent can be a single atom
