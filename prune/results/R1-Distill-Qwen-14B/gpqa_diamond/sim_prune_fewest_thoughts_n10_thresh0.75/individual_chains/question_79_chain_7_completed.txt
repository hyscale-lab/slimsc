Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR problems can get tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about identifying Compound X based on the reaction and the resulting NMR spectra of the product. The reaction conditions are with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Hmm, wait, what's that reagent? Oh right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, often used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. So I think this reaction is opening an epoxide.

But wait, no, wait. Or is it the other way around? Oh wait, perhaps Compound X is an epoxide that undergoes some reaction. Wait, the product is what's giving the NMR. Oh, so the starting material is X, and after reacting with the base, it becomes something else. Or maybe the reaction is eliminating something, forming an epoxide? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the reaction is with that base, which is usually used for ring-opening of epoxides. So perhaps X is not an epoxide but contains some other functional group that, when treated with a base, forms an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe X is an epoxide, and the base is causing it to open. But the product's NMR is what we have, so let me focus on that.

Looking at the given product's NMR data. Let's look at the 1H NMR first.

The 1H NMR shows:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s): that's a singlet, likely a methyl group attached to something deshielded but not near any protons, maybe an oxygen or a carbonyl. Wait, but the 13C NMR also has a peak at 21.3, which is low for a carbonyl. Wait, 21.3... that's more like a CH3 attached to something like an oxygen or maybe a carbonyl. Wait, looking at the 13C NMR: 197.7 is a carbonyl, but that's a high value, maybe an ester or a ketone? Or an epoxide? No, wait, 197 is more likely a carbonyl like ketone or ester.

Wait, but in the 1H NMR, the methyl groups: two singlets, each 3H. So maybe two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't have neighboring Hs. So perhaps each is attached to an oxygen, like an OCH3? But wait, those are singlets and at 2.28 and 2.31, which is a bit upfield for OCH3. Methoxy groups usually are around 3.3 ppm. So maybe they are attached to something else. Maybe they are adjacent to an electronegative atom, but not directly attached.

Alternatively, maybe they're part of a ring structure. Let's think about the 13C NMR. The 21.3 and 28.4 are two single carbons, each a singlet. So each attached to a methyl group. So two methyl carbons.

Looking at the aromatic region in 1H NMR: 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). So this looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. Wait, because the doublets are two sets. Let's see: 6.75 is a doublet, and 7.71 is another doublet, perhaps as part of a coupling pattern. Alternatively, maybe it's a styryl group.

Wait, for a para-substituted benzene, the protons are usually two doublets, each integrating to 2H. But in this case, we have 1H, 2H, 1H, 2H. Hmm. Maybe it's a substituted styryl group, like a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring. So perhaps there's a double bond adjacent to the benzene.

Let me think: a benzene ring with a substituent that's a double bond leading to another group. So for example, a structure like benzene-CH2-CH2-O-something? Or benzene-CH=CH-O-something? Wait, the doublet pattern suggests coupling between adjacent protons.

Wait, the 1H NMR for the aromatic region: 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). So maybe the structure is a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that has protons. Like a vinyl group attached to the benzene.

Wait, let me consider a structure like benzene ring with a substituent like CH2CH2O... No, but the coupling would be different. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is CH2-O, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the aromatic ring is connected to a double bond. Let's think of a styryl group (benzene-CH=CH2). But in that case, the vinylic protons would show up around 5-6 ppm, but that's not matching the given data. Wait, the given data has 6.75 and 7.71 for the aromatic and perhaps vinylic regions.

Wait, maybe the structure is a di-substituted benzene, perhaps with two substituents. Let me think of a para-substituted group with a substituent that has two sets of protons.

Wait, the product's 1H NMR shows four signals in the aromatic region: one 1H doublet, two 2H doublets, and another 1H doublet. That suggests a more complex structure, perhaps with substituents on the benzene that lead to such a splitting.

Wait, another possibility is that the benzene is part of a vinyl group attached to an epoxide. Because the reaction involves 1,4-diazabicyclooctane, which is a base often used in epoxide ring-opening. Wait, but if the product is giving the NMR data, perhaps X is an epoxide that undergoes some reaction to form a product with this structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a styrene oxide, which is an epoxide. Let me think: styrene oxide is an epoxide formed from styrene. The structure would be a benzene ring connected to an oxygen in a three-membered ring with a CH2 group. Wait, but in that case, the protons adjacent to the epoxide would be deshielded.

Wait, looking at the 13C NMR data: the carbons include 141.5 and 144.1, which are probably the carbonyl carbons in an epoxide. Because epoxide carbons typically show up around 50-70 ppm, but wait, no, wait, maybe I'm wrong. Wait, no, epoxide carbons are usually in the 60-80 ppm range, but these are higher. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe those are carbons from a carbonyl group, but wait, there's a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So maybe the product has both an epoxide and a carbonyl group? That seems unlikely unless it's a more complex structure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the product is an epoxide. The 13C NMR has some peaks that might correspond to an epoxide. Let me see, the carbons around 141 and 144, which would be the carbons attached to oxygen in an epoxide. So if there's an epoxide, then the structure would have two adjacent carbons each connected to an oxygen. So that makes sense. So perhaps the product is an epoxide.

But wait, the reaction was with 1,4-diazabicyclooctane. That's a strong, bulky base. It's often used to open epoxides. Wait, but if the product is an epoxide, then maybe the starting material X was something else, and the reaction formed the epoxide. Hmm, perhaps X is a diol or something that forms an epoxide when treated with a base? I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination reaction, forming an epoxide. So X might have a structure that can form an epoxide upon deprotonation and elimination. Oh, maybe X is a di-substituted ether or something similar.

Wait, let's look at the molecular formula of Compound X: C11H12O. The product must have the same molecular formula because the reaction is just a rearrangement, perhaps? Or maybe the product is an elimination, so perhaps it's losing a water molecule or something else. Wait, but the product's molecular formula isn't given, but the product's NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So perhaps X is something that upon reaction forms a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe X is a diol that undergoes oxidation to form a ketone. But the reaction conditions don't seem like oxidation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening of an epoxide with that base. Wait, but then the product would have more oxygen-containing groups.

Alternatively, maybe X is an epoxide, and the reaction conditions are causing some rearrangement. But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about the NMR of the product.

In the product's 1H NMR, the protons are:
- 3H singlet at 2.28 (maybe a CH3 attached to something)
- 3H singlet at 2.31 (another CH3)
- The aromatic region: four peaks.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like two methyl groups attached to the same carbon, adjacent to an epoxide. Like a structure where a carbon has two methyl groups and is part of an epoxide.

Wait, the 13C NMR has a peak at 21.3, another at 28.4. So two CH3 groups. Maybe they're on adjacent carbons, like a gem-dimethyl group near an oxygen.

Wait, let's think of an epoxide where one of the oxygen-attached carbons has two methyl groups. For example, (CH3)2C-O-CR2. So if one of the epoxide carbons has two methyl groups, that would explain the two singlets in the 1H NMR.

So the structure would be something like (CH3)2C-O-CR2. But what is R?

Wait, looking at the aromatic signals in 1H NMR. If the other side of the epoxide is a benzene ring attached via a double bond, perhaps as a styryl group.

Wait, maybe the structure is an epoxide connected to a styryl group. So the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(O)-something. Hmm, no. Alternatively, perhaps benzene-CH=CH-O-CH2-C(CH3)2 or something like that.

Wait, let's try to draw this. Suppose we have an epoxide where one oxygen is attached to a benzene ring via a double bond and the other oxygen is attached to a carbon that has two methyl groups. So the structure would be cyclopropane-like: O-C-CH2-CH2-O-C-Ph? No, maybe a 3-membered ring: O-C-CH2-CH2... Wait, no, epoxide is a three-membered ring with two carbons and one oxygen.

Wait, maybe the structure is (CH3)2C-O-CPh=CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like:

Ph-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-C(CH3)2. No, but that wouldn't form an epoxide. Alternatively, perhaps it's Ph-CH2-C(CH3)2-O-CH2-Ph? Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a bicyclic compound. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is part of a larger ring.

Alternatively, think about the 13C NMR. The carbons are as follows:
- 21.3 and 28.4: two CH3 groups.
- 126.9 (2C, s): maybe two carbons in a vinyl group.
- 127.1 (1C, s): maybe a carbonyl adjacent?
- 129.1 (2C, s): perhaps another part of the aromatic ring.
- 130.3 (1C, s): possibly a quaternary carbon in the aromatic ring.
- 141.5 (1C, s) and 144.1 (1C, s): these are likely the carbons attached to oxygen in the epoxide.
- 197.7 (1C, s): a carbonyl, perhaps a ketone.

Wait, but earlier I thought the product is an epoxide, but now there's a carbonyl. Hmm, that's confusing. Because if the product has both an epoxide and a carbonyl, then the structure is more complex. Alternatively, maybe the 197.7 is an ester or a ketone.

Wait, but let me think about the reaction again. The starting material X is reacted with a base, leading to a product with an epoxide and a carbonyl. How would that happen?

Wait, another possibility: X is a diol that upon treatment with a base forms a ketone via elimination of water. But then, how does the epoxide come into play?

Alternatively, maybe X is a cyclopropane ring attached to a benzene and some substituents. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let's reconsider the product structure. The 1H NMR has two singlets for methyl groups, which suggests that the two CH3 groups are each attached to a carbon with no neighboring Hs. So perhaps each is attached to a quaternary carbon, like in a gem-dimethyl group or attached to an oxygen in an ether.

If the methyl groups are attached to an oxygen, like O-C(CH3)2, that would make sense. So maybe the structure is something like:

Ph-CH2-CH2-O-C(CH3)2.

But that's an ether, but where is the epoxide?

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide where one of the oxygen-bound carbons is a CH2 group, and the other is a CH group connected to a benzene. Let me think: the epoxide would have two CH2 groups. So O connected to two CH2 groups, each attached to other parts.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a substituent that's a CH2-CH2-O-CH(CH3)2. No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another approach: let's count the number of carbons in the product. The molecular formula of X is C11H12O. The product's formula could be same if it's a rearrangement. Let's see, the product's 13C NMR has 9 distinct carbons. So each of the 9 carbons are accounted for.

Wait, the 13C data:
21.3 (1C, s) → maybe CH3
28.4 (1C, s) → another CH3
126.9 (2C, s) → maybe two aromatic carbons
127.1 (1C, s) → another aromatic C
129.1 (2C, s) → perhaps more aromatic Cs
130.3 (1C, s) → maybe a quaternary C in the aromatic ring
141.5 (1C, s) → epoxide C
144.1 (1C, s) → another epoxide C
197.7 (1C, s) → carbonyl.

Wait, that adds up to 9 carbons. So the product has 9 carbons, but X has 11? Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Or perhaps the product has a different formula, but the question doesn't specify. So maybe the problem isn't about formula change but structure.

Wait, perhaps X is an epoxide that undergoes a ring-opening reaction with the base. If the product is a diol, but the NMR doesn't show any OH signals, which suggests it's not a diol.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination, forming a more unsaturated structure. So X could be a diol that upon treatment with base forms an epoxide. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let's think about the options. The options are:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane
B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane
C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane
D) 2-styrylepoxide

Oxirane is another name for epoxide. So all the options are epoxides with some substituents.

So the product is an epoxide. So when X is treated with the base, perhaps it's forming an epoxide. Or maybe X is a diol that forms an epoxide upon reaction.

Wait, but the product's NMR data includes a carbonyl peak, which would not be present in an epoxide. So perhaps the product is not an epoxide but something else. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's look again. The product's 13C NMR includes 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So the product has a carbonyl group and also has an epoxide? Or is the product a ketone with some substituents.

But perhaps the product is a styryl group attached to a ketone. So the structure would be something like Ph-CH2-CO-something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide with a ketone group. Let me think: maybe the structure is Ph-CH2-CO-O-CH2-Ph, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about the 1H NMR of the product. The two methyl groups are singlets, so perhaps they're both attached to a single carbon. So maybe a gem-dimethyl group. So a structure like (CH3)2C- connected to something.

If the product is an epoxide with a gem-dimethyl group, then perhaps the structure is (CH3)2C-O-CR2, where R is part of a styryl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2C-O-CH2-Ph-CH2. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2C-O-CPh=CH2. That would form an epoxide with a styryl group attached.

Wait, that's possible. So the epoxide would have one side as (CH3)2C-O- and the other as CPh=CH2. But then, the NMR would show the vinylic protons.

Wait, looking at the 1H NMR:

The aromatic signals are two doublets of 2H each, and two doublets of 1H each. That suggests a para-disubstituted benzene with substituents that have adjacent protons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring connected via a double bond to a CH2-O- group, which is connected to a gem-dimethyl group.

So the structure would be Ph-CH2-C-O-(CH2C(CH3)2). Wait, no, that might not form an epoxide. Alternatively, perhaps it's Ph-CH2-CH2-O-C(CH3)2, but that's an ether, not an epoxide.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the product is an epoxide where one of the oxygen-connected carbons is a CH2 group attached to a benzene, and the other is a CH group attached to a gem-dimethyl group.

So the structure would be Ph-CH2-O-CH2-C(CH3)2. No, that's a four-membered ring, not an epoxide.

Wait, maybe the structure is Ph-CH2-CH(O)-CH(CH2C(CH3)2). No, that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic epoxide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a styrene oxide, which is an epoxide derived from styrene. Styrene oxide has the structure benzene-CH-O-CH2. The NMR of styrene oxide would have the epoxide protons at around δ 3.5-4.5 as a triplet and a quartet. But in our product's 1H NMR, there are no signals in that region, except the two methyl singlets. So maybe it's a modified styrene oxide.

Wait, let me think about the 13C NMR. The 197.7 is a carbonyl. So perhaps the product has a ketone group and an epoxide.

Hmm, but how would that happen? Maybe the starting material X was a diol that upon reaction formed both a ketone and an epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ether with a ketone substituent. But I'm not making progress this way.

Wait, perhaps I should look at each option and see which one would give the product's NMR.

The options are epoxides, so let's imagine each structure.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. The structure would be oxirane (epoxide) with a styryl group at position 2, and the styryl group is para-methyl. So the styryl group is CH2-Ph with a methyl at para. Wait, no, styryl is benzene-CH=CH2. So 4-methylstyryl would be benzene with a methyl at the para position and a CH2=CH- group attached. So the structure would be:

O
||
C - CH2-CH2-Ph-CH3 (para position).

Wait, no, the structure would be benzene ring with a CH2 group attached to the epoxide, and a CH2 group connected to the epoxide. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
|\
C - CH2-Ph-CH3 (4-methyl).

Wait, but that would have a double bond. Let me think in terms of structure.

Alternatively, the structure would be:

Ph-CH2-CH2-O- connected to an epoxide.

Wait, but 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane would have the epoxide connected to the styryl group. So maybe it's:

epoxide (O connected to two CH2 groups) where one CH2 is connected to the benzene ring (styryl group) which has a methyl at para.

So the NMR of this structure would have:

- Methyl groups on the benzene (4-methyl): that's a singlet in the aromatic region? Wait, no, wait, the 4-methyl would be as part of the styryl group. So the methyl is on the benzene ring, para to the point of attachment.

But wait, the 1H NMR of the product has two methyl singlets, which are likely not on the benzene ring because aromatic methyl groups would have a different shift and coupling.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option has a gem-dimethyl group connected to the epoxide.

Looking at the options:

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So the structure is an epoxide where one of the oxygens is connected to a prop-1-en-2-yl group that is substituted with a phenyl group. So the structure would be:

O
||
C - C(Ph)=CH2

Wait, that's a bit complicated. The substituent would be a propenyl group attached to the epoxide. The NMR would show the vinylic protons and the methyl groups.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the epoxide is at position 2 and 3, with a methyl and a styryl group. Wait, but oxirane is a three-membered ring, so positions 2 and 3 don't make sense. Wait, maybe it's a substituent arrangement.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So the epoxide is connected to a styryl group at position 2. So structure would be similar to option A but without the methyl.

Hmm. Let's think about the 1H NMR of each option.

The product's 1H NMR shows two singlets for 3H each. So two methyl groups. So the correct option must have two methyl groups in the structure.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. The styryl group has a methyl on the benzene ring. So that's one methyl. Any other methyl? The epoxide would have CH2- groups. So if it's CH2 connected to O, those would be two protons each. But the 1H NMR shows two singlets, each 3H. So unless there's another methyl elsewhere, this option may not fit.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. The substituent is a propenyl group with a phenyl. Let's see: the structure is O connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a C=CH-Ph group. Wait, the substituent is CH2-C(Ph)=CH2. So the substituent would have a CH2 group adjacent to the epoxide, and a vinylic group. But where are the methyl groups? Only the two CH2 groups may have Hs, but that doesn't explain the two singlets.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. The structure would have a methyl group on the epoxide (so one methyl) and a styryl group. So that would give one methyl singlet. But the product has two, so this may not fit.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. The structure is a styryl group attached to the epoxide. So no methyl groups. So this option doesn't explain the two singlets.

Wait, but all four options don't have two methyl groups except option A and maybe option B if there's another methyl.

Wait, looking again:

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. The structure would be O connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH(Ph) group, which is connected to a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2.

Wait, that would have a CH2 group next to O, a CH group attached to phenyl and another CH2. So in that case, the substituent has a CH2-CH(Ph)-CH2 group. But that would imply double bonds? No, wait, the substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, so the structure would be CH2-CH2-Ph with a double bond. Wait, maybe I got the structure wrong. Alternatively, the substituent is CH2- attached to an epoxide, and then a CH group attached to a phenyl and another CH2.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Maybe another approach would help.

Let me think about the product's 13C NMR. The two methyl carbons at 21.3 and 28.4 ppm. These are likely CH3 groups attached to a quaternary carbon. So perhaps a gem-dimethyl group.

If the product is an epoxide with a gem-dimethyl group, then the structure would have a carbon connected to two methyl groups and an oxygen in the epoxide. So the epoxide would be O-C(CH3)2-CR2.

So the other side of the epoxide would be connected to a CR2 group. Let's say R is a benzene ring.

So the structure would be O-C(CH3)2-CR2, where R2 is a benzene ring attached via a double bond. So that would make the structure O-C(CH3)2-C=CH-Ph.

Wait, that would be a substituted epoxide. So the NMR would show the gem-dimethyl (two CH3 singlets), the vinylic protons, and the aromatic protons.

In the 1H NMR, the vinylic protons would be around 5-6 ppm, but in the given data, the aromatic protons are at 6.75 to 7.71. So perhaps the vinylic protons are downfield due to conjugation with the epoxide.

Wait, but the given product's 1H NMR doesn't show any signals around 5 ppm, which would be typical for vinylic protons. So perhaps in this case, the vinylic protons are part of the aromatic region.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is conjugated with the epoxide, leading to deshielding and shifting the vinylic protons upfield or downfield.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an epoxide where one side is a gem-dimethyl and the other side is a benzene ring attached via a double bond. That would make the structure:

O
||
C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2-Ph

No, that doesn't form an epoxide. An epoxide is a three-membered ring, so perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C(CH3)2-CH=CH-Ph

That would form a ring with the oxygen, making an epoxide. So the structure would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(O)-CH(CH3)2

Wait, no, that's a four-membered ring. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is (CH3)2C-O-CPh=CH2. That would form an epoxide ring. So the ring would be O connected to (CH3)2C and to CPh=CH2.

In that case, the 1H NMR would show the (CH3)2C as a singlet, the vinylic protons as a doublet (since they're on a double bond adjacent to the epoxide), and the aromatic protons.

Looking at the product's 1H NMR:

- 2.28 (3H, s): one methyl from (CH3)2C
- 2.31 (3H, s): the other methyl
- 6.75 (1H, d): perhaps a vinylic proton
- 7.08 (2H, d): perhaps from the benzene ring
- 7.68 (1H, d): another vinylic proton
- 7.71 (2H, d): the other aromatic protons.

Wait, but if the structure is Ph-CH2-CH(O)-CH(CH3)2, that's not an epoxide. Alternatively, perhaps it's Ph-CH=CH-O-C(CH3)2.

So the structure is an epoxide with the oxygen connecting a benzene via a double bond and a gem-dimethyl group.

In this case, the vinylic protons would be on the CH=CH-O group. So the 1H NMR would show a doublet for each of those protons, integrating to 1H each. So that would match the 6.75 and 7.68 signals.

The aromatic protons would be on the benzene ring. If the substituent is in the para position, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H. But in the given product, the aromatic signals are 6.75 (1H), 7.08 (2H), 7.68 (1H), 7.71 (2H). Hmm, that suggests a more complex coupling pattern, possibly a vicinal di-substitution.

Wait, perhaps the benzene ring has substituents at the ortho and para positions, leading to a certain splitting pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzene is attached via a CH2 group to the epoxide. But then the vinylic protons would be further away.

I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should think about which option would have two methyl groups in the structure.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. The styryl group has a methyl on the benzene ring. So that's one methyl. But the product has two methyl groups. So unless the epoxide has another methyl, this option may not fit.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. The substituent is a propenyl group attached to the epoxide. The structure would be O-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2. But that substituent doesn't have any methyl groups. So the product would not have two methyl groups. So this option doesn't fit the NMR data.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. The structure would have a methyl group on the epoxide and a styryl group. So that's one methyl. The product has two, so this might not fit unless there's another methyl elsewhere.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. The structure is an epoxide with a styryl group attached. No methyl groups. So this doesn't fit the product's NMR data.

Wait, but the product's 1H NMR has two methyl groups. So only option A and perhaps none of the others have methyl groups. Option A has one methyl on the benzene. So unless the epoxide has another methyl, which it doesn't in the structure, the product data doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the reaction again. X is treated with 1,4-diazabicyclooctane, a strong base, in nonpolar solvent. So perhaps X is a di-substituted compound that undergoes elimination to form an epoxide.

Wait, another thought: if X is a diol, upon treatment with a base, it could form an epoxide. But the product's NMR includes a carbonyl, which diol elimination typically doesn't form.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a vicinal diether, and upon treatment with a base, it undergoes elimination to form an epoxide and a ketone. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an epoxide that undergoes ring-opening with the base to form a diol, but the product's NMR doesn't show any OH signals, so that's not it.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to match the options with the NMR data.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So the structure is an epoxide with a styryl group at position 2, where the styryl group is para-methyl. So the product would have a benzene ring with a methyl at para and a CH2-CH2-O- group attached. Wait, no, the styryl group is CH=CH-Ph. So the structure would be O-CH2-CH2-Ph-CH3 (but with a double bond).

Wait, no, the structure would be O-CH2-CH2-Ph with a methyl on the benzene at para. So the NMR would show the methyl on the benzene as a singlet. But the product's NMR shows two methyl singlets, which are not on the aromatic ring.

So this may not fit. So unless the epoxide has a methyl group as well, which option A doesn't have.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. The substituent is a propenyl group attached to the epoxide. So the structure would be O-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2. The propenyl group here has a CH2 adjacent to the epoxide and a CH connected to the benzene. But this structure doesn't have any methyl groups, so the product's two methyl singlets are unexplained.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. The structure would have a methyl group on the epoxide (so one methyl) and a styryl group. So that's one methyl. But the product has two, so this option may not fit.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. No methyl groups, so doesn't match.

Hmm, none of the options seem to fit except perhaps if I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the product is not the same as the options. But the question states that the product is the result of the reaction, and we have to find X, which is one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the product is the epoxide, and the options are possible structures for X. No, the question says X is subjected to the reaction, and the product is the resulting compound. So the product would be the epoxide, and X is something else.

Wait, maybe X is a diol that upon treatment with the base forms the epoxide. So the product is the epoxide, which matches one of the options.

But what's the structure of the epoxide product that would match the NMR data?

The product's 1H NMR shows two methyl groups, which suggests that the epoxide has a gem-dimethyl group. So the epoxide would be O-C(CH3)2-CR2.

So looking at the options, none of them directly have a gem-dimethyl group. Wait, option B's substituent is 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl, which is CH2-C(Ph)=CH2. So the substituent is CH2 connected to a C that's connected to Ph and another CH2. Hmm, not a gem-dimethyl.

Alternatively, perhaps option A's structure has a methyl on the benzene, but the epoxide doesn't have a methyl. So the product would have one methyl, not two.

Wait, but the product's 1H NMR shows two methyl groups. So the epoxide must have two methyl groups attached to the same carbon.

Therefore, perhaps the correct structure is an epoxide where one of the oxygen-connected carbons is a gem-dimethyl group. So the structure is O-C(CH3)2-CR2.

So looking at the options, none of them directly have this. But perhaps option B's structure could have a gem-dimethyl if the substituent is different.

Wait, option B is 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So substituent is a propenyl group, which is CH2-C(Ph)=CH2. So the substituent is CH2 connected to a C that is connected to Ph and a CH2. But this doesn't have a gem-dimethyl.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again about the 13C NMR data. The 197.7 peak is a carbonyl. How does that fit in?

Wait, could the product have both an epoxide and a carbonyl group? That would make it a more complex structure, perhaps a cyclic ketone with an epoxide. But how would that form from the reaction?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a result of a Diels-Alder reaction, but I don't think the conditions suggest that.

Wait, another possibility: the product is a carbonyl compound where the reaction opened an epoxide. So X was an epoxide, and upon reaction with the base, it opened to form a carbonyl group.

But the NMR data includes a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So perhaps the product is a ketone.

Wait, but the 13C NMR of the product has peaks at 141.5 and 144.1, which are likely epoxide carbons. So the product has both a carbonyl and an epoxide. But I'm not sure how that would form.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the product is a di-substituted epoxide with a gem-dimethyl group and a styryl group. So the structure would be (CH3)2C-O-CPh=CH2. But that's an epoxide with a gem-dimethyl and a styryl group attached.

In this structure, the two CH3 groups would be on the same carbon, giving two singlets in the 1H NMR. The styryl group would have vinylic protons, which could be in the aromatic region if conjugated.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinylic protons are around 6-7 ppm, matching the given NMR.

Let me think about this structure. The epoxide would be O connected to (CH3)2C and to CPh=CH2.

In this case, the 1H NMR would show:

- Two methyl singlets at around 2.3 ppm.
- The vinylic protons as a doublet around 6.75-7.68 ppm.
- The aromatic protons as two doublets, each integrating to 2H.

This seems to match the given data.

So the structure would be (CH3)2C-O-CPh=CH2.

Now, looking at the options, which option would have this structure?

Option A is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. That would be O connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a styryl group (Ph-CH2-CH2-O-). But our structure has (CH3)2C-O-CPh=CH2. So the substituent is a styryl group attached directly to the epoxide, but with a gem-dimethyl.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps option B or C have a structure similar to this. Option C is 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane, which would have a methyl and a styryl group attached to the epoxide. But our structure has a gem-dimethyl and a styryl group.

Wait, perhaps none of the options directly match, but perhaps option B is 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane, which would be O connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH(Ph) group, which is connected to a CH2 group.

Wait, that would give the structure O-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2. So the substituent is CH2-C(Ph)=CH2.

In this case, the 1H NMR would show the vinylic protons as a doublet (since it's a trans double bond), and the CH2 groups as triplets or something else.

But the product's NMR has two methyl groups, which would require the substituent to have methyl groups. So this structure doesn't explain the two methyl singlets.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the carbonyl in the product. The 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So the product has a ketone group.

Wait, but the product is an epoxide. How can it have a ketone as well? Perhaps the starting material X was a diol that upon treatment with a base formed an epoxide and a ketone. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an oxidation, but the conditions don't suggest oxidation.

Wait, perhaps X is a diol with adjacent CH2 groups. Reaction with the base could cause elimination, forming an epoxide and a ketone.

Wait, let's imagine X is a diol: HO-R-OH. Upon treatment with a base, it could eliminate water and form an epoxide. But where would the ketone come from?

Alternatively, X could be a glycol with adjacent carbonyl groups. Hmm, but this is getting too vague.

Another approach: perhaps the correct option is A, and I should figure out why.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. The structure is an epoxide with a styryl group at position 2, which is para-methyl. So the styryl group is Ph-CH2-CH2-O- connected to the epoxide.

Wait, no, the styryl group is Ph-CH=CH2. So the structure would be O connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH2-Ph group with a methyl at para.

In this structure, the styryl group is Ph-CH2-CH2-O- connected as an epoxide. So the NMR would have:

- The epoxide's CH2 groups as a triplet and quartet around 3.5-4.5 ppm.
- The styryl group's CH2-CH2 would be around 2.5-3 ppm.
- The aromatic protons would show up as a singlet or multiplets, but the given data has specific patterns.

But in the given product's NMR, there are no signals around 3.5 ppm, so this might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the product is not an epoxide but a different structure. But the options are all epoxides, so the product must be an epoxide.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the substituents' positions. The 1H NMR shows that the aromatic protons are split into four signals, which suggests a substituted benzene ring with a substituent that has more than one proton.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group connected to the epoxide, leading to coupling between the vinylic and aromatic protons.

But I'm not making progress quickly enough. Given the time I've spent, perhaps the correct answer is option A. But I'm not fully confident.

Wait, another thought: the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. But the product is supposed to be an epoxide. So perhaps the 197.7 peak is not part of the product, but that can't be. Or maybe it's an error in my thinking.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is not an epoxide but something else, and the reaction forms a carbonyl and eliminates something else.

Wait, I think I'm stuck, so I'll go with the option that includes a gem-dimethyl group and a styryl group connected via an epoxide. That would be option A if I'm not mistaken, but I'm not certain.

Wait, no. Option A has a styryl group with a methyl on the benzene, so only one methyl. The product has two, so option A doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option B. Let me think: if option B is 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane, the substituent is a propenyl group attached to the epoxide. So the structure is O-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2. But that doesn't have any methyl groups, so the product's NMR with two methyl groups doesn't fit.

Wait, unless the substituent has a methyl group elsewhere. Wait, the substituent is 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl. So the structure is CH2 connected to O, then to C(Ph)=CH2. So the substituent is CH2-C(Ph)=CH2. So no methyl groups. So the product would have no methyl groups, but the NMR has two. So option B is out.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the epoxide has a methyl and a styryl group attached. The structure would be O connected to CH(CH3) and CH2-Ph-CH2. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, the structure would have a methyl and a styryl group on adjacent carbons of the epoxide. So the substituents are on both sides of the epoxide.

In such a case, the 1H NMR would have a methyl group as a singlet and the styryl group's protons. But the product has two methyl singlets, so this option may not fit, unless the methyl is adjacent to another group.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is option D: 2-styrylepoxide. But that doesn't have any methyl groups, so the product's NMR wouldn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in interpreting the NMR. Let me re-examine the 13C NMR data. The 197.7 peak could be an ester or a ketone, but I might have been wrong about the presence of an epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonyl compound with a styryl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the starting material X is treated with a base, leading to an elimination reaction forming an epoxide. X could be a vicinal diol, and upon treatment with a base, it eliminates water to form an epoxide.

So, if X is a diol, its structure would be HO-R-OH, and upon elimination, it becomes an epoxide.

But the product's NMR includes a carbonyl, so perhaps during the reaction, a ketone is formed alongside the epoxide. But that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diether, and the base induces a rearrangement to form a carbonyl and an epoxide.

I think I've exhausted my options, and I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the NMR data, the product has two methyl groups, which suggests that the correct structure has a gem-dimethyl group attached to the epoxide. Among the options, none directly match this, but perhaps option B could have a substituent with a gem-dimethyl, which it doesn't.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. The substituent is a prop-1-en-2-yl group with a phenyl, so the structure is O-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2. But that doesn't include any methyl groups, so it doesn't fit the NMR. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. This would have a methyl group on one side and a styryl group on the other. But the product's NMR shows two methyl groups, so this option may not fit unless there's another methyl elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diastereomer, but I don't think that affects the NMR in this way.

After considering all the options, I'm inclined to think that the correct answer is option A, but I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the product's 13C NMR has two methyl carbons (21.3 and 28.4) and a carbonyl. Maybe the product is a ketone with an epoxide. So perhaps the structure is a gem-dimethyl ketone attached to an epoxide.

But I'm not sure how that structure would fit the options.

Given the time I've spent, I'll make a guess. Based on the two methyl groups in the product, the structure must have a gem-dimethyl group attached to the epoxide. Among the options, the only one that could have this is option B if the substituent is different. But without more information, I think the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves identifying Compound X, which reacts with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for 1 day, producing a compound with the given 1H- and 13C-NMR data. The reaction conditions suggest the formation of an epoxide, as 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong base commonly used for epoxide ring-opening or formation.

### Key Observations from the NMR Data:
1. **1H-NMR**:
   - δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s): Two singlets integrating to 3H each, indicating two methyl groups attached to carbons with no neighboring protons.
   - δ 6.75 (1H, d), δ 7.08 (2H, d), δ 7.68 (1H, d), δ 7.71 (2H, d): Aromatic and vinylic protons, suggesting a substituted benzene ring with a double bond.

2. **13C-NMR**:
   - δ 21.3 (1C, s) and δ 28.4 (1C, s): Two methyl carbons.
   - δ 126.9 (2C, s), δ 127.1 (1C, s), δ 129.1 (2C, s), δ 130.3 (1C, s): Aromatic carbons.
   - δ 141.5 (1C, s) and δ 144.1 (1C, s): Likely carbons in an epoxide.
   - δ 197.7 (1C, s): A carbonyl carbon, which is unexpected for a typical epoxide.

### Analysis of the Options:
#### **Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**
- Structure: An epoxide with a styryl group (Ph-CH=CH2) at position 2, where the styryl group has a methyl substituent at the para position on the benzene ring.
- This structure would have one methyl group on the benzene ring and no additional methyl groups. The product's NMR shows two methyl singlets, which this option does not explain. **Does not fit.**

#### **Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane**
- Structure: An epoxide with a prop-1-en-2-yl group (CH2-C(Ph)=CH2) at position 2.
- This structure does not include any methyl groups, as the substituent is a propenyl group with a phenyl group attached. The product's NMR shows two methyl singlets, which this option cannot account for. **Does not fit.**

#### **Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane**
- Structure: An epoxide with a methyl group at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3.
- This structure would have one methyl group on the epoxide and one methyl group on the benzene ring (from the styryl group). However, the product's NMR shows two methyl singlets, which this option does not fully explain. **Does not fit.**

#### **Option D: 2-styrylepoxide**
- Structure: An epoxide with a styryl group (Ph-CH=CH2) at position 2.
- This structure does not include any methyl groups. The product's NMR shows two methyl singlets, which this option cannot account for. **Does not fit.**

### Conclusion:
The product's NMR data indicates the presence of two methyl groups, which none of the options fully account for. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option B** is the closest match, as it aligns with the reaction conditions and the formation of an epoxide. The discrepancy regarding the methyl groups remains unresolved.
