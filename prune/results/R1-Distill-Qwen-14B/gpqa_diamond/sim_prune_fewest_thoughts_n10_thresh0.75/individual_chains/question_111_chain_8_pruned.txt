Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But I'll try to tackle it step by step.

The question has two parts, and I need to figure out the major products for each. Let's start with the first reaction.

Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK.

I remember that when a ketone reacts with an enolate, it's usually an example of a conjugate addition or maybe a Michael addition. Wait, no, wait. The ketone here is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the carbonyl is at position 1. The structure would have a cyclohexane ring with a ketone group on carbon 1, and substituents on 2 and 6. Let me sketch this mentally: position 1 is carbonyl, so it's a cyclohexanone derivative. Then, at position 2, there's an ethyl group, and at position 6, a methyl group. Wait, no. Wait, the formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. That would mean the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at C-1. The C-2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group? Or wait, maybe it's that C-2 has an ethyl and C-6 has a methyl? No, wait: 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethylâ€”that means C-2 has two methyl groups and an ethyl group? No, wait, the numbering. Wait, wait. The structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So carbon 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group. Because 2,6-dimethyl would mean methyl groups on C-2 and C-6. And 2-ethyl would be another substit
