Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium relative to an observer. The setup is that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. I need to find the speed of light in the glass as observed in the lab frame.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with light in moving media, things can get a bit tricky. I think this involves the concept of relativistic velocities and how they transform between different frames of reference. But wait, the glass is moving at a velocity v, and the light is moving in the same direction, so maybe I should consider how the velocities add up.

Wait, but light's speed is always c in a vacuum, right? Oh, but this is inside a glass, so the speed of light in the glass is c/n, if I'm not mistaken. Because the index of refraction n = c/v, where v is the speed of light in the medium. So in the rest frame of the glass, the light speed would be c/n.

But wait, the problem is about the lab frame, where the glass is moving. So I think I need to apply a velocity transformation. Oh right, this is similar to the addition of velocities in special relativity, but wait, the glass is moving at v, and the light's velocity in the glass is v_light = c/n.

So in the lab frame, the glass
