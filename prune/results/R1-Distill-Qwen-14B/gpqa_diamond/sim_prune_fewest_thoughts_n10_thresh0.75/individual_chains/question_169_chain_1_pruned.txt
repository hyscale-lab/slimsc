Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that originally, the decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. And the total energy spectrum of E particles is continuous with some maximum endpoint Q. Now, the variant changes this to emitting one exotic, massless particle M instead of the two V particles. So the new reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. The question is about how the E particles' energy spectrum changes in this new scenario.

Wait, I remember that in beta decay and similar processes, the emitted particles have a continuous energy spectrum. But wait, the original decay emits two E and two V. The spectrum for E is continuous with endpoint Q. So I'm thinking that in the original case, the E particles don't have a fixed energy but can vary up to Q.

Now, in the variant, instead of two V's, we have one M which is massless. So the decay products are 2B, 2E, and M.

I think this is a question about conservation of energy and momentum, and how the possible energy distribution changes when you change the products.

In the original case, with 2E and 2V, the E's and V's share the energy, so the E's can have a range of energies. But when the decay changes, perhaps the distribution of energy among the E's changes, but how?

Wait, what determines the endpoint Q? The maximum energy that an emitted particle can have. In the original case, I assume that Q is determined by the total available energy after the decay, minus the rest masses of the products.

So, let's think about the decay process as follows. The initial system is two A's. Let me assume that their rest frame. So the total initial energy is 2m_A c², where m_A is the rest mass of each A.

In the original decay, the products are 2B, 2E, 2V. So the total rest energy of products would be 2m_B c² + 2m_E c² + 2m_V c². The available energy is the initial energy minus this total, so Q would be the maximum energy any of the emitted particles can have
