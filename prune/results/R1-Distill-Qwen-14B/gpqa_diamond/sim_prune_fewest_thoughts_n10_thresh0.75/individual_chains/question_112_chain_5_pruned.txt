Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Alright, let's read the question again.

The problem says that we have an electron state |α> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. Hmm, so I think that means they form a basis for the spin space, probably a two-level system.

The task is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. This operator has a matrix representation where the elements Aij are equal to ħ/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. So, what does that matrix look like? Let me write it out.

For a two-level system, the matrix would be 2x2. The diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So,

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, but wait. The problem says that Aij is ħ/2 when i≠j, otherwise zero. So yes, that's the right matrix.

The first part is to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate of this operator. Then, we need to find the average value of that operator.

Wait, but wait. Since the operator has its own eigenstates, perhaps we need to diagonalize this matrix A to find its eigenstates and eigenvalues. Because when we measure an operator, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes of the corresponding eigenstates in the state |α>.

So, the plan is:

1. Find the eigenstates and eigenvalues of A.
2. Express |α> in terms of these eigenstates.
3. The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the coefficients in this expansion.
4. The average value is the expectation value of A, which can be found using the state |α>.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, since A is a 2x2 matrix, perhaps it's easier to diagonalize it. Let me see.

First, let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.

The matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. So
