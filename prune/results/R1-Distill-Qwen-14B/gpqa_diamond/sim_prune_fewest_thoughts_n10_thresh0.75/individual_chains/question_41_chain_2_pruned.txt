Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about a light beam propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the lab. The options are given as A to D, each with some formula.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with light moving through a medium and the medium itself is moving, we need to consider the principles of special relativity, specifically the velocity addition formula from Einstein's theory. But wait, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. And the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So, the light is moving with the glass, but also within the glass medium, which has its own refractive index.

Wait, so first, in the glass's rest frame, the light propagates at speed v_glass = c/n, right? Because the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So, if the glass is stationary, the light's speed is c/n.

But now, the glass itself is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. So, I need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame. Since the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, I think we're adding velocities, but perhaps with a relativistic approach because we're dealing with light.

Wait, no, because the glass is moving, the light is moving within the glass, which is itself moving. So in the lab frame, the light's velocity would be the vector sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity within the glass, but considering relativity.

Wait, but velocity addition in relativity isn't as simple as just adding them. The formula for velocity addition in special relativity is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/cÂ²), where u is the velocity of the object in the first frame, and v is the velocity of the first frame relative to the second. So in this case, what's u and what's v?

Wait, in the glass's frame, the light is moving at u = c/n towards the same direction as the glass is moving. So, in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass (since the glass is moving at
