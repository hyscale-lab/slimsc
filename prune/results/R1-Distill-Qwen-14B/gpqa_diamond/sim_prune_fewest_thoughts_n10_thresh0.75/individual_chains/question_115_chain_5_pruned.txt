Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

So, there's an electron moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Then there's a positron moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right, and its Lorentz factor is 2. When they collide, they annihilate each other and produce two photons. The energies of both photons are the same, and their directions are measured. One photon is moving in the upper-right direction, and the other is going in the lower-right direction. The question is asking for the angle between the directions of these two photons, and the options are given as A to D.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and due to conservation laws, the total momentum and energy must be conserved. Since the two photons have the same energy, that might help in figuring out the angle between them.

Let me think about the initial setup. The electron and positron are moving towards each other along the same line. The electron is moving from left to right (since it's moving along the horizontal axis from the left), and the positron is moving from right to left. So they're approaching each other head-on. When they annihilate, they produce two photons. The photons are moving in opposite directions in some sense, but the problem says they're both moving to the right but in upper and lower directions. That makes me think they might be emitted at some angle above and below the horizontal.

Wait, but the initial motion is along the horizontal axis. So maybe their directions after annihilation aren't directly along the original direction but have components in other axes.

Wait, more importantly, the problem says that one photon is moving in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right direction. So both are moving to the right but in different vertical directions. So their motion is in opposite vertical directions, but same horizontal direction. So their angles with the horizontal axis would be symmetric above and below.

But then, the problem is asking for the angle between the two photons. Since they are moving in opposite vertical directions, the angle between them would be 180 degrees minus twice the angle each makes with the horizontal axis. Wait, no, maybe not exactly. Let me think.

Alternatively, since both photons are moving to the right, their directions are symmetric about the horizontal axis. So the angle between them would be something like 2θ, where θ is the angle each makes above and below the horizontal. But I'm not sure yet. Maybe I need to calculate the momentum vectors.

Wait, let me think about the conservation of momentum. Since the system before annihilation is moving, but after annihilation, the photons must carry away momentum such that the total momentum is conserved.

Wait, but wait. The initial total momentum is the sum of the momenta of the electron and the positron. Since the electron is moving to the right (let's say positive x-direction) and the positron to the left (negative x-direction), their momenta would add. But I need to calculate their relativistic momenta.

Wait, the Lorentz factor gamma is given for each. The Lorent
