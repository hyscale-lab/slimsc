Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a reaction scheme involving several compounds, A to E, and I need to identify what compound E is. The options are given, and there are some hints provided. Let's break down the information.

First, let's outline the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Then, there are two hints:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of compound A has a strong peak at around 1750 cm^-1, and compound E has a peak at 1715 cm^-1.

Hmm, okay. Let's take this step by step.

Starting with the reaction steps:

1. A + HCN â†’ B. That sounds like a nucleophilic addition, perhaps adding to a carbonyl group. HCN typically adds to ketones or aldehydes. So if A has a carbonyl group, like a ketone, then B would be a cyanohydrin. Wait, but HCN can also add to esters or other carbonyls. Alternatively, maybe A is an aldehyde, but I'm not sure yet.

2. B is then reduced with H2 and Pd. Pd is a catalyst, so this is hydrogenation. If B is a nitrile (from HCN addition), H2 would reduce it. Wait, no: HCN adds to a carbonyl to form a cyanohydrin, which is an alcohol with a CN group attached. So B would be a secondary alcohol with a CN group? Wait, wait. Let's think: when HCN adds to a ketone (R2CO), it forms a cyanohydrin, which is R2C(OH)CN. So that's a vicinal diol
