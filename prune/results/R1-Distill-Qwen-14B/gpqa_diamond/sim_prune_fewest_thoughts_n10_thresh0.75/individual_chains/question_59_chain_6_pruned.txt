Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pH calculations yet. But let's take it step by step. The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing various acids and bases. Let me read it again.

The problem says: Determine the pH of the solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂.

Hmm, wait. So, I've got acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So, first, I think I need to calculate the moles of each acid and base and see what's left after neutralization.

Let me think. Acetic acid is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base. Oh, wait, Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into Ba²+ and OH⁻ ions. So, each mole of Ba(OH)₂ gives two moles of OH⁻, right? Because the formula is Ba(OH)₂, so it's Ba²+ and 2OH⁻.

Same with HCl: each mole gives one H+ ion. Acetic acid, CH3COOH, would donate a proton, but since it's weak, I might have to consider its dissociation later if needed.

So, the plan is:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from CH3COOH and HCl.
2. Calculate moles of OH- from Ba(OH)₂.
3. Determine which is in excess, H+ or OH-.
4. Find the concentration of the excess ion after mixing all the solutions.
5. Use that to find the pH, either with pOH if it's OH- excess or directly if H+.

Wait, but wait. Let me get the calculations right.

First, let's compute the moles for each component.

For CH3COOH: volume is 500 mL = 0.5 L, concentration 0.1 M. Moles = 0.5 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 mol. Since CH3COOH is a weak acid, each mole gives one mole of H+ (but it's not completely ionized, but wait, in the presence of other acids, maybe it doesn't matter? Or perhaps it's negligible compared to the strong acids and bases. Hmm, maybe I'll treat it as a source of H+ as well, but perhaps the contribution might be small compared to the strong acid.)

Wait, but maybe I should first consider all the H+ and OH- sources, including the strong ones, and then see if there's a net acid or base.

So, HCl is a strong acid, so all of it will dissociate. So, moles of HCl: 400 mL = 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 mol. Each mole gives 1 mole H+, so 0.08 mol H+.

CH3COOH: 0.5 L * 0.1 M = 0.05 mol. Since it's a weak acid, each mole can donate 1 H+ on dissociation, but let's see if the H+ from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)₂ will affect that.

Now Ba(OH)₂: each mole gives 2 moles OH⁻. So the moles of Ba(OH)₂: 300 mL = 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol. Each mole gives 2 OH⁻, so total OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

So, total H+ from HCl and CH3COOH: 0.08 (from HCl) + 0.05 (from CH3COOH) = 0.13 mol. Wait, but wait, I'm not sure about the CH3COOH. Because when you mix a weak acid with a strong base, the weak acid might not contribute much. Hmm, but maybe I should include it for now and see if it's significant later.

But actually, when we mix acids and bases, the H+ from the strong acid and the OH- from the base will neutralize each other. The weak acid's H+ might be negligible compared to the strong ones, but perhaps in this case, I should include all sources.

Wait, another approach: the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will react with OH- from Ba(OH)₂. Let me compute the total H+ and OH-.

Total H+ = (HCl) + (CH3COOH) = 0.08 + 0.05 = 0.
