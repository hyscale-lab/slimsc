Okay, so I have this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on black hole thermodynamics, but let's think this through.

The problem gives me the distance to the galaxy as d = 10^10 parsecs and the angular size of the event horizon as θ = 10^-17 degrees. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole.

Wait, entropy of a black hole... Oh right! Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. Or wait, sometimes I see it written as S = (ħ c^3)/(4 G ħ) A, but I might have mixed up the constants. Let me get that right. Oh wait, no, the formula is S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G), where k_B is Boltzmann's constant. Because the area A is in square meters, and the entropy is in J/K when using appropriate units.

So first, I need to find the area A of the event horizon. The event horizon's radius is related to the black hole's mass, but maybe I can find the radius from the angular size and the distance.

The angular size θ is given in degrees. I should convert that to radians because the formula for angular size is usually θ ≈ R / d, where R is the radius and d is the distance in the same units. So θ (in radians) is approximately R/d.

First, let's convert θ from degrees to radians. θ = 10^-17 degrees. Since 180 degrees is π radians, 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ_rad = 1e-17 * (π / 180) ≈ 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Wait, but wait a second. For small angles, θ (in radians) is approximately equal to (arc length)/radius. In this case, the arc length would be the diameter of the event horizon, or wait no, the radius. Wait, the event horizon has radius R, so the angular size θ should be θ ≈ R/d. So R ≈ θ * d. Oh wait,
