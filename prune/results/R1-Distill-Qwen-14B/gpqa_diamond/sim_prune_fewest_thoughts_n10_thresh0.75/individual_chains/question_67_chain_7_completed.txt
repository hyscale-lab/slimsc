Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals and their angular momentum states. Hmm, let me try to think through this.

The question says that there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. I remember that a p orbital has l=1, so each electron has l1=1 and l2=1. The coupled state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, that seems a bit off because the maximum possible total angular momentum l when adding two l=1 states would be 2 (since 1+1=2), but looking at the state, the total l is 2. Oh wait, that's correct. So the state is |l1, l2, L, M>, which is |1,1,2,-1>. 

The problem is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ. So each electron's orbital angular momentum in the z-direction is measured. Since each Lz can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ for l=1, right? Because m can be -1, 0, +1, but multiplied by ħ. So in this case, the measurement values are -ħ each for both electrons.

Wait, but how do I find the probability of both being -ħ? I think I need to express the given coupled state in terms of the product states of individual electron states. Because the coupled state is a combination of all possible product states, I should probably expand it.

But wait, coupled angular momentum states are eigenstates of L² and Lz. So the state |1,1,2,-1> is an eigenstate of L² with eigenvalue ħ²(2(2)+1) = 6ħ², and Lz with eigenvalue -ħ.

But wait, the individual states are L1 and L2, so the coupled state is a combination of their product states. How do I get the expansion? Hmm, maybe I should think about the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Oh right, the Clebsch-Gordan expansion tells us how to write the coupled state as a sum of product states.

The coupled state |l1 l2; L M> is a linear combination of |l1 m1> |l2 m2> where m1 + m2 = M.

In our case, M is -1. So the possible (m1, m2) pairs are such that m1 + m2 = -1. The possible combinations for two electrons with l=1 are m1 = -1, 0, +1 and same for m2.

So the possible (m1, m2) pairs that sum to -1 are:

(-1,0), (0,-1), and perhaps others? Let's see, m1 can be -1, 0, +1; m2 same.

Wait, m1 + m2 = -1.

Possible combinations:

m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum -1.

m1 =0, m2= -1 → sum -1.

m1= 1, m2= -2 → but wait, m2 can't be -2 because l2 is 1. So m2 can only be -1,0,1. So that's impossible. So only two possible combinations: (-1,0) and (0,-1).

Wait no, what if m1= -2? No, because l1=1, so m1 can't be less than -1. So the only possible pairs are (-1, 0) and (0, -1).

Wait, wait, but how does the Clebsch-Gordan expansion look for L=2, M=-1?

I remember that the expansion coefficients are determined by the CG coefficients. The state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as a sum of |1, m1> |1, m2> such that m1 + m2 = -1.

So the possible terms are:

|m1= -1> |m2=0> and |m1=0> |m2= -1>.

So the state is a linear combination of these two product states.

But what are the coefficients? The CG coefficients for adding two l=1 to get L=2. Let me try to recall the CG coefficients.

The general formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients when adding two angular momenta l1 and l2 to get L and M.

In this case, l1=l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

The expansion of |1,1,2,-1> is sqrt( (2-1+1)/(2*(2+1)) ) |m1=-1, m2=0> + sqrt( (2+1)/(2*(2+1)) ) |m1=0, m2=-1> ?

Wait, maybe I should find the coefficients for each term.

Alternatively, I can look up the CG coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

The CG coefficient for this state is sqrt( (2 +1 - (1) )/(2*(2+1)) )) ??? I'm a bit rusty here.

Wait, another approach: for two spin-1 particles, the states can be combined into symmetric and antisymmetric states. But wait, in this case, the orbital angular momentum is being considered, not spin. But each electron has orbital angular momentum l=1.

Wait, but the state |1,1,2,-1> is symmetric or antisymmetric under exchange? Hmm, perhaps not necessary here.

Alternatively, maybe I can write the state |1,1,2,-1> as a sum of product states where m1 + m2 = -1.

But to find the coefficients, perhaps it's easier to use recursion relations or look for patterns.

Alternatively, I recall that for adding two l=1, the possible L values are 2, 1, 0.

The state |1,1,2,-1> is part of the L=2 multiplet. The possible M values for L=2 are -2, -1, 0, +1, +2.

So for M=-1, the state is a combination of m1 + m2 = -1.

As I thought before, the possible m1, m2 pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

So the state is a linear combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

The coefficients can be found using the CG coefficients.

The general formula for CG coefficients when L = l1 + l2 is:

< l1 m1; l2 m2 | L M > 

For l1 = l2 =1, L=2, M=-1.

The CG coefficient is sqrt( [ ( (2*(2+1) - ( (m1 + m2) - (L) ) ) ) / (2*(2+1)) ) ] )

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for specific CG coefficients for L=2, M=-1.

Another approach: The CG coefficients for L=2, M=-1 in terms of m1 and m2:

The state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as √( (2×1)/ (2×3)) ) |m1=-1, m2=0> + √( (1×1)/ (2×3) ) |m1=0, m2=-1> ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the formula.

The CG coefficient < l1 m1; l2 m2 | L M > is given by:

sqrt( [ (2L +1) / ( (l1 + l2 + L +1)(l1 + l2 - L +1) ) ) ] × [ ( (l1 + l2 - L - |m1 - m2| )! ) / ( (L + l1 + l2 - |m1 - m2| )! (m1 + m2 - M )! ( ... )) ) ] )

Wait, perhaps that's too complicated. Maybe I can look for a table or find another way.

Alternatively, for L=2 and M=-1, the possible (m1, m2) are (-1, 0) and (0, -1).

The coefficients can be found from the CG table.

Looking up, for example, for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1:

The CG coefficient is [ 1/sqrt(6) ) ] for each term.

Wait, wait, I think the expansion is:

|1,1,2,-1> = sqrt( (2)/( (2)(2+1) )) ) |m1=-1, m2=0> + sqrt( (1)/( (2)(2+1) )) ) |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, let me compute the coefficients. The general formula for CG coefficients when adding two angular momenta:

The state |l1, m1; l2, m2> contributes to |L, M> where M = m1 + m2.

The CG coefficient for |l1, m1> |l2, m2> in the |L, M> state is given by:

< l1 m1; l2 m2 | L M > = sqrt( [ ( ( (2L +1) ) * ( (l1 + l2 - L) )! ) / ( (l1 + l2 + L +1)! ) ) ) ] ) * [ ... ]... Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that for two l=1 particles, the |L=2, M=-2> state is |m1=-1, m2=-1>, and the |L=0, M=0> state is (|m1=1, m2=-1> - |m1=-1, m2=1> ) / sqrt(2), and so on.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I can think of the state |1,1,2,-1> as a combination of (m1, m2) pairs that sum to -1.

Let me assume that the state is a sum of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, each multiplied by some coefficient a and b, respectively.

So |1,1,2,-1> = a |m1=-1, m2=0> + b |m1=0, m2=-1>.

I need to find coefficients a and b.

But how?

The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

Also, perhaps I can use the fact that the state |1,1,2,-1> is symmetric under some conditions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can think about the ladder operators. The state |L=2, M=-1> can be obtained by applying the lowering operator L- to |L=2, M=0>.

Wait, but the state |L=2, M=0> can be written as a sum of |m1=1, m2=-1> and |m1=-1, m2=1>, etc. Hmm, perhaps that's not helping.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the state |1,1,2,-1> as being orthogonal to other states. But this might not help.

Wait, maybe it's easier to look for the expansion coefficients. I remember that for two spin-1 particles, the CG coefficients for L=2, M=-1 are such that the state is a sum of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, each with coefficient 1/sqrt(2). But wait, that can't be because 1/sqrt(2) squared is 1/2 each, totaling 1, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: The state |1,1,2,-1> can be obtained by acting with lowering operators on |1,1,2,2> (which is |m1=1, m2=1>). The lowering operator L- would lower M by 1 each time.

But wait, the lowering operator L- = L1- + L2-.

So,

L- |l1=1, m1=1; l2=1, m2=1> = (L1- + L2-) |1,1; 1,1> = [ (L1- |1,1>) ) ⊗ |1,1> + |1,1> ⊗ (L2- |1,1> ) ].

Each L1- |1,1> = sqrt(1*(1+1) - (1)(1-1)) ) ħ |1,0> = sqrt(2) ħ |1,0>.

So,

L- |1,1;1,1> = sqrt(2) ħ ( |1,0;1,1> + |1,1;1,0> ).

Then, applying L- again:

L-² |1,1;1,1> = (L1- + L2- ) (L1- + L2- ) |1,1;1,1> 

But perhaps this is getting too involved. Maybe a better way is to realize that the state |1,1,2,2> is |m1=1, m2=1>, and each application of L- brings down M by 1.

So, the state |1,1,2,1> is L- |1,1,2,2>.

Similarly, |1,1,2,0> is L- |1,1,2,1>, and |1,1,2,-1> is L- |1,1,2,0>.

But perhaps this approach would take too long and I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the expansion coefficients more directly.

The state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of the product states where m1 + m2 = -1.

As I thought earlier, those are m1=-1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1.

So the state is a linear combination: |1,1,2,-1> = c1 |m1=-1, m2=0> + c2 |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Normalization requires |c1|^2 + |c2|^2 =1.

What else can I use to find c1 and c2?

Alternatively, I can use the fact that the state must be orthogonal to other states with different M. But without knowing other states, perhaps that's not helpful.

Wait, I think I found a pattern. For L=2 and M=-1, the coefficients are sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), but I'm not sure. Let me test.

Suppose the state is:

|1,1,2,-1> = sqrt(2/3) |m1=-1, m2=0> + sqrt(1/3) |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Then, the normalization is (2/3) + (1/3) =1, which is correct.

But how do I know that's the case? Maybe it comes from symmetry.

Wait, another approach: The state |1,1,2,-1> can be obtained from |1,1,2,2> by applying L- four times, but perhaps that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Wigner-Eckart theorem or other methods, but I think I might be overcomplicating.

Wait, I think I can recall that the expansion coefficients for |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1> are sqrt( (2*(2+1) - ( (m1 + m2) - M )) / (2*(2+1)) )) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for a specific table.

Upon checking, I find that for two l=1 particles, the |2, -1> state is given by:

|2, -1> = sqrt( (2)/( (2)(2+1) )) ) |m1=-1, m2=0> + sqrt( (1)/( (2)(2+1) )) ) |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, that simplifies to sqrt(2/6) and sqrt(1/6). Because 2/(2*(3)) = 1/3, so sqrt(1/3) is sqrt(2)/sqrt(6) ? Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, 2/(2*3) = 2/6 =1/3. So sqrt(1/3) is about 0.577.

Similarly, 1/(2*3)=1/6, so sqrt(1/6)=≈0.408.

So the coefficients are sqrt(1/3) and sqrt(1/6) respectively.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

The general formula for the CG coefficient when adding two angular momenta l1 and l2 to get L and M is:

< l1 m1; l2 m2 | L M > = sqrt( ( (2L +1) (l1 + l2 - L)! ) / ( (l1 + l2 + L +1)! (L + l1 - m2 - M)! (L + l2 - m1 - M)! ) ) ) × some factors.

But perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for two spin-1 systems, the state |2, -1> is symmetric under exchange in some way.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the problem again.

The question is about the joint probability of both L1z and L2z being measured as -ħ.

Each L1z and L2z can take values m1ħ and m2ħ, where m1 and m2 are -1, 0, +1.

So the probability that both are -ħ is the probability that m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

But wait, looking at the expansion of the state |1,1,2,-1>, which is a sum of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, each multiplied by some coefficients.

Wait a minute, because the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of m1=-1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1. There's no term where m1=-1 and m2=-1.

Because m1 + m2 = -1 in each case. So if m1=-1, m2=0, sum is -1. If m1=0, m2=-1, sum is -1.

So the state doesn't have a component where both m1 and m2 are -1. So the coefficient of |m1=-1, m2=-1> is zero.

Wait, wait! So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of m1=-1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1. So when you express the coupled state in terms of product states, the only terms are these two.

Therefore, the probability of finding m1=-1 and m2=-1 is zero. Because that product state isn't present in the expansion.

So the probability that both L1z and L2z are -ħ is zero.

Hence, the correct answer is D) 0.


The problem involves two electrons in p orbitals, where each electron has orbital angular momentum quantum number \( l = 1 \). The coupled angular momentum state of the two-electron system is given as \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \), where \( l_1 = 1 \), \( l_2 = 1 \), \( L = 2 \), and \( M = -1 \). The goal is to determine the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \) for both electrons.

To solve this, the coupled state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \) must be expressed in terms of the product states \( |m_1, m_2\rangle \), where \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the magnetic quantum numbers of the two electrons. The state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \) is a linear combination of product states where \( m_1 + m_2 = M = -1 \). The possible combinations of \( (m_1, m_2) \) that satisfy this condition are:

1. \( (m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0) \)
2. \( (m_1, m_2) = (0, -1) \)

Thus, the coupled state can be written as:

\[
|1,1,2,-1\rangle = c_1 |m_1=-1, m_2=0\rangle + c_2 |m_1=0, m_2=-1\rangle
\]

Here, \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which can be determined using standard tables or symmetry arguments. The state does not include a term where \( (m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1) \), as this combination does not satisfy \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \).

The probability of measuring \( L_{1z} = -\hbar \) and \( L_{2z} = -\hbar \) corresponds to the probability of the product state \( |m_1=-1, m_2=-1\rangle \). Since this product state is absent in the expansion of \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \), the coefficient of \( |m_1=-1, m_2=-1\rangle \) is zero. Therefore, the joint probability of this outcome is:

\[
P(L_{1z} = -\hbar, L_{2z} = -\hbar) = 0
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
