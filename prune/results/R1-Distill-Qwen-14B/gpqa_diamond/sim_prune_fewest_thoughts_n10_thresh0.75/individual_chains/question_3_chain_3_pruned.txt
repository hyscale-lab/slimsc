Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the expectation value of an operator for a spin-half particle in a given state.

Alright, the problem states that the particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. The operator we're looking at is 10σz +5σx. I need to find the expectation value of this operator.

First off, expectation values. I remember that the expectation value of an operator in a given state is calculated as the bra-ket ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So, I think I can break this down into finding the expectation values of σz and σx separately, then combine them with the coefficients given.

Wait, but the operator is 10σz +5σx. So, the expectation value would be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That makes sense because expectation values are linear.

So, I'll need to find ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ for the given state.

Let's start with σz. Since the state is a superposition of the eigenstates of σz, that should be easier. The eigenstates are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively for σz.

The given state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Wait, actually, let me check if this state is normalized. The coefficients squared should add up to 1.

Calculating the squares: (0.5)^2 = 0.25. (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) which is 0.75. Adding them gives 1, so yes, it's normalized. That's good.

So the expectation value of σz is ⟨ψ| σz |ψ⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates, this should be easy. Let me compute it:

⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ = (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1). Because when you expand the inner product, each term would be the coefficient of |↑⟩ times the eigenvalue for |↑⟩, and same for |↓⟩.

Wait no, actually, more carefully: ψ is a sum a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, so ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ = |a|^2 * (+1) + |b|^2 * (-1). Because σz |↑⟩ = +1 |↑⟩, and σz |↓⟩ = -1 |↓⟩.

So a is 0.5, so |a|^2 is 0.25, and b is sqrt(3)/2, so |b|^2 is 3/4 or 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

Got it. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Now for σx. Hmm, this is probably more tricky since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, not σx. So I can't directly compute the expectation value as easily.

I remember that σx is the Pauli X matrix, which in the σz basis is represented as [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when applied to |↑⟩, σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩. Let me write out ψ and compute this.

ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So, the bra is ⟨ψ| =
