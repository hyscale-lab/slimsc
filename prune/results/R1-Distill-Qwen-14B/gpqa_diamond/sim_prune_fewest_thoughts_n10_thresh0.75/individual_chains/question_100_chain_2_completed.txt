Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because these reaction sequences can get tricky. But I'll try to think through each step carefully.

The question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. C3H6 is propene, right? Because propene is C3H6, an alkene. Then, it undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Oh wait, bromination of alkenes typically adds bromine across the double bond. So propene (CH2=CH2CH3) would add Br2 to form 1,2-dibromopropane (BrCH2CHBrCH3) or maybe 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane. So that's compound B.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and likely causes elimination. So if B is 1,2-dibromopropane, treating it with alcoholic KOH would probably eliminate HBr and form an alkene again. Wait, but which position? Let's see. The structure after elimination would likely be propene again if it's 1,2-dibromide. Because when you have vicinal dihalide (like 1,2-dibromide), treatment with a strong base like alcoholic KOH leads to dehydrohalogenation. So removing two adjacent Brs with two elimination steps? Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, for 1,2-dibromopropane, the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to formation of a double bond. So the product C would be propene again. But wait, that's the same as compound A. Hmm.

But wait, when I add Br2 to propene, it's a diaddition. So in the presence of CCl4, which is a solvent for the reaction. So yes, compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, compound C is formed by reaction with alcoholic KOH. That should be dehydrohalogenation. Since B is 1,2-dibromide, the reaction with KOH (a strong base) would likely eliminate both Br atoms. Wait, but each Br is on adjacent carbons. So maybe it loses HBr twice, forming a triple bond? Wait, but propene has three carbons. So if you eliminate two HBr molecules from 1,2-dibromopropane, you would form propyne (HC≡CCH3), which is an alkyne. Because two eliminations would yield a triple bond.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. When you have 1,2-dibromide, the reaction with a strong base like alcoholic KOH would lead to elimination of two HBr molecules. The first elimination would form a double bond, but then another elimination would form a triple bond. So yes, compound C is propyne.

So moving on. Compound C (propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. Oh, that's a condition for dehydrohalogenation? No, wait, I think that's for dehydrohalogenation to form alkynes, but wait, propyne is an alkyne already. Alternatively, that condition is for decomposition. Alternatively, perhaps it's for hydrogenation? Wait, no. Red-hot iron is used in the catalytic hydrogenation of alkynes to cis alkenes. Wait, but in the presence of a catalyst like Lindlar's, it becomes cis. Without catalyst, maybe it's trans? Or perhaps that's a different condition. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction. Wait, another possibility is the decomposition of alkynes. But I'm not sure. Oh wait, no, another context: when alkanes are passed through red-hot iron, it might be for breaking bonds. Wait, but propyne is an alkyne. Maybe in this case, it's converted into something else.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of alkynes with red-hot iron might be for the conversion of alkynes into alkenes. Or perhaps it's a hydrogenation. Let me think: when you pass an alkyne over a catalyst like nickel, it hydrogenates to an alkane. But red-hot iron—maybe it's a different scenario. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is for converting alkynes into alkenes via a [2+2] cycloaddition, but I'm not sure.

Wait another approach. Let's think about the product D. So after treating propyne (C) with red-hot iron, we get D. Then, D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Let's think about what D could be.

Wait, if C is propyne, then D is perhaps propane? Because if propyne is hydrogenated over red-hot iron, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the reaction converts the alkyne into an alkene. Because when alkynes react with certain catalysts, they can hydrogenate to alkenes. So perhaps D is propene again, but that doesn't make sense because then D would react with strong acids, but propene is an alkene, maybe it's something else.

Wait, another angle: what's the product when an alkyne is heated with red-hot iron? I think that when an alkyne is passed over red-hot iron in a process called the Stephen reduction, it can form the corresponding aldehyde. Wait, no, the Stephen reduction uses a catalyst with a poison, like lead, to form ketones or aldehydes. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being hydrogenated to an alkane. Wait, let me check: propyne (HC≡CCH3) when hydrogenated, would become propane (CH2CH2CH3). Hmm, but propane is an alkane. So D would be propane.

Then, D (propane) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Wait, two strong acids—maybe concentrated sulfuric and nitric acid? That's a common mixture for nitration. But wait, propane doesn't have an aromatic ring, so nitration wouldn't apply. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfonation, but again, that's for aromatic rings. Hmm, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, another thought: If E is formed by treating D (propane) with two strong acids, maybe it's undergoing a substitution reaction. But in that case, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps D is a dihalide. Wait, but D is propane—CH3CH2CH3. How would that react with two strong acids?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's retrace.

Compound A: C3H6 is propene.

Bromination in CCl4: adds Br2 across double bond. So propene becomes 1,2-dibromopropane.

Reaction with alcoholic KOH: elimination, so two HBr removed, forming propyne (HC≡CCH3). So C is propyne.

Passing through red-hot iron: I think this is hydrogenation. So propyne (HC≡CCH3) would add hydrogen to become propene (CH2=CHCH3) if it's partial hydrogenation, but perhaps with more hydrogen, it becomes propane. But wait, hydrogenation of alkynes can be partial (to alkenes) or complete (to alkanes). But red-hot iron is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So perhaps D is propane.

Then, reacting D (propane) with two strong acids. Two strong acids—maybe H2SO4 and HNO3. But as I said earlier, without an aromatic ring, nitration doesn't happen. So perhaps I'm on the wrong path. Alternatively, maybe D isn't propane. Let me reevaluate the earlier steps.

Wait, alternative approach: when compound C (propyne) is treated with red-hot iron, maybe it's a decomposition reaction. For instance, propyne might be converted into something else. Another possibility is that the alkyne is being converted into an alkyne via some cycloaddition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is for dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should think about what D could be that reacts with two strong acids to form E.

Alternatively, perhaps D is a diol. Wait, but how would that happen?

Wait, another angle: What if the red-hot iron is used for a different reaction, like the oxidation of the alkyne?

Wait, propyne is an alkyne. Maybe when passed through red-hot iron, it's oxidized. The oxidation of terminal alkynes (like propyne) can yield ketones. Wait, that's possible. Propyne (HC≡CCH3) upon oxidation would form propanone (acetone, (CH3)2CO). So D would be acetone.

Then, when acetone (D) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, maybe it undergoes some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction. For example, perhaps it's undergoing the Bayer-Villiger oxidation, which would form a ketone oxide. But that's more specific and might not be relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps the strong acids are for nitrating the compound, but acetone isn't aromatic, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm off track. Another possibility: the mixture of two strong acids could be concentrated sulfuric and nitric acid, which are a nitrating mixture. But if D is a diol or something else, then... Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps D is a dihalide, but I don't see how that leads to E.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about the next steps. After D, E is formed. Then E reacts with Fe and HCl to form F. Then F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. G is then treated with NaOH to form H.

Wait, perhaps E is something like a nitro compound. Because if D is a benzene ring, but I don't think that's the case here. Alternatively, perhaps D is an alkyne that is being nitrated, but nitrating alkyne would require an aromatic ring.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that D is a diol. How? Maybe the alkyne is hydrolyzed to a diol.

Wait, another approach: maybe when propyne is treated with red-hot iron, it's a hydrogenation step. So propyne → propene. Then propene is treated with strong acids. Hmm, but propene is an alkene, which could undergo addition reactions. But with a mixture of two strong acids, perhaps concentrated H2SO4 and HNO3, which are nitrating conditions. But propene isn't aromatic, so it wouldn't undergo nitration. Unless it's a diene or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the step with the red-hot iron isn't hydrogenation but something else. Maybe it's for the production of an alkyne from another compound, but I'm not getting it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the reaction that forms compound C. Let me think again.

Compound A: propene → adds Br2 → 1,2-dibromopropane (compound B).

Alcoholic KOH treatment → elimination → propyne (C).

Then, red-hot iron: maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction of propyne with red-hot iron leads to the formation of some other compound. Wait, maybe it's a hydration reaction. The hydration of propyne would yield ketone. But under what conditions?

Wait, when propyne is treated with water in the presence of a catalyst, it can form acetone. But that's a hydration reaction. But does it require red-hot conditions? I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the red-hot iron is part of a hydrogenation process, but without H2, maybe it's using the iron as a catalyst for something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into an alkane via hydrogenation. So propyne → propane (D).

Then, D (propane) reacts with two strong acids. But that's confusing. Propane is a saturated alkane, so it's not reactive towards most acid conditions. Unless it's undergoing some special reaction.

Wait, maybe D is propane, and when it reacts with two strong acids (like H2SO4 and HNO3), it's undergoing some kind of substitution. But how? Alkanes are generally unreactive towards acids unless it's a very specific condition.

Hmm, maybe I'm wrong about D. Let me think again. Let's backtrack.

If compound C is propyne, and it's passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's being converted into propene via some mechanism.

Wait, another thought: the iron could be used for the catalytic hydrogenation of alkynes. So propyne (HC≡CCH3) would hydrogenate to propene (CH2=CHCH3) when passed through a catalyst like iron. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, if the alkyne is fully hydrogenated, it would become propane.

Wait, let me think about the products. Let's say D is propane. Then, D is reacted with a mixture of two strong acids. Two strong acids could be H2SO4 and HNO3. But how would that affect propane? Maybe it's a sulfonation, but without an aromatic ring, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nitration, but again, no ring to attach the nitro group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't about substituents but about something else. Maybe D is a diol or a glycol. But how would propane become a diol? Unless there's an oxidation or something else, but I can't see it.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misapplying the reaction steps. Let's think about another possibility for compound C: maybe it's not propyne, but propene. Wait, but how? Because when you eliminate 1,2-dibromide, you get propene again. But wait, elimination from 1,2-dibromide would typically form a double bond. So propene is the product. But then, that would make compound C as propene, but earlier I thought it's propyne because two eliminations would occur.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about that. Let me re-examine that step.

1,2-dibromopropane + alcoholic KOH: the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr and forming a double bond. So from 1,2-dibromide, elimination would produce propene. But wait, only once. Because each molecule of KOH would abstract one H and eliminate one HBr. So in the case of 1,2-dibromide, perhaps only one elimination occurs, because the other Br is on the same carbon. Wait, perhaps the first elimination would form a double bond, but there's another Br on the adjacent carbon, allowing for a second elimination. So two eliminations would occur, each removing an HBr and forming a triple bond.

So, 1,2-dibromopropane (BrCH2CHBrCH3) + 2 KOH (alcohol) → HC≡CCH3 (propyne) + 2 KBr + 2 H2O. So yes, compound C is propyne.

So, back to the step where propyne is passed through red-hot iron. If that's a hydrogenation step, maybe it becomes propene, or maybe propane. Let's assume it becomes propene. Then D is propene.

Then, D (propene) is treated with two strong acids (like H2SO4 and HNO3). But propene isn't aromatic, so nitration doesn't occur. Alternatively, it's a dienophile, but without a diene, I'm not sure. Another possibility: Maybe D is a diene, but I don't see how propene becomes a diene.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the earlier steps. Maybe the reaction of propyne with red-hot iron isn't hydrogenation but something else. Let me think: another possibility is that the alkyne is being oxidized. The oxidation of propyne could form a ketone (acetone). So D would be acetone.

Then, when acetone (D) is treated with two strong acids, perhaps it undergoes some kind of nitration, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but acetone isn't an alkylating agent for that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HCl, which could lead to some reaction. Maybe the formation of a nitro compound, but I'm not getting it.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to think of the possible products and see if any options can be eliminated.

Looking at the options, let's go through each statement.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. F is formed when compound E reacts with Fe and HCl. Let's think: if E is a nitro compound, then F might be an amine. For example, if E is nitrobenzene, then F would be aniline. Aniline is used in dye synthesis, which would make option A correct. So if F is aniline, then A is correct. But I need to see if that's the case.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. H is formed when G reacts with NaOH. If G is a nitro compound, maybe H is a nitrate or some other compound. Alternatively, if G is an amine (like aniline), then NaOH would form its conjugate base. But aniline with NaOH gives a solution that can form white precipitates under certain conditions. Alternatively, if H is a nitroso compound, perhaps it would react with FeCl3. Alternatively, perhaps H is a phenol, which would turn yellow with FeCl3 (ferric chloride) if it's aryl boronic acid or something else. Wait, phenols can form yellow complex with FeCl3. So if H is a phenol, then option B is correct. But I'm not sure.

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. If D is propane (CH3CH2CH3), its NMR would have a single peak for all the equivalent CH3 groups. So only one singlet, not two. So option C would be incorrect if D is propane. Alternatively, if D is something else, like acetone, then its NMR would have a singlet for the three CH3 groups attached to the carbonyl. So again, one singlet. So if D is either propane or acetone, option C's statement would be incorrect. So option C could be the incorrect statement.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propyne, which is a flammable gas. So option D is correct.

So the incorrect statement would be either A, B, C, or another. Wait, but in the options, the incorrect statement is the one that's wrong. So the question is about identifying the incorrect statement.

If I'm correct that D is propane, then option C says D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. But propane has all equivalent CH3 groups, so only one singlet. So option C is incorrect, making option C the incorrect statement.

But let me think again. Another possibility: Maybe D is a di-substituted compound. For example, if D is propene, which is CH2=CHCH3, then its NMR would have a triplet for the CH3 group and a doublet for the CH2 group. But that's more complicated. Alternatively, if D is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propanol, but I can't see how that fits the reaction steps.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formation of D. Let me think again.

Starting from C, which is propyne (HC≡CCH3), passing through red-hot iron. If that's a hydrogenation to form propene, then D is propene (CH2=CHCH3). Then, D is treated with two strong acids. Let's say H2SO4 and HNO3. But propene is an alkene, and in the presence of concentrated HNO3 and H2SO4, it could undergo nitration. Wait, but nitration usually requires an aromatic ring. Without that, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the mixture of strong acids is for a different purpose. For example, if it's a sulfonation, but that's again for aromatic rings.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propene and it's undergoing a dihydroxylation to form a diol. But that would require a different setup, like using a catalyst such as H2O2 and OsO4. So that's probably not relevant.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let's think about what each answer option implies.

Option C says that D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. If D is a compound with two different sets of equivalent protons, each as a singlet, then that's possible. For example, if D is 2-bromopropane (CH2CH2BrCH3), but that's not likely given the reaction steps.

Alternatively, perhaps D is an alkene with two different types of CH2 groups. But then the NMR would show more than two peaks.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the products from each step.

Let me outline the steps again:

1. A (C3H6) → B (1,2-dibromopropane) via bromination.

2. B → C (propyne) via alcoholic KOH (elimination).

3. C → D via red-hot iron. Let's say D is propane.

4. D → E via two strong acids. Hmm. Maybe E is propane sulfonic acid? Not sure.

5. E → F via Fe scrap and HCl. Maybe E is a nitro compound, and F is an amine.

6. F → G via nitrous acid. Nitrous acid with primary amines forms diazonium salts, which can undergo various reactions.

7. G → H via NaOH. For example, if G is a diazonium salt, then with NaOH it might form a phenoxide or something else.

But I'm not making much progress. Let me think about the options again.

Option A: F is used for dye synthesis. If F is aniline, then yes. So A is correct.

Option B: H gives yellow color with FeCl3. If H is a phenol, then yes. So B could be correct.

Option C: D gives two singlets in NMR. If D is propane, NMR has one singlet. So this would be incorrect.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propyne, which is a flammable gas. So D is correct.

So the incorrect statement is option C. So the answer would be option C, which is statement C is incorrect.


The reaction sequence begins with Compound A (C3H6), which is propene. Bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride adds bromine across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (Compound B). Reaction of Compound B with alcoholic KOH leads to two eliminations of HBr, resulting in the formation of propyne (Compound C), a flammable gas. 

When propyne (Compound C) is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes hydrogenation to form propane (Compound D). Propane is then treated with a mixture of two strong acids, but the exact nature of this reaction is unclear due to the lack of reactivity of alkanes toward most acid conditions. For the sake of analysis, it is assumed that Compound D is propane.

The next step involves Compound D reacting with a mixture of two strong acids to form Compound E. Without further details, the exact nature of E remains ambiguous. However, Compound E reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid to form Compound F. If F is aniline (a plausible intermediate in this sequence), it aligns with the use of Fe and HCl for reducing nitro compounds. Aniline is indeed used in dye synthesis, making Option A correct.

Compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form Compound G, which could be a diazonium salt. When G reacts with sodium hydroxide, it forms Compound H. If H is a phenol, it would give a yellow color with ferric chloride solution, making Option B correct.

Compound D (propane) has a structure of CH3CH2CH3, where all protons are equivalent, resulting in a single singlet in the 1H NMR spectrum. Therefore, the statement that D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectrum is incorrect, making Option C the incorrect statement.

Finally, Compound C (propyne) is a flammable gas, making Option D correct.

In conclusion, the incorrect statement is **Option C**, as propane does not give two singlets in the 1H NMR spectrum.

Answer: C
