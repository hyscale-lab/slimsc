Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about pH calculations, which I remember can get tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The question says: Determine the pH of a solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I think the first thing I need to do is calculate the total amounts of each substance after mixing. Because when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So maybe I should figure out how much of each is present in terms of moles.

Wait, right. Moles are calculated by concentration (Molarity) multiplied by volume (in liters). Let me get each part.

First, CH3COOH. That's acetic acid, which is a weak acid. 500 mL is 0.5 L. So moles CH3COOH = 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.

Next, HCl. That's a strong acid. 400 mL is 0.4 L. So moles HCl = 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.

Then, Ba(OH)2. That's a strong base. 300 mL is 0.3 L. The formula for Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole gives two moles of OH^-.

So moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Since each gives 2 OH- per mole, the total OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, mixing them all together. So the total solution volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 liters.

But wait, the HCl and Ba(OH)2 will react. HCl is H+ and Cl^-; Ba(OH)2 gives Ba^2+ and OH^-. So the H+ from HCl will react with OH^- from Ba(OH)2 to form water.

The reaction is H+ + OH^- → H2O.

So I need to figure out how much H+ and OH- there is, and see which is in excess.

Total H+ comes from HCl only, because CH3COOH is a weak acid and won't dissociate completely. But wait, when calculating neutralization, do I need to consider the weak acid's H+? Hmm, maybe not, because the strong acid HCl will completely donate its H+ and the Ba(OH)2 will completely donate OH-.

So, moles H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

Moles OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

Now, when they react, which is in excess? Let's see: 0.08 H+ and 0.18 OH-. So H+ is less than OH-.

So all the H+ will be neutralized, leaving some OH-.

Moles OH- remaining = 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Wait, but what about the acetic acid? Since acetic acid is a weak acid, in the presence of excess OH-, it will also react. Because OH- is a strong base and will deprotonate the acetic acid.

So the OH- will react with the acetic acid. The reaction is CH3COOH + OH^- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So the acetic acid (0.05 moles) will react with the remaining OH- (0.10 moles). So which is in excess
