Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer step by step. Let me read the question again and take notes.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step.

First step: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C, producing a light yellow solid product 1. The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I think is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone. The ¹H NMR spectrum of product 1 has signals at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). Hmm, let me think about what this could be.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a bicyclic compound. Heating with KOH usually suggests an elimination reaction, perhaps dehydrohalogenation. But since it's dibrominated, it might undergo a double elimination. Wait, but the product has a carbonyl. Oh, wait, when two vicinal bromides (like 1,2-dibromo) are treated with strong base, elimination can form a ketone. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—the positions are 1 and 3. So that's not adjacent. Hmm, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps it's undergoing a Dieckmann elimination? No, that's for cyclic esters. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination leading to a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. But with KOH, which is a strong base, likely elimination.

Wait, I recall that when bicyclic systems with two leaving groups are treated with base, they can undergo elimination to form a ketone via a process called the Cope elimination or something similar. Alternatively, it could form an epoxide, but the IR is 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. So maybe the result is an adamantyl ketone.

Wait, product 1 has an IR peak at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe it's an epoxide? No, epoxides usually have higher wavenumbers, around 1250 cm⁻¹. Alternatively, maybe a ketone.

Looking at the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be an -O- group, but perhaps more likely, it's CH2 groups attached to an oxygen. Wait, but if it's a ketone, maybe it's some CH2 groups near the carbonyl. Or maybe it's an ester. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol. Wait, in the reaction with KOH, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But wait, product 1's NMR doesn't show any signals in the alkene region (~5-6 ppm). So maybe it's a diol? No, because the IR at 1720 suggests carbonyl, not an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone? Let me think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The
