Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through glass, and the glass itself is moving. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

The question states: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. What's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

Wait, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is towards the observer. So, the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light inside it is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. That's interesting.

In a vacuum, light's speed is always c, right? But here, it's in glass, which has a refractive index n. So the speed of light in the glass is c/n, but that's in the glass's rest frame. Now, since the glass itself is moving, I think I need to consider how this affects the observed speed.

Wait, I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly because of the way velocities transform between frames. Wait, but this might not involve relativity if the velocities are non-relativistic. Oh, wait, no—because light is involved. Because even at non-relativistic speeds, the speed of light must remain c in any inertial frame. But wait, no, that's only in a vacuum. Or wait, no—special relativity says that the speed of light is c in any inertial frame, regardless of motion. But in this case, the light is in a medium, so it's moving at c/n in the glass's rest frame. But when the glass is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up two different things here. The speed of light in a medium is v = c/n in the medium's rest frame. But when the medium is moving relative to the lab frame, how does that affect the speed measured in the lab?

Wait, but in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. So the light inside must be moving relative to the lab. Let me think in terms of Galilean transformations, which are good for non-relativistic speeds. Because v is probably small compared to c, so maybe Galilean addition applies.

In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v' = c/n. Since the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light, the lab observer would see the light's speed as v' + v?

Wait, but wait. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. The light inside is moving at (c/n) relative to the glass. So the lab frame would see the light's velocity as (c/n) + v?

But wait, that can't be right because if v is a significant fraction of c, Galilean addition isn't valid. But the options given don't seem to involve any addition under relativity. Let me look at the options.

The
