Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm. Let me try to break it down. The question is about two electrons in p orbitals. I remember that p orbitals have a principal quantum number l equal to 1. Each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l, so in this case, l1 and l2 are both 1.

The problem says that the coupled angular momentum state is |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, so that means l1 is 1, l2 is 1, the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and the m value is -1. Oh right, the total angular momentum L is the sum of the individual angular momenta, L1 and L2.

The question asks about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ. So, each Lz component is measured, and both give -ħ. Since each Lz is measured for each electron, we're looking for the probability that both L1z and L2z are -ħ.

Wait, the state is |1,1,2,-1>. I think that when you have coupled states, you can express them in terms of the uncoupled states. The coupled state is a combination of product states of individual states. So, the state |l1, l2, L, M> is a superposition of |m1, m2> states, where m1 + m2 = M.

In this case, M is -1. So the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> must be a linear combination of all the |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1.

Let me think about the possible m1 and m2 values. Since each l is 1, m can be -1, 0, +1. So for two electrons, the possible (m1, m2) pairs where m1 + m2 = -1 are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0) again? Wait no, wait, let's list all possible combinations:

Possible m1 and m2:

m1 can be -1, 0, +1.

m2 can be -1, 0, +1.

So for m1 + m2 = -1:

1. m1 = -1, m2 = 0 →
