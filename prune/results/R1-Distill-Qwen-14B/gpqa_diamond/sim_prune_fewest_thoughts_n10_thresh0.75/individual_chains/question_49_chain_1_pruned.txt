Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and it's about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember sigmatropic rearrangements involve the migration of a pi bond along with a sigma bond in a concerted manner. The question gives me three reactions, and I need to figure out the products A, B, and C based on the options provided.

Let me break down each reaction one by one.

The first reaction is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacting with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat. I'm thinking this might be a Cope or Claisen rearrangement, but wait, those are usually for 1,5-dienes or other enol ethers. Alternatively, maybe it's a related type of pericyclic reaction. The starting material is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. So that's like (CH3O)2CH-NH2 or something similar.

Wait, another thought: when amines and alcohols are present with acid and heat, they might form some kind of cyclic intermediate. Oh! Maybe it's a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement or something involving the formation of an oxonium ion. Or perhaps it's a Claisen-like rearrangement where the amine group is involved.

Wait, another idea: the 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine could act as a nucleophile. But with H+ and heat, maybe it's protonating the oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Alternatively, since it's an amine and an alcohol, perhaps it's forming an iminium ion. Alternatively, considering the presence of acid, it might be undergoing a hemiacetal or acetal formation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an example of a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement like a Cope. But for Cope rearrangement, you need 1,5-dienes. Hmm. Let me see the structure of the first reactant. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be N-methyldimethylamine oxide? Wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2, but 1,1-dimethoxy would be (CH3O)2CH2NH2? Wait, no, wait: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be H2N-C(OCH3)2. So the structure is H2N-C(OCH3)2.

Wait, perhaps it's more like H2N-C(OCH2CH3)2? Wait, no, the compound is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. Ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would be OCH3 groups on the same carbon as the amine. So the structure would be NH2-C(OCH3)2.

Wait, but how would that react with but-3-en-2-ol? But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2
