Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrostatics. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the net potential energy of a system where a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. Hmm. Wait, no, actually, the charge q is placed d distance away from the center. So the setup is like this: a conducting sphere, which is grounded, and charge q is somewhere near it. I need to calculate the potential energy of this system.

Potential energy in electrostatics... Right, I remember that the potential energy of a charge in an electric potential is given by U = q * V, where V is the potential at the location of the charge. But wait, when dealing with systems of charges, sometimes you have to consider the work done to assemble the charges. Oh right, and for conductors, things are a bit different because charges reside on the surface.

Wait, the sphere is grounded. That means it's connected to the Earth, so any charges on it can flow in or out. If the sphere is conducting, any charge placed on it would redistribute itself on the surface. But if it's grounded, then any induced charges would be neutralized by the ground. Hmm, no, wait. If you place a charge near a conducting sphere, the sphere will have induced charges. But because it's grounded, the net charge on the sphere can change. Wait, but in this case, the sphere is initially uncharged, right? Or is the charge q placed on the sphere? No
