Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule to visualize what I'm aiming for. The structure is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So it's a phenyl group attached to an ethanone (acetone) group. On the phenyl ring, there's a bromine at the 3 position and a nitro group at the 5 position. Wait, but numbering the benzene ring can sometimes be tricky. Let me make sure: if the ketone is attached at position 1, then bromine is at position 3 (two carbons away) and nitro at position 5 (four carbons away in a six-membered ring). So the substituents are meta to each other? Or maybe ortho? No, wait, 1,3,5 would be positions that are all meta, but here we have two substituents: nitro and bromo.

Wait, the target structure is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl ring is attached to the carbonyl group. So the benzene ring has three substituents: the ketone is at position 1, bromo at 3, and nitro at 5. Therefore, the substituents are arranged in a way that they are at 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone.

So I need to find a way to introduce these substituents in the correct positions. Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution, so the order in which groups are introduced will determine their positions relative to each other.

The substituents are bromine, nitro, and the ketone group. Wait, the ketone is an electron-withdrawing group, which would make the ring more reactive towards electrophiles in certain positions.

Wait, no, the ketone is attached to the benzene as a substituent. Benzophenone derivatives are typically formed via Friedel-Crafts acylation, but wait! Friedel-Crafts requires the benzene to have activating groups because the acylation is an electroph
