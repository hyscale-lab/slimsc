Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay and resolution in a bubble chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about the CERN Bubble Chamber. A particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is given as τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. They want to find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, what's the proper lifetime? Oh right, proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when observed, due to time dilation, the lifetime will appear longer if the particle is moving. So the observed lifetime τ is gamma times τ₀. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity of the particle.

Okay, so first, I need to find the Lorentz factor gamma for this particle. Gamma is equal to the total energy divided by the rest mass energy. Because Energy E = gamma * m₀c², so gamma = E / (m₀c²). Oh, but wait, the mass is given in GeV, and energy is also in GeV. So units might cancel out correctly.

So E is 27 GeV, m₀ is 3.41 GeV. So gamma is 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, 3.41*8 is 27.28. Oh wait, 27 is just a bit less than 3.41*8. So 27/3.41 is approximately 7.91. Wait, wait, 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, 3.41*7.9 is 3.41*(7 + 0.9) = 23.87 + 3.069 = 26.939. Close to 27. So gamma is approximately 7.91.

So gamma is about 7.91.

Therefore, the observed lifetime τ = gamma * τ₀. τ₀ is 8e-16 s. So τ = 7.91 * 8e-16. Let's compute that. 7.91 *8 is about 63.28, so τ is approximately 6.328e-15 seconds.

Wait, but why is the observed lifetime longer? Because the particle is moving at a high speed, so from our frame of reference, it lives longer. So the particle can travel a longer distance before decaying.

The next part is to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm. So the resolution refers to the precision needed in the detecting medium to distinguish where the decay occurred. The resolution is the smallest distance that can be detected, right? So the decay products will leave a track, and the chamber should record the decay point accurately.

But how does
