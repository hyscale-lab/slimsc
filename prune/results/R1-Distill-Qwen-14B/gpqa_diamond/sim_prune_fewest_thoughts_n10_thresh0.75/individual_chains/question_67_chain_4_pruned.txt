Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're supposed to ignore their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So, l1 and l2 are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each particle, right? And l and m are the total angular momentum quantum numbers for the two-electron system.

The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z and getting eigenvalues of -ħ each. I remember that Lz is the z-component of the orbital angular momentum, and the eigenvalues are mħ where m is the magnetic quantum number.

Wait, but in this state, l1 and l2 are both 1, so each electron is in a p-orbital (since l=1 for p). So each L1z and L2z can take values -ħ, 0, or +ħ, because m can be -l, ..., +l.

But the given coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>. So the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1.

Hmm. I think the coupled state is a total angular momentum state, which is a combination of the individual states. The question is about measuring each electron's Lz, so I guess I need to express the coupled state in terms of the product of individual Lz eigenstates.

Wait, the coupled state |l1, l2, l, m> is a specific state in the coupled basis. To find the probability of getting specific values for each Lz, I think I need to express this coupled state in terms of the product of individual states |l1, m1> and |l2, m2>, right?

Because L1z and L2z are the individual operators for each electron. So when you measure them, you get their respective m1 and m2 values multiplied by ħ.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> is in the coupled angular momentum basis. To find the probability of m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, which would give both L1z and L2z being -ħ.

Wait, but m1 + m2 = m_total. So in this case, m_total is -1. So if m1 is -1 and m2 is 0, that adds up to -1. Or m1=0 and m2=-1. Or m1=1 and m2=-2, but wait, m2 can't be -2 because for l2=1, m2 can be -1, 0, +1. So the possible (m1, m2) pairs that sum to m = -1 are (-1,0), (0,-1), but not (1,-2) because m2 can't be -2.

Wait, but let me think about how the coupled state is constructed. The state |l1, l2, l, m> is a superposition of all possible |m1, m2> states where m1
