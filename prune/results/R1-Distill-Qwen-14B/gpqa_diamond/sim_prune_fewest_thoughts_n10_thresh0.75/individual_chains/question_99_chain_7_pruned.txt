Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still learning. Let's take it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. 

So, the first thing I'll do is read the question carefully. The compound is an unknown, and we're given two characterization techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. 

Looking at the FTIR data: there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm-1. I remember that FTIR is useful for identifying functional groups. The broad peak around 3000 likely corresponds to O-H stretching, which is common in carboxylic acids because they're acidic and have strong hydrogen bonds. The strong peak at 1700 cm-1 is probably a carbonyl group (C=O), which makes sense for a carboxylic acid. So, the compound likely has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).

Next, looking at the 1H NMR data: there are several peaks, but none correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the molecule probably doesn't have any double bonds, meaning it's a single bond structure. The absence of vinyl signals suggests no alkenes or aromatic rings, which aligns with the options given—most are branched alkanes with a carboxylic acid group.

Now, the NMR details: There's a signal that's a doublet of triplets of quartets and another that's a doublet of triplets of triplets. These splitting patterns seem complex, so I need to think about what kind of environments would cause such splitting. 

Let me consider the structure of the options. All options have a carboxylic acid group, so the COOH is at the end. The rest seems to be a branched carbon chain. Let's look at each option:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
So the structure is CH2COOH attached to a central carbon which is connected to two C2H5 groups and another CH3? Wait, the formula is a bit confusing. Let me parse it. It's CH3–C(H)(C2H5)–C(H)(C2H5)–CH2–COOH. So the chain is longer, with two substituents on each of two central carbons.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
So the structure is COOH at the end, with two substituents on the adjacent carbon. The substituents are CH2CH3 and another CH2CH3 on the same carbon, and an H. Then, a CH2CH3 group is attached next to that.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
This would be CH2COOH attached to a central part where each of the two central carbons have a CH3 and an H. So, like (CH3)2CH–CH2–COOH? Wait, no. Let's see: it's CH3–C(H)(CH3)–C(H)(CH3)–CH2–COOH. So the two central carbons each have a CH3 and an H, and are connected by a single bond. So the structure is more like (CH3)2CHCH2COOH? No, wait, the substituents are on adjacent carbons. So it's more like (CH3)C–C(CH3)–CH2COOH.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH
So COOH is at the end, attached to a carbon that has a CH2CH3 and a CH3 substituent. The next carbon has a CH3 and an
