Okay, so I've got this question about astrophysics, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says: Large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Hmm, I remember that the Lyman-alpha line is in the ultraviolet range. Oh wait, because Lyman-alpha is a transition in hydrogen where the electron goes from n=2 to n=1. The rest wavelength is about 1216 Angstroms, which is in the far ultraviolet. So, if this line is being observed, the redshift of the cloud must shift it into a wavelength that the telescope can detect.

But optical ground-based telescopes can't observe ultraviolet light because the atmosphere absorbs it. So for the Lyman-alpha absorption to be in the optical range, the redshift must be such that 1216 Angstroms is shifted into the visible spectrum.

Wait, wait. Let me think about this. The observed wavelength λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift. So if the Lyman-alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms, then for it to be in the optical range, λ_obs must be longer than about 400 nm, I think. Because optical wavelengths are roughly 400-700 nm. Wait, converting Angstroms to nanometers: 1 nm is 10 Angstroms, so 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms.

Wait, the observed wavelength would need to be in the optical range. So λ_obs = 1216 * (1 + z) >= 4000 Angstroms? Because that's when it's in the visible range.

Wait, let me check the numbers. Let me calculate z. So, 1216 * (1 + z) = 4000. So 1 + z = 4000 / 1216. Let's compute that.

4000 divided by 1216. Hmm, 1216 *3 is 3648, which is less than 4000. 3.294 would be 4000/1216. Because 1216 * 3.294 = let's see, 1216 *3=3648, 1216 *0.2=243.2, 1216*0.094≈114.5. So total 3648+243.2=3891.2 +114.5≈4005.7. So 3.294 is approximately 3.29. So 1 + z ≈3.29, so z≈2.29. So redshift z is about 2.29.

But wait, the question is about the lower limit. So when does the Lyman-alpha line enter the optical range? It's when the observed wavelength is 400 nm (4000 Angstroms). So the minimum redshift for it to be just visible is when λ_obs =4000 Angstroms.

So z_min is approximately 2.29. Let's see the options: option C is 2.4, option D is 1.9.

Wait, but wait. Does the quasar's light have to have the Lyman-alpha line in the emitted frame, and the absorption happens at higher redshift? Oh, wait, no. The cloud is in front of the quasar, so the cloud's redshift is higher than the quasar's. Wait, no, no, wait
