Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the motion of its ejecta. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. So the question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. That probably means we can use special relativity here because they're not accelerating relative to each other.

Wait, the problem says from the ejecta's frame, the center of the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta must be moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center, right? Because velocities in different frames are relative.

But wait, no. Wait, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy's center. Because the velocity reverses when you switch frames. So if the Galaxy is moving at v towards the ejecta in the ejecta's frame, then the ejecta is moving at v towards the Galaxy in the Galaxy's frame.

So the problem is asking: what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame? So the time given is in the ejecta's frame. We need to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, but how to relate the two times. Because time dilation comes into play here when moving between frames.

Wait
