Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about plant resistance to a fungal disease. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

Alright, the setup is that they're testing three genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knockout mutants and some double mutants. The question is about how these genes interact, especially since at least one is a transcription factor upstream of others.

The data they have is the resistance levels of each mutant compared to the wild-type. 100% is the wild type's resistance. The mutants’ resistances are:
- g1: 75% 
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Hmm, so the wild-type is 100%, so any mutant with lower than that is more susceptible. 

Let me think about what each mutant shows.

First, let's see the single mutants. 

g1 is at 75%, which is less than wild type. So knocking out G1 makes the plant less resistant. That suggests that G1 is involved in the resistance pathway. But how?

g2 is at 0%, which is super susceptible. That's a big effect. So the absence of G2 completely removes resistance. Maybe G2 is a crucial gene, perhaps a transcription factor or something essential.

g3 is at 50%, so half resistance. So knocking out G3 reduces resistance but doesn't eliminate it entirely.

Now, the double mutants:

g1g3: 10% — that's even more susceptible than either g1 or g3 alone. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance plummets.

g2g3: 0%. So when both G2 and G3 are out, the resistance is gone. But wait, g2 alone is already 0%, so the double mutant is the same as g2 alone. That might suggest that G3 is epistatic to G2, but wait, I'm not sure.

g1g2: 0% — same as g2 alone. So in the double mutant of G1 and G2, the resistance is the same as when G2 is knocked out. So the presence of the G1 mutation doesn't change the outcome when G2 is also knocked out. That suggests that G2 is upstream of G1, or something like that. Because if G2's function is upstream, then without G2, G1's function doesn't matter because the pathway is already blocked.

Wait, but the question says that at least one is a transcription factor upstream of others. So maybe G2 is the transcription factor? Because if G2 is upstream, then knocking it out would prevent the downstream genes from being expressed. 

Looking at the data, when G2 is absent (g2), resistance is 0%. That could mean that G2 is a transcription factor required for the expression of other resistance genes. So without G2, none of the downstream genes are active, leading to no resistance.

So, if G2 is a transcription factor, then what about G1 and G3?

Looking at their single mutant resistances:

- G1 knockout (g1) has 75%. So the plant is less resistant but still has some. So maybe G1 is a downstream gene that contributes to resistance, but not the only one. Or perhaps G1 is part of a redundant pathway.

- G3 knockout (g3) has 50% resistance. So when G3 is out, the plant can still resist the pathogen but not as well. So G3 might also be a downstream gene.

But in the double mutants:

g1g3 has 10% resistance. That's much lower than either single mutant. So both G1 and G3 contribute, but their effects are additive or synergistic. Because when both are missing, you get much lower resistance than
