Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an annihilation process. Hmm, let's see. The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, so I guess that means its speed is much less than the speed of light, but wait, no, because in particle physics, when something is moving slowly, it's not necessarily non-relativistic. Or maybe here it's implying that the kinetic energy is low compared to the rest mass energy? I'm not entirely sure, but I'll proceed.

The given is that the mass of A is 300 MeV/c². Wait, so the rest energy of each A particle is 300 MeV. And the question is about finding the velocity of particle A.

Wait, but wait a second. The reaction involves a proton and an antiproton annihilating into two A⁺ and two A⁻. So, the charges should balance. Let me see: proton is +e, antiproton is -e. So total charge is zero. On the right side, two A⁺ (+e each) and two A⁻ (-e each) also sum up to zero. So that checks out. But maybe that's not directly relevant to solving the problem, but just a sanity check.

Now, the problem gives the mass of A as 300 MeV. So, m_A c² = 300 MeV. I think I need to find the velocity of A, so I probably need to relate it to the energy or momentum conservation.

Since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps in the lab frame the proton is at rest? Or maybe the initial momentum is low. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let's think about the initial setup. The antiproton is moving slowly. So, in the lab frame, perhaps the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving with some low speed. But wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe the system's initial energy is dominated by the rest masses? Or maybe the kinetic energy is negligible, but that might not be the case.

Wait, but in particle physics, annihilation processes often conserve energy and momentum. So, the initial particles (proton and antiproton) have rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The products are the A particles. Hmm, but the masses of the proton and antiproton are about 938 MeV/c² each. So, their combined rest mass is around 1876 MeV
