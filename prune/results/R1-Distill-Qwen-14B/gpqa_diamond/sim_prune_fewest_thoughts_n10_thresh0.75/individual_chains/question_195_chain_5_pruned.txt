Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and an orbital period of 3 days. The star's radius is 1.5 times that of the Sun. The second planet has a radius of 2.5 Earth radii. The question is asking for the maximum orbital period of this second planet such that both transit and occultation events are observed. 

Hmm, transit and occultation events. I remember that a transit happens when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. An occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so we don't see its light anymore. For both events to happen, the planet's orbital plane must be aligned so that it transits, and because of this alignment, it can also be eclipsed by the star.

Wait, but how do orbital periods factor into this? Oh, right, the orbital period determines how long it takes the planet to go around the star. The longer the period, the larger the orbit, since according to Kepler's third law, the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (assuming same mass for the star).

So the problem is about finding the maximum period of the second planet so that both transit and occultation are possible. I think the key here is the alignment of their orbits. Both planets must have their orbital planes aligned so that the second planet can transit in front of the star, and when it's behind, it's occulted. But wait, the first planet is already known to transit, so that means their orbital planes are aligned. So the second planet must also share the same orbital plane, which is given.

Now, the thing is, the transit and occultation depend on the relative sizes of the planet and the star. Wait, but for occultation, the planet must be smaller than the star, which is always the case. So maybe that's not the issue here. Hmm, perhaps the issue is more about the timingâ€”like, the orbital periods of the two planets must be such that they can both have events observed.

Wait, but maybe the key here is that both planets must have their orbital periods such that their orbits are in a configuration where both transits and occult
