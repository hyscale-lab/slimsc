Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully. 

The question is about the electrophilic substitution reactions of six different substances with excess bromine. Each one forms a monobromo derivative, and I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. Hmm, so the para-isomer's yield is what's important here.

Wait, so when a benzene ring undergoes electrophilic substitution, substituents on the ring can direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions. Depending on whether the substituent is activating or deactivating, and whether it's meta or para directing, the pattern of substitution changes.

Each of the given compounds has a substituent attached to the benzene ring. Let's list them out:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's toluene, a methyl group attached to benzene.
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: That's an ethyl ester group, so the substituent is COOCH2CH3.
3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorobenzene, with Cl as the substituent.
4) C6H5-NO2: Nitrobenzene, with a nitro group.
5) C6H5-C2H5: That's ethylbenzene, substituent is CH2CH3.
6) C6H5-COOH: Benzoic acid, substituent is COOH.

I remember that substituents can be either activating (electron-donating) or deactivating (electron-withdrawing). Activating groups make the ring more reactive, and direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions, while deactivating groups do the opposite.

Let me recall the directing effects:

- Methyl (CH3): Activating, ortho/para-directing.
- Nitro (NO2): Deactivating, meta-directing.
- Chlorine (Cl): Deactivating, ortho/para-directing but less reactive.
- COOCH2CH3 (ester): The ester group is deactivating because it's an electron-withdrawing group (the carbonyl). Ester is meta-directing.
- COOH (carboxylic acid): Also deactivating, meta-directing.
- CH2CH3 (ethyl): Activating, ortho/para-directing.

Wait, so for each substituent, I need to determine if it's activating or deactivating, and whether it's ortho/para or meta directing. This will influence where the bromine adds.

Now, when the substituent is activating (like methyl, ethyl), the ring is more reactive, and the substituent is ortho/para directing, meaning the incoming electrophile tends to add in those positions. In such cases, the para isomer is often the major product, but competition between ortho and para can occur. However, for each substituent, the ratio between ortho, meta, and para can vary.

But wait, in this problem, each compound undergoes an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. So, it's a monobromination, but the substituent affects where the bromine goes.

The question is about the weight
