Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a specific potential in two dimensions. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. The options are various expressions involving quantum numbers and some coefficients multiplied by hbar times sqrt(k/m). 

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when dealing with potentials, especially in two dimensions, sometimes the problem can be solved by separating the Schrödinger equation into radial and angular parts. But this potential looks a bit complicated. Let me see.

The potential is V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let me factor out kr²: so it's kr² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ]. Hmm, can I rewrite this in a way that separates r and θ? Maybe express it as V(r) + W(θ), where V(r) is the part depending only on r, and W(θ) depends only on θ. Let me check: (1/2)kr² is just a function of r. The other term is (3/2) kr² cos²θ, which is kr² multiplied by cos²θ. So yes, it's separable into radial and angular parts.

So, the potential can be written as V(r) = (1/2)kr² and W(θ) = (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Wait, but since both terms have kr², I think that this can be rewritten as kr² [½ + (3/2) cos²θ]. Hmm, so the potential is a function that depends on r² and also on cos²θ. 

Wait, another thought: perhaps this is a case where the potential can be expressed in terms of polar coordinates, and the problem can be solved by using polar coordinates, taking advantage of the separation of variables in the Schrödinger equation. Let me recall that in polar coordinates, the Schrödinger equation separates into radial and angular parts.

The general approach for separable potentials is to write the wavefunction as a product of radial and angular parts. So, ψ(r,θ) = R(r) Θ(θ).
