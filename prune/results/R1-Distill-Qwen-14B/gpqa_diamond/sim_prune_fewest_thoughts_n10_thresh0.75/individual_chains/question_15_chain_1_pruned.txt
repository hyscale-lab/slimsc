Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet has a higher chance of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Let's break down the information given.

Both planets have the same minimum mass, which I think means they're similar in mass. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—it's three times shorter than Planet_2. So if the period is shorter, the planet is closer to its star because orbital period relates to the distance from the star. Right, Kepler's third law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis, so a shorter period means a smaller orbit.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they're equally sized. Wait, so same radius, but different masses. So Planet_1's star is more massive but same radius—probably a main-sequence star, while Planet_2's is a slightly evolved star, perhaps a subgiant or something, but same radius.

Transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital inclination. But since we're comparing two planets, I think inclination isn't a factor here because it's about the probability, which averages over all possible inclinations. So the main factors would be the size of the star and the size of the planet, and the size of the planet's orbit because the transit occurs when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view.

Wait, actually, the probability of a transit is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a_p / R_s), where R_p is planet radius, R_s is star radius, and a_p is the planet's orbital radius. Or maybe I'm mixing that up. Alternatively, the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 times the impact parameter, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, another approach: the probability that a
