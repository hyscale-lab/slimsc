Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about a chemical reaction involving substance X, liquid Y, and a bunch of products. Hmm, I'll need to break this down step by step.

First, the substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X has an isotope that's heavier than the usual. I remember that isotopes have the same number of protons but different neutrons. So maybe X is something like hydrogen with deuterium, but wait, hydrogen is too simple. Or maybe carbon with a heavier isotope like C-14? Not sure yet.

Then, X reacts violently with liquid Y. Violent reactions... like maybe an acid reacting with a carbonate or something. Or perhaps a reaction that produces a gas quickly. The reaction releases gas W, whose molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Let me thinkâ€”what gases have that? Maybe something with H and O, but let's see.

Wait, the number of neutrons and protons in the molecule. If it's a diatomic gas, like H2, then each H has 0 neutrons and 1 proton. So for H2, total protons are 2, neutrons 0. Not equal. Wait, but maybe another gas.

Wait, the molecule is a gas, so perhaps it's CO2? No, carbon has 6 protons, oxygen 8, so total would be 14 protons and 16 (8*2) neutrons? No, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe NH3? No, it's a gas, but not sure.

Wait, maybe the molecule is something like O2. Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (since oxygen is usually O-16, which has 8 neutrons). So O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. Oh, that fits! So gas W is O2. But wait, O2 is diatomic, and the number of protons and neutrons in each molecule would be per O atom, but the question says the molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, for O2, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So the molecule has 16 protons (2 atoms *8) and 16 neutrons (2*
