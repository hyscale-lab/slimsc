Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because particle physics isn't my strongest suit. But I'll give it a shot by breaking it down step by step.

So the question is about an electron and a positron colliding and annihilating into two photons. The details given are that the electron is moving to the right (since it's moving from the left along the horizontal axis), and the positron is moving to the left (from the right). Both have different Lorentz factors: the electron has a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron has 2.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma equals 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron. Lorentz factor is greater than or equal to 1, so that makes sense.

When they annihilate, they produce two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are both to the right, but one is upper-right and the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Hmm, okay. So the setup is that both particles are moving along the horizontal axis, but in opposite directions. When they collide, they annihilate into two photons with equal energy. And the photons are moving in opposite vertical directions but same horizontal direction, I think.

Wait, no. The problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So both are moving to the right but in opposite vertical (upper and lower) directions. So the angle between them would be 180 degrees minus twice the angle each makes with the horizontal.

Wait no, perhaps not. Let me think again. If both photons are moving to the right (same horizontal direction), but one is going up and to the right, the other down and to the right, then the angle between them is 180 degrees? Because if one is at an angle θ above the horizontal, the other would be θ below, making a total angle between them of 2θ. But wait, in this case, the two photons' directions are in different quadrants relative to the collision point.

Wait, but I think I should approach this with conservation laws. Since energy and momentum must be conserved, I can set up equations based on that.

So let's model this.

First, the electron and positron are annihilating.
