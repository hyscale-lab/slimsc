Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy and redshifts. Hmm, let me think. The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. And the task is to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Wait, I remember that the Lyman alpha line is emitted by hydrogen when an electron transitions from the second energy level to the first. But in this case, it's absorption, not emission. So when this line is observed in absorption, it tells us about the redshift of the cloud causing the absorption.

Redshift (z) relates the observed wavelength (λ_observed) to the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted) by the formula: λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z). So if the emitted wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, then when it's observed, it's longer because of the expansion of the universe, right?

But wait, the quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen cloud. So the cloud is in front of the quasar, right? The quasar emits light, and the hydrogen cloud in the intervening space absorbs at the Lyman alpha wavelength for that cloud. So the observed wavelength depends on the redshift of the cloud.

But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift such that the absorption can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. So what's the cutoff for optical telescopes?

I think optical telescopes can observe wavelengths in the visible spectrum, roughly 400-700 nm. Wait, wait, but wait—wait a second, 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. That's in the ultraviolet range, right? Because 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 Ang is 121.6 nm. That's way below the visible range. So if the cloud has a redshift such that the absorbed wavelength moves into the optical range, then the quasar's light can be observed with optical telescopes, but the absorption line would be in the optical.

Wait, no. Actually, the quasar emits light across the spectrum, but the absorption line would be in the observed frame. So for the Lyman alpha absorption to be in the optical, the redshift must be such that 1216 A*(1+z) is about in the range where optical telescopes can see.

So let's calculate the redshift z where 1216 A*(1+z) is equal to about 4000 A, which is the start of the optical range (or maybe 700 nm, but I'll think about it).

Wait, wait, wait. Let me clarify. The wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line is 121.6 nm (1216 Angstroms). So when this is redshifted, the observed wavelength λ_obs is 121.6 * (1+z) nm.

But ground-based optical telescopes can't observe wavelengths below about 300 nm or so because the atmosphere blocks ultraviolet light. So if the observed wavelength is longer than about 300 nm, it's in the optical range and can be detected from the ground.

So the minimum z would be when λ_obs is just above 300 nm. Let me compute that.

So λ_obs = 121.6 * (1+z) = 300 nm.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. So,

121.6 * (1 + z) = 300 nm.

Divide both sides by 121.6:

1 + z = 300 / 121.6 ≈ 2.468.

So z ≈ 1.468
