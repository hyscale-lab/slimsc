Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the CMB. Hmm, let me think about what I remember. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the energy at which the lifetime of gamma-rays is limited by their annihilation with CMB photons into electron-positron pairs. The process is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. The options are all in the GeV range, which is super high energy.

First, I remember that the lifetime of a particle is related to its energy and the probability of interactions. High-energy particles have shorter lifetimes if they interact frequently. So the process in question must be a significant interaction that limits their lifetime.

I think this has to do with the photon-photon interaction cross-section. The cross-section determines the probability of the interaction. For high-energy photons, the cross-section for pair production (gamma gamma → e+ e-) increases. But wait, I should recall the formula for the cross-section in this context.

The cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs is given by σ ≈ (8π/3) * (α²/(s)) * (m_e²c^4) / (s), where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Wait, no, I think that's not quite right. Alternatively, maybe it's proportional to 1/s, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, I remember that the cross-section σ is inversely proportional to the square of the photon energy, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the optical depth τ tells us whether a photon will annihilate. τ is the product of the cross-section σ, the flux N of target photons, and the velocity of the photon (but since we're dealing with high-energy photons, their velocities are near c, so maybe that's approximated as 1). If τ ≈ 1, then the photon's lifetime is significantly affected.

So the condition is τ ≈ 1. The optical depth τ is given by τ = σ * n * (c * t), where n is the number density of the target photons. Hmm, but wait, the process is γ + γ → e+ e-, so both photons are annihilating. So in this case, the cross-section would involve two CMB photons. Or wait, no, one is the gamma-ray, the other is the CMB photon.

Wait, wait, the problem says the annihilation is between a high-energy gamma-ray and a CMB photon. So the gamma-ray is the primary photon, and the CMB photon is the target.

So the cross-section for a gamma-ray photon of energy E and a CMB photon of energy E_cmb is relevant. The average CMB photon energy is given as E_cmb = 1e-3 eV. So the number density n is the photon density of the CMB.

The number density of CMB photons can be found using the CMB temperature. Oh wait, but the problem doesn't give the temperature directly. Oh, but the average photon energy can be
