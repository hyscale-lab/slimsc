Okay, so I have this question about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Hmm, I need to figure out which structure it is based on the given data. Let me think step by step.

First, let me look at the FTIR data. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches. Since it's a broad peak, it's probably from an alcohol, but wait, maybe a carboxylic acid? Because carboxylic acids have strong O-H stretches that are broad. Oh right, carboxylic acids have a broad peak around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ due to the O-H group. So that fits.

Also, there's a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹. That peak is likely a carbonyl group (C=O). So putting that together, the compound probably has both a carbonyl group and a carboxylic acid group. Wait, but wait—if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is part of the COOH group. So the 1700 cm⁻¹ is the C=O of the carboxylic acid. Alternatively, if it were an ester or ketone, but the presence of a broad O-H suggests it's a carboxylic acid.

Now looking at the 1H NMR. The question says none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens, so no double bonds. So structures with any double bonds can be ruled out? Wait, looking at the options, all the given compounds seem to be saturated. Let me check the options again.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So that's a structure where a central carbon (maybe a quaternary carbon) is attached to two ethyl groups and a CH2COOH. Hmm, no double bonds.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. Wait, that structure would have a central carbon connected to another CH2 group. Wait, maybe it's something like a geminal di-substitution.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So that's two methyl groups on adjacent carbons, then a CH2COOH.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So this looks like a central carbon with ethyl, methyl, and another CH group, and a COOH attached.

So all options have COOH groups, as expected.

Now, the NMR signals. The question mentions that one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me think about splitting patterns. Each split is due to coupling with neighboring protons.

So, for a doublet of triplets of quartets, the proton in question must be coupled with three different sets of protons. Let's think about the structure.

First, let's consider the environment of each proton in the NMR. For each option, what kind of splitting would we expect.

Looking at option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So the structure is:

CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH

So the two central carbons each have a CH group (each CH has two substituents: one CH3 and one CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me write it more clearly.

Structure of D: 
- The first carbon is CH3CH2-.
- Then, the next carbon is CH (with CH3 and the previous group).
- The next is another CH (with CH3 and the next group).
- Then, COOH.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like:

CH3-
