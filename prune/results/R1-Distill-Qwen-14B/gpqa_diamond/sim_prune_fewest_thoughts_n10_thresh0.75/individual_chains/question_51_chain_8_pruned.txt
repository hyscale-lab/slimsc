Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the problem is about calculating the net potential energy of a system where a charge q is placed a certain distance from a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember that potential energy in such systems often involves considering the interactions between charges, but I'm not exactly sure how to approach this.

Wait, the sphere is grounded. Grounded means it's connected to the Earth, so any excess charge would go into the ground, right? Oh, but wait, no—if the sphere is conducting and grounded, any induced charges on the sphere would actually cause a current, but since it's grounded, the potential on the sphere's surface must be zero. Is that right? Because the Earth is at zero potential.

So the setup: charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of the sphere. The sphere has radius R, and it's grounded. I need to find the potential energy of this configuration.

Potential energy between charges typically comes from the work done to assemble them. But since the sphere is conducting and grounded, maybe I don't need to consider the self-energy of the induced charges on the sphere. Oh wait, because if the sphere is neutral to begin with, the induced charges would just adjust, but since it's grounded, the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.

Wait, another thought: the conducting sphere when charged would have induced charges, but since it's grounded, the excess charge would leave, making the sphere's net charge zero. Or wait, no—wait, the sphere starts neutral. When you bring a charge q near it, it induces charges on the sphere. But because it's grounded, the
