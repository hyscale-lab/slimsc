Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question again and trying to break it down.

The question is about a chemical reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. The reaction produces a gas W, a precipitate G, and another product B. There's also mention of a keto acid reacting with X to form a product with two oxygen atoms. I need to determine the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering isotopes.

Hmm. Let's try to parse each part. 

First, the reaction: X reacts violently with Y to release gas W. W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. That's interesting. So, if a molecule has equal protons and neutrons, what could it be? Well, let's think about common gases. For example, H2O has 8 protons and 8 (assuming H is 1, O is 8) but wait, no. Wait, the molecule itself must have the same number of protons and neutrons. Wait, wait, the gas's molecule has equal protons and neutrons in total? Or each atom? No, the molecule as a whole. So the total number of protons and neutrons in the molecule are the same.

Wait, no, I think the question says the gas W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Or wait, the same number of neutrons and protons each, meaning for each atom? Or for the entire molecule? The wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again: "gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." Oh, maybe each molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So the total number of protons and the total number of neutrons in each molecule are equal.

So for example, if the molecule has two atoms, each with the same number of protons and neutrons. Or maybe a molecule where the sum of protons equals the sum of neutrons. Let me think of possible gases.

Wait, another approach. Let's think of a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Possible candidates: CO2? No. H2O? Let's see. H2O has 2 H atoms (each has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, normally) and one O (8 protons
