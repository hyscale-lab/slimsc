Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about optical isomerism, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question provides four organic compounds and asks which of them exhibit optical isomerism. The options are combinations of these four. I remember that optical isomerism, or enantiomerism, occurs when a compound has a chiral center, meaning it has a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, compounds with certain types of stereoisomerism, like geometric isomerism, might not show optical activity, but wait, no, optical isomerism is specifically about enantiomers.

Let me take each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm. Biphenyl structures can sometimes have axial chirality if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image. Wait, biphenyls with substituents on each ring that are not symmetrical could lead to atropisomerism. Atropisomers are a type of stereoisomer where the rotation around the bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted. For that to happen, the substituents need to be in such a way that the molecule can't freely rotate. If the substituents are large enough and positioned so that rotation is hindered (like in para positions), the molecule could have two enantiomers. Here, the substituents are at 6,6' and 2,2' positions. Wait, so the molecule has nitro groups on the 6 positions of each phenyl and carboxylate ester groups on the 2 positions. Are these substituents arranged such that the biphenyl can't rotate? The substituents at 2 and 6 positions on each ring are probably in positions that are para to each other. Wait, but biphenyls with substituents on adjacent positions (ortho) can have atropisomerism, but if substituents are on para positions, maybe the molecule is more symmetrical. Let me think again. If the substituents are on each ring in such a way that they are across from each other, like on opposite sides, then rotation is restricted. So if the substituents are on 2 and 6 positions, which are across from each other on each ring, then the biphenyl might have hindered rotation and thus exhibit optical isomerism. So compound 1 could have optical isomers.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's parse this. The formula is CH3CO-O-COCH2OH? Wait, no, the correct structure. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon is the one attached to OH, COOCH3, CH3, and the adjacent CH2 group. Wait, let's see: the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3? Or is it CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2
