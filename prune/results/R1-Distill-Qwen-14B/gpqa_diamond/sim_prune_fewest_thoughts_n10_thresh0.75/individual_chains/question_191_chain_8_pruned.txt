Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me draw the structure in my mind. So, it's a cyclohexane ring. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group—so that's a CH2OH attached to the ring. At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like a CH2CH2 group but wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the substituent where the double bond starts at C1 and the substituent is at C2. So that would be CH2-C(=CH2)-. Wait, no, I think prop-1-en-2-yl is actually CH2CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2. Wait, maybe I should think of it as CH2-C with a double bond to CH2? No, wait. Let me clarify. Prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2CH2 with the substituent on the middle carbon. Wait, maybe it's more like CH2-C(=CH2)-, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C2. So that would be CH2-CH(·)—but wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CHCH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So the en-2-yl group would be the substituent on the second carbon of propene. So, taking propene (CH2=CHCH3), the en-2-yl group would be CH2CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between 1 and 2. Wait, perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond, so the substituent is CH2CH2-CH3 but that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe it's a
