Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the hydrogen atom. The question is about the decay of a specific state, |3,0,0⟩, to another state |1,0,0⟩ through two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions between energy levels are governed by selection rules, which dictate which transitions are allowed or forbidden.

First, I need to recall the selection rules for dipole transitions. From what I remember, the selection rules for the hydrogen atom (in non-relativistic theory) are:

Δn = ±1, ±2, ±3, ... (but in practice, usually Δn = ±1 for most allowed transitions, but sometimes higher changes are possible)
Δl = ±1 (the orbital angular momentum quantum number changes by one unit)
Δm = 0, ±1 (the magnetic quantum number changes by 0 or ±1)

So, for a transition to be allowed via dipole emission, these changes must occur.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The final state is |1,0,0⟩. So, the initial n is 3, and the final n is 1. That's a Δn of -2. Wait, but the selection rule for Δn is that it can be any integer, but the transition must go through intermediate steps, right? Because the problem says it's a two-step process.

So, the state |3,0,0⟩ must decay in two steps. Each step must follow the selection rules. Let me think about the possible intermediate states.

In the first step, from n=3, l=0 to some state with n' and l'. Since Δl must be ±1, the possible l' can be 0±1 → so l' can be 1 or -1, but since l is always non-negative, l' is 1.

So the first transition must go to n=2 or n=4? Wait, but the final state is |1,0,0⟩, so maybe it's a two-step process: 3→2→1.

Wait, the initial state is 3,0,0. Let's think about possible first transitions.

In the first transition, from 3→something. Let's think about possible l changes. Since initial l is 0, the next step l must be 1. So the intermediate state must have l=1.

So the first transition could be 3,0,0 → 2,1, m, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but when you change l from 0 to 1, the possible m changes by 0, ±1. Since initial m is 0, the next m can be 0, +1, or -1.

So possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,-1⟩.

Now, from the intermediate state, it must transition to |1,0,0⟩. Let's see the selection rules. n goes from 2 to 1, Δn=-1, which is allowed. l goes from 1 to 0, which is Δl = -1, which is allowed. m goes from m' to 0,
