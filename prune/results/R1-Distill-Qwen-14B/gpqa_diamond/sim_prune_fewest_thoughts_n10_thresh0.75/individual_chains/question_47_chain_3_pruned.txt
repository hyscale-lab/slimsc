Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using the given spectroscopic data. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different structures. 

First, I'll look at the IR data. The IR shows strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹. These are usually indicative of either N-H or O-H stretches. Since the compound also has a strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹, that's probably a carbonyl (C=O) group. Now, looking at the options, I see that all of them have some sort of amide or ester group, which would explain the carbonyl. Let's think about each option.

Option A is 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide means a benzene ring with a CONH2 group. The ethoxy would be an OCH2CH3. So the IR should show the amide N-H stretches. The strong bands at 3420 and 3325 fit that, and the carbonyl at 1720 is typical for amides.

Option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide has a CONH2 group, so similar to A, the IR would have those N-H stretches. The ethoxy would also contribute to the IR.

Option C is 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate suggests an ester group (since it's an acid derivative). The amine group (NH2) would give N-H stretches. The 1720 cm⁻¹ would be the ester carbonyl.

Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Benzoate esters have a carbonyl, so 1720 fits. The ethyl group would be OCH2CH3. The amine (NH2) would provide N-H peaks in IR.

So all options have either amide or ester groups. Let's move on to the 1H NMR data.

The NMR data:
- 1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H: This is probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2. So, maybe an ethyl ester or ethyl ether.

- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H: A broad singlet for 2H. Could this be an amine group? NH2 would usually be broad, but in some cases, like if it's a secondary amine, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe an ethyl group adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2.

Wait, but in the IR, the strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹ are probably N-H stretches. So if the compound has an amine group, like NH2, then the broad peak in NMR could be from that. However, in D, the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which would have an NH2 group. The N-H in amines typically appear as broad signals, maybe around 1-5 ppm, but it's possible they're not showing up if it's a secondary amine or something else.

Wait, looking at the NMR data again: 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). Hmm, that's a bit downfield for an NH2, but maybe it's an OCH2 group. Or perhaps it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like an ethyl ester. Let me think.

Wait, in an ester like ethyl benzoate, the OCH2CH3 would have the CH2 next to oxygen. The CH2 in an ethyl ester usually appears as a quartet around 4.1-4.3 ppm. But in the data, it's at 4.0 and is a singlet. Wait, that's odd. Because if it's an ethyl group attached to oxygen, the splitting would be a quartet for the CH2, not a singlet. So perhaps this isn't the ethyl group.

Wait, another possibility: If the 4.0 ppm is a CH2 adjacent to an amine. Like in a structure where a CH2 is connected to an amine, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to something else.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 4.5 ppm (q, 2H). A quartet suggests coupling with a neighboring CH2 group. A quartet of 2H might be a CH2 next to another CH2. So perhaps it's a -OCH2CH2O- group, but that's not in any of these options.

Wait, perhaps it's a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, but let's think about the structures. 

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure would be O=C(OEt)-PhNH2. So the ethyl ester would have OCH2CH3. The OCH2 would appear as a quartet. Wait, in the NMR, 4.5 ppm is a quartet (q) for 2H. If the ethyl ester's OCH2 is at around
