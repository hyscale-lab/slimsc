Okay, so I need to identify the compound C9H11NO2 based on the given spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's start by analyzing the information step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Do that by using the formula: Degrees of Unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0. So plugging in: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (which accounts for 3 double bonds or three degrees), plus maybe an amide or ester group which would add the remaining two (like a carbonyl and a ring or something else).

Looking at the IR data: There are strong to medium bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H or O-H stretches. Since the compound has an amide or maybe a carboxylic acid? Wait, the options have amides and esters. Oh, but looking more carefully, if it's an amide, the NH would show up around 3300-3500. These are strong bands, so maybe it's an amide, but sometimes esters don't have O-H. Wait, the IR also has a strong band at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So ester, amide, or maybe a ketone. But with the formula, I'm thinking ester or amide because of the O2.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data: 

1.20 ppm triplet (3H): That's probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl ester. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring Hs. So maybe the ethyl group is connected to an oxygen, like OCH2CH3.

4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H): A broad singlet for 2H. Could be an amide NH2 or maybe an OCH2 group if it's adjacent to something else. But wait, in an amide, the NH protons are usually broad, but they would be a singlet if not split. Alternatively, if it's an OCH2 group, but why a singlet? Maybe between two similar groups. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an amino group, but if it's an amide, the NH would be exchange broadened.

4.5 ppm quartet (2H): Quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring Hs. So maybe a CH2 connected to something else. If the ethyl is OCH2CH3 at 1.20 ppm, then the quartet at 4.5 could be adjacent to another CH2. Like in an ester group, perhaps OCH2CH2O... No, wait, in ethyl esters, the structure is OCO-OCH2CH3. But that's typically a quartet for the OCH2 group. Wait, in the ethyl ester, the OCH2 is split by the adjacent CH3, which would be a triplet. But here, the quartet is at 4.5, which might be the OCH2CH2 group, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's think about the splitting. The triplet at 1.20 ppm is likely the CH3 of an ethyl group. So the neighboring group would be CH2. So the quartet at 4.5 ppm would be the CH2 connected to oxygen, perhaps. So maybe it's OCH2CH3, but wait, the triplet is the CH3, so the adjacent CH2 would be split into a quartet. So that makes sense.

Then, the 4.0 ppm singlet (2H) could be an NH group if it's an amide, but wait, amide protons are usually broad but as singlets if they're not split. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group, but I'm not entirely sure.

The aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). A doublet each, which usually suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. So the two doublets are probably para substituents. If it's para substitution, then the coupling is between the two sets of protons.

Putting this together, the aromatic ring is likely para-substituted with two groups. One is probably an electron-withdrawing group like an ester or amide, and the other could be an amino group or something else.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. But wait, benzamide is CONH2 attached to the benzene. If the ethoxy is at position 3, the substitution would be meta. But the aromatic NMR shows two pairs of doublets, which suggests a substitution pattern where the protons are in pairs, which para would do. So if it's 3-ethoxy, the substituents would be in meta positions, leading to more complex splitting. Hmm, maybe not.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is formamide (HCONH-) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the benzene would have an ethoxy at position 4 and a formamide group at position 1. That would be para substitution. So the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each with two H. That fits the NMR.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be a benzene ring with amino group at 4 and a propionate (CH2CH2COO-) group. Wait, I'm not sure about that structure. Wait, propionate ester would be CH2CH2COO- attached. Oh, wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be the amino group in para position and the propionate ester as another substituent. So the aromatic protons would again be two doublets. But then, the NMR would have the amine protons. Wait, but the IR has a strong band at 1720 which would be a carbonyl, likely an ester. So in this case, the ester would have the carbonyl. The amino group would absorb in the IR as N-H. But looking at the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet, which might be the NH2 group. But amine protons are usually broad, but can they be a singlet? Also, the splitting for the aromatic might be different. Alternatively, the propionate would have a CH2 group adjacent to the ester.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzoic acid ester, where the benzene has an amino group at position 4. So the ester is OCOOEt attached to the benzene. So the benzene would have substituents at positions 1 (ester) and 4 (NH2). Wait, but then the aromatic protons would be at positions 2 and 3 (ortho to NH2) and 5 and 6 (meta to NH2 and para to ester). Wait, no, the ester is at position 1, and NH2 at position 4. So the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, which are across from each other. So the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. So each pair would be doublets, leading to the NMR as given.

Wait, but in the NMR, there are two doublets, each integrating to two protons. So the aromatic ring has two substituents, each causing the protons to split into doublets. Hence, it's para substitution. So the substituents would be para to each other.

So for option D: 4-aminobenzoate ester. The substituents are the amino group and the ester group. The amino group is at position 4, and the ester is at position 1. So the ortho and para positions to the ester would have protons that couple with each other. So the doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm would make sense.

Looking at the NMR shifts:

The ethyl ester group: the CH3 would be around 1.2 ppm, which is a triplet, as observed. The OCH2CH3 group: the CH2 would be around 4.5 ppm as a quartet, which matches. Then, the 4.0 ppm singlet (2H) could be the NH2 group. Wait, but amines in NMR can be tricky. In an amide, the NH protons are usually broad, and in an amine, they might be as well. However, in the case of an amide, maybe the protons are part of the CONH structure and perhaps not present as a separate group. Alternatively, perhaps this is a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's look at each option's structure.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with ethoxy at position 3. Benzamide is CONH2 attached to benzene. Then the ethoxy is at meta. So the aromatic protons would be at ortho and para to the substituents, which would have more complex splitting, maybe a triplet and a doublet, or something else. So the NMR shows two doublets, which might not fit here.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The formamide group is HCONH attached. So the substituents are at position 4 (ethoxy) and position 1 (formamide). So the aromatic protons would be in two pairs, each as doublets, which matches the NMR. The ethoxy group would give a triplet at ~1.2 ppm and the OCH2 at ~4.5 ppm. The formamide would have a CO group at 1720 cm^-1. But formamide has an NH group which would show up as a broad peak in the NMR, perhaps around 4.0 ppm as a singlet (but formamide's NH is usually around 8 ppm in 13C NMR, but in 1H NMR, the NH would be a broad peak around 7-8 ppm maybe? Wait, but the given NMR has a singlet at 4.0 ppm for 2H. That might not fit, because the formamide's NH would usually be a singlet but at a higher ppm. Hmm, this might be a problem. Alternatively, perhaps the NH is not observed because it's an amide or it's in a different region.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. The structure would be benzene with an amino group at position 4 and a propionoate ester (CH2CH2COOEt) at position 1. The propionate ester would have a CH2CH2 group attached. The NH2 would be at position 4. The ester's CH2 would be around 4.5 ppm, but the propionate would have more CH2 groups. In the NMR, we have a quartet at 4.5 for 2H, which fits the OCH2 from the ethyl ester. But the propionate would have other groups, like maybe a triplet for the next CH2. But the given NMR doesn't show that. Hmm, perhaps this option doesn't fit.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzene with an ester group (COOEt) at position 1 and an amino group (-NH2) at position 4. The ester would give the triplet at 1.2 (CH3), quartet at 4.5 (OCH2CH3). The amino group's protons would appear as a broad peak. If the amino group is -NH2, maybe it's exchanging and appears as a broad singlet. But in the NMR data, there's a singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H), which could be something else. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the 1H NMR has a singlet at 4.0 ppm for 2H. If it's an amine, it's probably not a singlet unless it's in a symmetric position or perhaps the NH is split. Alternatively, maybe it's not an NH group but an OCH2 group. Let's think about the options.

Looking back at the IR: a strong band at 1720 cm^-1. That points towards an ester (around 1720-1740) or an amide (lower, around 1650-1700). But the amide's carbonyl is usually lower than ester. So 1720 is more likely an ester. So the compound probably has an ester group.

So the options with ester groups are D, and maybe B is a formamide which would be an amide.

So if it's an ester, then D is a candidate.

Looking at the NMR again: the 4.0 ppm singlet for 2H. In D, the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the benzoate ester has the OCH2CH3, which is the quartet at 4.5 ppm, and the CH3 triplet at 1.2. The amino group would be -NH2 attached to the benzene. But in the NMR, do we see the NH protons? In the data, there's a singlet at 4.0 ppm for 2H. That doesn't seem to fit the amino protons, which are usually broad and may appear around 1-5 ppm, but more likely in the 2-5 range as a broad peak.

Wait, maybe the amino group is not present in the NMR because it's an amide. Wait, but D is an ester with an amine group. Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 is not exchanging in this case, but that's unusual.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's recheck the options.

Wait, looking at options again:

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzene with OCOOEt at position 1 and NH2 at position 4. So the amino group is a substituent. The NH2 protons would typically show up in the NMR as a broad peak, perhaps around 1-5 ppm. But in the given NMR, there's a singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). Could that be the NH2? But NH2 usually has two protons, but they might be split or appear as a broad peak. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group elsewhere.

Wait, another possibility: the singlet at 4.0 ppm could be the -NH group in an amide. But then, the IR would show a lower carbonyl, around 1680 perhaps. But in this case, the IR is 1720, which is higher, pointing more towards an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the singlet is not an NH group but another group. Let's think about the structure.

Wait, another approach: the 1H NMR has four signals: triplet (CH3), quartet (OCH2), singlet (something), and two aromatic doublets.

Looking at option D: the structure would have the ester's OCH2CH3, which is the quartet. The ethyl's CH3 is the triplet. The amino group's protons would be another signal, possibly a broad one. But in the given NMR, there's a singlet at 4.0 ppm for 2H. So that's 2H in a singlet. That doesn't match the amino group. So perhaps this isn't the right option.

Wait, then what else could that singlet be? Maybe a methylene (CH2) group that's not split. For example, if it's part of an amide.

Wait, looking at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The structure is OCH2CH3 attached at position 4 of benzene, and HCONH- attached at position 1. The formamide would have the CONH group. The NH would be part of the formamide. In the NMR, there might be a singlet for the NH protons, but I'm not sure where.

Alternatively, perhaps the singlet is the NH group. But formamide's NH is usually a broad peak around 8-10 ppm, but the given data has the singlet at 4 ppm. Hmm, that might not fit.

Wait, let's think about the other options. Let's look at option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be benzene with NH2 at position 4 and a propionate ester (O-CO-OEt, where Et is ethyl) at position 1. Wait, no, propionate is CH2CH2COOEt. So the structure would be O-CO-OEt attached to the benzene, and NH2 at para position.

The ethyl ester would give the triplet and quartet as in the NMR. The propionate ester would have another CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl, which would appear as a triplet around 2.3-2.5 ppm, but that's not observed in the given NMR. Hmm, but the NMR doesn't show that. So maybe option C is less likely.

Hmm. Let me go back to the data.

The IR shows strong absorption around 3420 and 3325 cm^-1. These are likely N-H stretches. So if there's an NH group, that would explain these. So the compound likely has an amino group.

So, the options that have an amino group are A, C, D. Option B has a formamide, which would have an NH but as part of the amide.

Looking at the NMR, the singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) could be an NH group, but in an amide, the NH is usually a broad peak. Alternatively, perhaps it's a methylene group next to an oxygen, like OCH2.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the singlet is from a CH2 group that's next to a de-shielded environment, like adjacent to an amino group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, looking at the aromatic data: two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Each substituent is at the para position relative to each other. So, for example, one substituent is an ester group and the other is an amino group.

Looking back at the options, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the benzene has ester at position 1 and amino at 4. The ester's OCH2CH3 would give the quartet and triplet. The amino group's NH2 would have protons that may appear as a broad signal around 4.0 ppm, but the given data is a singlet. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is exchanging and not visible as a separate peak, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 4.0 ppm singlet is actually part of the aromatic ring's substitution pattern. No, that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, is there a possibility of another group, like an oxygen-bearing CH2 group?

Wait, in option D, the structure is O-CO-OEt attached to benzene and NH2. So the ethyl ester is present, so the 1.20 triplet and 4.5 quartet fit. The amino group would have protons, but perhaps they're not observed in this NMR if they're not split. But the NMR shows a singlet at 4.0 ppm for 2H. So maybe that's not the amino group.

Wait, perhaps the singlet is from another group. Let me think about the molecular formula again. C9H11NO2.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be C9H11NO2. Yes, that fits.

So the structure is O=C(OEt)-Ph-NH2.

In the NMR, the ethyl groups are accounted for. The aromatic ring has two doublets, which fit the para substitution. The singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) is a mystery. Unless I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the ethyl group is attached as OCH2CH3, which would be the quartet at 4.5 ppm. The triplet is the CH3. The singlet at 4.0 ppm is perhaps the NH2 group, but if it's a singlet, maybe it's not visible because of exchange or because the protons are broad and integrated into another peak.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the singlet. Let me consider the possibility that the singlet is from a CH2 group adjacent to the amino group. But in the structure of option D, the amino is directly attached to the benzene, so no adjacent CH2.

Another possibility: the singlet at 4.0 ppm could be from an OCH2 group, but in that case, it would likely be split by neighboring groups. Since it's a singlet, maybe it's a CH2 that's not adjacent to any protons, which is rare.

Wait, going back to the IR. The strong absorption at 1720 cm^-1 suggests an ester. So the main functional groups are an ester and an amine. So the structure must have both.

Looking at the NMR again, the singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) could perhaps be the NH2 group. But NH2 protons usually appear as a broad signal, but in some cases, they can be sharp if de-shielded. Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH2- group next to an oxygen, but that would require a different structure.

Wait, perhaps the singlet is from an acetamide group? No, because the IR is 1720, which is higher than amide. So acetamide would be lower.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the options again. 

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure would have the ester group and the amino group. The NMR would have the ethyl groups (quartet and triplet), the amino protons, and the aromatic protons. But the given NMR has a singlet at 4.0 ppm, which doesn't fit the amino group.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is formamide (HCONH-) attached to 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the ester here would be part of the formamide, but wait, formamide is an amide, not an ester. So the IR would show a lower carbonyl. But the given IR is 1720, which is higher, suggesting an ester.

Wait, so if the compound is an amide, the carbonyl would be around 1680. But the IR is 1720, which is more ester-like. So option B is likely an amide, which would have a lower carbonyl. So perhaps that's not the correct option.

So that brings me back to option D. The only thing not matching is the 4.0 ppm singlet. Unless that's due to another group, like perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to the amino group. But in option D, the amino group is directly attached. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the singlet is from the NH2 group, but it's a singlet because it's exchanging and the peaks are broad and not observed, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the singlet integrates for two H's but is actually two NH protons overlapping, but that's a stretch.

Another approach: Let's consider the molecular formula. C9H11NO2.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide (C7H7NO) plus ethoxy (C2H5O). So the formula is C9H10NO2. Wait, no, because benzamide is C7H7NO, then adding ethoxy (C2H5O) would make C9H12NO2. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So that doesn't fit. So option A is out.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONH- attached to a benzene with ethoxy. So the benzene is C6H4, ethoxy is OCH2CH3. So the formula is C6H4(OCH2CH3)(HCONH2). Wait, let me count: C6 + OCH2CH3 (C2) + HCONH2 (C=O, NH2, and H — that's 2 more C). So total C:6+2+2=10? Wait, no. Wait, formamide is HCONH- attached to the benzene. So benzene (C6), ethoxy (OCH2CH3, C2), formamide (HCONH- adds 2 C, O, and N). So overall, C6 + 2 + 2= C10? But the molecular formula is C9. So that doesn't fit. Option B is C10H11NO3? Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recompute.

N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: The phenyl group is C6H5 (but with an ethoxy and a formamide substituent). So structure is C6H4(OCH2CH3)(CONH2). So the formula is C6 + 2 (from OCH2CH3) + 2 (from CONH2) = C10. But the molecular formula is C9. So that can't be. So option B is incorrect.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure is benzene with NH2 at position 4 and propionate ester (CH2CH2COOEt) at position 1. Let's count the carbons: benzene (C6), NH2 (no C), propionate ester (3 carbons from propionate, plus the ester O and the ethyl). So total C: 6 + 3 (from propionate) + 2 (ethyl) = 11 C. But the molecular formula is C9. So that's too many. So option C is out.

So only option D remains. Wait, option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure is benzoate ester. Benzoate is C7H5O2 (benzoic acid is C7H6O2; as ester, it would be C7H5O2 plus the ethyl group. Wait, molecular formula:

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. As ethyl ester, it's C7H5O2 + C2H5O from the ethyl ester? No, the ester replaces the -OH of benzoic acid with OEt, so the formula becomes C7H6O2 (from benzoic acid) minus H2O (because it's esterification: RCOOH + HO-R' → RCOOR' + H2O). So for benzoic acid (C7H6O2) and ethanol (C2H5OH), the ester would be C7H5O2 + C2H5O plus H2O subtracted. So C7 + C2 = C9, H5 +5 (from C2H5O) +2 (from H2O) → wait, perhaps an easier way: the formula of ethyl benzoate is C9H10O2. But in this case, option D adds an amino group to the benzene ring.

Wait, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would have the structure O=C(OEt)PhNH2. So the formula would be:

Benzoate (C7H5O2) + NH2 (adds 1 N and 2 H). So C7H5O2 + C2H5O (from ethyl) → C9H10O2, but with an NH2 added (so N count is 1). Wait, molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So that matches. Because benzoate is C7H5O2, ethyl ester would be C2H5O, and the amino adds NH2 (so H increases by 2: 5 + 5 (from ester?) I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is C9H11NO2. Let's break it down:

Benzoate is C6H5COOEt. So C6 (benzene) + 2 (COO) + 2 (Et) = C10? Wait, no. Benzoate is C7H5O2. If it's 4-aminobenzoate, the formula would be C7H6O2N. Because each substitution on benzene replaces an H. So for benzoic acid, it's C7H6O2. Replacing one H with NH2 gives C7H5NO2. Then, the ester replaces the -OH with OEt, which has formula C2H5O. So the ester would be C7H5NO2 + C2H5O → C9H6NO3? Wait, no. Let me try again.

The parent acid is 4-aminobenzoic acid, which is C7H7NO2. Its ethyl ester would have the formula C9H11NO2, since esterification adds an ethyl group (C2H5) but removes a hydrogen (from the -COOH to -COOEt). So the formula would be C7H7NO2 (acid) → C9H11NO2 (ester) because: acid is C7H6O2N (wait, 4-aminobenzoic acid is C7H7NO2). Then, the ester would be C7H7NO2 (acid) plus C2H5O (ester group) minus H2O (from esterification). So C7 + C2 = C9. H: 7 (from acid) +5 (from OEt) -2 (from H2O) → 7 +5 =12 -2=10 H. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, discrepancy here. So that suggests I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is C7H5O2 (benzoate) + C2H5O (ester) → C9H5O3. But that's not matching the formula. Maybe I should stop getting stuck on this and accept that option D has the correct formula.

Now, looking back at the NMR. The singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) is still a problem. Unless I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps in the structure of D, the amino group is not present as a separate group but is part of the ester. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the singlet is from another CH2 group. Let me think: in the NMR data, the triplet is 1.20 ppm (t, 3H). That's the ethyl group's CH3.

The quartet is 4.5 ppm (q, 2H), which is the OCH2 of the ethyl ester.

The singlet at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): broad singlet, which could be an NH2 group. But in the case of an amine, the NH2 protons would typically be broad but could appear as a singlet. So perhaps that's the case here.

So, putting it all together:

IR shows ester (1720) and NH (3420, 3325).

NMR shows:

- Ethyl triplet (CH3) and quartet (OCH2).
- Broad singlet (NH2).
- Aromatic doublets (para substitution).

Therefore, the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (option D).


To identify the compound C9H11NO2, we analyze the given spectroscopic data and compare it with the options provided.

### Molecular Formula and Degrees of Unsaturation
The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**, and the degrees of unsaturation are calculated as:

\[
\text{Degrees of Unsaturation} = \frac{(2C + 2 - H - X + N)}{2} = \frac{(2(9) + 2 - 11 - 0 + 1)}{2} = 5
\]

This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (3 degrees) and additional unsaturation, likely from a carbonyl group (C=O).

### IR Analysis
- **Medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: These are indicative of N-H stretches, suggesting the presence of an amine or amide group.
- **Strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹**: This is characteristic of a carbonyl group, likely an ester (C=O stretch).

---

### ¹H NMR Analysis
1. **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H, consistent with a CH3 group in an ethyl group (CH2CH3).
2. **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to 2H, likely corresponding to an NH2 group.
3. **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating to 2H, consistent with a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen atom (e.g., OCH2 in an ethyl ester).
4. **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicative of a para-substituted benzene ring.

---

### Option Analysis
#### **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**
- Structure: Benzamide (CONH2) with an ethoxy group at position 3.
- The aromatic protons would not produce two doublets due to the meta substitution pattern. This does not match the NMR data.
- **Eliminated**.

#### **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**
- Structure: Formamide (HCONH-) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group.
- The IR data suggests an ester (1720 cm⁻¹), but formamide is an amide, which typically shows a lower carbonyl stretch (~1650-1700 cm⁻¹). Additionally, the NMR data does not support the presence of formamide.
- **Eliminated**.

#### **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**
- Structure: Benzene with an amino group at position 4 and a propionate ester (CH2CH2COOEt) at position 1.
- The molecular formula does not match (C9H11NO2 vs. C10H13NO3). Additionally, the NMR data does not show signals for the CH2 groups in the propionate ester.
- **Eliminated**.

#### **Option D: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**
- Structure: Benzene with an ester group (COOEt) at position 1 and an amino group (-NH2) at position 4.
- The IR data matches, as the ester carbonyl explains the 1720 cm⁻¹ band, and the N-H stretches explain the bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹.
- The NMR data also matches:
  - The triplet at 1.20 ppm corresponds to the CH3 group of the ethyl ester.
  - The quartet at 4.5 ppm corresponds to the CH2 group of the ethyl ester.
  - The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm corresponds to the NH2 group.
  - The two doublets at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm correspond to the aromatic protons of a para-substituted benzene.
- **Matches all data**.

---

### Conclusion
The compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.

**Answer: D**
