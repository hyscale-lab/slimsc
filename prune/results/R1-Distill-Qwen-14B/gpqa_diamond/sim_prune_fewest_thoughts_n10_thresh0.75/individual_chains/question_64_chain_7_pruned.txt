Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. I'm going to take my time and think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams, was heated to 200Â°C without air. When heated, they form a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through three tubes in sequence. 

The first tube is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. The second is a Ca(OH)2 solution, and the third has red-hot copper. 

The results are as follows: Tube 1's weight increased by 3.60 grams, tube 3's by 0.80 grams. The second tube's weight didn't change. And finally, there's 2.24 liters of gas C left at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm. Okay, so I need to figure out what's happening in each of these tubes, and then determine what the original salts are, and sum up the total atoms.

Let me break it down. Let's think about each tube.

Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent. If the gas mixture is passed through it and the tube gains mass, it must be absorbing some moisture. Wait, but Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant, it absorbs water. So the gas must have had some water vapor which was trapped here. So the gas after this tube would have less water.

But wait, the problem says that the mixture of gases was passed through these tubes, and the tube's weight increased by 3.60 g. So the gas that entered must have had some water vapor, which was absorbed here. So the gas coming out of Tube 1 would have lost that water.

Wait, but what is the initial gas mixture? Let's think. When salts A and B are heated, they decompose into gases. Since it's heated without air (so no O2 or N2 from the air), the gases are probably products of thermal decomposition.

So the initial gases would be a mixture of, perhaps, CO2, H2O, NH3, SO2, etc., depending on the salts.

Wait, but then the gases pass through Mg(ClO4)2, which absorbs water. So the water in the gas is captured here. So the mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of H2O absorbed.

So, the mass of H2O is 3.60 g. Let's compute how many moles that is. The molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol. So 3.60 / 18 = 0.2 mol. So 0.2 moles of H2O were present in the gas.

Next, the second tube is Ca(OH)2 solution. But the weight didn't change. So maybe the gas didn't react with Ca(OH)2. Or perhaps the gas didn't have any CO2 or SO2 or something that would react with the solution.

Wait, but if the gas had CO2, then it would react with Ca(OH)2 solution to form CaCO3 precipitate and water. But since there's no change in mass, maybe the gas didn't have CO2. Or maybe the amount of CO2 was zero. Or perhaps all the CO2 was absorbed in the first tube? Hmm.

Wait, but the first tube was Mg(ClO4)2, which is a drying agent and also a strong acid. So maybe any acidic gases like HCl or H2SO4
