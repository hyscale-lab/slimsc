Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement and another reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The problem has two parts: reaction A and reaction B. Let's tackle them one by one.

First, reaction A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Then it's treated with BuLi, followed by H+.

Wait, BuLi is a strong base, right? It's usually used to deprotonate things, maybe form enolates or conjugate bases. The starting molecule has an ether group connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. So, the structure is something like benzene-O-(CH2)-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Or wait, maybe I should draw it out.

Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-. Oh wait, no. But-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but with the double bond at position 2. So, it's CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, wait. Let me get this right. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-. Wait, no, wait: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? Wait, wait: butane has four carbons. So but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-CH2-? No, wait. But-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, wait. Let's think. The structure is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. So the benzene ring is connected to an OCH2 group, which is then connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group.

So, the 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH
