Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about the Cope rearrangement, which I remember is some kind of reaction that rearranges dienes. Hmm, I think the Cope rearrangement specifically deals with 1,5-dienes. Right, so when you heat or expose them to light, the molecule rearranges, moving the double bonds around.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let's look at each one step by step.

Starting with part A:
The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me draw it out. Benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So, the structure is OCH2 attached to the benzene, and the oxygen is connected to a but-2-en-1-yl group which has a methyl on carbon 3.

Breaking it down: The butenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait no, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-? Wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but no, wait. No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2CH2 groups with double bond at 2. So structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3? Wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2- as the substituent. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂? No, but-2-en-1-yl is CH₂=CHCH₂-CH₂? No, maybe I should think of the structure as: the substituent is OCH₂ connected to a but-2-en-1-yl group. So the substituent is OCH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂? But with a double bond at position 2. So the structure is OCH₂-CH₂-CH
