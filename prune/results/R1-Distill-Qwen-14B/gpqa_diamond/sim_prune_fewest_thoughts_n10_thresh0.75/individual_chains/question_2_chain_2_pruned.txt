Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question involves a series of reactions starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde, right? Trans means the substituents are on opposite sides of the double bond.

First reaction: trans-cinnamaldehyde is treated with methylmagnesium bromide, which is a Grignard reagent. Grignard reagents react with aldehydes and ketones. Since cinnamaldehyde has an aldehyde group, the Grignard will add to that. So, the aldehyde (RCHO) reacts with the Grignard (R'MgX) to form RCH(O-MgX)R', and then upon protonation, it becomes RCH2R'. Wait, but wait, no, more accurately, the Grignard adds twice to ketones, but for aldehydes, it adds once? Or does it add once and then protonate?

Wait, no, aldehydes have the carbonyl group as well, so the Grignard adds once to the aldehyde. So after the first step, product 1 would be the addition of the methyl group from the Grignard to the aldehyde. So the aldehyde (CHO) becomes CH2OMe after adding the Grignard, but wait, no, Grignard adds to the carbonyl. For an aldehyde, the Grignard adds once, so the product would be a secondary alcohol. Wait, let me think: the aldehyde is R-CHO. Grignard adds to the carbonyl, so the carbon becomes R-CH(-O-MgBr)-O-... No, wait, no, the Grignard adds the R' group (methyl here) to the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen gets the negative charge, which then grabs a proton to become an alcohol.

Wait, but the process is: Grignard adds to the aldehyde's carbonyl carbon, so the aldehyde (RCHO) becomes RCH(O-)MgBr..., but then when you protonate, you get RCH2OH? No, wait, more accurately, the Grignard adds to the aldehyde, so the product after the
