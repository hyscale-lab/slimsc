Alright, I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Okay, so the question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are various chemical formulas, so I need to match the given data to the correct one.

First, let me look at the data provided. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, a broad peak could also come from something like a carbonyl but that's usually around 1700, which is mentioned here as well. Oh, the FTIR has peaks at 1700 and 1650. Those are in the range for carbonyl groups. 1700 is typical for ketones, aldehydes, or maybe esters. The 1650 peak might be another carbonyl, maybe an amide, but I don't think there's any info about amines here. Alternatively, it could be conjugated carbonyl groups, like in a conjugated ester or something with resonance.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, so that suggests the compound has an alkene group. So, we have both a carbonyl and a double bond in the structure.

The Mass Spec shows a fragment at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let me think, 45 could be a CH3CO+ group, which is 45 (CH3CO+ is 45: 12+1*3 +12+16= 45). Alternatively, it could be a ketene fragment or something else, but CH3CO+ is a common one. So, maybe the compound has an acetyl group. Or perhaps something else that breaks off into a 45 m/z fragment.

Now, looking at the options for chemical formulas: the choices are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O2. Let's list them:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

I need to figure out which formula fits the data.

Let me think about each possibility.

Starting with the IR data. The broad peak at ~3000 cm^-1 suggests O-H. If this is a broad peak, maybe it's a carboxylic acid, which usually has a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm^-1. Alternatively, it could be an alcohol, but alcohols have a less broad but still somewhat strong O-H peak. But the presence of a carbonyl group (1700 and 1650) suggests that the O is part of a carbonyl, like a ketone, ester, or amide. But if there's an O-H, maybe it's a carboxylic acid with a carbonyl from the COOH group.

Wait, but 1700 and 1650? Carboxylic acids usually have a carbonyl around 1700, but maybe the 1650 is from conjugation or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or a conjugated carbonyl.

The 1H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond. So either an alkene or maybe a conjugated carbonyl.

Looking at the molecular formulas:

C6H12O has degree of unsaturation: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no N or X, 2*6+2 -12 -0 =14. 14/2=7 degrees. Each degree is a ring or double bond. So 7 degrees: possible scenarios like two rings and three double bonds, but that's unlikely. Or six
