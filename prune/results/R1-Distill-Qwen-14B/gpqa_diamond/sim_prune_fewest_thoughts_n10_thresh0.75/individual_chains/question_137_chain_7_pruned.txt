Okay, so I have this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons are used to accelerate charged particles, like protons. The question says that a proton is injected with negligible kinetic energy, and it undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy of 950 MeV. Wait, two accelerations? Or maybe it's two steps? I'm a bit confused there.

The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. Oh right, the voltage in the synchrocyclotron is an alternating voltage, which changes with time. The phase constant Phi_0 is pi/4, and U0 is 190 kV. I think the question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes before reaching that kinetic energy.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on the synchrocyclotron. I remember that in a cyclotron, the magnetic field and the electric field are arranged so that the particles move in a circular path, and each time they pass through the electric field, they gain some energy. Since the frequency of the electric field is synchronized with the particle's motion, it's called a synchrocyclotron.

So, the key here is to find the number of revolutions the proton makes until it reaches 950 MeV. Let me think about the energy gained each time the proton goes around the cyclotron. Each revolution, the proton gains energy from the electric field. Since the voltage is alternating, the maximum voltage is U0, so each time the proton passes through, it gains energy equal to the voltage, right? But wait, no, because the voltage is applied across the gap, so the energy gained per revolution would be e * U0, where e is the charge of the proton. So each revolution, the proton's kinetic energy increases by e*U0.

Wait, but wait a second, in a cyclotron, the magnetic field is perpendicular to the velocity, so the acceleration is centripetal, but the electric field provides the acceleration. But the voltage determines the energy gain each time the proton passes through the electric field region.

So, the kinetic energy after n revolutions would be n * e * U0. Hmm, but wait, the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so T ≈ 0. Therefore, T1 = n * e * U0.

But wait, let me check the units. U0 is given as 190 kV. Voltage is energy per charge, so e*U is in energy units. So e is 1.6e-19 coulombs, and U is 190,000 volts. So e*U is about 190,000 * 1.6e-19 = 3.04e-14 joules. But wait, the kinetic energy given is in MeV. Oh right, so maybe we should express it in electronvolts. Since 1 eV is the energy gained by an electron moving through 1 volt. So for a proton, each revolution would give it 190,000 eV, because e*U0 is 190,000 eV.

Wait, that makes sense. So each revolution adds 190,000 eV. So the total energy after n revolutions is n * 190,000 eV. We need this to equal 950 MeV, which is 950,000,000 eV.

So the equation would be n * 190,000 = 950,000,000. Solving for n: n = 950e6 / 190e3 = 950,000,000 / 190,000.

Let me compute that. 950e6 is 950,000,000. Divided by 190,000.

Dividing both numerator and denominator by 1000: 950,000 / 190.

950,000 divided by 190: Let's see, 190 * 5000 = 950,000.

So n is 5000. Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 5300, and option C is 3536. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, why? Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Because in a cyclotron, the frequency of the applied voltage must match the particle's cyclotron frequency. But wait, in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field varies with time to keep the cyclotron frequency matched with the applied voltage frequency. So perhaps the number of revolutions isn't simply T1/(eU0) because the acceleration isn't constant.

Wait, I think I'm mixing something up. Let me think again. In a standard cyclotron, the frequency is fixed, but the particle's mass increases (relativistic effects), so the frequency changes. But in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field is adjusted to keep the cyclotron frequency equal to the driving frequency. So in this case, the particle is accelerated each time it passes through the gap, gaining energy each time. So the number of revolutions should be the total energy divided by the energy gained per revolution.

But according to my previous calculation, that gives n=5000, which isn't one of the options. Wait, the options are A: 1864, B:5300, C:3536, D:2500. So none of them is 5000. Hmm, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem says that the proton undergoes two accelerations. Oh, the question says, "undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy T₁=950 MeV." Wait, does that mean two steps? Or perhaps two applications of the voltage? Or maybe the voltage is applied twice per revolution?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me read the question again. The problem says: "A synchrocyclotron is a special type of cyclotron. A proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, i.e. T≈0 undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy T1=950 MeV."

Hmm, so maybe the proton is accelerated twice per revolution? Because in a cyclotron, each time the proton goes through the electric field, it gets a kick. So perhaps each time it goes through the gap, it gains some energy. So for each full revolution, it gains energy twice? Or maybe each time it passes through the electric field, which could be part of the same revolution, it gains energy once.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the setup. Let's think about the structure of a cyclotron. It has two D-shaped electrodes (called dees) where the electric field is applied. The alternating voltage is applied to these dees. The particle moves in a circular path, and each time it passes through a dee, it gets accelerated. So each passage through a dee is an acceleration. So, how many times does it pass through the dees per revolution? Once per revolution, I think. Because the dees are opposite each other, and as the particle moves in a circle, it will go through each dee once per revolution.

Wait, no. Suppose the cyclotron has two dees, each
