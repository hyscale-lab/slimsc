Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out which compound E is in the reaction scheme. Let's take it step by step.

The problem gives a series of reactions starting from compound A and going through B, C, D, and finally to E. Also, there are some hints provided, and the options for E are given. Let me break it down.

First, the reactions:

1. A + HCN → B
2. B + H2 (with Pd) → C
3. C + HNO2 → D
4. D → E (elimination of an inert gas)

And the hints:

a) A reacts with a phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) IR of A has a peak at ~1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is ~1715 cm^-1.

Hmm, okay. Let's start by analyzing the hints.

IR peaks: 1750 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So compound A probably has a ketone or maybe an aldehyde or ester group. But since the product after a reaction with HCN (a nitrile) is formed, maybe A is a cyclic ketone. Because when you add HCN to a cyclic ketone, you can form a cyanohydrin.

Wait, when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. The cyanohydrin has an alcohol and a nitrile group adjacent. So compound B would be a secondary alcohol with a nitrile attached.

But wait, let me think about the next step. B is then hydrogenated with H2 and Pd. Hydrogenation usually adds hydrogen. In this case, since B has a nitrile group, perhaps the nitrile is reduced. Wait, but nitriles are typically hydrogenated to amines, but under H2 with Pd... Wait, no, Pd is often used for hydrogenation of triple bonds or maybe for reduction of nitriles. Wait, no, sometimes nitriles are hydrogenated to amines with catalysts like Raney Ni, but with H2 and Pd, maybe it's hydrogenation of a triple bond elsewhere, but in compound B, after HCN addition, the structure would have a CN group. So, perhaps the hydrogenation converts the nitrile group into an amine. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reduction is of something else, like an alkyne to an alkene or an alkene to an alkane. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the cyanohydrin has a nitrile group and an alcohol. When you hydrogenate that, maybe the nitrile is reduced to an amine. So for example, if B is RC(OH)CN, then hydrogenation might give RCH2NH2. But wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is hydrogenated to an amine, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is for a triple bond elsewhere.

Wait, maybe
