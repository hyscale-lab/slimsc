Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH to produce product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, okay. Let's break it down.

First, the first reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. KOH is a strong base. Since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, it's pretty rigid. The dibromide suggests vicinal dihalide. When vicinal dihalides react with strong bases like KOH, they usually undergo dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on opposite positions of the adamantane structure. So heating with KOH would likely lead to elimination, forming an allene or a diene? Wait, no, 1,3-dibromo could be on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure, I think. So when they eliminate, they form a double bond.

Wait, wait. The product is a light yellow solid, and the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe the product is a ketone. Hmm, how does that happen? Oh, wait. Maybe it's not elimination but substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the dibromide undergoes dehydrohalogenation to form a diene, but the IR suggests a carbonyl.

Wait a second, another possibility: Maybe the reaction is a ring-opening of adamantane. But I'm not too sure. Let me think again. KOH is a strong base, sometimes used in E2 reactions. But also, in some cases
