Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because particle physics isn't my strongest suit. But I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question again.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. We're supposed to find the mean decay distance. The given data is production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, with some very small distances in meters.

Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance of a particle is related to its lifetime. The formula that comes to mind is c multiplied by the lifetime (τ), where c is the speed of light. So, distance d = c * τ. But wait, particles that decay quickly have a short mean distance, right? So the key is to find τ first.

How do I find the lifetime τ from the given parameters? Oh, I think the relation involves the particle's energy and the natural linewidth. The width Γ is related to the mean lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The formula I recall is Γ = ħ / τ. Wait, no, more precisely, Γ is the total decay width, and the relation is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, let's think again. The decay width Γ is the total width, and it's connected to the mean lifetime via Γ = ħ / τ. So τ is Planck's constant over Γ. But I should make sure about the units here.

Wait, the decay width Γ is given in MeV, and Planck's constant ħ is in units of GeV·s or something like that. Let me get the exact value. Oh, right, ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

Wait, because 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, and 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 J. But perhaps I don't need to convert units because I can handle it with the given units.

So, let me proceed. First, calculate the lifetime τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, wait, the formula could be Γ = ħ * (something), or maybe Γ is the total decay rate. Let me think again.

The natural line width is given by Γ = ħ * (something), but more accurately, for a resonance, the width Γ is related
