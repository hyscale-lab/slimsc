Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

Alright, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively. The question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as blackbodies.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity of a blackbody is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

But how does the temperature come into play here? Oh, right, because the peak wavelength at which a star emits is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. In this problem, the peak wavelengths are the same for both stars. So λ_max1 = λ_max2. 

Wait, wait. So if λ_max is the same, then from Wien's Law, T = b / λ_max. Since λ_max is the same for both, their temperatures must be the same. Oh, because λ_max1 = λ_max2 implies T1 = T2. So T1 equals T2. So their temperatures are the same.

Wait, but wait a second. No, no. Wait, no. Because the radial velocities are different. Oh, right, because radial velocity can affect the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. Oh, right! Because the star might be moving towards or away from us, which shifts the observed wavelength. So even if their rest wavelengths are the same, their observed wavelengths could differ. 

Wait, the problem states that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and those are the same. But the stars are moving, so their observed wavelengths are shifted. Hmm, so the observed λ_max is the same for both, but the rest λ_max might be different because of their velocities. 

Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me think. The peak emission wavelength for each star in their rest frame is given by their temperature. But if the star is moving relative to us, we observe a Doppler-shifted wavelength. 

So, for each star, the emitted peak wavelength in their rest frame (λ_em) is b / T. But because of the Doppler effect, the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is λ_em multiplied by (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. Wait, but which way? If the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), so λ_obs = λ_em * (1 + v_r/c). If moving towards us, blueshifted, so λ_obs = λ_em * (1 - v_r/c). Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me get it right. 

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_em * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ), but that's for relativistic speeds. But since the velocities here are 0 and 700 km/s, and the speed of light is about 3e5 km/s, so 700 is about 0.0023c, so non-relativistic speeds. So the approximation can be used. So λ_obs ≈ λ_em * (1 + v_r/c). Because when moving away (v_r positive), it's longer. 

Wait, no, actually, the proper formula when v_r is the radial velocity (positive for moving away) is λ_obs = λ_em * (1 + v_r / c) for non-relativistic speeds. So if a star is moving away, you get a redshift. So, the observed wavelength is longer.

So in this problem, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so its observed wavelength is λ1_obs = λ1_em. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Since the problem doesn't specify direction, I think it's moving away, so its observed wavelength is λ2_obs = λ2_em * (1 + 700 / c).

But the problem says their observed wavelengths (where they appear brightest) are the same. So, λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So, λ1_em = λ2_em * (1 + v2 / c), where v2 is Star_2's radial velocity. 

Wait, but the problem states that the stars' observed peak wavelengths are the same. So λ1
