Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, the molecular formula for C3H6—wait, that's either propene or cyclopropane. Oh wait, cyclopropane has the formula C3H6 as well. But propene is more common in these types of reactions. So, propene is CH2=CH2CH3? Or CH2=CHCH3? Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Right, that's the structure for propene, which is an alkene.

So, Compound A undergoes bromination in carbon tetrachloride. Oh, right, when alkenes react with bromine (Br2), it's a dibromination addition. So, the double bond in propene will add Br2 across it. So, propene (CH2=CHCH3) reacting with Br2 in CCl4 would form 1,2-dibromopropane? Wait, propene has two carbons in the double bond: CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So when bromine adds, it would add across the double bond. So the product would be 1,2-dibromopropane, which is BrCH2-CH2BrCH3? No, wait, wait. Propene has three carbons, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2Br-CHBr-CH3.

So Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, when Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, that's a dehydrohalogenation reaction, which is an elimination reaction. Since it's a vicinal dihalide (two adjacent Brs), the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, and the two Brs would leave, forming a double bond again. So, the product would be propene again? Wait, but wait—alcohol KOH would provide a strong base. So, for a vicinal dihalide, elimination (dehydrohalogenation) would form an alkene. But wait, the starting material is 1,2-dibromopropane
