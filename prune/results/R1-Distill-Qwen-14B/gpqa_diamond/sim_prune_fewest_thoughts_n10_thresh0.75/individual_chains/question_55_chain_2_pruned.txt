Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound among four options: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate. The NMR data provided is:

1H NMR (ppm):
7.0 (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)
5.5 (1H, dq)
2.1 (3H, s)
1.6 (3H, d)

Hmm. Let me think about each part. First, I remember that NMR helps determine the structure based on the splitting and integration of signals. So, each peak corresponds to a set of protons, probably in a specific environment.

Looking at the options, all of them are acetates, so they have an ester group. The structure of acetates is usually like R-O-CO-R', where R and R' are alkyl or alkenyl groups.

In the NMR, the 2.1 ppm peak is a singlet (s) with 3H. That's probably the methyl group attached to the oxygen in the acetate. Because in acetates, the OCH3 group (if present) would be a singlet. Wait, no, wait, acetate is OAc, which is O-C(=O)-O-R, no. Wait, wait, no: acetate is CH3COO-R. So the methyl group attached to the carbonyl would be around δ 2.1 as a singlet. Yes, that makes sense. So that peak is the CH3 of the acetate.

The other peaks: 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's probably a proton near an electronegative atom or part of a conjugated system. Wait, in alkenes, protons can couple with each other. 16 Hz is a pretty large coupling constant—so maybe it's a trans coupling in a double bond?

Then there's the 5.5 ppm peak, a doublet of quartets. That's more downfield, so maybe near an oxygen or part of a double bond.

The 1.6 ppm peak is a doublet with 3H. So that's probably a CH2 or CH group next to something else. Wait, 1.6 is upfield for a CH2, but for a CH3 attached to a double bond, maybe. Like in an allyl group.

Wait, let's think about the structure. These options are propenyl or butenyl acetates. So propenyl is CH2CH2CH2? No. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- or CH2CH=CH2? No, propenyl would be CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, but wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as the substituent. But wait, butenyl would have four carbons in the chain with a double bond.

Wait, the options are either propenyl or butenyl. So for propenyl acetate,
