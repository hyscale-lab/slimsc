Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron's uncertainty in energy based on its position uncertainty. Hmm, I remember this has something to do with Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. I think that principle relates the uncertainty in position and the uncertainty in momentum. Oh right, the formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Wait, so the problem gives me Δx as 0.1 nanometers. Let me convert that into meters because the units are important. 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters. Because 1 nm is 1e-9 meters, so 0.1 times that is 1e-10 m.

Now, I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. I'm a bit fuzzy on how to connect ΔE to Δp. Oh right, because energy is related to momentum through the equation E = p²/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be related to the uncertainty in momentum Δp squared over twice the mass.

But wait, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle gives me a relationship between Δx and Δp. So perhaps I can first find Δp from Δx, then use that to find ΔE.

Let me jot down the equations:

Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2 → Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx)

Then, ΔE is approximately (Δp)^2/(2m) because E is p²/(2m), so the uncertainty in E would be Δp squared divided by twice the mass.

So putting it all together, substituting Δp from the first equation into the second:

ΔE ≈ ( (ħ/(2Δx) )^2 ) / (2m )

Simplify that:

ΔE ≈ ħ² / (8 m (Δx)^2 )

Let me plug in the numbers. I need the values for ħ, m, and Δx.

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Mass of electron m is 9.10938356e-31 kg.

Δx is 1e-10 m.

Calculating the denominator first: 8 * m * (Δx)^2.

Wait, let me compute each part step by step.
