Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see.

The question is about a peptidic compound's analysis. The 1H NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar shifts and integrate to 1H together. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So, what's causing these two peaks?

Hmm. So the same alpha-proton is showing up as two separate peaks. Since the integrals add up to 1H, it's not a splitting due to coupling with another proton. Spin-spin coupling would cause splitting into multiplets, but the question says they ruled that out based on the coupling pattern. So maybe it's something else.

In an NMR, double peaks for the same proton could indicate some kind of diastereotopicity. Diastereotopic protons are equivalent in a molecule but become non-equivalent in a different diastereomer. Wait, but if the molecule is a mixture of diastereomers, then each would have its own set of protons. So in the NMR, the same proton in each diastereomer would split into two peaks, right? That makes sense. So if the compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers, each would have their own environment for the alpha-proton, leading to two separate peaks.

Wait, another possibility is if there's some kind of conformational issue. Like, maybe the molecule is flipping between two conformers, causing the same proton to appear as two. But that usually leads to broader peaks or line broadening, not two distinct peaks. Also, the question says the peaks are similar and have equal integrals, which might not fit with conformational changes. Plus, the NMR is at a certain condition, maybe if the compound is not pure or if there's some dynamic process. But I'm not sure.

Let me look at the other clues. The LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. Same mass suggests the same molecular weight. But wait, if it's a mixture of enantiomers, the molecular weight would be the same. So the LC-MS would show two peaks (enantioselective chromatography?), but the mass spec would show the
