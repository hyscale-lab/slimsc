Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again.

The question is about sigmatropic rearrangements, which are pericyclic reactions. The reactions given are three different ones, each leading to a product labeled A, B, or C. I need to figure out what each product is and then match them to the options provided.

First, let's look at each reaction one by one.

**Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) â†’ A**

Hmm, so the starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol. The conditions are H+ and heat. I'm thinking sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember involve the shift of a sigma bond along with a pi bond. Specifically, the terminal pi bond moving into a sigma bond.

Wait, but more accurately, sigmatropic rearrangements (like Cope and Claisen) involve the shift of a group from one position to another through a cyclic transition state. The general form is [n]sigmatropic rearrangement, where n is the number of atoms in the sigma bond that the group moves. For example, Claisen is a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement.

But wait, the first reaction here might be something else. The starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. Let me draw the structure. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would have an amine group (-NH2) attached to a carbon that's also attached to two methoxy groups (-OCH3). So the structure is something like:

OCH3

NH2-C-OCH3

But wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2, but with two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine. So more accurately, it's (CH3O)2CHNH2? Wait, no: 1,1-dimethoxyeth
