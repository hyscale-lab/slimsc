Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, first, I think I need to normalize this state because probabilities depend on the state being normalized. Wait, the problem says it's proportional, so I can't forget to normalize it later when calculating probabilities.

Next, the operator in question has a matrix representation A where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, so that's a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin-up and spin-down states. Let me write that out.

The matrix A would look like:
[0   hbar/2]
[hbar/2   0]
Because the diagonal elements are zero, and all off-diagonal are hbar/2.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, A_ij is hbar/2 when i≠j. So for a 2x2, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal (1,2) and (2,1) are hbar/2. So yeah, that's correct.

I remember that when an operator has a matrix like this, it represents some kind of spin component. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this A looks like (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So A = (hbar/2) σ_x.

Wait, yes, because σ_x has off-diagonal 1 and 0 on the diagonal. So that makes sense.

So the operator is proportional to σ_x. Now, the eigenstates of σ_x are not |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of σ_z. So the eigenstates of A will be different from the standard basis states.

The question asks for the probabilities of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of A, and the average value of that operator.

Wait, wait, the operator whose matrix is A. So the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues of A, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes when the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of A.

So steps to solve:

1. Normalize the state |alpha>.
2. Find the eigenstates of the operator A.
3. Express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.
4. The coefficients' squares will give the probabilities, and the average value is the expectation value <A>.
Alternatively, I can compute the expectation value directly using the matrix elements, but perhaps expressing |alpha> in the eigenbasis is easier for probabilities.

Let me start with step 1: normalize |alpha>.

The state is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>.

So let's compute the norm. The inner product <alpha|alpha> is (1-i)(2+i) + (2+i)(1-i) ?

Wait, wait, no. Let me think. The state is a linear combination: (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. So the inner product is (1+i)*(2+i) + (2 - i)*(1 - i)

Wait, no: wait, the inner product is (1+i)* (2-i) (from |up>) plus (2 -i)* (1 - i) (from |down>), because when you take the conjugate transpose, the coefficients become their conjugates.

Wait, no, no. Let me be precise. The state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. So the inner product <alpha|alpha> is [(1-i) (2+i)] + [(2 +i) (1 -i)].

Because when you take the inner product, you take the conjugate of each coefficient. So the first term is (1+i)* → (1-i) multiplied by (2-i)* → (2+i). Wait, no: wait, the coefficient of |up> is (1+i), so when you take <alpha|, it's (1-i) for |up> and (2 +i) for |down>.

Wait, no: wait, the coefficient in |alpha> for |up> is (1+i), so in <alpha|, it's (1+i)*, which is (1 - i). Similarly, the coefficient for |down> is (2 -i), so in <alpha|, it's (2 +i).

So the inner product is (1 - i)(2 + i) + (2 + i)(1 - i). Wait, wait, no, no: because the inner product is the sum over each basis component: |a|^2 + |b|^2 for each coefficient a, b.

Wait, no, no. Wait, when you have a state |psi> = a|up> + b|down>, then <psi|psi> is |a|^2 + |b|^2.

Because |up> and |down> are orthonormal. So <up|up>=1, <up|down>=0, etc.

So for |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, the norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2.

Compute |1+i|²: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Compute |2 -i|²: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the norm is sqrt(2 +5) = sqrt(7). So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So now, step 2: find the eigenstates of A.

A is (hbar/2) σ_x. The eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of A as well, since A is a scalar multiple of σ_x.

The Pauli X matrix eigenstates are the states |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

Wait, let me confirm that.

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Its eigenvalues are +1 and -1. The eigenvectors are:

For eigenvalue +1: (1,1), normalized to (1/sqrt(2)) (|up> + |down>).

For eigenvalue -1: (1,-1), normalized to (1/sqrt(2)) (|up> - |down>).

So the eigenstates of A are the same as σ_x, because A is hbar/2 times σ_x. So the eigenvalues of A will be (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1).

So the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So now, the state |alpha> can be written in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me compute the coefficients.

Let me denote |alpha> as:

( (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) |up> + ( (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) |down>.

Expressing this in terms of |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>.

Where |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),
and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So let's write:

a |+x> = a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),
b |-x> = b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Adding these gives [ a (|up> + |down> ) + b (|up> - |down> ) ] / sqrt(2).

Grouping terms:

= [ (a + b) |up> + (a - b) |down> ] / sqrt(2).

This must equal |alpha>:

[ (a + b)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (a - b)/sqrt(2) ] |down> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So equate coefficients:

( a + b ) / sqrt(2) = (1 + i)/sqrt(7),
( a - b ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

We can write this as:

a + b = (1 + i) / sqrt(2 * 7) * sqrt(2) ? Wait, no, let me think.

Wait, the equations are:

a + b = (1 + i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7),
a - b = (2 - i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7).

Let me write:

Equation 1: a + b = (1 + i) * sqrt(2/7),
Equation 2: a - b = (2 - i) * sqrt(2/7).

Now, adding Equation 1 and Equation 2:

2a = [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= (3) * sqrt(2/7)
So a = (3/2) sqrt(2/7) = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) ) = (3)/(sqrt(14)).

Wait, sqrt(2/7) is sqrt(2)/sqrt(7), so 3/2 times that is (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) ), which can be written as (3)/(sqrt(14)) because sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) is sqrt(14)/7, but perhaps it's better to leave it as is.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately. Let me compute (1 + i) and (2 -i) first.

Wait, the left side is a + b = (1+i) * [1/sqrt(7)] * sqrt(2), because sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) is sqrt(2/7).

So sqrt(2/7) is same as sqrt(2)/sqrt(7).

So a + b = (1 + i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7),
Similarly, a - b = (2 -i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7).

So adding these equations: 2a = [ (1 + i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= (3) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
=> a = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)).

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from equation1:

2b = [ (1 + i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) 
= ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
=> b = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)).

Wait, but let me calculate this correctly.

Wait, (1 + i) + (2 -i) = 3, and (1 + i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i )= -1 + 2i.

Yes.

So a = 3 * sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)),

and b = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)).

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should compute a and b's magnitudes squared to get the probabilities.

Because the probabilities are |a|^2 and |b|^2.

So let's compute |a|^2 and |b|^2.

First, |a|²:

a = [3 sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)).

So |a|² = (9 * 2) / (4 *7) ) = 18/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Wait, 18 divided by 28 is 9/14, which is approximately 0.642857.

Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36 as probabilities, which would sum to 1. So maybe that's a possibility.

Now, |b|²:

b = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)).

The magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) * (2) / (4 *7 )

Because sqrt(2) is in numerator, so (sqrt(2))^2 is 2.

So numerator: (1 +4 ) * 2 = 5*2=10.

Denominator: 4 *7 =28.

So |b|²= 10/(28) =5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, 10/28 is 5/14 which is about 0.3571.

But wait, 9/14 +5/14 is 14/14=1. So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.6428 and 5/14≈0.3571.

Looking at the options, option D says 0.61 and 0.29 which are close but not exact. Hmm. Let me check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of |b|².

Wait, let's compute |b|² again.

b = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)).

The coefficient is (-1 + 2i) multiplied by sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)).

The magnitude squared is | (-1 + 2i) |^2 multiplied by [ sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) ]^2.

Compute | (-1 + 2i) |^2: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1+4=5.

[ sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) ]^2 = (2) / (4 *7 ) = 2/(28) =1/14.

So |b|^2 =5 * (1/14 )=5/14 ≈0.3571.

And |a|^2 = (3)^2 * [ sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) ]^2.

Wait, sqrt(2)^2 is 2, and (2 sqrt(7))^2 is 4*7=28.

So [ sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) ]^2 = 2/(4*7)= 2/28=1/14.

So |a|^2= 9 * (1/14) )=9/14 ≈0.6428.

So probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.3571.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 → sum is 1.00. So 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, which is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places, and 5/14 is approximately 0.3571, which is 0.36 when rounded. So option A's probabilities match.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29. 0.61+0.29=1, but 0.61 is lower than 0.6428.

So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the expectation value <A> as another part of the problem. Let's see.

The expectation value of A is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is (hbar/2) σ_x, and |alpha> is the given state.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <A> using the expectation value in the original basis.

So, since A is a spin-x operator multiplied by hbar/2, and |alpha> is expressed in the spin-z basis, I can compute <A> as (hbar/2) times ( <alpha| σ_x |alpha> ).

But perhaps it's easier to compute it directly.

The matrix for A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0 ]].

So when I compute <alpha| A |alpha>, it's the inner product of |alpha> with A |alpha>.

Since |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = ( (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ) / sqrt(7).

So A |alpha> is A acting on |alpha>.

First, write A as a matrix:

A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

So when you apply A to |alpha>, it's equivalent to multiplying the vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] by A.

The resulting vector is [ (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) , (hbar/2)(1 +i)/sqrt(7) ) ]^T.

So the inner product <alpha| A |alpha> is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A|alpha>.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to compute in components.

Compute each term:

<alpha| A |alpha> = sum_{i,j} <e_i | A | e_j> * <e_i| alpha > * <alpha |e_j>,

Wait, perhaps better to compute it as the sum over i,j of A_ij * <e_i | alpha> * <alpha | e_j>.

Wait, since A is a matrix, the expectation value is Σ_{i,j} A_ij * ( <e_i | alpha> ) * ( < alpha | e_j> )

But perhaps an easier way is to compute (alpha dagger) * A * alpha.

So let me write |alpha> as a column vector:

[ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]
[ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Compute A |alpha>:

First component: 0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (hbar/2)*(2 - i)/sqrt(7) = (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Second component: (hbar/2)(1 + i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) )= (hbar/2)(1 +i)/sqrt(7).

Now, the inner product <alpha| A |alpha> is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A|alpha>.

So |alpha>^dagger is [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7) , (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

Multiplying |alpha>^dagger by A |alpha>:

(1 - i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2)(2 - i)/sqrt(7) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2)(1 +i)/sqrt(7).

Factor out (hbar/2) and 1/7:

= (hbar/2) [ (1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ] /7.

Compute each term:

(1 - i)(2 -i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) -i*2 +i^2 i^2 is -1.

= 2 -i -2i -1 → (2-1) + (-i -2i) → 1 -3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 +2i +i*1 +i^2 = 2 + 3i -1 → (2-1) +3i → 1 +3i.

Adding these two terms: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) )= 2.

So the expectation value is (hbar/2) * (2) /7 = (hbar/2) * 2/7 = hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says the average is hbar/7, which matches. The probabilities in option A are 0.64 and 0.36, which are approximately 9/14 and 5/14.

So option A would be correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought the probabilities were 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.6428 and 0.3571, which when rounded to two decimals would be 0.64 and 0.36, which matches option A.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, and the average is hbar/7. So option A is correct.


The problem involves an electron in a quantum state \( |\alpha\rangle \), proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of the \( z \)-component of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given as \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The given state is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the norm:
\[
\| |\alpha\rangle \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix},
\]
which corresponds to \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) (and hence \( A \)) are:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle \right), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

### Step 3: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the eigenbasis of \( A \)
Substitute the expressions for \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) into \( |\alpha\rangle \):
\[
|\alpha\rangle = a|+x\rangle + b|-x\rangle,
\]
where:
\[
a = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad b = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
The coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) are obtained by solving:
\[
a + b = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}, \quad a - b = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]
Solving these equations gives:
\[
a = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}, \quad b = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{7}}.
\]

### Step 4: Probabilities of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)
The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:
\[
P(+x) = |a|^2 = \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6429,
\]
\[
P(-x) = |b|^2 = \left( \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{7}} \right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.3571.
\]

### Step 5: Average value of \( A \)
The expectation value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]
Using the matrix representation of \( A \) and the normalized state \( |\alpha\rangle \), compute:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \frac{(1-i)(2+i) + (2-i)(1+i)}{7} \right).
\]
Simplify the terms:
\[
(1-i)(2+i) = 1 - 3i, \quad (2-i)(1+i) = 1 + 3i.
\]
Adding these gives:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively, and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). These results match **Option A**.
