Alright, I'm trying to figure out this qPCR question. Okay, so the scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran serially diluted samples with three technical replicates each. The efficiency was 100%, which I remember means the reaction is perfect, doubling the target every cycle. R² was 1, so the curve fits perfectly, meaning the data aligns well with the expected curve. The slope was -3.3. Wait, what's the typical slope for a qPCR curve? I think the standard slope is around -3.32 when efficiency is 100%, so that makes sense here.

Looking at his results, let's see. The higher the copy number, the lower the Ct value because there's more starting material, so it reaches the threshold sooner. For 100000 copies, the Ct is around 34. At 10000 it's 30.6-31.2, 1000 is 27.3-27.9, 100 is 24-24.6, and 10 copies give 20.7-21.3. So each ten-fold dilution (each step is 10x less) leads to an increase in Ct. Let's calculate the delta Ct between each dilution.

From 100000 (Ct ~34) to 10000 (Ct ~31), delta is about 3 cycles. Similarly, 10000 to 1000 is another 3 cycles higher, same for 1000 to 100, and 100 to 10. So each ten-fold dilution increases Ct by 3 cycles. Oh, wait, but the slope is -3.3. How does that relate?

The formula for the slope in a qPCR calibration curve is slope = log10(E)/(-slope). Wait, no, the standard formula is: the slope should be approximately -3.32 when efficiency (E) is 100% (because log10(2) is about 0.301, and 1/0.301 is roughly 3.32). So a slope of -3.3 makes sense for a 100% efficient reaction.

So each ten-fold dilution should increase Ct by about 3.3 cycles. But in the data, each ten-fold dilution (from 1e5 to 1e4, 1e4 to 1e3, etc.) increases Ct by exactly 3.3 cycles. Let me check: 34.2 (avg of 33.9,34.2,34.5 is ~34.2) minus 30.9 (avg 30.6,30.9,31.2 is ~30.9) is about 3.3. Similarly, 30.9 to 27.6 is 3.3, 27.6 to 24.3 is 3.3, and 24.3 to 20.7 is 3.6. Wait, no, 24 to 20.7 is 3.3 cycles? Let me compute 24.3 minus 20.7 is 3.6. Hmm, that's a bit more than 3.3. But maybe I should average more carefully.

Wait the actual Ct values might not be exactly perfect. Let's see the actual data:

- 100000: 33.9,34.2,34.5 → average ≈34.2
- 10000: 30.6,30.9,31.2 → avg 30.
