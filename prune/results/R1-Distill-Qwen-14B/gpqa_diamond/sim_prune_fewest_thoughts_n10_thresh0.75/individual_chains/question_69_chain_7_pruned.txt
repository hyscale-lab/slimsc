Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. The decay process is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime of X⁰ is given as τ₀ = 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. The question is asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, so I think this has to do with the particles moving and the time they take to decay. Because when a particle is moving, its lifetime as observed in the lab frame would be longer than its proper lifetime due to time dilation. But to detect the decay, the particle needs to live long enough that we can see it. The resolution probably refers to the time resolution or the ability to detect particles within a certain distance before they decay.

Hmm, right, because particles moving at high speeds can't travel too far before decaying. If the Bubble Chamber's detection system can't resolve particles that decay beyond a certain distance, then some decays would be missed. So the minimum resolution is the maximum distance the particles can travel before decaying, such that at least 30% of the decays are observed.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So I think the idea is that the fraction of particles that decay within a certain length determines how many we can observe, and we want at least 30% (so 0.3) to decay within that length so we can see them.

So the proper lifetime τ₀ is given. First, I think I need to calculate the mean lifetime in the lab frame, which would be longer. Because in the lab frame, the particle is moving at a high speed, so its lifetime is dilated.

The formula for time dilation is τ = γ τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. And γ is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ E/(m c²) when the kinetic energy is much larger than the rest mass. Wait, but wait, the energy given is the total energy, including
