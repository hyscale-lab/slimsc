Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis questions can be tricky. But let's take it step by step. The goal is to figure out which sequence of reactions will give me 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, or D.

First, I need to understand the target molecule. Let me draw its structure in my mind. So, benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, numbering is a bit important here. Let me visualize it: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So, the substituents are at the 1, 2, and 3 positions, but wait, that might be adjacent. Hmm, actually, for benzene, the numbering would be such that substituents are in specific positions. Alternatively, maybe it's 1,2,3-trisubstituted but I'm not sure about the numbering.

Wait, the IUPAC name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the benzene ring has three substituents: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. So, the ring has substituents in positions 1, 2, and 3. That makes them adjacent in a row, which is possible but perhaps difficult to achieve through some reaction sequences.

I remember that when you have multiple substituents, the order of their introduction matters, especially if they're activating or deactivating groups. Because each substitution can influence the next, based on the directing effects of the substituents.

So, the target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy (OCH2CH3), tert-butyl (C(CH3)3), and nitro (NO2). Now, ethoxy is an activating group (since it's an electron-donating group via O's lone pairs), while nitro is a strong deactivating (meta-directing) group. The tert-butyl group is an activating, branching group because it's an alkyl group, which is ortho/para-directing.

Wait, but waitâ€”tert-butyl is attached to the ring. So, the substituents are ethoxy (OCH2CH3) at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. Let me think about the directing effects. The first substituent would direct the next substituent into certain positions.

So, I need to plan the steps. Let's think about the possible steps:

1. Introduce one substituent first. Which one? Maybe the nitro group, or the ethoxy, or the tert-butyl.

Wait, but nitration is a common reaction. Let me think: if I nitrate benzene first, that would add a nitro group. Then, I can introduce another substituent. But nitro is meta-directing, which could complicate adding the other groups.

Alternatively, maybe I should
