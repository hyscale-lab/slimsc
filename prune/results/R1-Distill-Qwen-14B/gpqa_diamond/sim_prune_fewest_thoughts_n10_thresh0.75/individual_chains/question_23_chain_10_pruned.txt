Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about an experiment where a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). After some time, they checked using TLC and noticed that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots appeared. We need to figure out which of the options could be the products.

Hmm, I remember that when alkenes react with HBr, it's typically an addition reaction, specifically a halohydrin formation or maybe allylic bromination. Wait, no, waitâ€”HBr can also lead to electrophilic substitution if the compound has a benzene ring, but wait, the starting material here is an ether with a substituent that's an allyl group, right?

Wait, the structure of the starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me draw that out. So the benzene ring has an ether oxygen attached to a butenyl group. The butenyl is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)- something? Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, no, wait, but but has four carbons. Let me think. But-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4? That can't be because but has only four carbons, so 3-en would be between C3 and C4, but that's the end. So it's actually CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with double bond from C3 to C4? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-O-benzene? No, wait, but positions are 1,2,3,4. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2
