Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it.

Alright, the setup is that there are two planets orbiting a star. Both have been detected using transit and radial velocity methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 times the Sun, and effective temperature 6300 K. 

Each planet has its own mass and radius. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses with a radius of 1.7 Earth radii, and Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with a radius of 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. 

They're inducing Doppler shifts in the star's forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2 a shift of 0.04 Å. Both have the same albedo.

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. So, I think I need to find T1/T2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors. The formula I remember is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. Or wait, maybe it's (1 - albedo)^0.5? Or was it (1 - albedo) to the 1/4 power? Let me think.

I think the equilibrium temperature equation is derived from the balance between the absorbed stellar radiation and the emitted blackbody radiation. The formula is T_planet = T_star * ( (1 - a) * L_star/(16 * pi^2 * sigma * D^2) )^(1/4), where D is the distance from the planet to the star. But wait, L_star is proportional to R_star^2 * T_star^4, right? Because the Stefan-Boltzmann law says L = 4pi R^2 sigma T^4.

So substituting L into the T_planet equation, we get T_p = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * sqrt( (1 - a) )^0.5. Wait, maybe it's more precise to write it as T_p = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - a) )^0.25 ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me write the steps. The flux received by the planet is F = L/(4 pi a^2), where a is the orbital distance. The planet reflects some of this (albedo a), so the absorbed power per unit area is (1 - a) * F. The planet emits as a blackbody: sigma T_p^4. The energy balance is (1 - a) * F = sigma T_p^4.

But F is L/(4 pi a^2), so (1 - a) * L/(4 pi a^2) = sigma T_p^4.

But L = 4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4. Substituting that in: (1 - a) * (4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4 ) / (4 pi a^2) ) = sigma T_p^4.

Simplify: (1 - a) * R
