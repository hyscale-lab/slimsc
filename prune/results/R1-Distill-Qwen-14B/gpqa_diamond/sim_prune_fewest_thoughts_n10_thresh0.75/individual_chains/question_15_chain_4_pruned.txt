Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods and their host stars are different. The researchers want to observe the one more likely to transit because they have limited time.

Hmm, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit. Wait, more precisely, the probability is calculated based on the planet's orbital distance and the size of the star relative to the planet's orbit. Oh right, the formula I think is something like (R_star / a_planet)^2, but I'm not sure. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around.

Wait no, the transit probability isn't just about the size. I think it's more about the orbital plane's orientation. The probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. The formula is P = (R_star / a) * (1 + (m_planet/m_star)^(1/3)), but wait, I'm mixing things up. Maybe I should think about the basic geometric probability.

Oh right, the probability of transit is roughly the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital distance, times some factor. Or more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a) * (1/(sin i)), but since the RV method tells us that the planet's orbit is edge-on (well, the minimum mass is known, but for RV, the detection depends on sin i, so i is around 90 degrees if detected). Wait, but for transit to happen, the orbit must be edge-on. So if the RV method detects the planet, it implies that the planetâ€™s orbit is at an inclination close to 90 degrees. So maybe the RV method has already biased the planets towards edge-on orbits, which would mean higher transit probabilities.

Wait, but for the purposes of calculating the transit probability, the RV method gives a lower limit on the mass because it depends on sin i. But in this case, the question says both planets have already been detected via RV, so I
