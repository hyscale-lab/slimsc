Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through each compound one by one.

Optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, which happens when there's a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom attached to four different groups. Also, if a compound has a plane of symmetry or some other form of internal compensation, it won't be chiral even if it looks like it might have a chiral center. So, I need to check each compound for possible chiral centers and any symmetry.

The question lists seven compounds, and the options are A to D, with the number of optically active ones being 5, 3, 2, or 4. Let me go through each compound.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.
Hmm, structure time. The formula is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but wait, wait. Wait, butene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2? No, wait, the structure is (Z) configuration. Let me draw this correctly. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So structure is Cl is on C1, and the substituents on C2 are CH3 and CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and the rest. So, structure is Cl-C(=CH(CH3))-CH2CH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Let me think. The double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, right? So the main chain is four carbons: 1
