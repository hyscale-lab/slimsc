Okay, so I've got this question about designing a molecular diagnostic kit for a viral outbreak. Hmm, let's see. The question is about a retrovirus, right? Retroviruses are RNA viruses, so their genetic material is RNA. 

The options given are four different approaches. Let's break them down.

The first part of the question is about identifying the virus. Well, if it's a new outbreak, they probably don't know the exact virus yet. But wait, the question says the problem is to design a diagnostic kit. So maybe the first step is already done—like, they know it's this specific retrovirus. Or perhaps not.

Option A: They identify using symptoms, then do nested PCR. Wait, symptoms might not be enough because different diseases can have similar symptoms. Nested PCR is a method where you do two rounds of PCR to increase specificity. But how would you design the PCR without knowing the exact target sequence? You need to know the virus's genetic info to design primers.

Option B: They do cDNA sequencing first. Since retroviruses have RNA, they would first make cDNA using reverse transcriptase. Then sequencing that would help in designing primers. Real-time PCR is good because it's quantitative and fast. Once you have the sequence, you can design primers specific to the virus. That sounds plausible.

Option C: DNA sequencing. But wait, the virus is RNA, so DNA sequencing wouldn't apply unless it's a DNA virus. Unless they're talking about host DNA, but that's not relevant here. So maybe this option is incorrect.

Option D: They look for IgG antibodies. ELISA is good for antibodies, but if the virus is new, maybe they don't have specific antibodies ready. Plus, antibody tests take time for the immune response to develop, which isn't ideal for quick diagnosis. Also, the question is about designing a kit for the virus itself, not the immune response.

Going back, the question is about designing a kit for quick detection. So molecular methods like PCR are faster than serological methods like ELISA. So options A and B are PCR-based.

Option A says nested PCR. Nested PCR is more time-consuming and requires more steps. Real-time PCR in option B is more efficient and faster because it can quantify in real-time. Also, once you have the cDNA, real-time PCR can be set up with specific primers and a probe—like using TaqMan technology. 

So the steps would be: first, confirm the virus by sequencing. That means they probably amplify a region, make cDNA, and sequence it. Once they have the sequence, they can design specific primers and a probe for real-time PCR. Then use that for quick and accurate diagnosis because real-time PCR is both sensitive and quantitative.

So the correct answer should be B.


To design a molecular diagnostic kit for detecting a retrovirus, it is important to consider the nature of retroviruses, which are RNA viruses. The first step involves identifying the virus, and the most reliable method for this is sequencing. Since retroviruses have RNA as their genetic material, cDNA sequencing is appropriate. Once the cDNA sequence is obtained, specific primers and probes can be designed for real-time PCR. Real-time PCR is a fast, sensitive, and quantitative method, making it ideal for quick and accurate diagnosis. 

Option A suggests using nested PCR, but this method is less efficient and time-consuming compared to real-time PCR. Option C involves DNA sequencing, which is not applicable to RNA viruses. Option D focuses on detecting IgG antibodies using ELISA, but this method is slower and less suitable for diagnosing a newly identified virus. Therefore, the best approach is to perform cDNA sequencing first and then develop a real-time PCR kit.

Answer: B
