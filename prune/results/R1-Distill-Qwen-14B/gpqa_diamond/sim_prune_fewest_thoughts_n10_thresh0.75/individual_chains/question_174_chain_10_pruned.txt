Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The problem is about an atomic nucleus undergoing spontaneous fission. The nucleus is initially at rest with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. When it splits, it forms two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest-mass. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. 

We're supposed to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options given are A to D, in MeV.

Hmm, okay. Let me start by jotting down the given data.

Initial mass of the nucleus = M
Rest-mass energy of nucleus = 300 GeV
After fission, two fragments:
- Let fragment A be the more massive one, fragment B the less.
- Mass of A is 2 times the mass of B.
- Sum of rest masses (mA + mB) = 0.99 M.

Wait, but wait. The initial problem says the sum is 99% of M. So, (mA + mB) = 0.99 M. 

But wait, that brings up a point: since the nucleus is initially at rest, but when it splits, the rest masses of the fragments sum to less than the initial mass. So that implies that some energy is released, perhaps in the form of kinetic energy, or other particles, but the problem says that nothing else is produced—so maybe the rest mass difference is converted into kinetic energy.

But wait, the problem says to ignore the electrons, but I'm not sure if that affects the calculation. Maybe it's just to say that binding energy isn't considered in electron terms, but perhaps that's not relevant here.

So, first, let's find the rest masses of the two fragments.

Given that mA = 2 mB. And mA + mB = 0.99 M. 

So substituting, 2 mB + mB = 0.99 M → 3 mB = 0.99 M → mB = 0.
