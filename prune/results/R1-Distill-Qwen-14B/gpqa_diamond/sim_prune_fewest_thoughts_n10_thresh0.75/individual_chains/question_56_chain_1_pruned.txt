Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transition probabilities. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the 3,0,0 state decaying to 1,0,0 via two dipole transitions. So, it's a two-step process. I remember that in hydrogen, transitions happen between energy levels, and the selection rules dictate which transitions are allowed.

Wait, the selection rules for dipole transitions are important here. I think for the hydrogen atom in the non-relativistic theory, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Also, n can change by any integer, but typically, you go from a higher n to a lower n, depending on the photon emission.

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. It's going to decay to |1,0,0⟩. But it's a two-step process. So it must go through an intermediate state.

Let me think about possible intermediates. The starting state has l=0, so the first transition must change l by ±1. So from l=0 to l=1. So the intermediate state would have l=1.

So the first transition could go to |2,1, m⟩ or |4,1, m⟩, but since it's decaying, n should decrease, right? Because it's emitting a photon, so energy goes down. So from n=3, the next state would be n=2 or n=4? Wait, but from 3,0,0 to a higher state like 4,1, something isn't decay, that's absorption. Since it's a decay, it must go to a lower energy level, so n decreases. So the first step would probably go to n=2, l=1.

Wait, but why not n=4? Because the energy decreases when n decreases, right. So from 3→2 is a possible step. So the first transition is from 3,0,0 to 2,1,m, then from 2,1,m to 1,0,0.

But wait, the second transition: can l=1 go to l=0? Yes, because l changes by 1. So that's allowed.

Now, what are the possible m values?

In the first step, from m=0 (since initial state is m=0), the selection rule Δm can be -1, 0, +1. So the possible m for the first intermediate state are m= -1, 0, +1 when l=1.

Similarly, for the second transition, the m can change by up to 1 again. But the final state is m=0. So the intermediate state's m must allow a transition to m=0 in the next step.

Let me think about each option.

Option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. So the first transition is m=0 → m=0. The second step is m=0 → m=0.

Is that possible? Wait, in the first transition, m can change by 0 or ±1. So yes, from 0 to 0 is
