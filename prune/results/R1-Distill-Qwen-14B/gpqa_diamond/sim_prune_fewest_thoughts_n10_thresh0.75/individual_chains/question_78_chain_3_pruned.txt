Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about this topic.

The problem states that a point charge q is moving with a trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the potentials at a later time t when the field is observed. The field point is r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated at time tr (which is earlier) to the observation point r. The velocity of the charge at the generating time tr is v.

I remember that when charges move, they create both electric and magnetic fields. The potentials are related to these fields. The scalar potential is V, and the vector potential is A. Maxwell's equations link these potentials to the fields.

Wait, the scalar potential for a charge at rest is straightforward, like Coulomb's law. But when the charge is moving, the potentials might get modified due to relativistic effects, right? Or maybe because of the motion affecting the fields.

In the rest frame, the scalar potential V is (q)/(4πε0 r). But when the charge is moving, there's a possibility of length contraction or something. Oh wait, no, that's more about the fields themselves. But the potentials are usually handled via retarded times or something like that.

Wait, the problem mentions that the velocity v is at the time tr. And t is greater than tr, so we're looking at the fields after the charge has generated them. So maybe we're considering the retarded potentials here.

I think the retarded time concept comes into play here. The fields at a point r are due to the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr, which is the time it takes for the field to travel from the charge's position to the observation point.

So the scalar potential V would be due to the charge q at time tr, and the vector potential A would be due to the current density (if any) at that time.

Wait, the vector potential A is typically associated with the current. For a point charge, the current is the charge times the velocity. So A would be proportional to the velocity v.

Let me think about the expressions for the potentials. For static charges, V is straightforward, but when they move, the potentials might involve terms dependent on velocity.

I remember that
