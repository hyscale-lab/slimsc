Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to the concept, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that there's an intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and they've built a super fast spacecraft that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The aliens have an average lifetime of about 150 solar years. Their destination is Earth. So, the question is about how long it will take for their 22-year-old astronaut to reach Earth from their own perspective, which is the astronaut's proper time. The options are about whether he dies before getting there, or how old he'll be when he arrives.

Hmm, right. I remember that when dealing with such high speeds, we have to consider effects from Einstein's theory of relativity, specifically time dilation. Because the spacecraft is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, time will pass differently for the astronaut compared to someone on Earth.

Wait, so from Earth's frame of reference, the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud is a certain amount. But the spacecraft is moving so fast, so the distance would be shorter in the astronaut's frame, right? Or wait, no, the distance is contracted in the direction of motion. So the astronaut would experience less time because of time dilation and length contraction effects.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Time dilation affects the astronaut's own time compared to someone else's. But also, the distance between the two points (Earth and the spacecraft's origin) would be length-contracted from the astronaut's perspective. So the distance they need to travel is shorter, making the trip take less time from their point of view.

But wait, the problem says the spacecraft is traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. So the distance between those two points is the distance we need to consider. I think the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. Wait, but waitâ€”do I know that for sure? Because that's a specific value, but the problem probably expects me to assume a certain distance or perhaps a different approach.

Wait, the problem doesn't give the distance between Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud. Hmm, maybe I'm supposed to compute using the given speed and perhaps figure out the time from each frame. Let me see
