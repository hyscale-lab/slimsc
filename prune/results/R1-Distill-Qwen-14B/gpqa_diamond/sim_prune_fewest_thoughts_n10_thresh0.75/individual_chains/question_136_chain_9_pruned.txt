Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field f(r) inside a sphere of radius R. The field falls off as 1/r² and is radial only. 

Wait, right, divergence theorem. Oh wait, no, wait. The divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the surface integral of the field over the boundary. So if I have ∫ (div f) dV over the volume, it's equal to ∫ f · n dA over the surface. But wait, what do I know about f?

The field f(r) has magnitude 1/r² and is radial. So in spherical coordinates, its components are only in the radial direction. So f(r) = (1/r²) er, where er is the unit radial vector. 

So to find the divergence, I need to compute ∇ · f. Since f is purely radial, the divergence would involve the derivative in the radial direction. 

I remember that in spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field A is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² A_r) + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂(A_θ sinθ)/∂θ + (1/(r sinθ)) (1/φ) ∂A_φ/∂φ. But since our field A only has A_r component, the other terms are zero. So divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r² A_r). 

In this case, A_r is 1/r². So let's compute that. 

So plugging in: (1/r²) * d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ] = (1/r²) * d/dr (1). The derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So the divergence is zero? 

Wait, but wait a second. If the divergence is zero everywhere except perhaps at the origin, then the volume integral would be zero. But wait, what about when r approaches zero? Because the field goes like 1/r², which might have a divergence that isn't zero when r approaches zero. Or maybe I'm mixing that up.

Wait, another approach. Let me compute the divergence more carefully. 

∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ) 
= (
