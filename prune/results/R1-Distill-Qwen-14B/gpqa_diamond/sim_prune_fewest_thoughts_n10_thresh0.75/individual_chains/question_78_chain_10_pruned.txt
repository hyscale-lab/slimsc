Okay, so I've got this question about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism class that when charges move, they create both electric and magnetic fields, and these are described using the scalar (V) and vector (A) potentials.

The question gives me a scenario where a point charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the potentials at a point r at time t, where t is larger than tr, the time when the field was generated. The vector d is the displacement from the point where the field was generated to the observation point r.

I think the potentials are solutions to Maxwell's equations, derived from the sources. The scalar potential usually comes from the electric field, and the vector potential from the magnetic field. For a static charge, the scalar potential is straightforward, like V = q/(4πε₀ r), but when the charge is moving, things get more complicated because of the magnetic effects.

Wait, the potentials for a moving charge would depend on its velocity, right? Oh, right, the vector potential A is related to the velocity of the charge. But how exactly?

I remember that in the case of a moving charge, the vector potential can be expressed in terms of the velocity. The formula I think is something like A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π) times some factor involving the distance and the velocity. Let me think about the exact expression.

Also, the scalar potential for a moving charge isn't just the static case anymore. There's a term involving the velocity. Oh, right, there's a correction term because of the motion that affects the potential.

Wait, the Lorentz transformation probably comes into play here. When you switch frames, the electric and magnetic fields mix. So the potentials in one frame can be expressed in terms of the other. But I'm not sure how that directly affects the expressions for V and A here.

Alternatively, I think the potentials for a moving charge can be derived using the Liénard potentials. Those are the expressions for the potentials due to an accelerated charge. But since the question doesn't mention acceleration, maybe it's assuming non-relativistic speeds or steady motion.

Wait, the vector potential A is proportional to the velocity v of the charge. The scalar potential V would be like the standard
