Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question is about identifying a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its IR and NMR spectra. The options are four different chemical formulas.

First, let's read the question carefully.

The compound is a di-substituted aromatic ring. That means the benzene ring has two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters have a characteristic carbonyl peak, usually around 1700 cm⁻¹. So, there's an ester functional group somewhere in the molecule.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are six signals. Let's categorize them.

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents can be in different positions. The aromatic protons would split into different signals based on their environment. For example, in para substitution, there are two sets of aromatic protons: the two H's adjacent to each substituent (ortho) and the two H's opposite (para). Wait, no, that's for mono-substituted. For di-substituted, the substitution pattern affects the splitting. If the substituents are in para positions, the aromatic protons might be split into two sets. Alternatively, if it's ortho, meta, or para, the number of signals and their splitting can vary.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for aromatic-H. That suggests two distinct sets. So perhaps the substituents are in a position that causes the aromatic H's to split into two groups. For example, if the substituents are para, the molecule would have some symmetry, leading to two sets of aromatic H's. Let me think: in para substitution, each substituent is opposite each other on the ring. So, the benzene ring would have two substituents, say X and Y, in para positions. Then, the aromatic Hs would be in two equivalent pairs. So each substituent would cause the adjacent Hs to have different shifts, but maybe in this case, the two substituents might lead to two sets of Hs each with two Hs, hence two signals. Alternatively, if the substituents are in meta positions, perhaps the Hs are in three different environments, but that would probably give more than two signals.

Another possibility is that the substituents are para to each other, causing the aromatic Hs to split into two sets, each as doublets maybe. Or maybe one substituent is an ester and the other is something else, but I'm not sure.

Next, the NMR also shows two signals for vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. A doublet of quartets would be coupling with two sets of protons perhaps? Or perhaps a more complex coupling, like in a
