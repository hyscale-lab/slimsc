Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through the question carefully.

Alright, the question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. It's dehydrated to form an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3. The major product has a cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum, which means there's a spatial proximity between two protons, while the minor product doesn't.

The question is about identifying which two resonances are connected in the major product's NOESY spectrum. The options are A to D, each describing different H NMR signals.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid typically forms an anhydride. The cis-alkene would influence the structure of the anhydride. Also, the NMR data of the anhydride is given: 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and 13C has peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.

Wait, 1H NMR at 7 ppm usually indicates protons that are deshielded, like aldehyde protons, aromatic protons, or maybe something else. But wait, in an anhydride, maybe it's from the carbonyl groups? Hmm, no, aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm, so maybe it's something else. Wait, the anhydride would have two carboxylic anhydride groups. But wait, maybe the proton is from the oxygen of the anhydride? Or perhaps it's the dienophile's part.

Wait, the 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 13C shifts: 165 could be a carbonyl, like an anhydride or ketone. 137 is probably a carbon with double bond, maybe an spÂ² hybridized carbon, like in an alkene.

Wait,
