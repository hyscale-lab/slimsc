Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

The question describes a reaction involving Substance X, liquid Y, and the production of gas W and precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases substance B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. Also, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with 2 oxygen atoms. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Alright, let's break this down.

First, let's think about the reaction setup. Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y. Violent reactions often involve things like metals reacting with acids, or maybe something more vigorous. Then, gas W is released. W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, same number of neutrons and protonsâ€”so that would make it an isotope of a lighter element, maybe like hydrogen? But wait, hydrogen's isotopes are just H, D, T. Hydrogen (H) has 1 proton and 0 neutrons; deuterium has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So if W's molecule has same protons and neutrons, maybe it's deuterium? Or perhaps another element where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons, like maybe CH4 or something else?

Wait, but the molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let me think: each molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons in its entire molecule. So for example, if W is H2O, each molecule has 8 neutrons (average for O) and 1+1=2 protons. That doesn't match. Or maybe CO2? That's 12 (C) + 16*2 (O) = 44 g/mol. Not sure.

Wait another approach: if the gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons in each molecule. So each molecule has protons P and neutrons N, and P = N.

Possible elements: Take H, but H's molecule would be H2. Each molecule has 2 protons and 0+0=0 neutrons? No, that doesn't work. Wait, maybe each atom in the molecule contributes to P and N. So, for H2, each H is
