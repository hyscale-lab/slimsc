Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's going on.

The problem says that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air. When heated, only a mixture of gases is formed. These gases are then passed through three tubes: the first is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, the second with Ca(OH)2 solution, and the third with red-hot copper. 

The results are:
- Tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2) gains 3.60 grams.
- Tube 2 (Ca(OH)2 solution) doesn't change weight.
- Tube 3 (copper) gains 0.80 grams, and CuO is formed.
- Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

We need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A) 13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Alright, let's break this down. 

First, the setup: heating salts without air. That probably means it's a decomposition reaction, maybe producing some gases. The gases are passed through various tubes, which react with them.

Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous. When it absorbs water, it forms Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O, increasing the tube's weight. So the increase (3.60g) is due to water. So, the amount of H2O in the gas mixture is 3.60g. 

Wait, wait. Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent; it absorbs water. So, the mass gained (3.60g) is the mass of water that was in the gas. So moles of H2O = 3.60g / (18 g/mol) = 0.2 moles.

But wait, how did the water get there? Because when salts A and B decompose, they could produce water vapor, HCl, or other gases. So the first tube captures the water, so that tells us about the water in the gas mixture.

Next, the second tube is Ca(OH)2 solution. It's a gas washer that would react with acidic gases. If the weight of this tube didn't change, it means that no acid was present. Because if HCl gas passed through, for example, it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCl2 and water, thus increasing the tube's weight. Since it didn't change, there's no HCl in the gases. Alternatively, but wait, maybe the gas was something else.

Wait, another possibility is that the gas passed through was neutral or inert. So, if the gas didn't react with Ca(OH)2, it's either non-acidic (like CO2 might not react, but wait, CO2 would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 precipitate, which would increase the weight). So if tube 2 didn't gain weight, perhaps the gas is not CO2, or maybe it's something else.

Wait, but no, CO2 in presence of Ca(OH)2 would form a precipitate, so the tube would gain weight. Since it didn't, that suggests that CO2 is not present, or that maybe the gas is something else, like NH3? But NH3 is a base, so it would react with the solution as well. Alternatively, maybe the gas is N2 or O2, but those wouldn't react. Hmm, maybe the remaining gas is something like O2 or
