Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. I remember that when dealing with such problems, it's important to break each reaction down and figure out the structures involved.

Alright, the first part says that 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1. The IR and NMR data are given. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I think is typical for a carbonyl group. So maybe an epoxide or a ketone? Wait, 1720 is more like a ketone or maybe an ester. But wait, when dibromides react with KOH, especially in a ring-opening reaction, it might form something else.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, with four fused cyclohexane rings. The 1 and 3 positions are both brominated. When treated with KOH, which is a strong base, perhaps it's an elimination reaction? But KOH could also cause a substitution or maybe a ring-opening because the adamantane structure is somewhat strained, but I don't think it's very strained. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but with two bromines, perhaps an elimination to form an alkene?

Wait, but the product is a solid, and the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That region is often where vinyl protons or maybe an ether's CH₂ is. Alternatively, epoxide protons are usually around 3-4 ppm. Wait, 4.79 could be a carbonyl adjacent group, like an ester or ketone. Hmm.

Wait, the IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl. So maybe the product is a diketone? But wait, the positions are 1 and 3. Let me think. Heating a dibromide with KOH... Maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. If the bromines are on adjacent carbons, perhaps the hydroxide could substitute, but with two Brs, maybe it's a double substitution.

Wait, but if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps the two bromide groups are eliminated, forming an allene or something else. Wait, no, elimination from adjacent positions would form a double bond. Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by an OH group, but that would give a diol. But the IR would have O-H stretches, which are usually broad around 3200-3600. The IR here doesn't mention that, so maybe it's not a diol.

Wait, another possibility is that the KOH is causing a ring-opening. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's an E2 elimination, forming an alkene. Since there are two Br atoms, perhaps two dehydrohalogenation steps occur. But that would require the Brs to be in positions that allow for a conjugated diene or something.

Wait, but the NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. Maybe a carbonyl group, like a ketone, but where? Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone, but that might not fit with the NMR. Alternatively, the 2H at 4.79 could be an epoxide's CH₂. Wait, epoxide protons are usually split into a quartet or something else, but more likely, they're around 3-4 ppm. Hmm.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the KOH is causing a substitution, replacing the Br atoms with something else. Oh, wait, KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So perhaps the Br atoms are replaced by hydroxide ions, but that would give a diol. But the IR doesn't show O-H absorption, so maybe it's an elimination.

Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. If both Brs are on adjacent carbons, then elimination would form a double bond. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules to form an allene, which has two double bonds? Wait, no, 1,3 elimination would form a single double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclohexene derivative. Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms an epoxide. Wait, but how? Epoxides are usually formed from alkenes and peracids, not from dibromides and KOH.

Hmm, maybe I should think more about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm for 2H could be a methylene adjacent to an oxygen. Like an ether or an ester. Alternatively, maybe it's the methylene next to a ketone. Let me think about the NMR data:

1H NMR of product 1:
- 4.79 (2H)
- 2.41-2.23 (10H)
- 1.94 (2H)

So, the product has some methylene groups. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) likely corresponds to a decalin system or something similar, like the adamantane structure without the Br atoms. Maybe the 10H are from the two central CH₂ groups in the adamantane structure, and the 2H at 1.94 could be some sort of bridgehead CH₂.

Wait, but if product 1 is a diol, maybe the 2H at 4.79 are the OH-bearing CH₂ groups, but again, the IR doesn't show O-H. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait another thought: when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalides) react with hydroxide, they can form epoxides via an SN2 mechanism. But this is a 1,3-dibromide, so the positions are not adjacent. That complicates things, so maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing a ring-opening via elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is an adamantane with ketone groups. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH, might form an enol. Alternatively, maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to a carbonyl group. For example, in a vicinal dihalide, elimination can form a carbonyl. Wait, but I think that's more for geminal dihalides. Wait, let me think: when a vicinal dihalide (like 1,2-dibromocyclohexane) is treated with a base, it can eliminate two equivalents of HX to form a double bond. But in a 1,3-dibromide, perhaps elimination leads to a conjugated diene or something else.

Wait, perhaps it's a dielimination, but I'm not certain. Another angle: the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, probably a ketone. So maybe product 1 is a ketone.

How can a 1,3-dibromide form a ketone upon treatment with KOH? One possibility is that each Br is replaced by an oxygen group, but that would form a diol, which doesn't fit the IR. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an O- group, leading to some kind of elimination.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe each Br is replaced by an OH, but then the O-H groups lose protons to form a carbonyl. That seems a bit far-fetched, but perhaps. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination where two HBr are lost, and the resulting structure has a carbonyl.

Wait, but how? Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane has a structure where each bridgehead carbon is connected to two CH₂ groups. The 1 and 3 positions are each attached to a bridgehead. If those are brominated, perhaps elimination would form a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a diketone. But
