Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let's try to parse this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my stellar chemistry, but let's see.

The question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I remember that when astronomers talk about elemental abundances, they often use logarithmic scales, like [X/Y], which represent the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of two elements.

So, the given data is:

- Star_1 has mass 1.5 times the Sun, and Star_2 is 1.2 times the Sun.
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So, the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times higher than in the Sun.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So, Mg is 10^0.3 times more abundant relative to Si in Star_2 compared to the Sun.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. So, Fe abundance in Star_1 is same as in the Sun.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Mg in Star_2 is same as in the Sun.

The Sun's photosphere has:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → So, log10(nFe/nH)= 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5.
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log10(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Wait, let me calculate those:

nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

nMg/nH = 10^(-5) = 1e-5.

So, for the Sun, Mg/Fe ratio would be (nMg/nH) / (nFe/nH) ) = (1e-5) / (3.16e-5) ) ≈ 0.316. So about 0.316, which is about 1/3.16.

Wait, but how does that tie in with the star data?

Let me think about each star separately.

Starting with Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0. So, Fe abundance is same as Sun. So, nFe/nH for Star_1 is same as Sun: 3.16e-5.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(Si/Fe) = 0.3 → Si/Fe =
