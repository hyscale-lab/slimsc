Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

The question says that the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. They're asking about the order of magnitude comparison between the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (which I think is the paramagnetic coupling term) and the transition energy ΔE for hydrogen when the wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So first, I need to figure out what each part is. The paramagnetic coupling term comes from the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. Oh right, the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B S, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio and μ_B is the Bohr magneton. So the coupling term would be something like -μ·B, which translates to some term involving S and B.

In the Hamiltonian, the paramagnetic term would be H = -μ·B. Since B is along Oz, this simplifies to H = -gμ_B B S_z. But wait, when we take the expectation value <H>, it would be proportional to <S_z> multiplied by B and other constants, right?

Now, the transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two states in the hydrogen atom. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which I think corresponds to a certain emission line. Let me calculate ΔE using the wavelength. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. So plugging in the numbers, h is Planck's constant (about 6.626e-34 J·s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), and λ is 0.4861e-6 meters.

Calculating ΔE: E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6) = Let's compute that. 6.626e-34 * 3e8 is about 1.9878e-25. Dividing by 0.4861e-6 gives approximately 4.088e-19 J. To convert that to electron volts, since 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J, so 4.088e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. Wait, but wait, hydrogen's energy levels are much smaller. Oh wait, no, the transition that corresponds to 0.4861 micrometers is the Balmer series, like the H-alpha line. The energy levels for hydrogen are on the order of a few eV, so this makes sense.

Now, the paramagnetic term. The expectation value <H> is for the paramagnetic term. For an electron in an atom, the expectation value of S_z depends on the state. Let's say the electron is in an s orbital, which has l=0, so m=0. Then <S_z> would be zero. But wait, the question says m is small, so perhaps m is about 1 or so. Wait, but for hydrogen, m can be -l, ..., +l. So if l is small, like maybe for lower energy levels where l is small, m is also small.

Wait, but the paramagnetic term is proportional to m (since S_z has eigenvalues mħ/2 for electrons). So for an electron in an orbital with m=0, the expectation value would be zero. But if m is, say, 1 or -1, then it's non-zero.

Hmm, but I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again. The paramagnetic term's expectation value is proportional to m. So if m is small, say m=1, then <H> would be proportional to 1. Then what's the typical magnitude of this term compared to ΔE?

The Bohr magneton μ_B is about 9.274e-24 J/T. So the paramagnetic term would be something like g * μ_B * B * m, where g is the Landé g-factor, which is approximately 2 for electrons. So putting it together: H = -g μ_B B m. Wait, but wait, S_z is (mħ/2), so when we compute H, it's H = -g μ_B B (mħ/2). So the expectation value <H> would be -g μ_B B (mħ/2). But let's compute the
