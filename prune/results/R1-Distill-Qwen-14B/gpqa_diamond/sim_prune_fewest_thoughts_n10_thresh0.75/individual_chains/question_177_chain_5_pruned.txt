Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it says. So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, but wait, the question is about luminosity, which I think relates more to radius and temperature, right? Because mass might not be directly relevant here unless we're talking about something like the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars emit their peak at the same wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 = T2. Got it.

Then, we're told about their radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, meaning it's not moving towards or away from us? Or wait, radial velocity is the component along the line of sight. If it's zero, maybe it's not moving much. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. But wait, how does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh, that's the Doppler effect. But since the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, I'm not sure if the Doppler shift affects their peak emission. Because the measured peak wavelength would include the Doppler shift. Hmm, but the problem says the astronomer determined the wavelengths where the stars appeared brightest, and those are the same. So maybe the observed wavelengths are the same, which would mean that their rest wavelengths are different. But if their temperatures are same, then their rest wavelengths would be same, unless they're moving. Wait, no. If they are moving, their observed wavelengths would be shifted.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let's think. The peak wavelength observed depends on both the star's temperature and any Doppler shift due to motion. Oh, right! So if a star is moving towards us, its emission is blueshifted; moving away, redshifted. So the observed wavelength would change. But the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same. So the Doppler shifts must have adjusted the rest wavelengths to make the observed ones the same.

Wait, but earlier we concluded that their temperatures are the same. That's because their peak wavelengths (rest frame) would be the same if their temperatures are same. Oh no, wait, wait. No, if the stars have same temperature, their rest frame peak wavelengths are same. But if one is moving, say, towards us, its observed peak would be shorter (blueshifted). So for their observed peak wavelengths to be same, their rest frame temperatures must be same, and their Doppler shifts must have adjusted such that the observed λ_max is same.

Wait, but the problem states that the peak wavelengths are same as observed. So perhaps that's a clue about their velocities.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler
