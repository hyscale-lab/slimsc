Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying Compound X based on the NMR data of the product after a reaction.

So, the reaction involved is between compound X and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, what's that reagent? Oh right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a commonly used base, especially in elimination reactions. I think it's often used in the formation of epoxides or maybe for deprotonating something. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, another thought. Oh, wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is also known as DBU, which stands for 1,8-diazabicycloundec-7-ene, but wait, no, wait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me think. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane would have a structure where there are two rings, each with two carbons, and the bridge has two carbons as well. So, it's a bicyclic amine. Oh, right, and it's a strong, non-nucleophilic base. So, it's often used in elimination reactions, like in the formation of epoxides, or in E2 mechanisms. Or maybe it's a catalyst for certain reactions, like maybe some ring-opening reactions.

Wait, but the product after this reaction is giving NMR data. So, let me think about what kind of reaction would produce a compound with the given NMR signals.

The product's 1H NMR has signals:

Î´ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

And the 13C NMR has:

21.3 (s), 28.4 (s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C,
