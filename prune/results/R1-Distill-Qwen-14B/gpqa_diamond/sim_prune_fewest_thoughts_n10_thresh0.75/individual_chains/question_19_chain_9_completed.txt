Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael reaction. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The question presents two reactions, A and B, and I need to pick the correct products from the options given. Let's break them down one by one.

First, Reaction A: methyl 2-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylate is reacting with NaOEt, THF, and 2,4-dimethyl-1-(vinylsulfinyl)benzene. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking a conjugated carbonyl compound. Oh wait, in the Michael addition, typically a nucleophile (like an enolate) adds to an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is methyl 2-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylate. The structure would be a cyclohexane ring with a ketone (2-oxo) and a carboxylate ester (methyl) at the 1-position. So, the carbonyl is at C2, and the ester is at C1. Now, the carbonyl is a ketone, so I'm thinking about the alpha and beta positions.

The reagent is NaOEt in THF, which is a strong base. So, maybe it's deprotonating something. Wait, methyl 2-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylate: the carbonyl is at C2, so the alpha carbons are C1 (which is the ester) and C3. But wait, the ester is at C1, so the alpha protons would be adjacent to the ketone. So, perhaps the base abstracts a proton alpha to the ketone, forming an enolate.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexane ring has a conjugated system. Let me visualize it. The structure is a six-membered ring, with a ketone at C2 and an ester at C1. So, the positions are 1 and 2 on the ring. The ketone is at 2, so the adjacent carbon is 1 (ester) and 3. So, the alpha carbons are the C1 (ester) and C3.

Wait, but the ester's carbonyl is at C1 (COOCH3), and the ketone is at C2. So, the enolate would form between C1 and C2? Or maybe C2 and C3? Hmm, perhaps the base deprotonates at C3, making an enolate that's conjugated with the ketone.

Once the enolate is formed, it can attack the alpha,beta-unsaturated sulfinyl group. The other reagent is 2,4-dimethyl-1-(vinylsulfinyl)benzene. So, that's a benzene ring with methyl groups at 2 and 4 positions, and a substituent at position 1 which is a vinylsulfinyl group. So, the structure would be:

Ph-SO-O-CH2-CH2-Ph? Wait, no. Wait, vinylsulfinyl is -SO-O-CH2-CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so vinylsulfinyl would be CH2=CH-S-O-... something. Wait, no, more accurately, the structure is R-S(O)- where R is the vinyl group. So, the substituent is CH2=CH-S(O)- attached to the benzene ring. So, the compound is a benzene ring with two methyl groups and a vinylsulfinyl group.

In the Michael reaction, the enolate would attack the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl or, in this case, perhaps the alpha,beta-unsaturated sulfinyl group. Wait, but the vinylsulfinyl group is a good Michael acceptor, right? Because the sulfinyl group is a good electron-withdrawing group, making the alpha,beta double bond more electron-deficient. So, the enolate would attack the beta position of this group.

So when the enolate attacks, the structure would add the nucleophile (the enolate) to the beta position of the vinylsulfinyl group. The attack would form a new carbon-carbon bond between the enolate's carbon and the beta position of the vinylsulfinyl.

So, the product would have the sulfinyl group attached to the cyclohexane ring via a new bond. Let me sketch this in my mind. The cyclohexane ring has the ester at C1 and the ketone at C2. The enolate forms at C3 (assuming the base deprotonates at C3, making a conjugated enolate between C2 (ketone) and C3). This enolate would attack the vinylsulfinyl group at its beta position.

The vinylsulfinyl group is CH2-CH2-SO attached to benzene, but wait, no, the structure is CH2=CH-SO attached to the benzene? Wait, no, the substituent is 1-(vinylsulfinyl), which I think is -CH2-CH2-SO- but that's not right. Wait, vinylsulfinyl is CH2=CH–S(O)–, but wait, the structure is probably CH2–CH2–S(O)– where the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, no. Wait, the vinyl group is CH2=CH–, so the substituent is CH2=CH–S(O)– attached to the benzene ring.

So, the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2-S(O)-? No, wait, no. The benzene ring has a substituent at position 1 which is a vinylsulfinyl group. So, the substituent is -(vinylsulfinyl), which is CH2=CH-S(O)-. Wait, but that would be attached to the benzene as CH2=CH-S(O)-, but I think it's actually -(CH2)CH2-S(O)-? Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the substituent is (vinylsulfinyl), which is -CH2-CH2-S(O)- but that's not correct. Wait, perhaps it's -(CH2)– where the double bond is between the two CH2 groups. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a sulfinyl group. So, it's like CH2=CH–S(O)–R, but in this case, R is the benzene ring.

Wait, maybe I should think of the vinyl group as CH2=CH–, and the sulfinyl group is –SO–. So, the group is CH2=CH–SO– attached to the benzene. So, the structure is benzene with a substituent at position 1, which is a vinylsulfinyl group: CH2=CH–SO– attached to the benzene.

So, when the enolate attacks, the enolate's carbon (from the cyclohexane ring) would add to the beta carbon of the vinylsulfinyl group, which is the CH2 part of CH2=CH–SO–. So the attack would form a new bond between the cyclohexane's enolate carbon and the CH2 part, adding the sulfinyl group to the cyclohexane.

So, the product would have a substituent attached at the site of the enolate. In methyl 2-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylate, the enolate would form at C3, adjacent to the ketone. So, the product would add the sulfinyl group to C3. So, the structure would be methyl 3-(2-((2,4-dimethylphenyl)sulfinyl)ethyl)-2-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A) A is methyl 1-(2-((2,4-dimethylphenyl)sulfinyl)ethyl)-2-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.

Option B) A is methyl 3-(2-((2,4-dimethylphenyl)sulfinyl)ethyl)-2-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.

So, the difference is the position of the substituent. If the enolate is at C3, then the product would have the substituent at C3, making option B the correct one for A.

Wait, but why would the enolate form at C3? Let me think again. The starting material is methyl 2-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylate. The ketone is at C2, so the adjacent carbons are C1 and C3. The base would deprotonate the alpha position to the ketone. So, the alpha positions are C1 and C3. But C1 is already bearing the ester group, so perhaps the proton is abstracted from C3, leading to an enolate between C2 and C3.

So, the enolate would form at C3, and when it attacks the vinylsulfinyl group, the substituent would add at C3, making the product A as in option B.

Alternatively, if the enolate forms at C1, but that's already an ester, so maybe C3 is the correct position. So, for reaction A, the product is option B's A.

Now, moving on to Reaction B: ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate reacts with NaH, THF, and methyl 2-cyclopentylidene-2-phenylacetate.

Wait, ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate is CH2CH2COOEt? Wait, no. Let me think: butanoate is CH3CH2CH2COOEt. Oh wait, but it's 2-ethylbutanoate. Wait, butanoate is CH3CH2CH2COO-. So, 2-ethylbutanoate would have the structure: CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3)COOEt? No, perhaps it's CH2CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3)COOEt? Wait, wait, maybe it's better to think of the structure.

Butanoate is CH3CH2CH2COO-. So, 2-ethylbutanoate would be CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3)COOEt? No, perhaps it's (CH2)2CHCH2COOEt. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2CH2CH2CH2COOEt, but that's pentanoate. Hmm, maybe I should clarify.

Alternatively, perhaps it's ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate being CH2=CHCOOEt? No, that's acrylate. Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as the ester derived from 2-ethylbutanoic acid. 2-ethylbutanoic acid would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2COOH. So, the ester would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2COOEt.

But regardless, the reaction conditions involve NaH, which is a strong base. So perhaps this is an example of the Claisen condensation or the Aldol reaction, but more likely, it's a Michael addition, given the context.

The other reagent is methyl 2-cyclopentylidene-2-phenylacetate. The structure is a bit complex. Let me think: methyl 2-cyclopentylidene-2-phenylacetate would have an acetyl group (CH2COOCH3), but with a cyclopentylidene group and a phenyl group attached to the same carbon. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
       |
C(cyclopentylidene)(phenyl)

Wait, more accurately, the structure is CH2(CO2Me)(Cyclopentylidene)(Phenyl). So, it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Because the cyclopentylidene group is a cyclic allene, perhaps? Or maybe it's a cyclopentene group attached as a substituent.

Wait, perhaps it's a bicyclic structure. Alternatively, it's an enone, which is a conjugated carbonyl. Wait, methyl 2-cyclopentylidene-2-phenylacetate: the acetate is CH3COO–, but wait no. Wait, acetate is OAc, which is O-CO-OCH3. So, the structure is:

CH2–C(O)OCH3, but the C in CH2 is also connected to a cyclopentylidene group and a phenyl group. So, the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (the alpha carbon) has two substituents: a cyclopentylidene group and a phenyl group. So, the structure is (cyclopentylidene)(phenyl)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but cyclopentylidene would be a cyclopentane ring with a double bond, perhaps. Or, more accurately, it's a cyclopentene substituent. Hmm, maybe it's a cyclopentylidene group, which is a five-membered ring with one double bond, making it a cyclopentene.

So, the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So, methyl 2-cyclopentylidene-2-phenylacetate would have a structure where the alpha carbon (next to the carbonyl) has a cyclopentylidene and a phenyl group attached, and the beta position is a double bond (since it's alpha,beta-unsaturated).

Wait, perhaps it's:

CH2=C(Cyclopentene)(Ph)COOCH3.

No, wait, the correct structure would be: the carbonyl is at C1, and the adjacent (C2) has a cyclopentylidene and a phenyl group, making the structure CH2=C(Cyclopentylidene)(Ph)COOCH3? Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the cyclopentylidene would be a substituent on C2. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like:

Ph–C(Cyclopentene)–CH2–COOCH3, connected via a double bond. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

But the key point is that this is a Michael acceptor. Because the compound is alpha,beta-unsaturated, it can undergo conjugate addition. So, in the presence of a base like NaH, which would deprotonate the alpha hydrogen of the other ester (ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate), forming an enolate.

Wait, ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate: the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2COOEt. Hmm, no, wait, 2-ethylbutanoate would have the structure CH2CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3)COOEt? No, perhaps it's CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3)COOEt. So, the ester is at the end, with the COOEt group, and the alpha carbon (next to the carbonyl) is CH(CH2CH2CH3), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let me think of butanoate as CH3CH2CH2COO-. So, 2-ethylbutanoate would be CH2CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3)COO-. Wait, perhaps it's (CH2)2CH(CH2CH2CH3)COOEt? Hmm, perhaps it's (CH2)CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2COOEt? Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as CH2CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3)COOEt. But perhaps I should move on, as the structure is getting complicated.

So, the reaction is between ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate and methyl 2-cyclopentylidene-2-phenylacetate in the presence of NaH. So, NaH is a strong base, probably deprotonating the alpha position of ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate to form an enolate.

The enolate would then attack the alpha,beta-unsaturated ester (methyl 2-cyclopentylidene-2-phenylacetate) in a Michael addition. So, the enolate's carbon would add to the beta position of the acceptor, forming a new bond.

In this case, the acceptor is methyl 2-cyclopentylidene-2-phenylacetate, which has a structure like Ph-C(Cyclopentene)-CH2-COOCH3, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

So, when the enolate (from ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate) attacks, it would add to the beta position of this acceptor. The product would then have a new substituent from the enolate attached to the acceptor.

Wait, but wait, the enolate is a nucleophile that attacks the electrophilic beta carbon of the acceptor. So, the structure that forms would have the enolate's R group (from ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate) attached at the beta position, and the rest would be connected.

But perhaps the positions are such that the product would have the cyclopentylidene and phenyl groups attached to a new carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the Michael addition here involves the enolate attacking the alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, leading to the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond between the enolate's carbon and the beta position of the acceptor.

So, the product would have the structure where the cyclopentylidene and phenyl groups are attached to a new carbon that's connected to the ethyl ester part.

But looking at the options, option A's B is ethyl 2-ethyl-2-(1-(2-methoxy-2-oxo-1-phenylethyl)cyclopentyl)butanoate. Hmm, that's a bit complicated.

Option B's B is the same as option A's B. Option C and D have different structures for B.

Alternatively, perhaps when the enolate from ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate attacks the acceptor, the cyclopentylidene and phenyl groups are added to the same carbon, leading to a branching.

Wait, perhaps the product's structure would have the cyclopentylidene and phenyl groups attached to the same carbon as the new bond from the enolate.

But I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should think about the possible products.

In the options, the product B is either option A or option B, which have similar structures but different substituents.

Option A: B is ethyl 2-ethyl-2-(1-(2-methoxy-2-oxo-1-phenylethyl)cyclopentyl)butanoate.

Option B: same as A.

Option C and D have different structures for B.

Alternatively, perhaps the product involves the cyclopentylidene ring opening or adding across the double bond. Hmm, but that might be more of a Diels-Alder scenario, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps another approach: when the enolate (from ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate) attacks the alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, the product would have the enolate's R group (from the alpha carbon) attached to the beta carbon of the acceptor.

So, the acceptor is:

Ph–C(=CH2)–COOCH3.

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

Ph–C(R)–CH2–COOCH3, with a double bond between C(R) and CH2.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Ph–C(=CH2)–COOCH3.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's Ph–C(CH2)–CH2–COOCH3, but with a double bond between the C and the next CH2, making it an enone.

So, when the enolate attacks the beta position (the CH2 in CH2–COOCH3), the product would have the substituent from the enolate added to that CH2, and the double bond would shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the product would have the cyclopentene ring attached to the new carbon.

But I'm not entirely confident, so perhaps I should look for a pattern in the options.

Looking at the options, for Reaction B, the products are either:

- ethyl 2-ethyl-2-(1-(2-methoxy-2-oxo-1-phenylethyl)cyclopentyl)butanoate (options A and B)

Or

- 4-ethyl 1-methyl 2-cyclopentyl-3,3-diethyl-2-phenylsuccinate (options C and D)

Wait, the first structure seems to have a cyclopentyl group attached via a methylene group to a phenyl and other substituents, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the product involves the formation of a bicyclic structure or a new ring.

But perhaps another approach: the starting material for B is ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate, which is an ester with an alpha carbon that can form an enolate. The enolate would attack the alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, leading to a new bond.

The product would then have the enolate's R group (from ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate) attached to the acceptor's structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a conjugated dienone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps focusing on the options might help. The options for B involve either an ethyl ester with a more complex substituent or a succinate structure.

Looking at option B, it's ethyl 2-ethyl-2-(1-(2-methoxy-2-oxo-1-phenylethyl)cyclopentyl)butanoate. That seems to suggest that the substituent is a cyclopentyl group attached via a carbon that is substituted with a phenyl and other groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ring formation. For example, the cyclopentylidene group could act as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction, but I think that's a different reaction type.

Wait, but the problem states that both reactions are Michael additions, so the second reaction is also a Michael addition.

In a Michael addition, the nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta carbon of the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound (acceptor), forming a new bond. So, the product would have the enolate's R group added to the beta position, and the carbonyl would remain.

So, in this case, the enolate from ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate would attack the acceptor (methyl 2-cyclopentylidene-2-phenylacetate), adding to the beta carbon. That would form a new carbon-carbon bond between the enolate's carbon and the acceptor's beta carbon.

But the acceptor's structure is a bit complex. Let me think again: methyl 2-cyclopentylidene-2-phenylacetate would have a structure where the alpha carbon (next to the carbonyl) is attached to both a cyclopentylidene group and a phenyl group, and the beta position is a CH2 group connected to the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Ph
|
C(=O)OCH3
|
C(CH2Cyclopentene)

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

CH2=C(Cyclopentene)(Ph)–COOCH3.

No, maybe it's:

Ph–C(=CH–Cyclopentene)–COOCH3.

Hmm, perhaps the structure is more like:

Ph–C(=CH–Cyclopentene)–COOCH3.

So, the alpha,beta-unsaturated ester would have a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons, with substituents on the alpha carbon.

When the enolate (from ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate) attacks the beta carbon, the product would have the R group from the enolate attached to the beta carbon, and the double bond would shift.

So, the structure would be:

Ph–C(O)OCH3
|
C(R)–CH2– 

Wait, perhaps I'm not getting that right. Alternatively, perhaps the product would have the R group attached to the former beta carbon, now a single bond, and the carbonyl would be at the alpha position.

But maybe the product would have the structure where the cyclopentene is attached to a new carbon that's connected to the R group from the enolate.

Alternatively, perhaps the product would have a cyclopentyl group attached via a methylene group to the rest of the structure.

But looking at the options, the product B in option A is ethyl 2-ethyl-2-(1-(2-methoxy-2-oxo-1-phenylethyl)cyclopentyl)butanoate. That seems to suggest that the cyclopentyl group is attached to the same carbon as the substituent that includes a methoxy and oxo group with a phenyl.

Hmm, perhaps the product has a substituent like (cyclopentylmethyl), which is attached to a group that includes a methoxy and oxo (like a ketone) along with a phenyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a result of the enolate adding to the acceptor, which then forms a new ring.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here, so perhaps I should compare the options.

For reaction A, the options differ in the substituent's position (1 or 3). From earlier reasoning, I thought it's at position 3, so option B for A would make sense.

For reaction B, looking at the options, option A and B have the same B product, which is ethyl 2-ethyl-2-(1-(2-methoxy-2-oxo-1-phenylethyl)cyclopentyl)butanoate. Option C and D have a different B.

But considering the starting material for B, which is methyl 2-cyclopentylidene-2-phenylacetate, perhaps the product would have the cyclopentylidene group incorporated into the structure.

Wait, perhaps the product would have a cyclopentane ring attached to the molecule via a methylene group, as the cyclopentylidene (with a double bond) could add to the enolate, leading to ring formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic compound.

But without a clear structure, perhaps it's better to look for another approach. Since I'm more confident about reaction A, let's consider that.

So, for reaction A, the product is option B (methyl 3-(2-((2,4-dimethylphenyl)sulfinyl)ethyl)-2-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylate).

Now, looking at the options, only options B and C have this structure for A. So, the correct options for A are B and C.

Now, looking at the options for B, option B's product is the same as option A's B, which is ethyl 2-ethyl-2-(1-(2-methoxy-2-oxo-1-phenylethyl)cyclopentyl)butanoate.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct product for B is this structure. So, putting it all together, the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about reaction B. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps in reaction B, the methyl 2-cyclopentylidene-2-phenylacetate is the nucleophile, and the ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate is the electrophile, but that seems unlikely because the Michael reaction typically involves enolates as nucleophiles attacking alpha,beta-unsaturated acceptors.

So, ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate would form an enolate, which attacks the acceptor (methyl 2-cyclopentylidene-2-phenylacetate).

The acceptor is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with substituents on the alpha carbon.

So, the enolate from ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate would attack the beta carbon of the acceptor, leading to a new bond.

So, the product would have the substituent from the enolate (R group) attached to the former beta carbon of the acceptor.

The structure of the acceptor is Ph–C(=CH2)–COOCH3, perhaps, and the enolate would attack the CH2 group, leading to a structure where R (from enolate) is attached to that CH2, and the double bond would shift.

So, the product would have R–CH2–C(Ph)(COOCH3)–CH2–.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product would have a new ring formed, incorporating the cyclopentylidene group.

But I'm not confident, so perhaps I should look for the answer in the options.

If Reaction A's product is option B (position 3), then the answer could be option B or C, as they have that structure.

For Reaction B, the correct product is either the ethyl ester with the cyclopentyl group (options A and B) or the succinate (options C and D).

Alternatively, considering the acceptor in reaction B, methyl 2-cyclopentylidene-2-phenylacetate, which has a cyclopentylidene group, perhaps the product after Michael addition would form a new ring.

Wait, perhaps the cyclopentylidene group (a conjugated diene) would allow for a ring expansion or some kind of cyclization, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the enolate adds to the acceptor, and the product is a bicyclic structure where the cyclopentane ring is part of the molecule.

But I'm not making much progress, so perhaps I should conclude that for Reaction A, the correct product is option B's A, and for Reaction B, the correct product is option A/B's B.

Looking at the options, option B has A as option B's structure and B as the ethyl ester structure.

So, the correct answer would be option B.


The Michael reaction involves a nucleophile (typically an enolate) attacking the beta carbon of an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound (acceptor), forming a new carbon-carbon bond. The problem involves two reactions, and the goal is to determine the correct products from the given options.

### Reaction A:
The starting material is **methyl 2-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylate**, which contains a ketone at C2 and an ester at C1. The base (NaOEt) deprotonates the alpha position (C3) relative to the ketone, forming an enolate. This enolate attacks the **2,4-dimethyl-1-(vinylsulfinyl)benzene**, which is an alpha,beta-unsaturated sulfinyl group. The enolate adds to the beta carbon of the vinylsulfinyl group, resulting in the sulfinyl group being attached to C3 of the cyclohexane ring. The product is **methyl 3-(2-((2,4-dimethylphenyl)sulfinyl)ethyl)-2-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylate**, which corresponds to option **B** for Reaction A.

### Reaction B:
The starting material is **ethyl 2-ethylbutanoate**, which can form an enolate at its alpha carbon under the influence of NaH. This enolate attacks the alpha,beta-unsaturated ester **methyl 2-cyclopentylidene-2-phenylacetate**, where the beta carbon is the reactive site. The enolate adds to the beta carbon of the acceptor, incorporating the cyclopentylidene and phenyl groups into the product. The resulting product is **ethyl 2-ethyl-2-(1-(2-methoxy-2-oxo-1-phenylethyl)cyclopentyl)butanoate**, which corresponds to option **A** for Reaction B.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: A = incorrect (position 1 instead of 3 for Reaction A); B = correct.
- **Option B**: A = correct; B = correct.
- **Option C**: A = correct; B = incorrect (succinate structure instead of ethyl ester).
- **Option D**: A = incorrect (position 1 instead of 3 for Reaction A); B = incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it provides the correct products for both reactions.

Answer: B
