Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we have a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh wait, that's the potential for a harmonic oscillator, right? Because the form is like (1/2) m ω² r², which is the potential energy of a spring in Hooke's law. So this is a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, meaning the potential is the same in all directions.

The question is about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. Hmm. I remember that in 3D harmonic oscillators, the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh right, the energy levels are given by E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), but wait, wait, I think the formula might actually be E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Or wait, each direction contributes (n_x + 1/2) ħω, so adding them together gives (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Wait, n_x, n_y, and n_z are the quantum numbers for each direction, right?

But wait, in 3D harmonic oscillators, sometimes people use a total quantum number N, where N = n_x + n_y + n_z. So the energy becomes E = (N + 3/2) ħω. So the energy depends on N.

Now, the third excited state. Wait, the ground state is the lowest energy level. Let's think about the order. The ground state is N=0, then first excited is N=1, second is N=2, third is N=3. So the third excited state would have N=3. Because ground state is N=0 (no excitations), first excited N=1 (one excitation), second N=2, third N=3.

So the energy for N=3 would be E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. Hmm, that's the first part of the answer.

Now,
