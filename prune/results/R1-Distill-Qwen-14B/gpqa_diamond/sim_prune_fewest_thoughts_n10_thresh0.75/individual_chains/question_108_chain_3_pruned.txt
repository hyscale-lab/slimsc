Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian for a system in a magnetic field includes the Zeeman term, which deals with the interaction of the magnetic moment of the electrons with the external magnetic field. Oh wait, the problem mentions the paramagnetic coupling term, which I think is part of the Zeeman effect.

So the setup is a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis. The field strength is 1 Tesla. Also, it's given that m (the orbital magnetic quantum number) is small. Wait, small m—I guess that would mean that the orbital angular momentum isn't too large. But I'm not entirely sure how that plays into this yet.

We need to compare the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (the paramagnetic term) with the transition energy ΔE. The transition energy is given for hydrogen with a wavelength λ=0.4861 μm, which I think is the Balmer series, specifically the H-alpha line. That line corresponds to a transition from n=2 to n=1, but wait, no, wait the Balmer series is n=2 to n=1? Wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. The Balmer series is transitions down to n=2, like from n=3,4,... So the H-alpha line is n=3 to n=2, and the wavelength is about 656 nm. Wait, but the given λ is 0.4861 μm, which is 486 nm, which I think is the Balmer beta line, n=4 to n=2. Or wait, no. Wait, Balmer alpha is 486 nm, right? Because the Balmer series starts at H-alpha (656 nm, n=3→2), H-beta (486 nm, n=4→2), H-gamma (around 434 nm, n=5→2), etc. So this must be the H-beta transition. So the transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between n=4 and n=2 in hydrogen.

So first, I need to calculate the energy of that transition. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by the Rydberg formula: E_n = - (13.6 eV) * (1/n²). So for n=4 and n=2, the energies are:

E4 = -13.6 / (4²) = -13.6 /16 = -0.85 eV

E2 = -13.6 / (2²) = -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV

The transition energy ΔE is E2 - E4 = (-3.4) - (-0.85) = -2.55 eV. But since energy difference is the magnitude, we take 2.55 eV.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, when an electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower one, it emits a photon. So if it goes from n=4 to n=2, the energy emitted is the difference: E4 is higher (less negative) than E2, so ΔE = E2 - E4 would be negative, but the magnitude is 3.4 - 0.85=2.55 eV. So yes, ΔE is 2.55 eV. Or wait, wait, no: E2 is lower than E4? No, actually, as n increases, the energy becomes less negative. So E4 is higher than E2. So when the electron transitions from n=4 to n=2, it emits a photon of energy E4 - E2? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Hydrogen's energy levels are E_n = -13.6 eV * (1/n²). So E_1 = -13.6 eV, E_2 = -3.4 eV, E_3= -1.511 eV, E_4= -0.85 eV, etc. So from n=4 to n=2, the change is E2 - E4: (-3.4) - (-0.85) = -2.55 eV. But the energy of the photon emitted is the absolute value, 2.55 eV. So ΔE is 2.55 eV.

So the paramagnetic coupling term's expectation value ⟨H⟩ is the Zeeman energy shift. The Zeeman Hamiltonian is H_Zeeman = -(μ·B), where μ is the magnetic moment. For an electron, μ = -g_s * μ_B * m_s, where g_s is the Landé g-factor (approximately 2), μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetism is due to the electron's spin, right? So the Zeeman term for spin is H = -μ·B, where μ is the spin magnetic moment. The magnetic moment for spin is given by μ = -g_s (μ_B) m_s. So H = g_s μ_B m_s B.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm mixing orbital and spin contributions. The paramagnetic term refers to the spin part, while the diamagnetic is from the orbital. But the question
