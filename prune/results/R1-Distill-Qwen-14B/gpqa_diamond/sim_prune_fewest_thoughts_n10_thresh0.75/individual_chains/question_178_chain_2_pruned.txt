Okay, so I've got this question about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to break it down.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ_bar σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, where σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

First, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of a coupling constant determines the renormalizability. If the dimension is less than or equal to 4, the interaction is renormalizable. If it's higher, it's not.

So, I need to calculate the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian itself has mass dimension 4 because it's the integrand of the action (which is dimensionless), and integrating over four dimensions (dx^4) gives the Lagrangian dimension 4.

Each term in the Lagrangian should have mass dimension 4 as well, right? So for L_int = κ ψ_bar σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, each part must add up to 4.

Let me list out each field's mass dimension. I think ψ (the Dirac spinor) has dimension 3/2. The field strength tensor F has dimension 2, since it's like the derivative of the gauge field, which has dimension 1. So each F is ∂A, which is [∂][A] → [mass]^1 * [mass]^1 → mass^2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, dimension of A is 1 for electromagnetism. So F = ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so F has dimension [∂][A] = 1 + 1 = 2. Ok, so F^{μν} has dimension 2.

Now σ_{μν} is made from the gamma matrices. Since γ matrices are dimensionless (they are just matrices), the commutator [γ_μ, γ_ν] is also dimensionless. So σ is dimensionless. So [σ] = 0.

So now, the term ψ_bar σ_{μν} ψ. Each ψ is 3/2. So ψ_bar is (3/2), multiplied by σ (0) and ψ (3/2). So the product of ψ_bar and ψ is (3/2 + 3/2) = 3. Then, multiply by σ (0) → still 3.

So the term ψ_bar σ ψ has dimension 3. Then we multiply by F^{μν}, which is dimension 2. So the whole term is 3 + 2 = 5? Wait, that can't be right because the entire Lagrangian term must have dimension 4.

Wait, that can't be. So L_int has dimension 4, right. So L_int = κ (ψ_bar σ ψ F) → dimension of each part?

Wait, wait. Let me recheck. L_int term is κ multiplied by (ψ_bar σ ψ F). So each part:

ψ_bar: 3/2
σ: 0
ψ: 3/2
F: 2

So the product (ψ_bar σ ψ F) has dimension (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5.

But the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So κ must have a dimension that brings this down to 4. So κ must have dimension 4 -5 = -1. Because (κ) * (5) =4 → κ has dimension -1.

Wait that makes sense. So [κ]_M = -1.

Now, the question of renormalizability. The rule I remember is that a term is renormalizable if the coupling constant's mass dimension is ≥ 0. Because in the Fey
