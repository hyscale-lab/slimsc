Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the question is about three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But maybe that's not super important for solving this problem. 

The problem gives me the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures, their mass ratios, and asks about the ratio of their orbital periods. Oh, and all have the same albedo of 0.3, like Earth. So I can probably ignore albedo since it's the same for all.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Temperature ratios:
  - T_eq(Planet1) / T_eq(Planet2) ≈ 1.4
  - T_eq(Planet2) / T_eq(Planet3) ≈ 2.3

Wait, maybe I should write it as T1/T2 = 1.4, and T2/T3 = 2.3. So, T1 = 1.4 T2, and T2 = 2.3 T3. So T1 = 1.4 * 2.3 T3 = 3.22 T3. Hmm, but maybe I don't need to find the exact temperatures, but more about the relation between their orbital periods.

Mass ratios:
- M1/M2 ≈ 1.15
- M2/M3 ≈ 1.35

So M1 = 1.15 M2, and M2 = 1.35 M3. So M1 = 1.15 * 1.35 M3 = approx 1.5525 M3. Not sure if I'll need this for period.

The question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. Specifically, by what factor is Planet3's period larger than Planet1's. So we're looking for Period3 / Period1
