Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

Wait, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. Oh, but the state is given as a specific column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So this is the state vector ψ. And the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the basis is the standard basis for P_z's eigenstates.

First, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩. Since the state is given, I can compute the expectation value by taking the conjugate transpose of ψ, multiplying by P_z, then multiplying by ψ. Alternatively, since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, maybe it's easier to express ψ in terms of these basis vectors and find the coefficients, then compute the expectation value.

Wait, but actually, the state is already given in the P_z eigenbasis. Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So each component in ψ corresponds to the amplitude of each eigenstate.

Looking at P_z's matrix:

The matrix is diagonal since it's given in the eigenbasis. So P_z is diag(ħ, 0, -ħ).

So the state ψ is a column vector [a, b, c], where a=-1/2, b=1/√2, c=-1/2.

The expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is computed as ψ† P_z ψ. But since it's diagonal, it's just the sum of the squares of the amplitudes multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So:

⟨P_z⟩ = |a|² * (ħ) + |b|² * 0 + |c|² * (-ħ)

Let me compute each part. 

a is -1/2, so |a|² is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So the first term is (1/4) * ħ.
