Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Alright, I remember a bit about special relativity from my studies, so let me think this through.

The problem says there are two astronauts. One has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, and the other has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, so the first thing I'm thinking is, when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, I can't just subtract the speeds normally because of relativity. Oh right! I remember the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. Oh, wait, no, the formula is for when they're moving relative to each other or in opposite directions. Wait, no, actually, the formula I just mentioned is for when you have two velocities u and v in the same frame, and you want to find the velocity of one as seen from the other's frame.

But wait, the question is about the relative speed, which would be the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame. So for example, the relative speed of astronaut 2 as seen from astronaut 1's frame, or vice versa. So I need to calculate that.

Let me assign the velocities. Let’s say astronaut A has mass 2m and is moving at u = 0.6c. Astronaut B has mass 3m and is moving at v = 0.5c. Both in the same direction, so from the perspective of the lab frame, they are moving in the positive x.

But when considering the relative speed, I think I need to compute the velocity of B as observed from A’s frame. So the formula is:

u' = (v - u) / (1 - (u*v)/(c²)).

Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second, no. Let me think again. No, wait, the formula for the velocity of an object in one frame as observed from another frame is given by the velocity addition formula. Suppose in the lab frame, A is moving at u = 0.6c, and B is moving at v = 0.5c in the same direction. To find the velocity of B as seen from A's frame, which is moving at u = 0.6c relative to the lab frame.

So the formula for the relative velocity is (v - u) / (1 - (v u)/(c²)). Wait, no, I think I have it backwards. Wait, when you switch frames, the velocity in the new frame is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)). So if the lab frame is S, and frame S' is moving at velocity u relative to S, then an object moving at v in S will appear to move at u' = (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)) in S
