Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is asking me to determine the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but I think I can break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I need to figure out the moles of H+ and OH- ions in each solution and see how they react when combined.

CH3COOH is acetic acid, a weak acid. HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will also completely dissociate into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. 

Let me start by calculating the moles of each component.

For the acetic acid (CH3COOH):
Molarity = 0.1 M, volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L. Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, it doesn't fully dissociate, but I'll note that for later.

For HCl:
Molarity = 0.2 M, volume = 400 mL = 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it contributes 0.08 moles of H+ ions.

For Ba(OH)2:
Molarity = 0.3 M, volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So OH- moles = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, when these are mixed together, the total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L. But more importantly, the H+ from the acids will react with OH- from the base.

Wait, I should think about the neutralization reaction. H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so its H+ isn't as available. Hmm, but when mixed with a strong base, maybe the OH- will first neutralize the stronger acid's H+ before neutralizing the weaker acid. Or wait, no, the OH- is a strong base, so it will react with all available H+.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-.

Let me get the total H+:

From HCl: 0.08 moles H+.

From CH3COOH: it's a weak acid, so initially, it provides some H+. But when OH- is present, it will react. So perhaps I should first consider the neutralization of these H+ ions with the OH-.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate the total H+ and OH- in the solution, regardless of the source, and see which one is in excess. Because when you mix them, the H+ and OH- will react to form water.

Total H+:
CH3COOH contributes some H+. But since it's weak, perhaps it's better to first consider the strong acid HCl's H+ and then see how much OH- is in the solution.

Wait, maybe I should calculate all H+ and OH- first.

Wait, strong acids and bases completely dissociate, so:

HCl → H+
