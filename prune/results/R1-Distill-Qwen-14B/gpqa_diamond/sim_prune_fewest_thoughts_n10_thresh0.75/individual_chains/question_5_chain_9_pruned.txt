Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is asking for the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're interested in is +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar factor when an operator is applied. So, applying P to this eigenvector should just give back (plus some scalar) the same vector.

The problem gives me the components of the operator P in terms of 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Specifically, the X, Y, and Z components are provided. Let me write them down:

- P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
- P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
- P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, so the operator P we're considering is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh right, so the direction is some vector in the x-z plane. So, n would be something like (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Because in spherical coordinates, the x and z components are determined by θ, with φ (the azimuthal angle) being zero since it's entirely in the x-z plane.

The operator P is given as a vector operator, so the operator along direction n would be the sum of its components multiplied by the respective unit vectors. So, P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n lies in the x-z plane, the y-component of n (n_y) is zero. Therefore, P becomes P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Let me write out what n_x and n_z are. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, right? Because the unit vector in the x-z plane is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So, substituting these into the operator:

P = (sinθ)(P_x) + (cosθ)(P_z)

Now, substituting the given matrices:

P = (sinθ) * (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] + (cosθ) * (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Let me compute this matrix multiplication. Let's break it down into each component.

First, the (sinθ)(ħ/2) term:

That's (ħ/2) * sinθ multiplied by the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the matrix becomes:
[ [0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

The second term is (cosθ)(ħ/2) multiplied by [[1,0],[0,-1]], which gives:
[ [cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ] ] multiplied by ħ/2.
