Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me take it step by step. The question involves a series of reactions starting from Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, wait, C3H6 is propene because propane would be C3H8. So propene is an alkene.

First reaction: Compound A undergoes bromination in CCl4. Bromination of alkenes typically is an addition reaction. Propene (CH2=CH2CH3) adding bromine would form 1,2-dibromopropane? Wait, no, wait. Propene has the double bond between C1 and C2. Adding bromine would add across the double bond. So the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane. But wait, wait another thought—bromination in presence of CCl4 is a typical addition, not substitution, right? Because for substitution you usually need a polar aprotic solvent or something else. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCH2BrCH3? Wait wait, wait. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3; adding Br2 would add across the double bond, so it becomes CH2BrCHBrCH3. Oh, because the structure is CH2-CH2CH3, so adding Br across the double bond would give CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So that's compound B.

Next reaction: Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. That's probably an elimination reaction. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good condition for elimination. So when 1,2-dibromopropane reacts with KOH, it should undergo dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but 1,2-dibromopropane has two adjacent bromines. Eliminating two HBr molecules, perhaps. So the reaction would form propene again, but wait, that's a possibility. Wait, let me think: when you have vicinal dihalide (two adjacent halogens), treating with base can lead to elimination, forming a double bond. So the product C would be propene (CH2=CH2CH3) again. Or maybe an alkyne, but more likely an alkene. So C is propene.

Then, passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube. Hmm. Red-hot iron with an alkene—common reactions. Oh, that's the process for dehydrohalogenation, but wait
