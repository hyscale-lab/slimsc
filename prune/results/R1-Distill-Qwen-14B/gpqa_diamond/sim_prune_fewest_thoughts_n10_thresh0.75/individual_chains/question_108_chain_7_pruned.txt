Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I need to figure out the right approach. Let me read the question again.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. The setup is a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, with small m values and B=1 T. The transition energy has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers.

Hmm, I remember that paramagnetic coupling is related to the Zeeman effect, right? The Zeeman effect is the splitting of atomic energy levels in a magnetic field. The paramagnetic coupling term probably refers to the energy shift due to this effect.

Wait, the transition energy ΔE is given by the wavelength λ. Oh right, the energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. So I can calculate ΔE using that formula.

Let me jot down the numbers. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1e-9 meters. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s.

So ΔE = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9). Let me compute that.

First, compute the numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Then, the denominator is 486.1e-9 m, so when I divide, I get (1.9878e-25) / (486.1e-9) = approximately 4.088e-18 J. Wait, that seems low. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 486.1e-9 meters is 4.861e-7 meters. Oh no, wait, 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1 nanometers, so 486.1e-9 meters, right. So the denominator is 4.861e-7 m. So:

ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (4.861e-7) 

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide: 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = (1.9878 / 4.861) * 1e-18 ≈ 0.4089e-18 J, right?

Wait, 0.4089e-18 is 4.089e-19 J. That's about 4.09e-19 Joules. Hmm, but wait, I might have messed up the exponents. Let me re-calculate:

Wait, 3e8 is 3 * 1e8 m/s. 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 6.626 *3 = 19.878, times 1e-34+8= 1e-26. So 19.878e-26 J·m. Then divide by 4.861e-7 m.

So 19.878e-26 / 4.861e-7 = (19.878 / 4.861) * 1e-19.

19.878 / 4.861 is approximately 4.088. So 4.088e-19 J.

But wait, wait, 19.878e-26 is 1.9878e-25? No
