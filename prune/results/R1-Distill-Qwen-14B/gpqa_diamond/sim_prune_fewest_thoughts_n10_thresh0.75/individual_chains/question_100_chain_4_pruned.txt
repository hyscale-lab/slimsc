Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem involves several reactions starting with Compound A, which has the formula C3H6. I remember that C3H6 could be either propene or cyclopropane, but more likely propene since that's more common in such reaction sequences. But wait, cyclopropane can also undergo similar reactions. Hmm, I'll have to think about that.

So, the first reaction: Compound A undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Oh right, that's a typical bromination using Br2 in CCl4, which is a non-polar solvent. For alkenes, bromination (like an addition reaction) occurs. If A is propene, then bromination would add Br2 across the double bond. So propene (CH2=CHCH3) reacting with Br2 would form 1,2-dibromopropane? Wait, no, wait. Wait, when bromine adds to propene, it's a diaddition. So the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3). But wait, is there another possibility? If the starting material is cyclopropane, then bromination would substitute a hydrogen with Br, but I think cyclopropane's more likely to react via ring-opening, but maybe that's more for other conditions. I think A is propene.

Next, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a base and a good nucleophile. For vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens), treating with alcoholic KOH leads to an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. So B, which is 1,2-dibromopropane, when treated with KOH (alcohol) would eliminate HBr twice and form propene again? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane when treated with KOH would eliminate both Br atoms. So the elimination would produce an alkene. The structure would be CH2=CHCH3, which is propene again, so compound C is propene.

Then, passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube. Oh, that sounds familiar. Red-hot iron in the presence of hydrocarbons can cause dehydrogenation, but wait, propene doesn't have any
