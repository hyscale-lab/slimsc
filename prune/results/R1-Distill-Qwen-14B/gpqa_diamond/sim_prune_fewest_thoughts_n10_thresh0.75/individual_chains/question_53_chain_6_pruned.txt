Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. Di-substituted means there are two substituents attached to the benzene ring. The FTIR shows an ester group, so that means there's an OCOOR group somewhere in the molecule. Ester groups usually show strong absorption around 1740-1710 cm⁻¹ in IR, so that's a clue.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: six signals in total. Let me break them down. 

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Wait, benzene is usually symmetric, but with substituents, the symmetry changes. Di-substituted benzene can have different substitution patterns. If it's para, the aromatic protons would split into two sets: two Hs each. But wait, wait, no. Oh, wait, in para substitution, each substituent is opposite each other. For example, in para-dimethylbenzene, the aromatic Hs are all equivalent, so only one peak. But if it's ortho or meta, the symmetry is different.

Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for aromatic-H. So, perhaps the compound has two different sets of aromatic protons. Maybe the substituents are in such positions that the ring has some symmetry but not complete. For example, if the substituents are para, but each substituent is different. Or maybe it's ortho substitution. Wait, if it's a di-substituted ring with substituents in para positions, the aromatic Hs might be in two sets, each with two Hs. So, that would give two signals for aromatic protons.

2. Two signals for vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are on a double bond, so maybe there's an alkene group attached to the benzene ring. The fact that there are two signals suggests different environments. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm. Maybe the alkene is part of an ester group. Wait, ester groups are OCOOR, so the R could be an aryl group or an alkenyl group. Or maybe the substituent includes an ester and another group with a double bond.

Wait, the substituents on the benzene ring: since it's di-substituted, each substituent could be an ester group? Or maybe one substituent is an ester and the other is something else, like a vinyl group. Or perhaps the ester is part of a substituent that includes a vinyl group.

Wait, another thought: the ester group is probably one substituent, and the other substituent might have a double bond, perhaps as part of a vinyl group.

Wait, but the NMR has two vinyl-H signals. Let's think: if the substituent has a vinyl group, like a CH₂CH₂ group attached, but maybe it's actually a CH₂CH₃ group, but that wouldn't have vinyl
