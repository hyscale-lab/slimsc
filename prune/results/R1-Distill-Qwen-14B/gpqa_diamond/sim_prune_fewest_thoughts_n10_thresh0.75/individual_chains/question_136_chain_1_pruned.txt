Okay, so I have this vector calculus problem in front of me. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. The vector field f(r) falls off as 1/r² radially. So, it only has a radial component, right?

Wait, I remember that divergence in spherical coordinates has a specific formula. For a vector field that only has a radial component, the divergence is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² A_r), where A_r is the radial component. In this case, the field is f(r) = 1/r² in the radial direction. So A_r = 1/r².

Let me compute the divergence then. So, ∇ · f = (1/r²) * d/dr (r² * (1/r²)). Let's see, r² times 1/r² is 1. The derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So the divergence is zero everywhere except perhaps at the origin.

Wait, but wait a second. If the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, then the integral of the divergence over the volume would be zero, right? Because the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe a point, which in three dimensions has measure zero. So the integral should be zero?

But I'm a bit confused because I remember something about the divergence theorem. The divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the surface integral of the vector field over the boundary. Let me recall: ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV = ∫∫ f · dA over the surface.

In this case, our volume is a sphere of radius R. So the surface integral would be f · dA. Since f is radial, dA is also radial, so the dot product is f * dA * cos(theta), but theta is zero here because they are in the same direction. So it's just f times dA.

Wait, f at the surface of radius R is 1/R² in the radial direction. The surface area of a sphere is 4 π R². So the surface integral becomes (1/R²) * 4 π R² = 4 π. According to the divergence theorem, that equals the volume integral of the divergence. But wait, earlier I thought the divergence is zero everywhere except the origin. That's a contradiction.

Oh! Because the divergence is
