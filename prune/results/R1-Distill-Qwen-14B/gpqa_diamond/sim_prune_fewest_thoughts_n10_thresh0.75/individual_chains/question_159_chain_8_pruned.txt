Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about quasars and comoving distance. Hmm, let me think. The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at about 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops at shorter wavelengths. I remember that in quasars, emission lines are broad, but I'm not sure how that connects here.

Wait, maybe the peak is related to the Lyman-alpha emission line? Oh wait, the Lyman-alpha line is at about 121 nm in the ultraviolet. But in this case, the peak is at 790 nm, which is in the near-infrared. So if the observed wavelength is longer than the rest wavelength, that must mean redshift. So redshift would cause the wavelength to stretch.

Right, the rest wavelength for Lyman-alpha is around 121.6 nm. If the observed is 790 nm, then the redshift z can be found by (observed / rest) - 1. Let me calculate that. 790 / 121.6 is approximately 6.499, so z is about 5.499. Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check. 121.6 * (1 + z) = 790. So 1 + z = 790 / 121.6 ≈ 6.499. So z ≈ 5.499, so about 5.5.

But wait, wait—am I sure that the emission line in question is Lyman-alpha? Because if the peak is in the near-infrared, maybe it's another line. Alternatively, maybe it's the Lyman-alpha forest, but no, that's more about absorption lines in quasar spectra. Alternatively, maybe it's the Lyman series emission lines. But the peak here is in the observed spectrum, so perhaps the emission line is from a different series. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's the Balmer series—like hydrogen's Balmer-alpha line. The rest wavelength of H-alpha is about 656 nm. But 790 is longer than that. So if observed is longer, that means higher redshift. Let me compute for H-alpha.

If observed is 790 nm, rest is 656.33 nm. Then (
