Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants relate to how stable a complex is. The higher the constant, the more the complex tends to form.

So the question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The solution has Co(II) and thiocyanate ions. The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) are given for complexes up to β4=16.

Wait, the complexes are probably Co(SCN)n^2- where n is 1,2,3,4. The blue ones are dithiocyanato, which I think is [Co(SCN)2]^2- or maybe another form. I need to figure out which n corresponds to the blue complex.

Stability constants, β, are for each step. So β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)2, etc. Or wait, maybe βn is the overall constant for the complex with n SCN- ions. So β1 = 9 is for [CoSCN]^2+? Or perhaps each β is for the nth step. I might need to clarify that.

Wait, the problem says stability constants of the complexes. So each β is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ions. For example, β1 is the formation constant for Co(SCN)1^2+? Or does β1 represent the first step: Co^2+ + SCN^- → CoSCN^+? Hmm, I think the overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ is the product of β1 through βn. Or maybe each βn is the formation constant for the nth ligand.

Wait, no, I think the stability constant for the complex with n ligands is the product of the stepwise formation constants. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^2+, the overall β is β1 * β2 * ... * βn. But wait, the way the problem presents the β's is for each complex, so perhaps β1 is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, and so on. Or maybe it's the overall constant for each step.

Alternatively, the problem could
