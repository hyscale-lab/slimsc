Okay, so I need to solve this chemistry problem. Let's read through it carefully and try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through step by step.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with another element Y. There are five of them. So, Y is probably a common element that forms multiple fluorides. Let's think, elements with multiple fluoride ions... like maybe chlorine? Because chlorine can form ClF, ClF3, ClF5, etc. Or perhaps it's oxygen? No, oxygen's fluorides are limited. Maybe sulfur? Wait, no, sulfur forms SF4 and SF6, but that's two. Hmm. Maybe it's nitrogen? No, nitrogen usually forms NF3 and maybe others, but I'm not sure about five.

Wait, what about carbon? Carbon can form CF4, but that's just one. Hmm. Wait, perhaps it's phosphorus? Oh, phosphorus has several fluorides. Or maybe it's another halogen, like bromine or iodine. Iodine can form IF5, IF3, and maybe others. Wait, five binary compounds. Let me think: for example, Cl has ClF, ClF3, ClF5, ClF7? Wait, I'm not sure about that. Or perhaps it's another element.

Wait, the problem says five binary compounds. Let's think about elements that have multiple possible fluorides. For example, sulfur has SF4 and SF6. Chlorine has ClF, ClF3, ClF5, maybe more? I think Cl has ClF, ClF3, ClF5, and perhaps others? Or maybe it's another element.

Wait, another approach: looking at the reactions. The bright-red substance A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine. So, A1 â†’ A2 + F2. And A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is unreactive, but maybe A1 is a strong oxidizer. Fluorine is a strong oxidizer, but A1 is a binary compound.

Wait, when A1 decomposes, it releases fluorine. So A1 might be a diatomic fluoride, but when it decomposes, it produces another fluoride and F2. Hmm, maybe A1 is a compound that breaks down into a simpler fluoride and F2. For example, ClF3 decomposes into ClF and F2? Not sure. Or maybe Cl
