Okay, so I've got this problem here about partition functions for a system of three spins. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll do my best.

The system consists of three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So, first, I need to figure out all possible states of the system and their corresponding energies.

Each spin can be either +1 or -1, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list them all. I'll denote each state as (S1, S2, S3).

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now, for each state, I need to compute the value of E.

The energy formula is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me compute each term S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 for each state.

Let's go through each state:

1. State (+1,+1,+1):
S1S2 = 1*1 = 1
S1S3 = 1*1 = 1
S2S3 = 1*1 = 1
Sum = 3
E = -J * 3 = -3J

2. State (+1,+1,-1):
S1S2 = 1*1=1
S1S3=1*(-1)=-1
S2S3=1*(-1)=-1
Sum=1-1-1= -1
E= -J*(-1)= J

Wait, wait. Wait, the sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1, so E is -J * (-1) = J.

3. State (+1,-1,+1):
S1S2=1*(-1)=-1
S1S3=1*1=1
S2S3=(-1)*1= -1
Sum: -1 +1 -1 =-1
E= -J*(-1)= J

4. State (+1,-1,-1):
S1S2=1*(-1)=-1
S1S3=1*(-1)=-1
S2S3=(-1)*(-1)=1
Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1
E= -J*(-1)= J

5. State (-1,+1,+1):
S1S2=(-1)*1= -1
