Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember that the index of refraction affects the speed of light. The formula for speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, right? But wait, that's when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. But here, the medium is moving, so I think we need to consider relativistic effects or maybe just a simple velocity addition.

Wait, maybe it's a matter of adding the velocities. Because the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So, the light's speed in the glass is v_light = c/n (because speed in medium is c/n), but then the glass is moving at velocity v. So how does that affect the observed speed?

If the medium is moving in the same direction as the light, then the observer sees the light's speed as the sum? Wait, but that can't be right because in relativity, velocities don't just add linearly, but maybe for this problem, they're using a non-relativistic approach. Hmm.

Wait, no. Wait a minute, the speed of light is always c in a vacuum, but when it's in a medium, it's different. But when the medium is moving, does that affect the speed of light as observed?

Wait, let's think about it in the lab frame. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. Inside the glass, the light is moving at v_light = c/n. But the glass is moving at v in the same direction as the light.

So, relative to the lab, what's the speed? Hmm, when two objects are moving in the same direction, their relative speed is the difference of their individual speeds. But wait, the light is moving through the glass, which itself is moving.

Wait, perhaps we should look at it from the perspective of the glass. In the glass frame, the light is moving at v_light = c/n towards the observer. But the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So, the lab frame would see the light's speed as v_light + v? No, wait, because the glass is moving in the same direction as the light. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the light is propagating through the glass, which is moving towards the observer. Let me imagine this setup: the glass is moving towards the observer, so from the lab's point of view, the glass is moving at v towards the observer. The light is moving through the glass, which is also moving towards the observer. So the light's velocity in the lab frame would be the sum of the light's velocity in the glass and the glass's velocity?

Wait, but that might not be correct because the light's speed in the glass is already a vector quantity. Let me think in terms of velocities in the lab frame. The glass is moving at velocity v (towards the observer, so maybe positive). The light inside the glass is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the velocity of the light in the lab frame would be the velocity of the light in the glass plus the velocity of the glass.

But wait, velocity addition in relativity is more complicated, but maybe this problem is assuming non-relativistic velocities. But the speed of light in the medium is c/n, which is less than c. But adding it to v might not work because v could be a significant fraction of c, but the problem says the speed of light in vacuum is c=1, so perhaps they expect us to use a relativistic approach.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. If the medium (glass) is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, and inside the medium, light moves at v_light = c/n, then what's the observed speed in the lab?

I think the formula for velocity addition in special relativity is (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²), where u' is the velocity of the object in the medium's frame. Wait, but that's when the medium is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So light's speed in the medium is u' = c/n. So then, the observed speed u would be [ (c/n) + v ] / [1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ].

Simplify denominator: 1 + v/(n c).

So u = (c/n + v) / [1 + v/(n c)].

But since c=1, that simplifies to ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + v/(n) ).

Hmm, that's the same as ( (1 + n v) ) / (n + v ), because numerator: (1 + n v)/n, denominator: (n + v)/n. So the (1/n) cancels out, giving (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Wait, wait, let me recheck:

Numerator: (1/n + v) → same as (1 + n v)/n.

Denominator: 1 + [v/(n*1)] → (n + v)/n.

So the entire expression becomes [ (1 + n v)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ] → (1 + n v)/(n + v).

So that's option A) (1 +n v)/(n +v).

Wait, but wait a second. The glass is moving towards the observer. So if the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, but the light is inside the glass, which is moving towards the observer, then perhaps the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. Or is it the opposite?

Wait, the problem states that the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the lab frame sees the glass moving towards the observer (so direction is towards), and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's movement.

Wait, but the light is inside the glass. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n in the same direction as the glass's movement. So when we transform to the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass, the observed velocity would be higher.

Wait, but earlier, applying the velocity addition formula gave us (1 + n v)/(n + v). Let me check the options. Option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v), which matches this.

But wait, another thought: the problem is about the speed of light in the glass, as observed in the lab. The speed of light in the glass is c/n, but since the glass is moving, perhaps the observed speed is just the speed of light in the medium plus the speed of the medium. But that would be (c/n) + v.

But that's only correct in the non-relativistic case, but if the velocities are significant compared to c, that's not accurate. But the problem might be expecting a simple velocity addition.

Wait, but the options given don't include that. Let me see the options again.

Options:
A) (1+nv)/(n + v)
B) 1
C) (1+nv)/(n -v)
D)(1- nv)/(n +v)

Wait, if we take the velocity addition formula for small v, let's see what happens. Let's expand the relativistic formula when v is much smaller than c (so c=1, so v << 1).

u ≈ (u' + v) [since denominator 1 + u'v ≈1]

So u ≈ (1/n + v).

But wait, that's not one of the options. However, when we do the exact calculation, we get option A.

But wait, when the glass moves towards the observer (v is positive), and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the light's speed in the lab would be higher than (1/n + v), but according to the options, option A is (1+nv)/(n +v). Let's compute this when v is small.

(1 + n v)/(n + v) ≈ [1 +n v ] / [n (1 + v/(n)) ] → (1/(n)) [ (1 +n v) / (1 + v/n) ].

Approximate denominator as 1 + v/n ≈ 1 - v/n when v <<n.

Wait, no. Wait, 1/(1 + x) ≈ 1 -x when x is small.

So denominator is (1 + v/n) → 1/(1 + v/n) ≈ 1 - v/n.

So [ (1 +n v) ] * (1 - v/n ) → (1)(1) + (n v)(1) + (1)(-v/n) + (n v)(-v/n) ) → 1 + n v - v/n - v².

Hmm, but I'm not sure about the approximation here. Alternatively, perhaps for small v, option A reduces to (1/n + v).

Wait, let's compute (1 + n v)/(n +v) when v is small.

Factor numerator and denominator: (1 + n v) = 1 (1 + n v).

Denominator: n(1 + v/n) → n [1 + (v/n) ]

So (1 +n v)/(n (1 + v/n )) ) → [ (1/n) (1 + n v) ] / (1 + v/n )

Which is (1/n) * [ (1 + n v) / (1 + v/n) ) ]

Let me expand numerator and denominator as series:

(1 + a) ≈ 1 + a - a² for small a.

So (1 +n v) ≈ 1 +n v.

Denominator 1 + v/n → 1 + (v/n) - (v/n)^2.

So [ (1 +n v) ] / [1 + (v/n) ] ≈ (1 +n v) [1 - (v/n) + (v/n)^2 ) ]

Multiply out:

= 1*(1) + 1*(-v/n) + 1*(v^2/n² ) + n v*(1) + n v*(-v/n) + n v*(v^2/n^2) )

Simplify each term:

1 - v/n + v²/n² + n v - v² + v^3/(n^2)

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let's collect the terms up to first order in v.

The dominant terms are 1 + n v - v/n.

So (1 +n v)/(n +v) ≈ 1/n [1 +n v - v/n + ... ] → (1/n) [1 + (n v - v/n) ]

= (1/n) + (n v - v/n ) /n.

Wait, not sure if I'm getting this right. Alternatively, perhaps I should just accept that the correct approach is using relativistic velocity addition, leading to option A.

But looking at the options, option B is 1, which is the speed of light in a vacuum. But the light is in a medium, so unless the medium's movement somehow brings the speed back to c, which seems unlikely, option B is probably incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the speed of light in the medium as measured in the lab, not considering the medium's motion. Wait, no, because the medium is moving, so its motion would affect the observed speed.

Wait, another approach: if the medium is moving, then the speed of light in the medium as observed in the lab is c/n plus the velocity of the medium. But that would be (c/n + v). But that's only valid in non-relativistic cases.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the speed of light in vacuum is c=1. So the speed in the glass is 1/n. If the glass is moving at speed v in the same direction as the light, then the observed speed in the lab would be (1/n + v). But this isn't one of the options. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v). Let me compute that when v is zero: (1 +0)/(n +0) )= 1/n, which is correct because when the medium is at rest, the speed is 1/n. So that's correct.

If v approaches zero, then option A becomes (1)/(n), which is correct. So that's a good sign.

Another test: if v is zero, option A gives 1/n, which is correct; option B gives 1, which is incorrect because it's a medium, not vacuum.

Option C: (1 +n v)/(n -v). If v is positive and small, denominator is n -v, which would be less than n. So (1 +n v)/(n (1 - v/n )) → (1/n) (1 +n v) (1 + v/n) ≈ (1/n)(1 +n v + v/n + ... ) → 1/n + v + 1/(n²) v + ... which doesn't match the expected (1/n + v).

Option D: (1 -n v)/(n +v). For small v, it's (1 –n v)/n → 1/n – v, which would imply the light's speed is less than 1/n when the medium is moving in the same direction, which doesn't make sense because the medium's motion should add to the light's speed.

Hmm, so only option A gives the correct behavior when v is zero and when v is small.

Wait, but wait, another thought: in the lab frame, the medium is moving. The light's speed in the medium is c/n. So the lab frame measures the light's speed as c/n plus the medium's speed, but that would only be a valid approximation for small velocities.

But according to the relativistic velocity addition, the correct formula is (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c² ), where u' is the speed in the medium's frame. Here, u' = c/n = 1/n, and v is the medium's speed relative to the lab.

So substituting into the formula:

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / [1 + ( (1/n) v ) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by n to simplify:

u = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Which is exactly option A. So the correct answer should be option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic velocity addition. The light beam propagates through the glass, which has an index of refraction \( n \), and the glass itself is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light and toward the observer. 

In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is \( u' = \frac{c}{n} = \frac{1}{n} \), since the speed of light in a medium is reduced by the refractive index. To find the speed of light in the laboratory frame, we apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \). Substituting these values, the formula becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{1}{n} v}{1}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \) to eliminate fractions:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. To confirm, we test the behavior of the formula in special cases:

1. **When \( v = 0 \):** The glass is stationary, and the speed of light in the glass is \( \frac{1}{n} \), which matches the result of option A.
2. **When \( v \to 0 \):** The formula reduces to \( \frac{1}{n} \), consistent with the non-relativistic case.
3. **When \( v \neq 0 \):** The formula accounts for relativistic effects, ensuring the speed of light remains consistent with physical principles.

Other options fail these tests. For example:
- Option B (\( 1 \)) incorrectly assumes the speed of light is always \( c \) in the lab frame, ignoring the medium's refractive index.
- Option C (\( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \)) and Option D (\( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \)) do not reduce to the correct speed of light in the glass when \( v = 0 \) or \( v \to 0 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
