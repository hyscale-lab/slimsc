Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, let's visualize that structure. It's a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (so a CH2OH attached), and at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like CH2-C(CH2)=CH2? Or maybe it's CH2-CH2-C(=CH2)? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C(=CH2)-CH2? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3, so the substituent would be the group attached at the 2nd carbon. So prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(=CH2)-, but wait, that might not be right. Let me think: prop-1-en-2-yl is actually CH2CH2 attached to the double bond. No, wait, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. So the substituent would be CH2-CH2 with a double bond to another CH2? Maybe I'm confusing the numbering. Prop-1-en-2-yl group would be CH2=CH-CH2-, but attached to the cyclohexane at the middle carbon (position 2), right? Wait, no, the substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, which is CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond at 1-2. So it's CH₂=CH-CH₂- attached to the cyclohexane at the central carbon? Or maybe it's CH₂-C(=CH₂)-... Wait, perhaps it's the same as isopropenyl. Let me think. Prop-1-en-2-yl would have the structure CH₂=CHCH₂–, but the substituent is attached to the middle carbon. So yes, the substituent is CH₂-C(=CH₂)-
