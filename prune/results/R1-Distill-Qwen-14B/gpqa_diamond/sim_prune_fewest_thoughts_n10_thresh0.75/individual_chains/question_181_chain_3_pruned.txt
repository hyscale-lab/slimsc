Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when the pp-III branch stops. Hmm, I need to find the ratio of the flux between two energy bands. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should recall what the pp-III branch is. Oh right, the proton-proton chain is the main way the Sun produces energy. The pp-I branch is the initial part where protons fuse into deuterons, then tritium, and so on. The pp-II and pp-III are later stages, but I'm not exactly sure about the specifics. Oh wait, the pp-III branch involves the fusion of helium-3 nuclei. So each He-3 nucleus is made of two protons and one neutron. When two He-3s fuse, they form He-4 and two protons.

Wait, but how does this relate to neutrinos? Oh, right! The pp-III branch produces neutrons, which then decay into protons and emit neutrinos. So, the neutrinos from this process are part of the solar neutrino flux that reaches Earth.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stops. So, that means the production of neutrinos from that process ceases. But all other reactions remain the same. So, other neutrino sources, like the pp-I and pp-II branches, or maybe the CNO cycle, are still active. Wait, but wait: in the Sun's core, the dominant process is the proton-proton chain, and the CNO cycle is more prominent in higher-mass stars, I think. So perhaps the CNO contribution is minimal in the Sun, but maybe it's not zero.

Wait, actually, the Sun is mostly using the proton-proton chain, but a small fraction (maybe about 1%) comes from the CNO cycle. So if the pp-III stops, what happens to the neutrino flux?

But the question is about the flux in two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to know how the pp-III neutrinos contribute to these bands.

I remember that the neutrinos from the pp-III branch have a certain energy spectrum. The main neutrino emission from the Sun comes from two primary sources: the dominant one is the pp-I branch, which produces neutrinos when a proton captures a neutron in the decay of deuterium (or something like that). The pp-III branch produces lower-energy neutrinos, I think. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, when a neutron is created in the pp-III process, when it decays into a proton and emits an electron and antineutrino (or is it a neutrino?), that's the neutrino we detect.

Wait, the proton-proton chain's neutrinos are from the decay of the boron-8 isotope. Oh no, wait, the main neutrinos from the Sun are from the decay of boron-8. Boron-8 is produced in the pp chain, I think. So when a boron-8 nucleus decays, it emits a positron and a neutrino. Oh, right, the neutrinos from boron-8 decay have a higher energy than the ones from the neutron decay in the pp-III branch.

Wait, so the pp-III branch produces lower-energy neutrinos compared to the ones from the pp-I branch or the main pp chain. Because in the main chain, the neutrinos come from the decay after the boron-8 captures an electron and emits a neutrino. So the energies of these neutrinos are higher, around 15-20 keV? Or wait, no, I might have that wrong. I think the neutrinos from the Sun's main process (boron-8) have energies around 0.5 MeV on average. Oh, wait, 0.5 MeV is 500 keV. So that's in the higher keV range.

But the pp-III branch: when a neutron is captured in the pp-III process, it decays, producing lower-energy neutrinos. Or wait, maybe the pp-III neutrinos are lower energy than the main pp neutrinos. So if the pp-III branch stops, the main source of lower-energy neutrinos is gone.

Wait, but the question is about the flux ratio between two bands. So, without the pp-III, the flux in certain energy bands would drop. Let me think: the pp-III neutrinos contribute to lower energy bands. So, when the pp-III stops, the flux in the lower band (say, 200-400 keV) would drop, but what about 700-800 and 800-900 keV?

The main neutrino flux from the Sun comes from the boron-8 decay, which peaks around 0.5 MeV (500 keV), but has a tail extending to higher energies. So the flux in the 7
