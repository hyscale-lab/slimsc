Okay, let's tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, so the question is about the uncertainty principle and estimating the minimum uncertainty in energy. Alright, I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

So, the electron is moving along the x-direction with a speed v of 2e8 m/s, and the uncertainty in position Δx is 0.1 nm. Wait, I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. Oh right, because energy is related to momentum, I think I'll have to connect Δp with ΔE.

First, let's get all the units straight. The position uncertainty is given in nanometers. 0.1 nm is 0.1e-9 meters. So, Δx = 1e-10 m. Right.

Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle equation: Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. I can solve for Δp. So, Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx). But wait, I think for the minimum uncertainty, we can set it equal to ħ/(2Δx), because the principle states that the product is greater than or equal to ħ/2. So the minimum is when it's exactly ħ/(2Δx).

Now, I need to find Δp. Let's write out the constants. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, so ħ is h/(2π), which is about 1.055e-34 J·s.

So, substituting in the numbers: Δp = (1.055e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) ) → Wait, wait, Δx is 0.1e-9 m, which is 1e-10 m. So 2Δx is 2e-10 m.

Wait, no, the formula is Δp = ħ/(2Δx). So, substituting numbers: (1.055e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-10 m) ) → Let me compute that denominator first. 2 * 1e-10 is 2e-10. So 1.055
