Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, all of which have a similar base but vary in substituents. Let's start by looking at the FTIR data.

The FTIR shows a very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Since the peak is around 3000, which is a bit lower than typical for a strong O-H (like 3200-3600 for alcohols), maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch due to hydrogen bonding. Also, there's a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, which is typical for a carbonyl group (C=O). So this suggests the compound is a carboxylic acid.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR. The problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So there are no double bonds or rings with adjacent hydrogens, which makes sense because all the options given are branched structures without double bonds.

In the NMR, some signals have complex splitting patterns. One is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is a mouthful. Another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. These splitting patterns suggest that these protons are next to several sets of neighboring protons. Let me think about how splitting works. Each neighboring set with n+1 peaks adds a level to the splitting.

So, for a proton that has neighbors on two different adjacent carbons, each with different numbers of neighboring Hs, the splitting can get complex. For example, if a proton is next to two different groups with 2 and 3 Hs, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a vicinal coupling with multiple adjacent groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure has multiple CH or CH2 groups adjacent, leading to multiple coupling partners. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
So this is something like two CH groups (each with a C2H5 and CH3 attached?), wait no. Let me parse the formula properly. The structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So it's a four-carbon chain, with the middle two carbons each having a CH group substituted with C2H5 and CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me see: The first part is CH3-C(H)(C2H5), which would be a CH2 group? Wait, no, more accurately, each of the central carbons is a CH that is connected to two ethyl groups and a CH3. Hmm, maybe I should draw it out.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (
