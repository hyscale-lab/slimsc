Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully and think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO₄^3- or PO₄^3-?) in the solution. The temperatures are given as 25°C, which is a standard condition, so I don't think I need to worry about temperature affecting the Ka values or anything like that.

Wait, actually, orthophosphate is H₃PO₄. But in the solution, we'll have various forms of phosphate ions because H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. The species present would depend on the pH of the solution. Hmm, but since we're mixing KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, which are different salts, this might form a buffer solution.

Wait, KH₂PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. So when these salts dissolve in water, they'll dissociate into their ions.

KH₂PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water of crystallization, but the water probably doesn't affect the ions in solution much. So the main ions here are K+, Na+, H2PO4^-, and HPO4^2-.

Wait, so in solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. But how does this affect the concentration of orthophosphate ions? Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it can dissociate into H2PO4^- and then further. Or wait, maybe orthophosphate refers to all the phosphate species?

Wait, no. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4. When it dissociates, it forms H2PO4^- (first dissociation), HPO4^2- (second), and PO4^3- (third). But in this problem, the salts provided are KH
