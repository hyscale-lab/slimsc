Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for Transit Timing Variations. But I'm not sure how TTV affects this particular problem. Maybe it's just context for how they were found, not relevant to the calculations here.

The problem gives me the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures. Planet1 to Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 2.3. So, let me write that down. T_eq ratio: (T1/T2) = 1.4 and (T2/T3)=2.3. So I can probably find T1 in terms of T3 by multiplying these ratios. Wait, let's compute that.

T1/T2 = 1.4 → T2 = T1 / 1.4.

Then T2/T3 = 2.3 → T3 = T2 / 2.3. Substituting T2 from the first equation: T3 = (T1 / 1.4) / 2.3 → T3 = T1 / (1.4 * 2.3). Let me calculate that denominator: 1.4 *2.3 is about 3.22. So T3 is T1 divided by 3.22. So T1 is about 3.22 times T3. Wait, or is it the other way? Because if T3 is T1/(3.22), then T1 is 3.22 * T3. So T1 is higher than T3 by that factor. Wait, but equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star. I recall that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance because the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance, and equilibrium temperature is based on the energy balance, so T ∝ (L/(16πσd²))^(1/4), which simplifies to T ∝ sqrt(1/d), since L and σ are constants here. Wait, actually, T_eq is proportional to (L/(d²))^(1/4) which is (1/d²)^(1/4) = 1/d^(0.5). So, T ∝ 1/sqrt(d). Alternatively, d ∝ 1/(T)^2.

So if T1 is 3.22 * T3, then the distance d1 is (T3 / T1)^2 times d3. So (T3 / T1) is 1/3.22. So (1/3.
