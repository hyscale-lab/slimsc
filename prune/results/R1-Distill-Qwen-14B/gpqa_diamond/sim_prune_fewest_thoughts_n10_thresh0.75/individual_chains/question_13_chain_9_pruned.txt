Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what each part does and how the reactions proceed.

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember that limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. When I think about limonene, it's either in the R or S configuration, which gives it the (+) or (-) designation. So (R) is the configuration.

The first reaction is a hydrogenation with Pd/C under hydrogen. The question says that one equivalent of hydrogen is consumed. Hydrogenation of limonene would typically add hydrogen across double bonds. Since limonene has two double bonds (I think it's a bicyclic structure with two rings, one of which is a double bond?), but wait, no. Wait, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with one double bond, right? Or maybe two? Let me think. Oh, no, limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene with a single double bond in a ring structure, like in a cyclohexene ring. So when hydrogen is added, it would hydrogenate that double bond.

Wait, limonene is a bicyclic compound. The structure of (R)-limonene is a cyclohexene with a substituent (like a methyl group) and a bicyclic structure, maybe a fused ring? Or perhaps it's a mono-cyclic with a substituent that's part of the ring. Hmm, maybe I should draw the structure. Limonene has a structure where the double bond is in a six-membered ring, with a substituent like a methyl group and another substituent that forms a bridge. Wait, perhaps it's a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene structure? Or maybe I'm mixing it up with something else.

Wait, maybe limonene is more like a cyclohexene with a substituent. So hydrogenation would hydrogenate the double bond. So product 1 is the hydrogenated limonene. So the double bond becomes single, so it's a cyclohexane derivative.

Wait, the problem says that when hydrogen is consumed, product 1 is isolated as the major product. So 1
