Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question gives me a Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of the coupling constants tells us about renormalizability. The idea is that higher-dimensional operators are less renormalizable because they come with higher powers of energy, making them non-renormalizable theories. So if the dimension of κ is positive, maybe that affects things.

Let me break this down step by step. First, I think I need to find the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has to be dimensionless because when you integrate it over spacetime (which has dimension 4 in 4D spacetime), the action has to be dimensionless. So [L]_M = 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. The term given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let's figure out the dimensions of each component.

The Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2, right? Because in 4D, the Dirac spinor has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ would also be 3/2.

What about σ_{μν}? It's a product of two gamma matrices. Each γ matrix has dimension 1, since gamma matrices are dimensionless (or do they have a dimension? Wait, no—gamma matrices are just matrices, so they are dimensionless. So σ_{μν} is a commutator of two gammas, so it has dimension 0. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless.

Then ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) = 3. So that part has dimension 3.

Then F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. For a gauge field like A_mu, each derivative term in F is dimension 1. So F_{μν} has (field strength) dimension 2. Because F is like ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, and A has dimension 1 (because the kinetic term for A is (∂A)^2, which gives dimension 4, so [A]_M=1). So each A has dimension 1, each derivative adds dimension 1, so F has dimension 2.

So putting it all together, the term is κ multiplied by (ψ̄ σ ψ) which is dimension 3, multiplied by F which is dimension 2. So the whole term has dimension [κ] + 3 + 2 = [κ] +5.

But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, so:

[κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = 4-5 = -
