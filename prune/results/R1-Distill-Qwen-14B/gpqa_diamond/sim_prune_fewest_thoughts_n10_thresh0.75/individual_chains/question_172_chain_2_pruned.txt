Alright, so I have this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, okay, I remember something about the Boltzmann equation from my studies. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the excitation is higher in star_1. I think this has to do with temperature because higher temperatures usually lead to higher excitation states. But wait, I should probably get into the details.

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, wait, 1.38 is close to Boltzmann's constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Interesting, so the energy difference ΔE is k_B * something, but wait, ΔE might be equal to some multiple of k_B multiplied by temperature? No, wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think.

In the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by (n_upper / n_lower) = exp(-ΔE / (k_B T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k_B is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. But wait, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited, so their population ratio is 2:1 for the excited state compared to the lower state. Or maybe the excited level is higher in population in star_1 compared to star_2. I need to clarify.

Wait, star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited. So, perhaps the excitation in star_1 is higher, meaning more atoms are in the higher energy level. Let me denote the excitation level as the population in the higher state. So for star 1, n_upper1 / n_lower1 = 2? Or maybe it's the ratio between the two stars. Wait, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Hmm, perhaps the ratio for star_1 compared to star_2 is 2:1. Or maybe the excitation is higher, so their population ratios are different.

Wait, let me read the question again. "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2."
