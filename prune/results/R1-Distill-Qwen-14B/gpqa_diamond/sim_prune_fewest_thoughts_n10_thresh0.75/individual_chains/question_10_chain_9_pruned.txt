Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. Right, density = mass/volume. So the question is asking which of the options has the highest density. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option a) is an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is known, so that's a good starting point. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, I think. So this planet's density would be the same as Earth's. Wait, but sometimes I get confused because mass and radius are related. Oh, but since mass and radius are the same as Earth, the density is the same.

Option b) has 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, that's given. So the density is already provided as 5.5, which is the same as Earth. So maybe that's a trick option because the mass is higher, but the density is the same. So it's not higher than a), which is also 5.5. Hmm.

Option c) has the same composition as Earth but is five times more massive. Same composition means same density, right? Because density is based on the material's makeup. So if Earth's density is 5.5, then this planet's density would also be 5.5. But wait, mass is 5 times Earth's. How does that affect density? Oh, but density is mass/volume. If the mass increases but the composition is the same, the volume would scale with mass, so
