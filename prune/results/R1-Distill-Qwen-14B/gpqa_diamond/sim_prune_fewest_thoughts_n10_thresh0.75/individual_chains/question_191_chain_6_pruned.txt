Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what each reaction does and how the structure changes each time.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. The main ring is a cyclohexane with a ketone at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH), and at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like CH2-C(CH2)=CH2? Wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3, so the substituent is the group attached to the cyclohexane. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C(=CH2)-. Wait, maybe it's CH2-C(CH2)= something? Or wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2? Wait, no, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl would have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, so the structure is CH2=CH-CH2- but attached at the second carbon. So the group is CH2-C(=CH2)-, but that doesn't make sense because that would be a substituent. Oh wait, maybe it's CH2=C(CH3)-. No, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So the substituent is the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and substituent is at C2. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=C(CH2-). But wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2, but attached at the second carbon. So the group would be CH2-CH2-CH2 where the middle CH is attached to the ring. No, I'm not getting this right. Let me think. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, so the structure is -CH2-C(=CH2)- but attached via the central carbon. So the substituent is CH2
