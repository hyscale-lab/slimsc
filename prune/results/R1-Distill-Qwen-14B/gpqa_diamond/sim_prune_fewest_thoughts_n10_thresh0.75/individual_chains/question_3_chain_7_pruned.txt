Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about a spin-half particle in a specific superposition state. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of the σz operator. So, σz is the Pauli z-matrix, right? Its eigenvalues are +1 and -1 for the spin-up and spin-down states, respectively.

The problem asks for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Hmm, okay. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the bra-ket ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator and ψ is the state.

So I need to find the expectation values of σz and σx separately, then combine them with their coefficients.

Wait, but wait, the state is already given as a linear combination of σz eigenstates. That might make things easier for σz. Because for σz, the expectation value would just be the probability of measuring spin-up times +1 plus the probability of spin-down times -1.

Let me start by writing down the state again. The state ψ is (0.5)|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. So the coefficients are 0.5 and (√3)/2. I should check if these are normalized. The sum of the squares of the magnitudes should be 1.

Calculating 0.5² is 0.25. (√3/2)^2 is (3)/4, which is 0.75. Adding them together, 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. So yes, the state is normalized. Good.

So the expectation value of σz is straightforward. The probabilities are the squares of the coefficients, right? Because |c_up|² is the probability of measuring spin-up, same with |c_down|² for spin-down.

So, c_up is 0.5, so |c_up|² is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. Similarly, c_down is sqrt(3)/2, so |c_down|² is (3/4) = 0.75.
