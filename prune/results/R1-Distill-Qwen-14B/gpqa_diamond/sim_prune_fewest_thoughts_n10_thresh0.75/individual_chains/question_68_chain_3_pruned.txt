Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think it through. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it step by step.

The problem says there's a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu. The magnetic moment is given as gamma times Sz, where Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction. Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Hmm, right. So I remember that when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. The magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field via the Hamiltonian H = -mu·B. But wait, mu is gamma Sz, so H would be proportional to Sz.

Initially, when the field is along Z, the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -gamma B Sz. The energy levels are determined by the eigenvalues of Sz, which are ±ħ/2 for spin 1/2. But when the field is suddenly turned off and then turned on in the Y direction, the Hamiltonian changes. So the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -gamma B Sy, since the field is along Y now.

Wait, let me think about the time dependence here. The field is turned off and then another is turned on suddenly. So the change happens instantaneously, which suggests a time-dependent problem. But for the purpose of finding the oscillation frequency, maybe I can model this as a change from H_initial to H_final.

But the particle's state before the change is an eigenstate of Sz. Let's say it's in the spin-up state along Z, |↑⟩_z. After the field changes to Y, the new Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy. So the state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, which means it will evolve over time, causing oscillations in observable quantities.

The question is about the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is mu_z. Since mu = gamma Sz, mu_z = gamma S_z. So the average ⟨mu_z⟩ will oscillate over time. I need to find the frequency of these oscillations.

The general approach for such time-dependent oscillations involves finding the energy difference between the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. The frequency of oscillation is related to the energy levels by the Bohr
