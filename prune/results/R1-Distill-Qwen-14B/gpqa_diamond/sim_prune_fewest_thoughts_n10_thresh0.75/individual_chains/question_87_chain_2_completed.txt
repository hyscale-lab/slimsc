Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. Oh wait, di-substituted means two substituents, right?

The FTIR spectrum shows peaks indicating a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, that means the molecule has both a carbonyl (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.) and a halogen attached to an aromatic ring.

Wait, wait. The aromatic ring is 6-membered, like benzene. So, the substituents are on the benzene ring. One substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, and the other is a halogen.

Wait, but wait. The carbonyl could be part of another group attached to the ring. Like, maybe it's an acyl group. Let me think about possible structures.

The compound has 8 carbons. Benzene is 6 carbons, so the two substituents add 2 more carbons. Or maybe the substituents themselves are larger. Wait, let's count. The substituents could be, for example, a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and a halogen. But wait, a ketone substituent would be something like a carbonyl attached to another carbon. Or maybe an aldehyde group (RCHO), but that would add more carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the possible structures that fit. Let's think: 6-membered ring (benzene) with two substituents. Each substituent contributes some carbons.

The total is 8 carbons. So, benzene (6) plus substituents sum to 2. So, substituents could be Cl (no carbons) and a ketone group (like RCO-). Wait, but a ketone substituent would be like O=C-R attached to the ring. So, for example, if R is a methyl group, that would be 3 carbons in the substituent (COCH3). But wait, that would add 3 (COCH3) + 0 (Cl) carbons, but 6 +3 =9, which is more than 8. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl and a halogen. Wait, but a halogen is an atom, not a group with carbons. So, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, like -COX or something. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach. Let's look at the options' NMR data to see what they represent.

Option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, singlet), 7.8 (2H, doublet), 7.6 (2H, doublet), 3.7 (2H, singlet). 

A singlet at ~10 ppm usually indicates an aldehyde proton. So if there's an aldehyde, that's a carbonyl group. But aldehydes are often at higher ppm, like around 9-10. So that fits. Then, the aromatic region: two doublets at 7.8 and 7.6. That suggests a para-substituted benzene perhaps, but wait, if there are two substituents. Oh wait, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene with two different groups.

Wait, the doublets would mean that each set of H's is next to one substituent. Maybe it's a para-substituted ring with two substituents, each causing the neighboring H's to be doublets. But wait, maybe it's an ortho or meta situation.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a benzaldehyde with another substituent. Wait, but then what about the 3.7 ppm singlet of 2H? That could be a methylene group (OCH2O perhaps, but that would be a carbonyl maybe). Or maybe it's an OCH2 group attached elsewhere.

But wait, the molecule has 8 carbons total. Benzene (6) plus substituents. Let's see: if one substituent is an aldehyde group (-CHO), that's one carbon (the aldehyde is CHO, so it's one carbon attached to the benzene). Then another substituent, which must have one carbon as well. Wait, but then the substituents would add 2 carbons (1 each), making 8 total. So, the substituents would be CHO and Cl or Br?

Wait, wait. Let me think: benzene (6 carbons) plus two substituents. If one substituent is -CHO (aldehyde), which is one carbon (the benzene ring connects to the aldehyde via a CH), then that's 7 carbons. The other substituent would need to be one carbon, perhaps a halogen. Wait, but a halogen is an atom, not a carbon. So that doesn't add a carbon. So, that would make 7 carbons in total, but the problem states 8. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a ketone group attached to a methyl group. Like, say, a benzophenone derivative. So, maybe the substituent is -COCH3. That would add two carbons (the carbonyl and the methyl). So benzene (6) + 2 (from COCH3) and another substituent, which would add zero, like a halogen. So, total carbons would be 8 (6 + 2). That fits.

So, the structure would be a 6-membered ring with a COCH3 group and a halogen substituent. Let me think about the NMR. The COCH3 would show up as a singlet around 2.1 ppm (for the CH3 attached to carbonyl). But in option A, the 3.7 ppm is a singlet for 2H. That doesn't fit a CH3. Hmm.

Wait, looking at option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). The 2.3 ppm singlet for 3H suggests a CH3 attached to something, maybe a carbonyl. So that fits a COCH3 group. Then, the aromatic protons. Two doublets each integrating to 2H, suggests perhaps a para-substituted benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. Because in para substitution, each substituent would cause the adjacent H's to be deshielded, but in a di-substituted benzene, if the substituents are in the para positions, the NMR would show two sets of doublets.

Wait, but wait, in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each substituent would be opposite each other. So, for example, if you have two substituents at positions 1 and 3, that's meta. But if they're at 1 and 4, that's para. Wait, no, positions 1 and 4 are adjacent in a benzene ring. Wait, no, benzene is a six-membered ring, so substituents at positions 1 and 4 are across from each other (para). So, if the ring has two substituents at para positions, the aromatic protons would be in a certain pattern.

Wait, but in a di-substituted benzene ring with substituents in the para positions, the aromatic protons would be split into two sets, each with two protons, as doublets. Because each substituent would cause the adjacent protons to split. So, for example, each substituent in para would have two H's adjacent to it, each of which is a doublet, and the coupling between adjacent H's would lead to that.

So, in the NMR, you'd see two doublets each of 2H, which matches option C's aromatic protons (7.8 and 7.6 ppm). Also, the 2.3 ppm singlet for 3H fits the COCH3 group. So that seems to fit. But wait, option C doesn't have any peaks around 10 ppm, which might indicate an aldehyde. So since the problem states there's a carbonyl group, but not necessarily an aldehyde, that's acceptable.

Now, about the other substituent: it's a halogen. So, perhaps the molecule is p-chlorobenzophenone? Or p-bromobenzophenone? Wait, no, benzophenone is a diaryl ketone, which would have more than 6 carbons. Hmm, maybe the substituents are a COCH3 and a Cl.

Wait, but the compound must have 8 carbons. Benzene (6) + COCH3 (2 carbons) plus a Cl (0 carbons) → total 8. So that's correct.

So, the NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets (due to the substituents, each in para positions, causing the adjacent H's to couple), the COCH3 as a singlet, and perhaps another group.

Wait, but in option C, the peaks are 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s). That matches the COCH3 group. The aromatic Hs would come from the substituents. But where is the halogen in this structure? Oh, wait, the other substituent is a Cl (or Br), which is attached to the ring. So the ring would have two substituents: COCH3 and Cl.

So, in this case, the ring would have substituents at para positions. Let's imagine substituents in positions 1 and 4: COCH3 and Cl. The aromatic protons would be in positions 2 and 6 (each adjacent to COCH3) and positions 3 and 5 (each adjacent to Cl). The protons in 2 and 6 would be deshielded by the COCH3 group, and those in 3 and 5 would be deshielded by Cl. But wait, in para substitution, each substituent is opposite, so the ring's Hs adjacent to substituents would be in specific positions. Let me sketch this mentally.

In para-substituted benzene with two different substituents, the Hs adjacent to each substituent would be in a certain pattern. For example, the Hs next to the COCH3 would be in the ortho position, and the Hs next to the Cl would be in their respective ortho positions. But since the substituents are para to each other, the adjacent Hs would be in the meta positions relative to each other.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think of the substituents as being in positions 1 and 3 (meta) or 1 and 4 (para). Let's say substituents are in 1 (Cl) and 4 (COCH3). Then the Hs in positions 2 and 6 (adjacent to COCH3) and positions 3 and 5 (adjacent to Cl) would each have coupling.

In that case, the Hs at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, each coupled to their neighboring Hs, and the same for Hs at 3 and 5. But in this scenario, the two sets of Hs (each 2H) would each be doublets, which matches the NMR data in option C.

So, the NMR for option C looks promising. It has two doublets in the aromatic region, integrating to 4H in total (2 each), and a singlet at 2.3 ppm for 3H, which is probably the COCH3. So that makes sense.

Wait, but what about the presence of a halogen? How would that affect the NMR? Halogens are electronegative and can cause deshielding. But in aromatic regions, the substituents (like Cl) can cause the adjacent Hs to shift downfield. So, the Hs next to Cl would be more deshielded than those next to COCH3, perhaps explaining the higher ppm in their signals.

Wait, but in option C, the higher ppm is 7.8 and the lower is 7.6. That suggests that the substituents are causing varying degrees of deshielding. The more deshielded Hs would be at higher ppm. So, if the Cl is a stronger de-shielder than COCH3, the Hs next to Cl would be at higher ppm. But in option C, the higher ppm is 7.8, which could be the Hs next to Cl, and 7.6 next to COCH3.

So, that would make sense. So option C's data fits a structure with para-substituted benzene, with substituents being Cl and COCH3.

Wait, but I should check the other options to make sure.

Option A has a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which is likely an aldehyde proton. But then, the substituents would be an aldehyde and a halogen. Let's see: benzene with -CHO and -X (Cl, Br). That would give a total of 6 (benzene) + 1 (CHO) + 0 (X) =7 carbons. But the problem states 8 carbons. So maybe this isn't possible. Unless the substituents are more than just CHO and X. Hmm, unless there's another group.

Wait, maybe the substituents are a CHO group and a -OCH3 group. Then the total would be 6 + 1 (CHO) + 3 (OCH3) = 10 carbons, which is way over. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a CHO and a -CH2X group. But that would add more than one carbon per substituent.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a ketone group and a halogen. Wait, but a ketone substituent would have a carbonyl adjacent to a CH2 group, perhaps. Let me think: if the substituent is a ketone, say, a benzoyl group, but that would add more carbons. Hmm, perhaps not.

So, in option A, the aldehyde would contribute a proton, but that would mean the compound has 7 carbons (6 in benzene, 1 in CHO), but the problem says 8. So maybe option A is not correct.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s). These peaks suggest some sort of diastereotopic protons, maybe in a cyclic structure or adjacent to an oxygen. For example, maybe an epoxide or a di-substituted ether. But I don't see any aromatic protons in this option. The question states that the compound is aromatic, so this option is unlikely.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The 6.9 ppm singlet suggests a single aromatic proton, but in a di-substituted benzene, you’d expect more than one. Unless it's a substituted benzene where all Hs are equivalent except one, but that seems unlikely. Also, the other peaks suggest some kind of ethylene or similar structure, but the absence of aromatic peaks except for one suggests maybe a mono-substituted benzene, which contradicts the di-substituted statement. So option D is probably incorrect.

So, going back, the correct option is probably C. It fits with the substituents being COCH3 and Cl in para positions on the benzene ring. The NMR shows the aromatic protons as two doublets, the COCH3 as a singlet, and the integration adds up correctly.

Wait, but wait. Could there be another structure that also fits? For example, a benzene ring with a ketone substituent and a halogen. But then, the ketone would be, say, a benzophenone group. Wait, but benzophenone is a diaryl ketone, which would have more than 6 carbons. Let me check: benzophenone is (Ph)2CO, which would have 12 carbons (each Ph is 6, plus the CO). So that's way over the 8 carbons in the problem. So, that's not it.

So, the only option that fits is C. So the answer should be option C.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (benzene) with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. This suggests that one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group (e.g., -COCH₃) and the other is a halogen (e.g., Cl or Br). The total carbon count is 6 (from benzene) + 2 (from -COCH₃) = 8, which fits the given data.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**:  
   - Peaks: 9.9 ppm (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s).  
   - The singlet at 9.9 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton (-CHO). However, this would result in a total of 7 carbons (6 from benzene + 1 from -CHO), which contradicts the problem's requirement of 8 carbons.  
   - **Eliminated**.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Peaks: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s).  
   - These peaks suggest a structure with non-aromatic protons, such as a di-substituted ether or epoxide. However, there are no aromatic protons in this spectrum, which contradicts the problem's description of an aromatic compound.  
   - **Eliminated**.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Peaks: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s).  
   - The two doublets in the aromatic region (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) indicate a para-substituted benzene ring, where the substituents are in opposite positions. The singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H) corresponds to a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (e.g., -COCH₃).  
   - This structure fits the description: benzene (6 carbons) with a -COCH₃ group (2 carbons) and a halogen (0 carbons), totaling 8 carbons.  
   - **Correct**.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Peaks: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s).  
   - The single aromatic proton at 6.9 ppm suggests a mono-substituted benzene, which contradicts the problem's description of a di-substituted benzene.  
   - **Eliminated**.

### Conclusion:
The correct structure is a para-substituted benzene with a -COCH₃ group and a halogen. The NMR data in **Option C** matches this structure, with two doublets in the aromatic region and a singlet for the -COCH₃ group.

**Answer: C**
