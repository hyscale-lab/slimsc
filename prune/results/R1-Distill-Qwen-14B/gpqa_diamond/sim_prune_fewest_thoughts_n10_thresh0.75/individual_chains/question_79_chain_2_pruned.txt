Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me try to break it down.

Alright, the question is about identifying Compound X based on the NMR data of its reaction product. The compound X is treated with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DBU) in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. I remember that DBU is a strong, non-nucleophilic base, often used in elimination reactions or as a catalyst in various organic reactions. So, maybe Compound X is undergoing an elimination or some kind of ring-opening reaction here.

Looking at the molecular formula of Compound X: C11H12O. Hmm, that's 11 carbons, 12 hydrogens, and one oxygen. The product's NMR data is given, so I need to figure out what the product looks like and then work backwards to determine what X was.

The 1H NMR data is:
δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

And the 13C NMR:
δ 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).

Let me look at the 13C first. The peaks around 126-130 are likely aromatic carbons. The 197.7 seems high for a carbonyl, but wait—epoxides don't have carbonyls. Oh, wait, maybe this is an ester or a ketone? Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, the 197 could be a carbonyl from a ketone or something else. Wait, but the starting material is an epoxide perhaps, and after treatment, it opens up. Hmm.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows two singlets at around 2.28 and 2.31 ppm, each with 3H. Those are probably methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split the signal, maybe an electronegative atom or a group that's symmetrical. Like attached to an oxygen (maybe an ether or oxide) or perhaps a quaternary carbon.

Looking at the aromatic signals: 6.75 (d), 7.08 (doublet), 7.68 (d), 7.71 (d). So, this suggests a substituted aromatic ring with perhaps some substituents causing splitting. Let me count the number of aromatic protons. 1 (d) + 2 (d) +1 (d) +2 (d) = 6H. Wait, but that's 6 protons, but benzene has 6. So maybe it's a single substituent on the benzene causing the doublets. Alternatively, perhaps a para-substituted ring? Let me think.

Wait, another approach: the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is quite high. That's a strong indication of a carbonyl group. So, maybe the product is a ketone or an ester. Alternatively, perhaps an aldehyde, but aldehydes are usually around 200 ppm. 197.7 could be a ketone.

But wait, if the reaction is with DBU, which is basic, maybe it's an elimination. So if the starting material is an epoxide, perhaps
