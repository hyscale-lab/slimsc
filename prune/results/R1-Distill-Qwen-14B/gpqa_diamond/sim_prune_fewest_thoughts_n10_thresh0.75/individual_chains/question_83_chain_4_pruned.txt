Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully. Alright, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when you titrate them, you're neutralizing the acid with the base.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

First, I should probably figure out the concentrations and moles involved here. Let me break it down step by step.

Okay, initial step: Diluting the acetic acid. The initial volume is 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then adding 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³ (0.040 L). 

Molarity is moles per liter. So the moles of acetic acid before dilution would be Molarity × Volume = 0.05 M × 0.020 L = 0.001 mol. After dilution, the volume is 0.040 L, so the new concentration is moles/volume = 0.001 / 0.040 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. At 25% titration, that means we've added a quarter of the volume needed to reach the equivalence point. But wait, I should calculate the equivalence point first to find out how much NaOH is needed.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol, as calculated. Since NaOH is a strong base, it reacts with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio (CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O). So moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 mol.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. To find the volume needed at equivalence point, use M = moles/volume → volume = moles/M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence point volume would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Now, for the pH at 25% titration. Since only a quarter of the acid has been neutralized, I'm dealing with a buffer solution. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation should apply here. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). 

Wait, but first, let me find the pKa. The given Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/Ka) → log(1/(1.85e-5)) is approximately 4.74. Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 1.85e-5 is 1.85 ×10^-5. The log of that is log(1.85) ≈0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is -4.733. So pKa is 4.733, approximately 4.73.

At 25% titration, the amount of NaOH added
