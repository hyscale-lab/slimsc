Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. The question is asking at what energy the gamma-rays' lifetime in the universe would be limited by this process. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Wait, the process given is gamma-gamma annihilation producing electron-positron pairs. So the reaction is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. I remember that this is one of the processes that can limit the flux of high-energy gamma-rays because they interact with the CMB photons.

The key here is understanding the cross-section for this process and how it relates to the photon density of the CMB. I think the cross-section σ depends on the energy of the gamma-ray and the CMB photon. Oh right, the cross-section for this process peaks at certain energies, and the photon's energy is given as 1e-3 eV on average.

I remember that the annihilation cross-section for a gamma-ray with a photon is given by some formula. I think it's proportional to 1/(E^2) or something similar, but wait, maybe it's more precise than that. Oh right, the cross-section for γγ → e+e- is proportional to 1/E^4, where E is the energy of the gamma. Or was it 1/E^2? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I think the cross-section σ scales as σ ~ 1/E^2. Because for high energies, the cross-section drops. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the cross-section for pair production on the CMB has a certain dependence on the photon energy. Let me think: the cross-section is a function of the center-of-mass energy. The center-of-mass energy for the gamma-photon collision is important. Oh, right, when the gamma collides with a CMB photon, the threshold for producing an electron-positron pair is when the center-of-mass energy is at least 2m_e c², which is about 1.022 MeV. But in this case, the gamma-rays are high energy, so the process is possible.

But wait, the question is about the lifetime limitation. The lifetime
