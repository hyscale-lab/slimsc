Okay, let's try to tackle this astronomy problem. Hmm, so the question is about planets transiting and occulting a star, and finding the maximum orbital period for a second planet. 

Wait, I remember transit and occultation... Transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet is behind the star, so the planet's light is blocked. Both events happening mean the planet's orbit must be such that these events are visible.

The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius, transits with an impact parameter of 0.2, and orbits a star of 1.5 solar radii. Its orbital period is 3 days. The second planet is larger, 2.5 Earth radii, and we need to find the maximum period it can have and still have both events.

Oh, right, transit and occultation events depend on the alignment of the planet's orbit relative to our line of sight. The impact parameter is the distance (in units of star radius) from the center of the star that the planet's path is closest. So the first planet's impact parameter is 0.2, meaning it's passing 0.2 times the star's radius away from the center.

But how does this relate to the orbital period of the second planet? I think the key here is the size of the orbit. For the second planet to have both transit and occultation, it must pass in front of and behind the star. That probably means it's in a different orbit, but with a period that's a multiple or related to the first planet's period.

Wait, maybe it's about the Hill sphere or orbital resonances. Or perhaps it's about the planets being in the same orbital plane and their orbital periods allowing the second planet's orbit to sometimes be between us and the star (transit) and sometimes behind (occultation). 

But how do orbital periods relate to each other for that to happen? I remember that for two planets to have such events, their orbital periods need to be in a ratio that allows their positions to align in those ways. Like, if the second planet's period is longer, it would take longer to orbit, so the time between events would vary.

Wait, another thought: the transit and occultation events happen when the planet is in a position relative to the observer. For the second planet, to have both events, its orbital period must be such that when it's between us and the star (transit), and when it's on the other side (occultation), those events are observable.

But how to calculate the maximum period? Maybe it's related to the orbital radius. The first planet has a period of 3 days. Using Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (or just the radius, since it's circular). 

The formula is P² = (4π²/GM) * a³, but in astronomical units and solar masses, it's often simplified to P² = a³ when P is in years and a in AU. But our periods here are in days. Maybe I should convert the periods to years.

Wait, but perhaps the key is the ratio of the periods of the two planets. For the second planet
