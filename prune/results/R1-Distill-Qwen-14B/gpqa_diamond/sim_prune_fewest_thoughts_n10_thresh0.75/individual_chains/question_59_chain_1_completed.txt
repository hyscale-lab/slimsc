Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: CH3COOH, HCl, and Ba(OH)2. Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So, I think I need to calculate the moles of each acid and base and see what's left after the neutralization.

First, let me list out the details given. The volumes and concentrations are:

- 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
- 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid)
- 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (a strong base, I think)

Wait, wait. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? Because group 2 hydroxides are usually strong. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 will produce 2 moles of OH- ions. Because Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

So, I should calculate the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base.

Let's start with each solution.

First, for CH3COOH. It's a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But for the purpose of neutralization, I think we consider the H+ it can donate. Wait, but maybe in the presence of a strong acid and strong base, the weak acid might not play a role because the strong acid is dominant. Hmm, not sure about that yet.

Wait, no. Maybe I should consider all the acids and bases. So, the total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. The OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely, giving H+ and Cl-. Acetic acid, being weak, won't fully dissociate, but for neutralization, perhaps the reaction is between H+ from all acids and OH- from the base.

Wait, but maybe it's better to calculate the total moles of H+ and total moles of OH- in the mixture, then see which is in excess. If H+ is in excess, then the remaining H+ will determine the pH. If OH- is in excess, pH will be determined by that.

Let me calculate the moles.

Moles of CH3COOH: volume in liters is 0.5 L, concentration 0.1 M. So moles = 0.5 * 0.1 = 0.05 moles. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so each mole can donate one H+. But wait, since it's weak, in a solution without a base, it won't dissociate much. But in this case, we have a strong base, so maybe the acetic acid will donate its H+ to neutralize the OH-.

Wait, but maybe I should approach it as all H+ and OH- reacting. Let's see: the H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. But HCl is a strong acid, so it contributes more H+. Ba(OH)2 contributes OH-.

Wait, but wait: HCl gives H+ and Cl-. Ba(OH)2 gives Ba^2+ and 2 OH- per formula unit. So, 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2: moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives 2 moles OH-, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles OH-.

Now the H+ from HCl: 400 mL is 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 moles HCl. Since HCl is strong, 0.08 moles H+.

CH3COOH is 0.5 L * 0.1 M = 0.05 moles. It's a weak acid, so each mole can donate one H+.

Wait, but when mixing a weak acid and a strong base, the weak acid's H+ may react with the OH- from the base. So, perhaps the OH- will first neutralize the H+ from the weak acid, and any remaining OH- will neutralize the strong acid's H+.

Wait, no, wait. The OH- is a strong base, so it will react with all available H+ from both strong and weak acids.

So, total H+ available is from HCl (0.08) plus CH3COOH (0.05). But wait, but CH3COOH doesn't fully dissociate, so maybe only a portion contributes H+. Hmm, but in the presence of a strong base, like OH-, which is a strong enough base, maybe it will deprotonate the acetic acid. Because OH- is a strong base, it will take H+ from any available source—so even from the weak acid.

So, the total H+ available is:

H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

H+ from CH3COOH: 0.05 mol (if it fully donates, which may not be the case, but with OH- present, it's likely that the OH- will deprotonate the acetic acid).

Wait, but wait. Let me think again.

When you mix a weak acid and a strong base, the OH- will deprotonate the weak acid. So the reaction would be:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O.

So, the moles of OH- will determine how much of the CH3COOH is neutralized. So, the total H+ available would be from HCl plus any leftover CH3COOH that wasn't neutralized.

Wait, but let me calculate the moles.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

But wait, the CH3COOH is 0.05 mol. So, the OH- can react with the CH3COOH first.

Each mole of CH3COOH can react with 1 mole OH-.

So, 0.05 mol OH- needed to neutralize 0.05 mol CH3COOH. But wait, the OH- available is 0.18 mol. So, after neutralizing all CH3COOH, there's 0.18 - 0.05 = 0.13 mol OH- left.

Now, the OH- will then react with H+ from HCl. H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol.

So, 0.08 mol H+ reacts with 0.08 mol OH-:

H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, after this, how much OH- remains?

We had 0.13 mol OH- after neutralizing CH3COOH, and 0.08 mol added to that. Wait, no: the initial OH- is 0.18. Subtract the 0.05 to neutralize CH3COOH, leaving 0.13. Then, this 0.13 reacts with 0.08 H+ from HCl.

Wait, no: the OH- after neutralizing CH3COOH is 0.13. Then, the H+ from HCl is 0.08. So, 0.08 mol OH- reacts with 0.08 H+, neutralizing each other. So, after that, we have 0.13 - 0.08 = 0.05 mol OH- remaining.

Wait, wait, no. Let me re-calculate:

Total OH-: 0.18 mol.

This OH- first reacts with CH3COOH. CH3COOH is 0.05 mol. So, 0.05 moles of OH- neutralize 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

That leaves 0.18 - 0.05 = 0.13 moles of OH-.

Then, this 0.13 moles of OH- reacts with the H+ from HCl.

HCl is 0.08 moles of H+.

So, 0.08 moles of OH- would react with 0.08 moles of H+.

Wait, but wait, I have 0.13 moles of OH- and 0.08 moles of H+. So the OH- will take all 0.08 H+, leaving 0.13 - 0.08 = 0.05 moles of OH-.

So, after all reactions, we have excess OH- of 0.05 mol.

Wait, but let's check the total volume. The solutions are 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL, or 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Then, pOH is the negative log of [OH-].

pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38.

Then, pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but wait, that's a possible option. Looking at the options, option A is 12.62, and option B is 1.38.

But wait, if there's excess OH-, the pH would be high, around 12.62. So, option A.

But let me double-check my steps. Did I account for all reactions correctly?

Another approach: calculate moles of H+ and OH-.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

Total H+ from CH3COOH: 0.05 mol (assuming it's fully deprotonated by OH-).

Wait, but only 0.05 mol of OH- is needed to neutralize CH3COOH, leaving 0.18 - 0.05 = 0.13 mol OH-.

Then, the remaining OH- (0.13) reacts with H+ from HCl (0.08). So, H+ is all neutralized, leaving 0.13 - 0.08 = 0.05 mol OH-.

So, yes, the excess is 0.05 mol OH- in 1.2 L.

So, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

pOH = log(1/(0.0416667)) = log(24) → wait, no. pOH is -log(0.0416667).

Wait, 0.0416667 is 1/24, since 1/24 ≈ 0.0416667.

Log(24) is approx 1.38, so pOH is 1.38. Therefore, pH is 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

So the answer would be option A.

But wait, let me check if I missed anything. Did I account for the fact that CH3COOH is a weak acid and may not fully donate H+? Hmm, but in the presence of a strong base (OH-), the weak acid will donate its H+ because the OH- will deprotonate it. So, I think I was correct in using all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH as H+.

Alternatively, if the OH- is not enough to neutralize all the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH, then we'd have excess H+ and the solution would be acidic. But in this case, the OH- is 0.18, and the total H+ is 0.08 (HCl) + 0.05 (CH3COOH) = 0.13. Wait, wait, wait a second. No, that can't be right. Because I have 0.18 moles of OH- and 0.13 moles of H+.

Wait, wait, 0.08 (HCl) + 0.05 (CH3COOH) = 0.13 moles of H+.

But the OH- is 0.18 moles. So, 0.18 OH- will neutralize 0.13 H+ (since H+ is 0.13), producing water. That would leave (0.18 - 0.13) = 0.05 moles of OH-.

Ah, so that's where the 0.05 comes from. So, the solution would have an excess of OH- and be basic, so pH is 12.62, which is option A.

Wait, but why did I initially think that the 0.05 comes from subtracting 0.05 (CH3COOH) from 0.18? Because OH- first neutralizes the CH3COOH, then the HCl.

Wait, but that's not correct because the order shouldn't matter. The moles of H+ and OH- should just combine, regardless of source.

Wait, that's correct. So, the total H+ is 0.08 (from HCl) + 0.05 (from CH3COOH) = 0.13 mol. Then, the OH- is 0.18. So, 0.13 H+ will be neutralized by 0.13 OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05 moles OH-.

So, same result. So, regardless of the order, the excess OH- is 0.05 mol.

So, the final [OH-] is 0.05 / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38, so pH is 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

So, the correct answer is option A) 12.62.


To determine the pH of the solution, we calculate the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions contributed by the acids and base, respectively, and then determine the excess after neutralization.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻
- **CH₃COOH (weak acid):**  
  Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L, concentration = 0.1 M.  
  Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.5 \times 0.1 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Each mole of CH₃COOH can donate 1 H⁺, so it contributes 0.05 mol of H⁺.

- **HCl (strong acid):**  
  Volume = 400 mL = 0.4 L, concentration = 0.2 M.  
  Moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.4 \times 0.2 = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).

- **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
  Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L, concentration = 0.3 M.  
  Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces 2 OH⁻ ions, so it contributes \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻.

### Step 2: Neutralization reaction
The OH⁻ ions react with the H⁺ ions from both CH₃COOH and HCl:

1. **Neutralization of CH₃COOH:**  
   OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH in a 1:1 ratio.  
   Moles of OH⁻ required to neutralize CH₃COOH = 0.05 mol.  
   Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.18 - 0.05 = 0.13 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Neutralization of HCl:**  
   The remaining OH⁻ reacts with H⁺ from HCl in a 1:1 ratio.  
   Moles of OH⁻ required to neutralize HCl = 0.08 mol.  
   Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.13 - 0.08 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).

### Step 3: Calculate [OH⁻] and pH
The total volume of the solution is:  
\( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
The concentration of excess OH⁻ is:  
\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \frac{\text{moles of OH}^-}{\text{total volume}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.0416667 \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is calculated as:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-] = -\log(0.0416667) \approx 1.38.
\]

The pH is then:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH of the solution is **12.62**, corresponding to **Option A**.
