Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to work through it step by step.

Okay, the problem says that the system's state at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, I should note that down. So the state vector is a column vector, ψ, which has components [-1, 2, 1]^T. But wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, meaning their norm (or length) should be 1. Let me check that real quick.

The norm squared would be the sum of the squares of each component. So (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, and 1^2 is 1. Adding them up: 1+4+1=6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). That means the state vector isn't normalized. Hmm, but in quantum mechanics, state vectors are typically normalized. So I might need to normalize it before proceeding. Or wait, maybe the problem assumes it's already normalized? Let me think. The question is about calculating the probability, so perhaps normalization is necessary. So I should probably compute the normalized state vector.

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention anything about normalization. Maybe I can proceed without it because probabilities might adjust accordingly. Alternatively, perhaps the given vector is already normalized, but in this case, sqrt(6) is approximately 2.45, so it's not 1. So I think I should normalize it.

So the normalized state vector would be ψ_normalized = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T. Hmm. But wait, the problem might not require me to normalize because the observable is a projection operator. Or maybe I should proceed without normalization because the observable's matrix might take care of it. Wait, perhaps I should proceed as is, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to proceed with normalization, as probabilities are based on inner products, which require normalization. Let me proceed with that.

Next, the observable is given by the matrix P. Let me write down matrix P. It's a 3x3 matrix. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. So, P looks like this:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Wait, that's an interesting matrix. Let me see if it's a projection operator. Because in quantum mechanics, observables are Hermitian, and projection operators are a type of observable.

First, I should check if P is Hermitian. A matrix is Hermitian if it's equal to its conjugate transpose. Since all the elements are real here, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. So let's transpose P and see.

Transposing P would make the first column [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], second column [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], third column [0,1/sqrt(2), 0]. Comparing to the original P, which is the same as its transpose. So yes, P is Hermitian. That's good because observables must be Hermitian.

But wait, is P a projection operator? A projection operator P must satisfy P^2 = P. Let's compute P squared to check.

Hmm. Let me compute P^2. So each element (i,j) of P squared is the sum over k of P_ik * P_kj.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it step by step.

First, P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me compute P squared.

Row 1 of P is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Let's compute each element of row 1 in P^2.

Element (1,1): sum over k=1 to 3 of P[1,k] * P[k,1].

P[1,1] is 0, P[1,2] is 1/sqrt(2), P[1,3] is 0.

So sum is 0 * P[1,1] + (1/sqrt(2)) * P[2,1] + 0 * P[3,1].

P[2,1] is 1/sqrt(2). So element (1,1)= (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(2)) )= 1/2.

Element (1,2): sum
