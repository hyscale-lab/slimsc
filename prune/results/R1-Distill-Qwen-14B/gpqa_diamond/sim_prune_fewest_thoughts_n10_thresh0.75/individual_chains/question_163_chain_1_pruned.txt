Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm. The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid. I remember that when a metal hydroxide reacts with an acid, they typically form a salt and water. So, Fe(OH)3 is reacting with a strong acid like HCl, right?

First, let me write down the reaction. I think it's Fe(OH)3 reacting with HCl. The product should be FeCl3 and water. So the balanced equation would be Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2O. Yeah, that makes sense because each OH- from Fe(OH)3 needs three H+ from HCl to neutralize.

Now, the problem states that there's 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. I need to calculate how many moles that is. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3... Let's see, Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol. So moles of Fe(OH)3 is 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol. Calculating that: 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.000936 moles, or 9.36 x 10^-4 moles.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.1 divided by 106.85. Let's compute 106.85 times 0.000936. Hmm, 100 * 0.000936 is 0.0936, and 6.85 * 0.000936 is about 0.00642, so total is about 0.099, which is 0.1 g. Yeah, that seems right.

Since the reaction is 1 mole Fe(OH)3 reacting with 3 moles HCl, the moles of HCl needed would be 3 times that. So 3 * 9.36e-4 = 0.002808 moles of HCl. 

Wait, but wait! The question is about the minimum volume of a 0.1 M HCl needed. So I need to find the volume that contains 0.002808 moles. The formula is moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So volume = moles / Molarity. 

So volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, because 1 L is 1000 cm³, so 0.02808 L is 28.08 cm³. Looking at the options, option C says 28.05 cm³. Close enough, considering rounding.

But wait, the options also give pH values. So I need to calculate the pH of the resulting solution. How?

After the reaction, we have FeCl3 in solution. FeCl3 is a strong electrolyte, so it dissociates completely into Fe³+ and Cl⁻ ions. The concentration of Fe³+ will determine the pH because Fe³+ is a Lewis acid and can hydrolyze in water.

So the concentration of Fe³+ is the same as the concentration of FeCl3. Let's find out how much FeCl3 is formed. We had 0.000936 moles of Fe(OH)3, which produces 0.000936 moles of FeCl3. But wait, the total volume of the solution is 100 cm³, right? Because the question says "in 100 cm³ total volume."

Wait, the 100 cm³ is the total volume after adding the acid. So the concentration of Fe³+ is moles / volume in liters. So 0.000936 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00936 M. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 0.000936 mol divided by 0.1 L is 0.00936 M? No, wait, 0.000936 divided by 0.1 is 0.00936? Wait
