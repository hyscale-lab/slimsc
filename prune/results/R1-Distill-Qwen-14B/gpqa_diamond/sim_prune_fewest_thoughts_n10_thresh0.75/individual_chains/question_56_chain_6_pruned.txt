Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and electron transitions. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

The question says that the |3,0,0> state decays to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions between energy levels are governed by the selection rules. Dipole transitions involve the emission or absorption of a photon, right?

So the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. So I need to find a path that goes from 3,0,0 to 1,0,0 in two steps, each being a dipole transition.

Wait, dipole selection rules. Oh right, for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are:

Δn = ±1, ±2, etc., but more importantly, for hydrogen-like atoms, the main selection rules are:
- Δl = ±1 (the orbital angular momentum changes by one unit)
- Δm = 0, ±1 (the magnetic quantum number changes by 0 or ±1)

So the first transition from 3s (n=3, l=0) must go to a state where l increases by 1. So l=1. So the first step would be to a 3p state.

Wait, but n can change as well. So from n=3, l=0, the electron can transition to a state with n=2,3,4... but wait, no, the selection rules don't restrict n as much as l and m. So for a dipole transition, the allowed transitions are when Δl = ±1. So from l=0 to l=1. But n can change by any integer, but it's more about the energy levels.

Wait, the possible transitions would be from 3s (n=3, l=0) to 2p (n=2, l=1) or to 4p (n=4, l=1), but since we're going to a lower energy state (from 3 to 1), it's more likely to go down. So maybe 3s → 2p.

But wait, the question says it's a two-step decay. So from 3,0,0 to some intermediate state, then to
