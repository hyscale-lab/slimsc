Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the SMEFT, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what I remember. SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, right? It's a framework that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the Standard Model symmetries. So the question is about which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect.

The options given are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Hmm, Lorentz symmetry. I think SMEFT is built in a way that all operators must be Lorentz covariant. Because the Standard Model itself respects Lorentz symmetry, so any operator added should maintain that. So point 1 is correct.

Poincare symmetry is a bit trickier. Poincare group includes Lorentz transformations plus translations. So for a theory to be Poincare invariant, it must have a local symmetry, meaning that the laws are the same everywhere and every time. But in effective field theories, like SMEFT, the operators are written with derivatives and fields, and the theory is considered valid up to some cutoff scale. Wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, right? So operators are constructed as Lorentz scalars. But I'm not sure if they all necessarily have Poincare symmetry. Because Poincare includes momentum conservation, etc. But wait, the operators are written in a way that they are local, so I guess they must respect Poincare. So points 1 and 2 are correct.

Wait, no. SMEFT is an effective theory, so the operators are built from SM fields and are local. So each operator must be a renormalizable term, but actually SMEFT includes higher-dimensional terms. So all these terms must be Lorentz invariant, but also local, so Poincare should be respected as well. So both 1 and 2 are required.

Wait, but wait. The Poincare symmetry includes the possibility of having terms that are not just Lorentz scalars but also involve momenta? Or perhaps more accurately, Poincare symmetry is the combination of Lorentz and translation symmetries. So for an operator to be Poincare invariant, it should be invariant under both. But in SMEFT, the operators are written as terms in a Lagrangian, which must respect both Lorentz and translation invariance. So yes, Poin
