Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The question says: If a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. We need to calculate the net potential energy of this system. The options are A to D.

Hmm. I remember that potential energy in electrostatics often involves calculating the work done to bring charges together. Since the sphere is conducting and grounded, that probably affects how the charges distribute.

Wait, when a conducting sphere is grounded, any excess charge on it would go to the ground, right? So if I have a charge q placed near the sphere, what happens? Oh, wait, no, because the sphere is grounded, it can't hold any charge. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, if the sphere is neutral and you bring a charge near it, the induced charges would cause a redistribution. But since it's grounded, the induced charges would flow to the ground, leaving the sphere with no net charge, but with a rearrangement of charges on the surface.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think differently. If the sphere is grounded, it's at zero potential. So any work done in bringing the charge q near would influence the potential energy.

Alternatively, maybe I should model this using image charges. Because when a charge is near a conducting sphere, the method of images can be used. The conducting sphere can be considered as having an image charge inside it.

Wait, but since the sphere is grounded, maybe the image charge approach is still applicable but with some modification. Because in the case of a grounded sphere, the image charge would be placed inside the sphere, but the sphere's potential remains zero.

Let me think. The conducting sphere, when not grounded, would have induced charges. But when it's grounded, the excess charge can flow away. So the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So the potential due to all the charges (including the image charge) must sum to zero on the sphere's surface.

Wait, when the sphere is grounded, the potential is zero. So any charges on the sphere would adjust such that the potential on the surface is zero.

But the problem is about the potential energy of the system. So how do I compute that?

Wait, the potential energy U of a charge q in an external potential V is U = q V. But since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the external potential would be due to induced charges.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the potential energy as the work done in assembling the system. That would involve the work done to bring the charge q near the sphere, and the work done to create the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, but since the sphere is grounded, it can't have a net charge. So any induced charges would flow to the ground. Hmm, but that's not entirely correct. The sphere will have induced charges due to the external charge q, but because it's grounded, the net charge on the sphere is zero. Wait, no. Wait, the sphere can have induced charges but they would be on the surface, but the total charge on the sphere is zero because it's grounded.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. If the sphere is neutral and you bring a charge q near it, the sphere's electrons would be attracted, leaving a positive charge on the near side. But because it's grounded, the excess positive would be neutralized by the ground, so the sphere would have no net charge. So the sphere ends up with induced charges: positive on the near side (which is connected to the ground, so the excess flows away) leading to the sphere having a negative charge on the far side? Or wait, if the sphere is grounded, the electrons can move to the ground, so the sphere would have a positive charge induced on the near side but since it's grounded, maybe it can't hold any charge, so the induced charges are such that the net is zero. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the sphere as a conductor. The image charge method could be used. When a charge q is placed outside a conducting sphere, the sphere's potential can be found by considering an image charge inside the sphere.

Wait, the image charge method. The conducting sphere can be replaced by an image charge inside it. The image charge's value would be such that the potential on the sphere's surface is the same as it would be if the sphere weren't there.

Wait, but since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero. So the potential due to the charge q and the image charge at the surface of the sphere must be zero.

So let's think about it: the potential at the surface (radius R) due to the charge q and the image charge q' should be zero.

So, the potential at a point on the sphere's surface due to q is V1 = k q / d', where d' is the distance from q to that point. But wait, that's complicated because d' varies around the sphere. Instead, using the image charge method, the image charge q' would be placed at a distance R^2/d from the center, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the image charge q' is placed inside the sphere such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So the potential at the sphere's surface due to q and q' must be zero.

So, the potential due to q is k q / (distance from q to the point on sphere). But because the sphere is a conductor, the image charge q' would be located at a point along the line connecting the charge q and the center of the sphere.

Wait, the image charge is inside the sphere, so its position is at a distance of R²/d from the center, but on the opposite side of the sphere from q. So if q is at a distance d from the center, then the image charge q' is at a distance R²/d from the center, but on the same line but inside the sphere.

Wait, but how does that work? Let's say the charge q is outside the sphere, at a distance d from the center. The image charge q' would be inside the sphere, at a distance (R²)/d from the center. So the distance between q and q' would be d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d. Hmm.

But wait, actually, I think the image charge is placed such that the sphere's surface is a conductor, so the potential there must be the same as it would be without the image charge. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the image charge for a sphere is given by q' = - (R/d) q. Wait, no, I think that's for a spherical capacitor. Let me think again.

Wait, in the method of images, for a point charge outside a conducting sphere, the image charge is given by q' = - (R/d) q, where d is the distance from the charge to the center, and R is the radius of the sphere. So the image charge would be inside the sphere, at a distance R²/d from the center along the line connecting the charge and the center.

Wait, no, I think the image charge's position is at a distance R²/d from the center, but on the opposite side of the sphere from the charge q. So if q is at distance d, the image charge is at R²/d, but on the same line.

Wait, let's say the charge q is at a point P, distance d from the center of the sphere. The image charge would be located at a point P', along the same line CP (C is the center), but on the opposite side of the sphere. So the distance from C to P is d, and from C to P' is R²/d. So the distance between q and the image charge is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d. That's the distance between the two charges.

Wait, but why is the image charge placed at R²/d? Because when you have a conducting sphere, the image charge's position is determined such that the potential on the sphere's surface is the same as it would be without the image charge, which in this case is zero because the sphere is grounded.

So, the potential energy of the system would be the potential energy of the two charges q and q' in each other's field. Since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the image charge q' would be in the sphere, which is at zero potential.

Wait, but what about the potential energy? The potential energy U is the work done to bring the charges together. So the system consists of the charge q and the image charge q'. The potential energy would be the work done to bring q and q' together, which is U = (1/2) k q q' / r, where r is the distance between them.

Wait, but q' is the image charge, which is - (R q)/d. Or is that correct? Hmm, wait, I think the image charge's magnitude is (R^3)/(d²) * q, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me get this straight. The image charge for a point charge outside a conducting sphere. The image charge is inside the sphere, and the magnitude is given by q' = (R^2/d) q. Wait, no, maybe it's q' = (R²/d) q. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe the image charge is q' = - (R^2/d) q. Because the sphere is a conductor, so the image charge must be such that the potential on the surface is the same as if the sphere weren't there. But wait, the sphere is grounded, so the potential on the surface is zero. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Wait, perhaps another approach is better. The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring charge q from infinity to a point d away from the sphere. But because the sphere is a conductor, the presence of the charge induces charges on the sphere, which affects the potential energy.

But the sphere is grounded, so it's at zero potential. So the potential at the point where q is placed is just the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is a conductor, the induced charges arrange themselves on the surface such that the potential inside the conductor is uniform.

Alternatively, maybe the potential energy can be found by considering the work done to bring the charge q to its position, considering the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, but the sphere's potential is zero because it's grounded. So when we bring the charge q to a distance d, the potential energy would be the work done against the electric field, which is the integral of F·dr. But I'm not sure about that approach.

Alternatively, the potential energy U is given by the charge q multiplied by the potential at the point where it's placed, due to all other charges. But since the sphere is conducting and at zero potential, the potential at the point where q is placed is due to the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, but how do I find this potential? Because the sphere's induced charges are due to the charge q. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps using the method of images is the right approach. Let's model the sphere as if it's a conductor with an image charge inside. Then, the potential energy is the sum of the potential energy due to q and q', but since the sphere is grounded, the image charge's potential is accounted for.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recall the formula for the potential energy when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere. I think the image charge approach gives U = (1/2) k q q' / r, where r is the distance between q and q', and q' is the image charge.

So, the image charge q' is located at a distance R²/d from the center, in the opposite direction from q. The distance between q and q' would be d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

Wait, but the image charge's magnitude is q' = - (R^2/d) q. So the product q q' is - (R^2/d) q^2.

So the potential energy would be (1/2) * k * q q' / r, where r is (d² - R²)/d.

Putting it together: U = (1/2) * k * (- (R²/d) q²) / ( (d² - R²)/d )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Denominator: (d² - R²)/d = (d² - R²)/d.

So U = (1/2) * k * (- (R² q²)/d ) * (d / (d² - R²)) )

The d in the numerator and denominator cancels out.

So U = (1/2) * k * (- R² q² ) / (d² - R² )

Wait, but d² - R² is the same as (d^2 - R^2), which appears in the denominator.

So U becomes: - (1/2) k R² q² / (d² - R² )

Looking at the options, option C says U=-(1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R^2), which matches.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the image charge approach. Because the sphere is grounded, the image charge is inside the sphere, and the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So the image charge's potential must account for that.

Wait, in the image charge method, the potential on the sphere's surface due to the image charge and the real charge must be zero. So the potential due to q and q' at the surface is zero.

So, the potential at the surface due to q is k q / (distance from q to surface point), and due to q' is k q' / (distance from q' to surface point). The sum must be zero.

But perhaps using the formula for the image charge when the sphere is grounded. Wait, when the sphere is ungrounded, the image charge is q' = q (R/d). But when the sphere is grounded, the image charge is different.

Wait, no, actually, the image charge depends on the situation. For a sphere that's conducting and isolated (not grounded), the image charge would be as I thought earlier. But for a grounded sphere, perhaps the image charge is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the image charge approach isn't applicable here because the sphere is grounded. Because when the sphere is grounded, the image charge might be at a different position or not present in the same way.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the sphere being grounded leads to the potential on its surface being zero. So the potential due to the charge q and any induced charges must be zero on the sphere's surface.

Wait, but if the sphere is a conductor, the induced charges would be on the surface, but because it's grounded, those charges can leave, meaning the sphere's net charge is zero. So the only charge present is q, but that's not right because the sphere would have induced charges but they would be such that the net charge is zero.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. The potential energy of the system is the work done in assembling the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

But since the sphere is grounded, any induced charges can flow away, leaving no net charge on the sphere. Therefore, the only potential energy comes from the work done in bringing the charge q to its position.

Wait, but the induced charges on the sphere would also contribute to the potential energy, but since the sphere is grounded, perhaps the potential energy doesn't include the energy stored in the induced charges because they can flow away.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. The potential energy should account for the interaction between q and the induced charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is simply the work done in bringing the charge q to a distance d from the sphere, which is the potential at that point multiplied by q.

But the potential at the point where q is placed is due to the induced charges on the sphere. Since the sphere is a conductor, the potential inside is the same as on the surface. Wait, but the point where q is placed is outside the sphere, so the potential there is due to the induced charges.

Wait, but the sphere's potential is zero because it's grounded. So the potential at the point where q is placed is due to the induced charges, which in turn depend on q. Hmm.

Let me think about the potential at a point outside a grounded conducting sphere. The potential due to the sphere's induced charges at a distance d from the center would be the same as the potential due to a charge Q at the center. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential is zero on the surface. So the potential inside the sphere is zero, and outside, it would be the same as that of a point charge Q at the center.

Wait, but in reality, the induced charges would produce a potential outside that's the same as if the charge were at the center. So the potential at point P (distance d from center) would be V = k Q / d, where Q is the total induced charge. But since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero, so V = 0 at r = R. So the potential at P would be V = k Q / d.

But since the sphere is grounded, the potential on the sphere is zero, which implies that the potential at the surface (r=R) is zero. So,

At r = R, V = k Q / R = 0 → Q = 0. So the induced charge Q is zero. But that can't be right because when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, it induces charges on the sphere.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The induced charge would be such that the potential inside the conductor is zero, but the potential outside depends on the induced charge.

Wait, for a conductor, the electric field inside is zero. So the potential inside is constant. But the sphere is grounded, so this potential must be the same as the ground's potential, which is zero.

So, the potential outside the sphere at a point P is given by the potential due to the induced charge Q. But since the sphere is a conductor, the induced charge Q would arrange itself such that the potential outside is as if the charge were at the center.

Wait, so if the point charge q is outside, the induced charge Q on the sphere would be such that the potential outside is the same as that produced by Q at the center.

But the potential at the surface (r=R) is zero because it's grounded. So the potential due to Q at r=R is zero. Therefore,

V(R) = k Q / R = 0 → Q=0. That's strange because I thought there would be induced charges, but if they lead to no net charge, then the potential outside would be the same as if the sphere weren't there.

Wait, but that can't be right because the presence of the sphere changes the potential. Hmm, perhaps this approach is leading me astray. Let me try another approach.

The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the sphere's induced charges.

But if the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero, so the potential at the point where q is placed is just the potential due to itself and the induced charges. Wait, but the induced charges are due to q. So the potential at that point would be the sum of the potential due to q and the induced charges.

But that seems a bit circular. Alternatively, maybe the potential energy U is the work done by the external force in bringing q to that point, which is the integral of F · dr, where F is the electric force.

But without knowing the electric field, this might not be straightforward.

Wait, but perhaps using the method of images, the potential energy is given by the formula for the system of the charge q and the image charge q', which is the same as the potential energy of two point charges.

So, with the image charge approach, the potential energy U is (1/2) k q q' / r, where r is the distance between q and q'.

Earlier, I thought q' is -(R²/d) q and r is (d² - R²)/d. So putting these together,

U = (1/2) k * q * ( - R² q / d ) / ( (d² - R²)/d )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The denominator is (d² - R²)/d. So,

U = (1/2) * k * ( - R² q² / d ) * ( d / (d² - R²) )

The d in numerator and denominator cancels:

U = (1/2) * k * (- R² q²) / (d² - R² )

Which is U = - (1/2) k R² q² / (d² - R² )

Looking at the options, option C is U= - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R^2), which matches.

But wait, in this case, is the image charge correct? Because if the sphere is grounded, the image charge might be different. Wait, wait, no, the image charge approach applies to the conductor regardless of whether it's grounded. Because the image charge represents the effect of the induced charges on the conductor. So whether the conductor is grounded or not, the image charge accounts for the induced charges. But when it's grounded, the net charge on the conductor is zero, so the image charge's value must reflect that.

Wait, but in the image method, when the sphere is grounded, the image charge is such that the conductor's potential is zero. So the image charge's placement and value are determined by the condition that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.

But perhaps I should think about the image charge correctly. The image charge for a conducting sphere when a charge q is placed outside is given by q' = -(R²/d) q, placed inside the sphere at a distance of R²/d from the center along the line connecting q and the center.

So, the potential energy would be the potential energy of the system of q and q', which is (1/2) k q q' / r, where r is the distance between them.

So, q' is -(R²/d) q, and r is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So,

U = (1/2) k * q * ( - R² q / d ) / ( (d² - R²) / d )

Simplify:

Multiply numerator and denominator:

= (1/2) k * ( - R² q² ) / d * d / (d² - R²)

The d's cancel, so:

U = -(1/2) k R² q² / (d² - R² )

Which is exactly option C.

So the answer should be option C.


To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we consider the interaction between the charge \( q \) and the grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \). The sphere being grounded ensures that its potential is zero, and the induced charges on the sphere flow to the ground, leaving no net charge on the sphere. However, the induced charges still influence the potential energy of the system.

Using the method of images, the conducting sphere can be replaced by an image charge \( q' \) inside the sphere. The image charge \( q' \) is located at a distance \( R^2/d \) from the center of the sphere along the line connecting the charge \( q \) and the center of the sphere. The magnitude of the image charge is \( q' = -\frac{R^2}{d} q \). The distance between the charge \( q \) and the image charge \( q' \) is \( r = d - \frac{R^2}{d} = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \).

The potential energy \( U \) of the system is the work done to bring the charge \( q \) and the image charge \( q' \) into their respective positions. This is given by:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{q q'}{r}
\]

Substituting \( q' = -\frac{R^2}{d} q \) and \( r = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \), we get:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} k \cdot q \cdot \left(-\frac{R^2}{d} q\right) \cdot \frac{d}{d^2 - R^2}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k R^2 q^2}{d^2 - R^2}
\]

This matches option C. Thus, the net potential energy of the system is:

\[
U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k q^2 R^2}{d^2 - R^2}
\]
