Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow because I'm a bit new to this. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from benzene, and the options give different reaction sequences. Hmm, I remember that electrophilic substitution reactions are common for benzene rings.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me draw that structure mentally. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Wait, wait, benzene numbering can be a bit tricky. Let me imagine the positions. Oh right, numbering starts from the ethoxy group as position 1. So, the substituents would be at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, it's a meta arrangement between the nitro and ethoxy groups, and the tert-butyl is adjacent to ethoxy.

I think the synthesis will involve several substitution reactions, each adding a group in the correct position. Let's think about the directing effects of each group. The tert-butyl is a bulky substituent. Wait, no, tert-butyl is an alkyl group, so it's an activating group, and it's a para/ortho director. The nitro group is a strong deactivating and meta-directing. Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director.

Wait, but when we add substituents, the order matters because each new group will direct the next substitution. So the strategy is to add the groups in an order that allows each new group to be added correctly.

So the target has three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. Let's plan the order of addition.

Hmm. One approach is to add the groups in an order where each new group is added where it can be directed by the existing substituents. Let me think: maybe first add the ethoxy group, then the tert-butyl, then the nitro? Or maybe add the tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Wait, but adding nitro can be tricky because it's a strong meta director. Once nitro is present, any subsequent substitution will
