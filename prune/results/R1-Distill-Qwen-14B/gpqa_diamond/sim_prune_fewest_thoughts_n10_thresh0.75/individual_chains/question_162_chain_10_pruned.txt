Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that the metric given describes a two-dimensional surface. The metric is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this looks like a conformally flat metric because it's just a scalar function multiplied by the flat metric (dx² + dy²). Conformally flat metrics are easier to handle since you can often use coordinates more effectively.

I recall that the area of a surface in such a metric can be found by integrating the area element. The area element in this case would be the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor multiplied by dxdy. But wait, since it's conformally flat, the determinant is just the square of the conformal factor. So the area element dA would be [sqrt(g)] dxdy, where g is the determinant. Here, g = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)]². So √g is 32/(4 - x² - y²).

But wait, the metric is given in terms of x and y, but I'm supposed to find the area of the pseudosphere. Pseudosphere sounds like a surface of constant negative curvature. Oh right, in hyperbolic geometry, pseudospheres are models with negative curvature.

Wait, the metric given actually looks similar to the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic space. The Poincaré disk
