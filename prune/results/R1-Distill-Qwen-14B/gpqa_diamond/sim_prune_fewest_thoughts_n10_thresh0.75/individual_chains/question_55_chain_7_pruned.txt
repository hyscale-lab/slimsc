Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are between different propenyl and butenyl acetates, and whether they're cis or trans.

First, let me list out the given NMR data:

- 7.0 ppm: 1H, doublet, J = 16.0 Hz
- 5.5 ppm: 1H, doublet of quadruplets (dq)
- 2.1 ppm: 3H, singlet
- 1.6 ppm: 3H, doublet

So, I need to match these signals to the possible structures of the options.

Let me recall what these NMR signals usually indicate. The singlet at 2.1 ppm for 3H is likely a methyl group attached to an oxygen, like an acetate group. So that makes sense because all the options are acetates. The acetate's methyl is typically around 2 ppm as a singlet.

Now, looking at the other signals. The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a large coupling constant (J=16 Hz). That's a big coupling, so maybe it's an aromatic proton or perhaps a vinylic (spÂ²) proton. Wait, since the options are propenyl or butenyl acetates, they have double bonds, so vinylic protons are likely.

Then there's the 5.5 ppm signal, a dq. That's a bit more downfield than typical for a simple alkene proton. Let me think about the structures.

The options are either propenyl or butenyl, so let's think about the structures.

For propenyl acetate, the structure would be something like CH2CH2OAc, but wait, no. Let me correct that. Acetate esters have the structure R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, acetate is OAc which is O-CO-CH3. So the ester would be R-O-CO-CH3. So for propenyl, the R is propenyl.

Wait, propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-. But wait, the propenyl group is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc? Or is it CH2=CH-OAc? No, no, wait. The structure of propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but wait, that's not correct because the acetate is OAc-O-R. So R is the propenyl group.

Wait, propenyl group is CH2CH2CH2? No, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- or CH2CH=CH-? Wait, no, propenyl is an allyl group, which is CH2=CHCH2-. But wait, the possible options are propenyl and butenyl.

Wait, let me get the structures right.

First, propenyl acetate: the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3
