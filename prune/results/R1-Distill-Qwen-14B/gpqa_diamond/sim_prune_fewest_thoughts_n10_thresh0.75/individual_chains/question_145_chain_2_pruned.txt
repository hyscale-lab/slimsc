Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about stereoisomers. The compound is 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol. Hmm, that's a mouthful. I need to figure out how many stereoisomers it has. 

Wait, stereoisomers come from chiral centers and geometric isomerism, right? Oh, but wait, I think this compound has double bonds too, so maybe geometric isomerism is a possibility. Let me break it down.

First, I should draw the structure or at least visualize it. Undeca means 11 carbons. So the main chain is 11 carbons long. Let's number them from 1 to 11. 

The substituents are at positions 2, 6, 9, and 5. Wait, the 5 is the alcohol group, -OH. So position 5 is the alcohol. Then, position 2 is methyl, 6 is chloro, 9 is ethyl.

Also, there are double bonds at positions 3 and 7. So, undeca-3,7-diene. That means the double bonds are between carbons 3-4 and 7-8.

So the structure would look something like this: 

1  2  3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
   CH3-C=C-CH2-C-OH-Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3?

Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me try to get the substituents right.

Wait, the compound is 6-chloro, so on carbon 6, there's Cl. 9-ethyl is on carbon 9. 2-methyl on carbon 2. And the double bonds are between 3-4 and 7-8.

So, the structure is:

1: CH2-

2: CH(CH3)-

3: C= 

4: C-

5: CH(OH)-

6: CH2Cl-

7: C= 

8: C-

9: CH2CH2CH3? Wait, 9-ethyl is on carbon 9. So maybe:

Carbon 9 has an ethyl group. So carbon 9 is CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, ethyl is two carbons. So carbon 9 is CH2CH2CH
