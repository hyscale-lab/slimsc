Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me see. The question says that there's a 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the temperature is 25°C. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions. Oh, right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms a complex with Ca²+.

Wait, the problem mentions the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. But I remember that when a complex forms, the metal ions and the ligand combine in a certain ratio. Since it's a 1:1 complex, I think. For Ca-EDTA, the formula is probably CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA part. So the stoichiometry is 1:1.

The K for the complex is given as 5e10. K for the formation of the complex would be Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). Oh wait, but in this problem, the solution contains the complex, so the EDTA is already part of the complex. So I guess the free EDTA in solution is very low because the complex is stable (high K).

So the complex dissociates as CaY²− ⇌ Ca²+ + Y⁴−. The K for this dissociation would be the inverse of the formation constant. Because the formation constant is Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca][Y]). So the dissociation constant Kd would be 1/(Kf). So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, wait. Let's think: when the complex dissociates, each mole gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of Y⁴−. So the expression for Kd is [Ca²+][Y]/[CaY²−] = 1/(Kf). So in this case, Kf is 5e10, so Kd is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Now, the initial concentration of CaY²− is 0.02 M. Let's say the change is x. So when it dissociates, [Ca²+] = x, [Y]
