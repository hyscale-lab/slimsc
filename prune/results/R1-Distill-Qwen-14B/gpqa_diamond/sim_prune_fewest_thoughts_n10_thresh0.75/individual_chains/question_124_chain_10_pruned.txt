Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, alright, the question is about particles being collided in a detector and their Lorentz factor needed for a certain fraction to reach the inner walls.

Wait, the setup: Particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. New particles are produced that travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these reach the inner walls. The detector's radius is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the walls.

I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is related to time dilation and length contraction. Oh right, because particles moving at high speeds (relativistic) will have their lifetime as seen from the lab frame longer due to time dilation. So the proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame) multiplied by gamma gives the dilated lifetime.

So the idea is that the particles have to travel a certain distance before decaying. If they decay before reaching the detector's wall, they won't be detected. But if they live long enough (because of their high speed), they'll make it to the wall and be detected.

The initial case: gamma is 20, and one third reach the walls. So probably, the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector's walls is longer than their lifetime, so only a fraction survive.

Wait, but if the particles are moving at high speed, their lifetime is longer, so more of them would have time to reach the walls. So the fraction that make it is higher when gamma is higher.

In the first scenario, gamma is 20, and 1/3 of them reach. We need to find a gamma such that 2/3 reach.

Wait, but I think the fraction depends on the ratio of the distance they need to travel versus the distance they can cover before decaying. So let's model this.

The detector's radius is 30 meters. The particles are produced at the center, so they have to travel 30 meters to reach the wall.

The lifetime of the particle in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime (tau), so t = gamma * tau.

The speed of the particle is v ≈ c, since they're ultra-relativistic. So the distance they can travel before decaying is approximately v * t = c * gamma tau.

But wait, maybe I should think in terms of the average lifetime. The number of particles that decay before reaching the wall depends on the probability that their lifetime is shorter than the time it takes to reach the wall.

So the time it takes for a particle to reach the wall is t_wall = R / v. Since v ≈ c, approx t_wall = R / c.

But wait, for ultra-relativistic particles, v is approximately c, so t_wall ≈ R/(c). For R=30 meters: t_wall = 30 m / (3e8 m/s) = 1e-7 seconds. Hmm, that's 100 nanoseconds.

The proper lifetime of the particle is tau, so the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau.

The probability that a particle decays before reaching the wall is the probability that its lifetime is less than t_wall. Since the decay is exponential, the survival probability (making it to the wall) is exp(-t_wall/(gamma tau)).

Wait, no. The decay probability in the lab frame is related to the lifetime there. So the decay follows an exponential distribution. The survival probability (not decaying) is exp(-t_wall/(gamma tau)).

Wait, let me think again. The decay rate is given by the exponential decay law. The number of particles N(t) surviving at time t is N0 * exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

In this case, the time t is t_wall = R/(v). Since v ≈ c, t_wall ≈ R/(c).

So the survival probability P is exp(- R/(c gamma tau)).

In the initial scenario, gamma is 20, and P is 1/3. So:

1/3 = exp( - R/(c * 20 * tau)
