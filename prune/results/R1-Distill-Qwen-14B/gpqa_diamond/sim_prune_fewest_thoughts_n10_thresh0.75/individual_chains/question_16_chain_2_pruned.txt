Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a molecule has chirality, which is when it has a carbon center (stereocenter) with four different substituents. But wait, there's more to itâ€”it's not just about having a stereocenter; the molecule must not have a plane of symmetry or an internal center of inversion, otherwise, it might not be chiral even with stereocenters.

So I need to go through each compound and check if it's chiral. Let's take them one by one.

1. First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The molecule is an alkene with substituents in the Z configuration. Wait, but it's a butene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 are Cl and two CH3 groups (since it's 2-methyl). Wait, no, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene structure is Cl-C=C-CH(CH3). Wait, let me draw it. The structure is Cl-C=C-CH2CH3? Or wait, no. Let's see: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but substituted. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? No, wait, perhaps I should count the carbons. But-1-ene has four carbons with the double bond starting at C1. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and another substituent. Oh wait, 2-methyl, so the C2 has CH(CH3). So the structure is Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl and maybe another CH2 group? Hmm, not sure. But the key point is about the Z configuration. But wait, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? If the molecule
