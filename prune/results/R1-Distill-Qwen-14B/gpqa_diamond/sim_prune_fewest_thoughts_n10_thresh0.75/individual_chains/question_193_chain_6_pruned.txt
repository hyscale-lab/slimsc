Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, parallax—right, parallax is a measure of distance. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, no, wait. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So like, parallax (plx) = 1/distance, but in parsecs or something. So higher parallax means closer star.

The number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So if plx increases, 1/plx^5 decreases. So number of stars would decrease as parallax increases. But that makes sense because if stars are closer, there are fewer of them in a given volume? Or wait, maybe it's about the number density. Let's think.

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh, right, so it's about how the number of stars per unit volume (or per some distance interval) changes as you move outwards.

Wait, the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. Let me write that down.

Number of stars N ∝ 1 / plx^5.

But parallax plx is related to distance. Since plx = 1/d (if d is in parsecs), because plx in arcseconds is 1/(distance in parsecs). So plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx.

Substituting
