Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again.

The question is about a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh right, that's the harmonic oscillator potential. The force here follows Hooke's law, so it's like a 3D quantum harmonic oscillator. The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions there are for that energy.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized. Each energy level is given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the total quantum number. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, I think each direction contributes, right? Because in 3D, the oscillator is separable into x, y, z parts. So each has its own quantum number.

Wait, right, the energy levels for each direction are (n_x + 1/2) ħω for x, same for y and z. So the total energy is E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Or sometimes, people define n = n_x + n_y + n_z, and then E = (n + 3/2) ħω. Oh wait, but in this case, n is the sum of the individual quantum numbers. 

Wait, so the ground state is when n_x = n_y = n_z = 0, so n=0. The first excited state would be n=1. But wait, the problem says the third excited state. Oh, because the ground state is n=0, first excited is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3. So the third excited state has n=3.

Wait, no, sometimes the excited states are counted as the first being the one above the ground. So ground is the 0th state, first excited is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3.

So the energy E is (3 + 3/2) ħω, since n=3. That's (9/2) ħω.

Wait, 3 plus 3/2 is 9/2? Let's compute: 3 is 6/2, so 6/2 + 3/2 is 9/2. So E = (9/2) ħω. So among the options, let's check the energies.

Looking at the options, option A is (9/2) ħω, option D has a different expression. So the energy part would be A or maybe another option.

Now, the second part is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the same energy. That's the degeneracy of the energy level. So for a given n, how many ways can n_x, n_y, n_z add up to n?

So for n=3, the possible (n_x, n_y, n_z) triplets where n_x + n_y + n_z = 3.

Each n_x, n_y, n_z is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...). So the number of such triplets is the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = 3. 

The formula for that is (3 + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So the degeneracy is 10.

So the eigenvalue would have 10 eigenfunctions. So the first part of the answer is (9/2) ħω, and the second part is 10.

Looking back at the options, option A says (9/2) ħω and 10. Option C says 3, which is wrong. So option A is the correct one.

Wait, what about the other options? Option B has an energy expression involving pi squared and r squared, which doesn't fit because our potential is a harmonic oscillator, which is a quadratic potential. The energy should be proportional
