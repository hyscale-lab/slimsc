Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down. Let's see what the question is asking.

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, right? So the vector has to have a magnitude (norm) of 1. Let me check that. The vector is [-1, 2, 1]. The norm squared would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state vector should be 1/sqrt(6) times this. So the state is (1/sqrt(6))*[-1, 2, 1]^T. Hmm, I think that's important because the probabilities depend on the state's normalization.

The operators for two observables, P and Q, are given. The matrix for P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it down:

P =
[ 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]

And Q is:
Q =
[1, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, -1]

The question is about measuring P first, then Q. We need the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, but wait. When you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator. So first, I should find the eigenvalues for both P and Q.

Let me start with Q because it looks simpler. The matrix for Q is diagonal, so the eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: 1, 0, -1. So possible outcomes for Q are 1, 0, -1.

For P, the matrix is more complicated. Let me find its eigenvalues. The matrix P is symmetric, so it's diagonalizable. The eigenvalues might be found by solving the characteristic equation det(P - Î»I) =0.

But wait, looking at P: It's a symmetric matrix, so it's Hermitian, ensuring
