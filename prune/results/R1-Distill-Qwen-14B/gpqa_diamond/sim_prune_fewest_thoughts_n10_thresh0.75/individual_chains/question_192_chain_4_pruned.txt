Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's going on.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center, and the cavity itself has radius r, which is smaller than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Wait, point P is outside, so its distance from the conductor's center is L. But it's also at a distance l from the cavity's center. Oh, and the angle between l and s is theta. Both l and L are greater than R, so point P is definitely outside the conductor.

Hmm, I remember that conductors have some specific properties when it comes to electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is uncharged initially, the charges on it must rearrange when +q is placed inside the cavity.

Wait, in a conductor, the charges can move freely. So when you put a charge inside a cavity, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge opposite to it. Since the charge is +q, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) must have -q. But wait, the conductor is neutral overall, so the outer surface must have +q to balance that. Or wait, noâ€”wait, the conductor was uncharged, so the total charge on it must be zero. So the inner surface would have -q, and the outer surface would have +q, right?

Because the conductor as a whole must remain neutral. So the inner cavity's walls have -q to cancel the +q inside, and the outer shell has +q to balance the inner surface's -q, keeping the conductor's total charge zero.

But wait, the conductor has a cavity. When a charge is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's walls) must have an induced charge opposite to the enclosed charge. So in this case, since +q is inside, the inner surface has -q. Then, since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q. Because the total charge on the conductor is zero, so inner is -q, outer is +q: -q + (+q) =
