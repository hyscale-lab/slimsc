Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but let me think this through.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass m attached to a spring in a harmonic oscillator setup. The spring follows Hooke's law, F = -kx. But wait, it's relativistic, so Newtonian mechanics might not apply directly. Right, because at high speeds, relativistic effects come into play.

In the Newtonian case, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement A is (1/2)kA², and this converts into kinetic energy (1/2)mv_max² at the equilibrium point. So solving v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That would be option C, but it's a relativistic scenario, so Newtonian might not be accurate here.

Wait, but the options don't all look like the Newtonian result. So I need to consider relativistic corrections. In relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic; it's the total energy that's conserved. The total energy E would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, the oscillator's potential is quadratic, so perhaps the total energy is higher than in the Newtonian case.

Wait, the potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². In relativity, the energy of the particle would be given by the total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But the kinetic energy in relativity is (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the total energy would be E = (1/2)kA² + mc², because at maximum displacement x=A, all energy is potential. At the equilibrium point x=0, all energy is kinetic plus rest mass. Wait, no. Wait, no, because when x=0, the potential is zero, but the kinetic energy is maximum. But in relativity, the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So maybe E = (1/2)kA² + mc²? Or is it that the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the total energy is E = (1/2)kA² + mc²? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no. The maximum potential energy is (1/2)kA². At that
