Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's think it through. Hmm, the question is about binary star systems and their masses. I remember that binary stars orbit around a common center of mass, and their motion can be observed through radial velocity measurements.

The problem states that there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The periods are the time between primary eclipses, which I think relates to the orbital period. So the orbital period of system_1 is 2 years, system_2 is 1 year.

Then, the radial velocity (RV) measurements show sinusoidal variations. For system_1, the velocities have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. I think the RV amplitude depends on the mass of the companion star and the system's orbital parameters.

Wait, right, in a binary system, the more massive star will have a smaller orbit, so its velocity amplitude (the speed at which it moves towards and away from us) will be smaller. The less massive star will have a larger orbit and thus a larger velocity amplitude. Or wait, no, the velocity is inversely proportional to the mass because of the center of mass thing. So if the mass is higher, the star doesn't have to move as much. So the velocity amplitude is higher for the lower mass star.

But how does this relate to the total mass of the system? I think the RV method gives the mass function, which involves the masses of the stars and the inclination of the orbit. Oh wait, but since both systems are eclipsing, the inclination must be close to 90 degrees, so we can assume that the orbits are edge-on, making the mass function more straightforward. So the mass function gives the mass of the companion relative to the total mass, but in this case, since we can observe both stars' velocities, maybe we can find the actual masses.

Wait, no. Wait, the RV variations for each star in the binary would be such that the ratio of their velocities is inversely proportional to their masses. Because the more massive star would have a smaller orbit, so lower velocity. So if the velocities are v1 and v2 for the two stars, their masses m1 and m2 are proportional to (v2/v1) and (v1/v2), respectively. But wait, the actual masses would be calculated based on the system's period and the velocities.

The formula I remember for the mass of a star from RV is something like M = (v * P) / (2π G), but I might be mixing up the exact terms. Alternatively, I think the mass function for a binary system is (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) ), but since it's an eclipsing binary, sin i is approximately 1, so we can ignore that. But wait, in this case, both stars' RVs are observed, so perhaps we can find their individual masses.

Wait, another approach: the ratio of the velocities of the two stars in a binary system is inversely proportional to their masses. So v1 / v2 = m2 / m1. Because the more massive star moves slower. So for system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. So v1 is 10, v2 is 5. Then, 10/5 = 1, so m2/m1 = 1. So m2 = m1. That suggests that both stars have equal masses in system_1.

Similarly, for system_2, the velocities are 15 and 10 km/s. So v1=15, v2=10. The ratio is 15:10 = 3:2. So m2/m1 = 3/2. So m2 = (3/2)m1. So the mass of star 2 is 1.5 times that of star 1.

Wait, but let me get this right. Let me think again: the more massive star moves slower. So if star A has mass m_A and velocity v_A, and star B has m_B and v_B, then m_A/m_B = v_B / v_A. So for system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5. So m1/m2 = v2 / v1 = 5/10 = 1/2. So m1 = (1/2) m2 → which implies m2 is twice m1. Wait, no, that can't be right because if m1 is less than m2, then m1/m2 is 1/2, so m2 is 2 m1. So m2 is more massive than m1. So in system_1, the masses would be m1 and 2 m1. So total mass is 3 m1.

Wait, but wait, in system_1,
