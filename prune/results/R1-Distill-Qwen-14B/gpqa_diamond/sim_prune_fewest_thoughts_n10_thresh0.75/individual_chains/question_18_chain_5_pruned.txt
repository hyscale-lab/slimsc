Okay, so I have this question about stellar abundances, and I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, I'll read the question carefully. Both stars have masses higher than our Sun, 1.5 and 1.2 times. But I'm not sure if their masses directly affect the abundance ratios, but maybe it's a red herring. The question is about photospheric composition, so perhaps the mass affects other things, but maybe not the abundances directly. I'll keep that in mind.

The given data includes the following elemental abundances determined by the EW method, assuming LTE. So, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex for Star_1. [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 dex for Star_2. Also, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. And the Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7.

Wait, the notation [X/Y] means log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the number of X to Y atoms relative to the Sun.

So the goal is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2's photospheres, n_Si1 / n_Si2.

I think I need to find [Si/H] for each star and then compute the ratio. Or perhaps determine [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H] for each to get [Si/H], then calculate the ratio.

Let me jot down the given data:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0.

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0.

The Sun's values:
- log10(nFeH_sun) = 7.5 -12 => wait wait, the formula given is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5).

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 => log10(nMg/nH) =7-12 = -5 â†’ nMg/nH = 1e-5.

So the solar [X/H] for Fe is log10(nFe/nH)_sun = -4.5. Similarly, [Mg/H]_
