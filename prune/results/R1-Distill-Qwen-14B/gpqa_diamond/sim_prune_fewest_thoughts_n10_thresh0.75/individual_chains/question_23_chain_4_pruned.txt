Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully. The question is about a reaction involving a specific compound and hydrogen bromide. Then, after some time, they checked the reaction using TLC and found that the reactant spot had diminished, with two new spots appearing. The options are possible products, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

The compound in question is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Hmm, I should draw that structure to visualize it. So, benzene ring with an ether group (O-) connected to a butenyl chain. The butenyl is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. Let me break that down: the butenyl chain has four carbons. The substituents are two methyl groups on the second carbon, and the double bond is between carbons three and four. So the structure is CH2-CH(C)(C)-CH2-CH2, but wait, no, the double bond is between C3 and C4, so it's CH2-CH(C)(C)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond?

Wait, more accurately: the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, wait, butenyl is four carbons with a double bond. The substituents are on C2. So, the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, no, but-3-enyl would be four carbons with double bond starting at C3. So positions are 1, 2, 3, 4. So but-3-enyl is CH2CH2CH=CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the substituent on carbon 1. Wait, no, the but-3-en-1-yl group is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, no, but-3-enyl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? Hmm, getting confused.

Wait, I think the correct structure is: the butenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but with substituents. Wait, no, the starting point is
