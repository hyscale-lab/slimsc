Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to unpack the information given.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X, liquid Y, and some products. There's also a mention of a keto acid reacting with X. The goal is to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are numbers like 25, 29, etc., so I'm thinking they add up two atomic masses.

First, let me read the problem again carefully.

Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, since a molecule's protons are the atomic number, and neutrons add to the mass number, same count for bothâ€”so the molecule must be something where protons + neutrons per molecule are equal. Wait, actually, for each atom in the molecule, the number of protons and neutrons must be the same. Or maybe the molecule as a whole has equal numbers? Hmm, not sure. Let me think.

Wait, the molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for each molecule, the total neutrons equals the total protons. So, for example, if the molecule is H2O, that's 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and one O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So total protons would be 2 + 8 =10, and neutrons would be 0 +8=8. Not equal. So that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: the molecule is something like CO2. Let's see. C is 6 protons, 6 neutrons (if it's the isotope 12C). O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons (if it's 16O). So CO2 would have 6+16*2= (6+32)=38 protons and neutrons. Wait, wait, wait. Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, so two O would be 16 protons and 16 neutrons. C has 6 in each. So total protons: 6 + 16 =22. Neutrons: 6 (from C) + 16 (from O) =2
