Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these acid-base reactions. The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other, but I need to think through the steps carefully.

Let me read the problem again. It's 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide). I need to find the pH of the resulting solution.

Wait, I think the first thing I should do is figure out the total volume of the solution after mixing. Because all the volumes are given, I can add them together. So 500 + 400 + 300 equals 1200 mL, which is 1.2 liters. That's going to be useful for calculating concentrations after mixing.

Now, I need to figure out the moles of each acid and base. Moles are calculated as Molarity multiplied by Volume (in liters).

Let me calculate each one:

For CH3COOH (acetic acid):
Molarity is 0.1 M, volume is 0.5 L (500 mL). So moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

For HCl (hydrochloric acid):
Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely, providing H+ ions.

For Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide):
Molarity is 0.3 M, volume is 0.3 L. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH^- ions. So moles of OH^- = 0.3 * 0.3 * 2 = 0.18 moles? Wait, wait. Let me think again. Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2 OH⁻. So for each mole of Ba(OH)2, we get 2 moles of OH-. So yes, 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, which gives 0.18 moles of OH-.

Now, I need to figure out the net reaction between the acids and the base. The H+ ions from HCl and CH3COOH will react with the OH- ions from Ba(OH)2.

But wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully dissociate. In the presence of a strong acid like HCl, I think the H+ from
