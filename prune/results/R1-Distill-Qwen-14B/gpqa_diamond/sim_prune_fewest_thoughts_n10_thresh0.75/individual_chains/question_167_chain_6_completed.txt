Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I remember that non-Gaussian states are important in quantum optics and quantum information because they can't be described by Gaussian operations alone, which are easier to handle. 

The problem gives me the state |psi> as (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. N is the normalization constant, which is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2alpha²)). Oh wait, I remember that |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, right? Coherent states are Gaussian states because they minimize the uncertainty principle and their Wigner functions are Gaussian.

The non-Gaussianity here is measured using relative entropy. The formula given is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where tau is the density matrix of a Gaussian reference state, and rho is the density matrix of our non-Gaussian state.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about what del_b represents. Oh right, the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is a measure comparing the state's entropy to a Gaussian state's entropy. If del_b is positive, the state is more non-Gaussian than the reference.

But wait, in this case, maybe the state is Gaussian? Because the state is a superposition of two coherent states. But wait, coherent states are Gaussian, but their superpositions are usually non-Gaussian. Unless in specific cases. Oh, but wait, I think if the state is a coherent state itself, then it's Gaussian. Alternatively, maybe if the state is a squeezed state or some Gaussian operation on a coherent state, but a superposition like this, it's non-Gaussian.

Wait, the state is |psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. So for example, if phi is 0, then it's just |alpha> scaled by cos(0)=1, which is a coherent state. Similarly, if phi is pi/2, then it's sin(phi)=1, so it's |-alpha>. But when phi is something else, like pi/4, then it's a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, which is a non-Gaussian state.

But in the given case, phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5. So I need to compute the non-Gaussianity for these parameters.

Wait, but the non-Gaussianity is the relative entropy between rho (the state's density matrix) and tau (a Gaussian reference state). But wait, what's tau in this case? The problem says tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the state we'd get if the parameters made |psi> a Gaussian state. Hmm, but when is this state |psi> Gaussian?

Wait, coherent states are Gaussian, so if the state |psi> is a coherent state, then it's Gaussian. Let's see when that happens. The state |psi> would be a coherent state if it's a single coherent state, like when sin(phi) is zero or cos(phi) is zero. For example, phi=0 would give |psi> = |alpha>, which is a coherent state. Similarly, phi=pi/2 would give |psi> = |-alpha>, another coherent state.

But when phi is not 0 or pi/2, it's a superposition and hence non-Gaussian. So for phi=-pi/4, the state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, which is non-Gaussian. So the state rho is non-Gaussian, and tau is a Gaussian state, perhaps the closest Gaussian state to rho in terms of relative entropy. Alternatively, maybe tau is the Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments as rho, like the displacement and squeezing parameters adjusted to match the moments. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

But wait, the problem says to calculate the non-Gaussianity using the relative entropy measure. So perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the one obtained by minimizing the relative entropy, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the reference state is the thermal state? Or maybe it's the state that would be Gaussian and closest to rho in some way.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is the state that is Gaussian and has the same first moments as rho. Wait, but coherent states have well-defined position and momentum, so perhaps the reference state is the coherent state that matches the expectation values of position and momentum of rho. Because the superposition state would have the same expectation values as the coherent state if phi is such that the interference terms in the expectation values vanish.

Wait, let's compute the expectation values of position and momentum for |psi>. The expectation value of the position operator (x) for a coherent state |alpha> is proportional to alpha. Let me think, x is proportional to (a + a†), so for |alpha>, <x> would be proportional to alpha. Similarly, for |-alpha>, <x> would be proportional to -alpha.

So the expectation value of x in |psi> would be:

cos(phi) * <alpha|x|alpha> + sin(phi) * <(-alpha)|x|(-alpha)>.

Wait, but <alpha|x|alpha> is Re(alpha) times sqrt(2) times some constants, perhaps. Wait, actually, the expectation value of x for |alpha> is (sqrt(2} ) Re(alpha), and for p it's (sqrt(2} ) Im(alpha). Let me just note that <x> for |alpha> is proportional to alpha (real part), and similarly for | -alpha> it's proportional to -alpha.

So for the state |psi>, the expectation value of x would be:

( cos(phi) * <alpha|x|alpha> + sin(phi) * <(-alpha)|x|(-alpha> ) ) / N^2.

But N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). So N squared is 1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²).

So let's compute <x>:

Assume x is (a + a†)/sqrt(2), so <x> for |alpha> is alpha * sqrt(2) * Re(alpha) ? Wait, maybe better to compute <alpha| x |alpha>.

Wait, x is (a + a†) / sqrt(2). So <alpha| x |alpha> = (alpha + alpha*) / sqrt(2) = 2 Re(alpha) / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) Re(alpha). Similarly for p, it's (a - a†)/(i sqrt(2)), so <p> = (alpha - alpha*) / i sqrt(2) ) = i (alpha - alpha*) / sqrt(2) ) = sqrt(2) Im(alpha).

So for |alpha>, <x> is sqrt(2) Re(alpha), and <p> is sqrt(2) Im(alpha).

Similarly, for | -alpha>, <x> would be sqrt(2) Re(-alpha) = - sqrt(2) Re(alpha), and <p> would be sqrt(2) Im(-alpha) = - sqrt(2) Im(alpha).

So the expectation value of x in |psi> is:

[ cos(phi) * sqrt(2) Re(alpha) + sin(phi) * (- sqrt(2) Re(alpha)) ] / N^2.

Wait, wait, because when you have | -alpha>, the expectation value is for x, which is - Re(alpha) times sqrt(2}.

So substituting:

<x> = [ cos(phi) * sqrt(2) Re(alpha) + sin(phi) * (- sqrt(2) Re(alpha)) ] / (1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)).

Factor out sqrt(2) Re(alpha):

= sqrt(2) Re(alpha) [ cos(phi) - sin(phi) ] / N².

But N squared is 1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²).

Similarly, the expectation value of p would be similar:

<p> = [ cos(phi) * sqrt(2) Im(alpha) + sin(phi) * (- sqrt(2) Im(alpha)) ] / N².

Which becomes sqrt(2) Im(alpha) [ cos(phi) - sin(phi) ] / N squared.

Wait, but let's plug in the given values: phi = -pi/4, alpha = 0.5.

So, phi is negative pi/4, so cos(phi) is cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, and sin(phi) is sin(-pi/4) = - sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So cos(phi) - sin(phi) is (0.7071) - (-0.7071) )= 1.4142 ≈ sqrt(2).

Similarly, Re(alpha) is 0.5, and Im(alpha) is 0 since alpha is 0.5 (a real number).

So <x> is sqrt(2) * 0.5 * sqrt(2) / N².

Because Re(alpha) is 0.5, and [ cos(phi) - sin(phi) ] is sqrt(2).

So sqrt(2) * 0.5 * sqrt(2) is 2 * 0.5 = 1.

So <x> = 1 / N².

What is N squared? N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)).

Compute sin(2phi): 2phi is -pi/2. sin(-pi/2) is -1.

So N squared = 1 + (-1)*exp( -2*(0.5)^2 ) = 1 + (-1)*exp( -0.5 )

Exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065.

So N² = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935.

So <x> = 1 / 0.3935 ≈ 2.54.

Wait, but wait: because in the numerator, the calculation for <x> is [ cos(phi) * <alpha|x|alpha> + sin(phi) < (-alpha)|x|(-alpha) > ] / N².

Wait, but < (-alpha)|x| (-alpha) > is - sqrt(2) Re(alpha), right? Because |-alpha> has expectation value - Re(alpha) sqrt(2) for x.

Similarly, <alpha|x|alpha> is sqrt(2) Re(alpha).

So for the numerator:

cos(phi) * sqrt(2) Re(alpha) + sin(phi) * (- sqrt(2) Re(alpha)).

Which is sqrt(2) Re(alpha) [ cos(phi) - sin(phi) ].

So as before.

But for phi = -pi/4, cos(phi) = sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi) = -sqrt(2)/2.

So [ cos(phi) - sin(phi) ] = sqrt(2)/2 - (- sqrt(2)/2 ) = sqrt(2).

So numerator is sqrt(2) * 0.5 * sqrt(2) = 2 * 0.5 = 1.

Denominator N² = 0.3935.

So <x> = 1 / 0.3935 ≈ 2.54.

Wait, but wait, let me compute N exactly.

Given alpha =0.5, phi=-pi/4.

sin(2 phi) = sin( -pi/2 ) = -1.

So N² = 1 + (-1) * exp( -2*(0.5)^2 ) = 1 - exp(-0.5).

exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.60653066.

So N² ≈ 1 - 0.60653066 ≈ 0.39346934.

So N ≈ sqrt(0.39346934) ≈ 0.6273.

Now, the expectation value of x is 1 / 0.39346934 ≈ 2.54.

Similarly, the expectation value of p is sqrt(2) Im(alpha) [ cos(phi) - sin(phi) ] / N².

But Im(alpha) is zero because alpha is 0.5, a real number. So <p> is zero.

So the state |psi> has mean x of approximately 2.54 and mean p of zero.

If the reference Gaussian state tau is the coherent state with the same mean x and zero p, then tau would be |beta>, where beta has real part 2.54 / sqrt(2) and imaginary part zero. Wait, because the coherent state |beta> has <x> = sqrt(2) Re(beta), right? So if we set sqrt(2) Re(beta) = <x>, then Re(beta) = <x> / sqrt(2) ≈ 2.54 / 1.414 ≈ 1.795.

Wait, but wait, I might have to get this right. The coherent state |beta> is given by e^{-|beta|^2/2} sum (beta^n / sqrt(n!)) |n>. The expectation value of x is sqrt(2) Re(beta), and p is sqrt(2) Im(beta). 

So if our state rho has <x> = x0 and <p> = p0, then the reference coherent state tau would have beta = (x0 + i p0)/sqrt(2). Since our rho has <p> =0, beta would be x0 / sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait, in our case, <x> is about 2.54 and <p> is zero. So beta would be (2.54 + 0i)/sqrt(2) ≈ 2.54/(1.414) ≈ 1.795. So the reference state tau is |beta>, with beta ≈ 1.795.

Then, the density matrices rho and tau are:

rho = |psi><psi|.

tau = |beta><beta|.

So the relative entropy would be S(rho || tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau).

Wait, but wait, the relative entropy of quantum states is usually defined as S(rho || tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau), but the problem defines del_b as trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). Wait, that's a bit confusing because the order is reversed.

Wait, the formula given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)].

So it's the entropy of rho minus the entropy of tau. So if rho is non-Gaussian and has higher entropy than tau, del_b would be positive. But wait, the entropy of a pure state is zero. Wait, wait, rho is |psi><psi|, a pure state, so its entropy is zero. Because for a pure state, rho^2 = rho, so Tr(rho ln rho) = Tr(rho ln rho) = ln 1 = 0? Wait, no. Wait, rho is a pure state, so rho^2 = rho, so the eigenvalues are 1 and 0s. So the von Neumann entropy S(rho) is - sum lambda ln lambda, which would be 0 for a pure state. So Tr(rho ln rho) would be zero.

Wait, but wait, wait: rho is |psi><psi|, so it's a pure state. So the entropy S(rho) is zero.

Tau is the reference Gaussian state, which would be a pure state if it's a coherent state. Wait, coherent states are also pure states. So tau is |beta><beta|, so its entropy is also zero.

So del_b would be zero minus zero, which is zero. But that can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the reference state tau isn't a coherent state but a thermal state, or some other Gaussian state. Or perhaps the problem is using a different reference state. Alternatively, maybe the reference state is the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken in assuming that tau is a coherent state. Maybe the problem uses the reference as the closest Gaussian state under some metric, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the relative entropy measure is between the state rho and a Gaussian state that best approximates rho. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the same as the state when phi is chosen such that the superposition reduces to a coherent state, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think again. For phi = -pi/4 and alpha =0.5, the state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>. So it's a non-Gaussian state. The density matrix rho is a pure state, but it's non-Gaussian.

The reference Gaussian state tau could be the coherent state with the same expectation values of x and p as rho, which we found to be x≈2.54 and p=0. So tau is |beta>, where beta is x/sqrt(2) ≈ 2.54 / 1.414 ≈ 1.795.

But rho is a pure state, so Tr(rho ln rho) is zero. Similarly, for tau as a pure state, Tr(tau ln tau) is also zero. So del_b would be zero, which is option D.

But that can't be right because a non-Gaussian state should have non-zero non-Gaussianity. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not comparing rho and tau as pure states but as mixed states. Alternatively, maybe the reference state is not a coherent state but some other Gaussian state, like a squeezed state or a thermal state.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy is being calculated in a different way. Perhaps the reference state tau is not a coherent state but the vacuum state, but that would complicate things.

Wait, another approach: the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is sometimes defined as the relative entropy between the state and the closest Gaussian state. So perhaps tau is the Gaussian state that is closest to rho in terms of relative entropy. If that's the case, then for a pure state rho, the closest Gaussian state might not be a coherent state.

Alternatively, perhaps the state |psi> can be expressed as a Gaussian state under certain conditions. For example, when the parameters phi and alpha are such that the state ends up being a coherent state. But in our case, with phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5, it's a superposition, so it's non-Gaussian.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again about the expression for |psi>.

|psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N.

Which can be rewritten as:

= [ cos(phi) e^{-|alpha|^2/2} sum (alpha^n / sqrt(n!)) |n> 
  + sin(phi) e^{-|alpha|^2/2} sum ( (-alpha)^n / sqrt(n!)) |n> ] 
  / N.

Factor out e^{-|alpha|^2/2} / N:

= e^{-|alpha|^2/2} / N sum [ cos(phi) alpha^n + sin(phi) (-alpha)^n ] |n> / sqrt(n!).

Wait, but if we can write this as a single coherent state, but I don't think that's possible. Because a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha> is not a coherent state. So, rho is non-Gaussian.

But earlier, when I calculated the expectation values, I found that <x> is about 2.54 and <p> is zero. So the reference Gaussian state tau would have the same expectations. So if tau is a coherent state |beta>, then beta = <x> / sqrt(2) ≈ 2.54 / 1.414 ≈ 1.795.

So tau is |beta>, with beta ≈1.795.

So rho is a pure state (so Tr(rho ln rho) =0), and tau is a pure state as well (Tr(tau ln tau)=0). So del_b would be 0 - 0 = 0. That suggests the non-Gaussianity is zero, which can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the relative entropy measure. Because in the formula del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), if both are pure states, then both terms are zero, so del_b is zero. But that would imply that all pure states have zero non-Gaussianity, which is not the case. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait another thought: perhaps the reference state is not a pure Gaussian state but a maximally mixed Gaussian state, which would have non-zero entropy. For example, the reference could be a thermal state with some temperature. Or perhaps the reference is the vacuum state, which is a Gaussian state.

Wait, but the vacuum state is a pure Gaussian state. So if tau is the vacuum, then its density matrix is |0><0|, and Tr(tau ln tau) is zero.

So in that case, del_b would be Tr(rho ln rho) - 0 = 0, since rho is a pure state.

But that can't be right either, because then the non-Gaussianity would be zero, which is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is the completely mixed Gaussian state. For example, the maximally mixed state, which would have density matrix proportional to the identity matrix. But for a single mode, I think the maximally mixed Gaussian state is the thermal state at infinite temperature, which would have density matrix (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1| + ...) ), but that's not a valid density matrix because it doesn't sum to 1. Alternatively, the maximally mixed state would have equal probabilities for all basis states, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different definition of non-Gaussianity. Maybe the relative entropy is computed differently, such as using the von Neumann entropy of the state compared to the reference Gaussian state, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the state |psi> is a Gaussian state. But that seems unlikely because it's a superposition of two coherent states. Wait, wait: a superposition of coherent states can sometimes be a Gaussian state. For instance, if the state is a squeezed state or a coherent squeezed state. But in general, a superposition of coherent states is non-Gaussian.

Wait, but perhaps when sin(2 phi) is zero? Let's see, sin(2 phi)=0 when phi is 0, pi/2, etc. So for phi=0, sin(2 phi)=0, and N would be 1. The state becomes |psi> = |alpha>, which is Gaussian. Similarly, phi = pi/2 would give |psi> = |-alpha>, which is Gaussian.

But in our case, phi is -pi/4, which is not one of those points. So the state is non-Gaussian.

So now, the problem is to compute the non-Gaussianity using the relative entropy measure. But earlier, assuming both rho and tau are pure states gives del_b =0, which can't be correct, since the state is non-Gaussian.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that rho and tau are pure states. Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is not a pure Gaussian state but a mixed Gaussian state. For example, perhaps tau is the vacuum state, which is a Gaussian mixed state? No, vacuum is a pure state.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is the identity matrix, which is the completely mixed state. But the identity matrix is a mixed state only in the case of a maximally mixed state, which for a single qubit would be (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, but for an infinite-dimensional system like this, it's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is the maximally mixed Gaussian state, which for a single mode would be a thermal state with a certain temperature.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should approach the problem differently. Let's consider the state |psi> given.

The state is |psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N.

For phi=-pi/4, alpha=0.5.

Let me compute N:

N = sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)).

phi is -pi/4, so 2phi is -pi/2. sin(-pi/2) = -1.

So N = sqrt( 1 + (-1) * exp( -2*(0.5)^2 ) ) = sqrt( 1 - exp(-0.5) ).

exp(-0.5) is about 0.6065, so 1-0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6273.

So the state |psi> is ( cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ) / 0.6273.

cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So the state becomes:

[ 0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 |-0.5> ] / 0.6273.

Which can be written as (|0.5> - |-0.5> ) / sqrt(2) * (1/0.6273 * 1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, because 0.7071 is 1/sqrt(2), so the numerator is [ |0.5> - |-0.5> ] / sqrt(2)}.

So the entire state is [ |0.5> - |-0.5> ] / sqrt(2) / 0.6273.

So approximately, 1/(0.6273 * 1.414) ≈ 1/(0.886) ≈ 1.128.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to not approximate and think about the density matrix.

The density matrix rho would be |psi><psi|.

Since |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states, the density matrix will involve terms like |alpha><alpha|, |alpha><-alpha|, and |-alpha><alpha|, and | -alpha><-alpha|.

The off-diagonal terms are between |alpha> and |-alpha>, which might cause the state to be non-Gaussian.

The problem is that calculating the exact relative entropy would require knowing the von Neumann entropy of both rho and tau. But rho is a pure state, so its entropy is zero. So if tau is a pure Gaussian state, its entropy is also zero, leading to del_b=0.

But that can't be right because the non-Gaussianity is supposed to measure how non-Gaussian the state is. So perhaps I'm missing something in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different reference state. For example, perhaps the reference state is the maximally mixed Gaussian state, which would have a non-zero entropy. Let's think: if tau is a maximally mixed Gaussian state, then Tr(tau ln tau) would be some positive value. But I'm not sure how to compute that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is the vacuum state. The vacuum state's entropy is zero, so del_b would again be zero.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about whether the state |psi> can be written as a Gaussian state. If so, then the non-Gaussianity would be zero.

But for |psi> to be Gaussian, it would have to be a Gaussian state, like a coherent state, squeezed state, etc. But a superposition of two coherent states is generally non-Gaussian because the Wigner function develops interference fringes, which are a hallmark of non-Gaussianity.

But wait, in some cases, a superposition might be equivalent to a Gaussian state. For example, if the two coherent states are orthogonal, maybe the superposition is Gaussian. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, let's think about the case where alpha is zero. Then the state becomes (cos(phi)|0> + sin(phi)|0> ) / N, since |0> is the same as |-0>. So N becomes sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) * 1 ), so N depends on phi. But for alpha=0 and phi=0, it's |0>, which is Gaussian. For other phi, like pi/4, the state is (|0> + |0> ) / sqrt(2), which is still |0>, which is Gaussian. So in that case, the state is Gaussian. But when alpha is non-zero, it's a superposition, which is non-Gaussian.

Wait, but in the given problem, alpha is 0.5, which is non-zero. So the state is non-Gaussian.

But then, the question is why the relative entropy measure would give zero. Maybe the problem is using a different reference state.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the density matrix for |psi> and then compute the relative entropy compared to a Gaussian state with the same parameters.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the density matrix for |psi> and see if it's a Gaussian state. If it's Gaussian, then the non-Gaussianity is zero. If not, then the non-Gaussianity is positive.

Wait, but how can I tell if the state is Gaussian? Gaussian states have Wigner functions that are Gaussian distributions, and their density matrices are Gaussian, which can be determined by their moments. The first and second moments determine the state up to Gaussian transformations.

Wait, in general, a Gaussian state is determined by its first moments (mean x and p) and second moments (variances and covariance). But the state |psi> has specific properties. Let me compute the second moments.

The second moments for x and p would involve terms like <x²>, <xp>, and <p²>. If these match those of a coherent state, then the state might be Gaussian.

But for |psi>, which is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, the second moments might differ from those of a coherent state. For example, for a coherent state, the variance of x is (1/2), because the uncertainty is minimized. But for a superposition state, the variance might be higher.

Wait, let's compute <x²> for |psi>.

The state |psi> is (|alpha> - |-alpha> )/( sqrt(2) N ).

Wait, because for phi=-pi/4, the state is (|alpha> - |-alpha> ) / sqrt(2) N.

Wait, the denominator is N = sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)).

Which for phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5 is sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)).

So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6273.

So |psi> is ( |0.5> - |-0.5> ) / (sqrt(2) * 0.6273 ).

Now, the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|.

To compute <x²>, I can write x in terms of a and a†: x = (a + a†) / sqrt(2).

So <x²> = <psi| (a + a†)^2 / 2 |psi>.

Expanding (a + a†)^2 = a² + a a† + a† a + (a†)^2.

So <x²> = (1/2) [ <psi|a²|psi> + <psi| a a† |psi> + <psi| a† a |psi> + <psi| (a†)^2 |psi> ].

Similarly, compute each term.

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation values for x² and p² and the cross term xp.

But for a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, the cross terms might contribute.

Wait, another idea: the state |psi> can be written as a tensor product or perhaps even as a single coherent state under certain conditions, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the state |psi> is a two-mode entangled state, but in this case, it's a single mode.

Wait, perhaps for specific values of phi and alpha, the state can be written as a Gaussian state. For example, if phi is such that the state becomes a coherent state. But in this problem, phi is -pi/4, which isn't one of those cases.

So, given that the state is a non-Gaussian state, the relative entropy should be positive. But according to the earlier calculation, if the reference state is a pure Gaussian state, then del_b would be zero, which suggests the non-Gaussianity is zero. Which is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the expectation values of x and p for |psi> are the same as those for the coherent state |beta> used as the reference.

Wait, perhaps the reference is a different Gaussian state. For example, the vacuum state. Let's see.

If the reference state is the vacuum, then its density matrix is |0><0|, with <x>=0, <p>=0, and <x²> = ½, <p²> = ½, and <xp> =0.

So to compute the relative entropy, we'd compute S(rho || tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). But as before, rho is a pure state, so Tr(rho ln rho)=0. And tau is a pure state, so Tr(tau ln tau)=0. So del_b would again be zero.

This isn't making sense. I think I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the relative entropy measure is not between rho and tau, but between rho and a certain Gaussian state. For example, the problem states that tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. But perhaps in this specific case, the state is actually Gaussian, making the non-Gaussianity zero. But how?

Wait, let me think about the state |psi> again. Maybe the state can be rewritten as a Gaussian state under certain conditions.

Wait, I recall that a two-mode squeezed vacuum state can be written as a superposition of product states, but that's a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps if the state has certain symmetry, it could be a Gaussian state. For example, if the state is a squeezed state, which is Gaussian.

But the given state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, which doesn't look like a squeezed state.

Wait, perhaps for specific choices of alpha and phi, the state |psi> becomes a squeezed state. For example, let me see:

A squeezed state can be written as S(z) |alpha>, where S(z) is the squeezing operator. But I don't think that would result in a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, unless alpha is zero.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the state |psi> can be expressed as a displaced thermal state, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a cat state, which is known to be non-Gaussian. So the non-Gaussianity would be positive, which would mean the answer is not option D.

But according to the earlier calculations, if the reference state is a pure Gaussian state, del_b would be zero, which suggests the non-Gaussianity is zero, which can't be right. So perhaps the problem is using a different reference state, such as the vacuum, or another Gaussian state that's mixed.

Wait, maybe the reference state is a maximally mixed Gaussian state, which would have non-zero entropy. But I'm not sure how to compute that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relative entropy between the state and the vacuum. But in that case, the relative entropy would involve the entropy of the state plus the entropy of the vacuum, which is zero, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the state is actually a Gaussian state, making the non-Gaussianity zero. But how?

Wait, let's think of the state |psi> as a sum of |alpha> and |-alpha>, scaled by 1/sqrt(2). So for alpha=0, it's just |0>, which is Gaussian. For alpha≠0, it's a superposition, which is non-Gaussian.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the state |alpha> + |-alpha> is symmetric, and when normalized, it could be a Gaussian state. But I don't think so. For example, the coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha> are each Gaussian, but their superposition is not.

Alternatively, perhaps the state can be represented as a single coherent state under a certain transformation, but I don't think so.

So given that, the non-Gaussianity should be positive, which would rule out option D.

But according to the earlier calculations, if tau is a pure Gaussian state, the relative entropy would be zero, which would suggest the answer is D. But that's conflicting.

Hmm, maybe the problem is using the relative entropy between rho and the vacuum as the reference. So if the state is non-Gaussian, the relative entropy would be positive.

But the relative entropy between rho and the vacuum would be S(rho||vacuum) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(vacuum ln vacuum). Since rho is pure, Tr(rho ln rho)=0, and the vacuum is also pure, Tr(vacuum ln vacuum)=0. So again, del_b would be zero.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different reference state. For example, the reference state is a thermal state with some temperature T. The thermal state would have a density matrix rho_thermal = exp(-H/(k_B T)) / Z, where H is the Hamiltonian. For the harmonic oscillator, H = (a† a + 1/2) hbar omega.

But this is getting complicated, and I'm not sure if this is the approach the problem expects.

Wait, perhaps the state |psi> is a Gaussian state. Let me consider the density matrix.

The state |psi> is (|alpha> - |-alpha> ) / N.

The density matrix is |psi><psi|.

Expanding this, we get:

( |alpha><alpha| - |alpha><-alpha| - |-alpha><alpha| + |-alpha><-alpha| ) / N^2.

So the density matrix has four terms: |alpha><alpha|, |alpha><-alpha|, |-alpha><alpha|, and |-alpha><-alpha|.

Now, for a Gaussian state, the Wigner function is Gaussian, which implies that the density matrix can be expressed in terms of normally ordered terms up to second order. So any terms beyond that (like |alpha><-alpha| which have higher order terms) would make the state non-Gaussian.

Because |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, their outer products involve exponential terms. Specifically, |alpha><-alpha| would involve e^{a a†} or something like that, which is a non-Gaussian term.

So the presence of the cross terms (like |alpha><-alpha|) in the density matrix implies that the state is non-Gaussian. Therefore, the non-Gaussianity should be positive, so the answer shouldn't be D.

But earlier, considering the relative entropy, if the reference is a pure Gaussian state, the del_b would be zero. Which suggests that perhaps the problem has a different setup.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the relative entropy between the state and the closest Gaussian state, not a specific reference. But if that's the case, then the non-Gaussianity would be positive, which again would not be zero.

So perhaps the problem is expecting that the state is Gaussian, hence non-Gaussianity is zero. But under what condition would the state be Gaussian?

Wait, maybe when N^2 is 1. Let's see: N^2 = 1 + sin(2 phi) exp( -2 alpha² ). So when sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha²) =0, then N=1. That happens when sin(2 phi)=0 (phi=0, pi/2, etc.), which gives |psi> as a coherent state. So in those cases, the state is Gaussian, and non-Gaussianity is zero.

But in the given problem, phi is -pi/4, so sin(2 phi) =-1, which is non-zero, so N is not 1, and the state is a superposition, hence non-Gaussian.

Hmm. I'm stuck. According to the problem statement, the relative entropy is del_b=Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau), and the options include 0 as an option (option D). But according to my earlier analysis, the state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be positive, which would exclude option D. But why is option D an option?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering a specific reference Gaussian state, for which the relative entropy is zero. But I can't think of any such state except when rho is Gaussian.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the state |psi> is a Gaussian state because it can be written as a single coherent state. But earlier analysis says that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the state |psi> is a squeezed state. Let me think.

A squeezed state can be written in terms of |alpha> and S(z) |alpha>, where S is the squeezing operator. But I don't think that's applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed such that the state is actually a Gaussian state, making the non-Gaussianity zero. How?

Looking again at the state:

|psi> = ( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N.

Let me write this as |psi> = [ e^{i phi} |alpha> + e^{-i phi} |-alpha> ] / sqrt(2) N'.

Wait, perhaps this can be rewritten as a single coherent state. Let me see.

Wait, another approach: let's compute |beta> = cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha>.

Wait, this can be written as |beta> = |alpha> (cos(phi) ) + |-alpha> sin(phi).

But for what values of phi would this be a coherent state?

If this state is a coherent state, then it can be written as |gamma> for some gamma.

So, |gamma> = A [ cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha> ].

But for this to be a coherent state, the coefficients must satisfy certain conditions. Let me expand |gamma> in terms of the number states.

|gamma> = A e^{-|gamma|^2/2} sum_{n} (gamma^n / sqrt(n!)) |n>.

On the other hand, [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] is:

e^{-|alpha|^2/2} [ cos(phi) sum (alpha^n / sqrt(n!)) |n> + sin(phi) sum ( (-alpha)^n / sqrt(n!)) |n> ].

Factor out e^{-|alpha|^2/2} and 1/sqrt(n!):

= e^{-|alpha|^2/2} sum [ ( cos(phi) alpha^n + sin(phi) (-alpha)^n ) / sqrt(n!)) |n> ].

So, for |gamma> to be equal to this, we must have:

gamma^n = [ cos(phi) alpha^n + sin(phi) (-alpha)^n ] * sqrt(|gamma|^2 / |alpha|^2) or something like that.

Wait, this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps for specific phi, this can be a coherent state.

Assume that phi = 0: then |beta> = |alpha>, which is a coherent state.

Similarly, phi=pi/2: |beta> = |-alpha>, coherent state.

But for other phi, it's a superposition.

So, for phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5, it's a superposition and hence non-Gaussian.

So the non-Gaussianity should be positive, which would mean the answer is not D.

But according to the problem's setup, the relative entropy could be zero if rho and tau are both pure Gaussian states. But |psi> is a non-Gaussian state, so unless the reference is not a pure state, which I'm not considering.

Wait, perhaps the reference state is a mixed Gaussian state, like the vacuum. But as before, if tau is the vacuum, then del_b=0, which suggests non-Gaussianity is zero, which is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a mistake, and the correct answer is zero, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, let me consider the possibility that the state |psi> is actually a Gaussian state. Because the problem gives N as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)), perhaps this normalization ensures that the state is Gaussian.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the state can be written as a displaced thermal state, which is Gaussian. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the state is a coherent state. Let me check.

The state |psi> is ( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N.

For phi=-pi/4, this becomes ( |alpha> - |-alpha> ) / sqrt(2) N.

If this state can be written as |beta> for some beta, then it's Gaussian.

But how?

A coherent state |beta> has the property that the expectation values of x and p are sqrt(2) Re(beta) and sqrt(2) Im(beta), respectively.

In the state |psi>, the expectation value of x is approximately 2.54, as computed earlier.

So for |beta> to have the same expectation value, beta would need to have Re(beta) ≈ 2.54 / sqrt(2) ≈ 1.795, and Im(beta) =0.

But does this mean that |psi> is |beta>? No, because |beta> is a single coherent state, while |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states.

So the state |psi> can't be written as a single coherent state, hence it's non-Gaussian.

Thus, the non-Gaussianity should be positive, so the answer can't be D.

But earlier, using the relative entropy formula as given, it would be zero. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in understanding the formula. Let me re-read the problem statement.

The relative entropy measure is given as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)].

So del_b is the entropy of rho minus the entropy of tau.

But rho is a pure state (so entropy zero), and tau is a pure Gaussian state (so entropy zero). So del_b is zero.

But that can't be right, because the state is non-Gaussian, and hence should have higher non-Gaussianity.

So perhaps the problem is using a different definition. Or perhaps I'm missing a key point.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the density matrix of the reference state tau is the same as rho when it's Gaussian. But in this case, rho is non-Gaussian, so tau is not rho, and thus del_b would not be zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the state to be pure, but that's not the case here.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Based on the analysis, the state is non-Gaussian, so non-Gaussianity should be positive, which would exclude option D. But according to the formula, if both are pure Gaussian and non-Gaussian states, del_b would be zero.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different reference state. For example, the reference state could be the vacuum, which is a Gaussian state. But as we saw, the relative entropy would be zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the relative entropy between rho and a Gaussian state that isn't pure. For example, a mixed Gaussian state like a thermal state.

But without knowing the specific reference, it's hard to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Maybe the state is actually a Gaussian state, making the non-Gaussianity zero.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation of the expectation values.

Wait, let's re-calculate the expectation value of x for |psi>.

The state is |psi> = [ cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha> ] / N.

The expectation value of x is (1/N^2) [ cos(phi) <alpha|x|alpha> + sin(phi) < -alpha |x| -alpha > ].

As before, <alpha|x|alpha> = sqrt(2) Re(alpha) = sqrt(2)*0.5.

Similarly, < -alpha |x| -alpha> = sqrt(2) Re(-alpha) = - sqrt(2)*0.5.

So, <x> = (1/N^2) [ cos(phi) * sqrt(2)*0.5 + sin(phi) * (- sqrt(2)*0.5) ) ].

Substituting phi=-pi/4: cos(phi)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi)=-sqrt(2)/2.

So,

<x> = (1/N^2) [ (sqrt(2)/2) * sqrt(2)*0.5 + (-sqrt(2)/2) * (- sqrt(2)*0.5) ) ].

Each term: (sqrt(2)/2) * sqrt(2)*0.5 = (2/2)*0.5 = 0.5.

Similarly, the second term: (-sqrt(2)/2) * (-sqrt(2)*0.5) = (2/2)*0.5 = 0.5.

So <x> = (1/N^2) [ 0.5 + 0.5 ] = (1/N^2) * 1.

N squared is 0.3935, so <x> ≈ 1 / 0.3935 ≈ 2.54.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the sign. Let me re-calculate:

sin(phi) is -sqrt(2)/2.

So the second term is [ sin(phi) * < -alpha |x| -alpha> ] = (-sqrt(2)/2) * ( - sqrt(2)*0.5 ) = (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) ) * (1/2 * 1/2 ) )= (2) * (1/4) )= 0.5.

So the sum is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.

So <x> = 1 / N^2 ≈ 2.54.

But if the reference state is a coherent state with <x> =2.54 and <p>=0, then tau is |beta> with beta ≈ 1.795, which would have the same expectation values as rho. So the first moments match. But if the second moments don't match, then the state is non-Gaussian.

So the relative entropy would involve the von Neumann entropy of rho and tau. But since both are pure states, their entropies are zero, leading to del_b=0.

But that can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the problem statement and the given options, perhaps the correct answer is D) 0. But I'm not confident because the state is a superposition and hence non-Gaussian. Alternatively, maybe the state is Gaussian under the given parameters.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the state is a squeezed vacuum state. Because a squeezed vacuum state is a Gaussian state. But the given state is a superposition of two coherent states, which doesn't look like a squeezed state.

Alternatively, perhaps the state can be expressed as a displaced thermal state. But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps when sin(2 phi) is negative, the state becomes Gaussian. But I don't see why that would be the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as considering the state's second moments to determine whether it's Gaussian.

In a Gaussian state, the Wigner function is Gaussian, which depends on the second moments. So let's compute the second moments for |psi> and compare to those of a coherent state.

Compute <x^2>, <p^2>, and <xp>.

For a coherent state, <x^2> = (1/2) + <x>^2, and similarly <p^2> = (1/2) + <p>^2, and <xp> = <x><p>.

So for a coherent state, the second moments are determined by <x> and <p>.

In our case, <p> is zero, <x> is approximately 2.54.

So for a coherent state with <x>=2.54, <x^2> would be 0.5 + (2.54)^2 ≈ 0.5 +6.4516=6.9516.

Similarly, <p^2> would be 0.5.

Now, let's compute <x^2> for |psi>.

Using x = (a + a†)/sqrt(2), x^2 = (a² + a a† + a† a + (a†)^2 ) / 2.

So <x^2> = ( <psi| a² |psi> + <psi| a a† |psi> + <psi| a† a |psi> + <psi| (a†)^2 |psi> ) / 2.

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the properties of coherent states:

For a coherent state |alpha>, <x^2> = (1/2) + |alpha|^2 + 2 Re(alpha^2).

Wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps <x^2> for |alpha> is (1/2) + (sqrt(2) Re(alpha))^2.

Because <x> for |alpha> is sqrt(2) Re(alpha).

So <x>^2 = 2 Re(alpha)^2.

Thus, <x^2> = (1/2) + <x>^2.

Which for |alpha> is (1/2) + (sqrt(2) Re(alpha))^2.

Similarly, for the state |psi>, which is a superposition, the expectation value <x^2> would involve cross terms.

But perhaps it's easier to compute <x^2> for |psi> directly.

|psi> = (|alpha> - |-alpha> ) / (sqrt(2) N).

So <x^2> = (1/(2 N^2 )) [ <alpha| x² |alpha> - <alpha| x² |-alpha> - < -alpha |x^2 |alpha> + < -alpha |x^2 | -alpha> ].

But this is getting very complicated, and I'm not sure if I can compute it without more information.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup, and the correct answer is D) 0, but I'm not confident.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, I'll have to make a decision. Based on the initial analysis that rho is a pure state and tau is a pure Gaussian state, leading to del_b=0, I'm inclined to think that the answer is D) 0. But this contradicts the understanding that the state is non-Gaussian. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have the non-Gaussianity as zero under specific parameters.

Wait, wait! Let me compute N again.

Given phi=-pi/4, alpha=0.5.

N^2 = 1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha²).

sin(2 phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1.

exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈0.6065.

So N^2 = 1 + (-1)*0.6065 = 0.3935.

So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈0.6273.

But wait, let's compute the state |psi>.

|psi> = [ cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha> ] / N.

phi=-pi/4, so cos(phi)=sqrt(2)/2 ≈0.7071, sin(phi)= -sqrt(2)/2 ≈-0.7071.

So,

|psi> = [0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 |-0.5> ] / 0.6273.

= [ |0.5> - |-0.5> ] / (0.6273 * sqrt(2)).

= [ |0.5> - |-0.5> ] / (0.6273 * 1.4142).

≈ [ |0.5> - |-0.5> ] / 0.886.

Which is approximately (|0.5> - |-0.5> ) * 1.128.

But the key point is that this is a superposition of two coherent states, which is generally non-Gaussian.

So the non-Gaussianity should be positive, implying that the correct answer is not D) 0.

But according to the formula given, del_b is the entropy of rho minus the entropy of tau. Both are pure states, so del_b=0. That doesn't make sense because the state is non-Gaussian.

Hmm. Perhaps the problem is considering the relative entropy in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be zero because the state is a coherent state, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is a coherent state, but that's only when phi is 0 or pi/2, which isn't the case here.

I'm going to have to make a guess. Given the options, and the fact that the state is a superposition, I think the non-Gaussianity should be positive, so the answer is not D. But without further information, I can't compute the exact value.

Wait, but perhaps the state |psi> is a cat state, which is known to have non-zero non-Gaussianity. So the answer should be option C) 1.38 or A) 2.48.

But I can't compute the exact value without more information.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a Gaussian state, making the non-Gaussianity zero, so the answer is D.

Given the confusion, I'll go with the initial calculation that del_b is zero, so the answer is D) 0.


The problem involves calculating the non-Gaussianity of the given Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is defined as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N},
\]
where \(N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}}\). The relative entropy measure is given as:

\[
\Delta_b = \text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau),
\]
where \(\rho\) is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state \(|\psi\rangle\), and \(\tau\) is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

### Key Analysis:
1. **State Properties**: The state \(|\psi\rangle\) is a superposition of two coherent states \(|\alpha\rangle\) and \(|-\alpha\rangle\). Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superposition is generally non-Gaussian. For \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\), the state is explicitly a superposition, making it non-Gaussian.

2. **Normalization Constant**: The normalization constant \(N\) is computed as:
   \[
   N^2 = 1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}.
   \]
   Substituting \(\phi = -\pi/4\) (\(\sin(2\phi) = -1\)) and \(\alpha = 0.5\) (\(e^{-2\alpha^2} = e^{-0.5} \approx 0.6065\)), we find:
   \[
   N^2 = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935, \quad N \approx 0.6273.
   \]

3. **Expectation Values**: The expectation values of position (\(x\)) and momentum (\(p\)) are calculated. For \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\), the expectation value of \(x\) is approximately \(\langle x \rangle \approx 2.54\), while \(\langle p \rangle = 0\). These match the expectation values of a coherent state \(|\beta\rangle\) with \(\beta = \langle x \rangle / \sqrt{2} \approx 1.795\).

4. **Relative Entropy**: The relative entropy \(\Delta_b\) is defined as the difference between the von Neumann entropy of \(\rho\) (the non-Gaussian state) and \(\tau\) (a reference Gaussian state). For pure states, the von Neumann entropy is zero. If \(\tau\) is a pure Gaussian state (e.g., a coherent state with the same \(\langle x \rangle\) and \(\langle p \rangle\)), both \(\rho\) and \(\tau\) have zero entropy, leading to \(\Delta_b = 0\).

5. **Non-Gaussianity Interpretation**: While the state \(|\psi\rangle\) is a superposition and thus non-Gaussian, the problem's definition of \(\Delta_b\) compares the entropy of \(\rho\) to that of \(\tau\). Since both are pure states, \(\Delta_b = 0\), suggesting that the non-Gaussianity, as defined, is zero.

### Conclusion:
Based on the problem's setup and the relative entropy formula provided, the non-Gaussianity is calculated to be zero. This result aligns with the interpretation that the relative entropy measure used here does not capture the non-Gaussianity of the state in the conventional sense.

**Answer: D**
