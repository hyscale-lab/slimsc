Okay, so I have this problem about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, the question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh right, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude is a complex quantity, often written as f(θ, φ), which can be split into real and imaginary parts.

The given phase shifts are δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, and δ₄. The values are 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13° respectively. The rest are ignored, so I guess higher-order terms beyond δ₄ don't contribute here.

Wait, I think the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts is given by a sum over the Legendre polynomials multiplied by the exponential of i times twice the phase shift. The formula is something like f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ (2l +1) e^{i 2δ_l} P_l(cosθ) ] multiplied by e^{i m φ}, where m is the orbital angular momentum number. Wait, but here we are considering the scattering along the incident beam direction, which is probably θ=0°, right? Because that's the direction of the incoming particle.

So if θ is zero, then cosθ is 1. That means each P_l(1) is 1 because the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is always 1. So the sum simplifies a lot. Also, since we're along the beam direction, φ is 0°, so the e^{i m φ} term becomes 1 when m=0 (since for each term, m is the same as l, right? Because each phase shift δ_l is associated with the orbital angular momentum l. So each term may have a different m, but wait, the problem may be considering m=0, so then e^{i m φ} is 1.

Wait, but wait, the scattering amplitude f has a term involving e^{i (k r) cosθ} or something else? Maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, I think that the scattering amplitude is written as a sum over the partial waves. Each partial wave contributes a term involving (2l+1) e^{i(δ_l)}, or something like that.

Wait, I think the expression is f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞
