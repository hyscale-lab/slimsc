Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron microscope. Hmm, let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says that Mike is designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. He's using vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum, which is less than 10^-9 Torr. The purpose of this is to minimize gas molecules because having a vacuum improves electron microscopy. But some gas particles are still there, detected by a mass spectrometer. 

Mike determined the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and volume, right? I remember that the mean free path (λ) in a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure and the square root of the temperature, and directly proportional to the diameter of the gas molecules and the square root of the absolute temperature. Or wait, the formula I think is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter, and P is pressure. So as pressure decreases, λ increases. And higher temperature also increases λ because the thermal speeds are higher, so molecules move faster and collide less often.

So when the vacuum is created, the pressure is really low, so λ1 is large. That makes sense because in a vacuum, gas molecules don't collide much, so each one travels a longer distance before hitting something.

Now, when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes. It's now λ2, which is different from λ1. The question is, why is λ2 different?

Wait, the electron beam is being used. So what happens when you have an electron beam in the presence of gas molecules? The electrons can interact with the gas atoms or molecules. I think this could cause electron scattering. So when the electrons hit gas molecules, they might cause the gas molecules to move, perhaps ionize them, or something like that.

But how does that affect the mean free path of the gas molecules? Well, normally, the mean free path is determined by collisions between the gas molecules themselves. If the electrons are causing some sort of disturbance, maybe they're adding another source of collisions for the gas molecules.

Wait, but wait. The electrons are moving at high speeds, right? The accelerating voltage is 1000 kV, so the electrons are highly energetic. They might collide with the gas molecules, but would that significantly affect the gas molecules' motion?

Oh, but in this scenario, the mean free path λ is about the gas molecules colliding with each other, not with the electrons. Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think.

The mean free path λ for a gas is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions with other molecules. But when you have another type of particle (like electrons) in the mix, the gas molecules might collide with those as well. But in this case, the electron beam is moving through the gas, so the electrons are moving, and the gas molecules are stationary (or moving much slower compared to the electrons).

Electron scattering from gas atoms would mean that the electrons would interact with the gas atoms. But for the gas atoms themselves, their mean free path is determined by their mutual collisions. So if the gas molecules
