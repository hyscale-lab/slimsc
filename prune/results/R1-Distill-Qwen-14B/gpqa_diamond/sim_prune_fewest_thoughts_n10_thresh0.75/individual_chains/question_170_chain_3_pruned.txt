Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state.

Wait, the state is given as (3i, 4). I think that means the spinor is a column vector with components 3i and 4. So, ψ = [3i; 4]. Right, because in quantum mechanics, spin states are often represented as two-component vectors.

The operator for spin along the y-direction is given as σ_y, which is the Pauli matrix for y. The matrix is:

[0, -i]
[i, 0]

I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as ψ† O ψ, where ψ† is the conjugate transpose of the state vector. So, I need to compute the conjugate transpose of ψ, multiply by σ_y, and then multiply by ψ again.

Let me write down the steps. First, find ψ†. Since ψ is [3i, 4]^T, the conjugate transpose would be [ -3, 4* ] wait, wait. Wait, the original ψ has components 3i and 4. So, the conjugate of 3i is -3i, and the conjugate of 4 (which is real) is 4. But since it's a row vector, ψ† would be [ -3, 4 ] because the first component is the conjugate of 3i. Wait, 3i's conjugate is -3i? No, wait, wait, no, wait. The conjugate of 3i is -3i, right. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ]? Or is it [ -3i, 4 ] as a row vector? Wait, no, no. Wait, the components of ψ are [3i, 4], so ψ is a column vector. So ψ† is the conjugate transposed row vector. So, ψ† = [ (3i)*, 4* ] which is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, no, wait. No, wait. 3i is a complex number. The complex conjugate of 3i is -3i. Because (3i)* = 3*(-i) = -3i. So yes, ψ
