Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Hmm, let me think. The reaction given is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A−. Oh wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says it's an annihilation process. So protons and antiprotons annihilate each other and produce two A+ and two A− particles. I remember that in annihilation, matter and antimatter particles convert into other forms of energy or particles.

The problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy? Or perhaps it's moving at a non-relativistic speed. Also, given that m_A c² is 300 MeV. I'm not sure yet, but I think I'll need to use conservation laws here—probably conservation of energy and momentum.

Wait, let's break it down. The initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Let's think about their rest masses. A proton's rest mass is about 938 MeV/c². Similarly, the antiproton has the same mass as the proton. So the total rest mass energy before the reaction is 2 * 938 MeV = 1876 MeV.

But wait, the antiproton is moving slowly. So that probably means its kinetic energy isn't too high. Since it's moving slowly, maybe we can approximate its total energy as just its rest energy. So the initial total energy would be the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's rest energy, which is 938 + 938 = 1876 MeV.

Wait, but wait. The proton is at rest, right? Because the antiproton is the one moving. Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So the proton is presumably at rest. So the proton's energy is just its rest energy, 938 MeV. The antiproton has rest energy 938 MeV, but because it's moving, its total energy is gamma * m_p c². But since it's moving slowly, v is much less than c, so gamma is approximately 1. So the total energy of the system before the reaction is approximately 938 + 938 = 1876 MeV. Maybe I should think of it as 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. But I'm not 100% sure
