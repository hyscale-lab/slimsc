Okay, so I'm trying to solve this enthalpy of formation problem. Hmm, the question gives me the formula for a compound, which is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That's a bit of a mouthful. I remember that the enthalpy of formation is calculated using bond energies, right? So I need to figure out the structure of this molecule and then break it down into its constituent bonds.

Wait, the enthalpy of formation is the change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So for this hydrocarbon, it's formed from carbon and hydrogen. The problem gives me bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H. Oh, and the enthalpy of atomization for carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. I think atomization is the energy required to break a bond in an element's standard state, so for carbon, that's probably the energy to break a C-C bond in graphite or something.

So, first, I need to figure out how many C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds are in the molecule. Also, I have to consider the H-H bonds, but wait, when forming the molecule from elements, I'm starting with H2 molecules. So each H in the compound comes from breaking H-H bonds and then forming C-H bonds.

Let me draw the structure. The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let's count the carbons. Each (CH3)2 group is two CH3 attached to a central C. Then there's a double bond, so the structure alternates between single and double bonds.

Wait, maybe it's better to count each type of bond in the molecule. Let's see:

Each molecule has a certain number of C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

So, step by step:

1. Determine the number of each type of bond in the molecule.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down into parts:

- The first part is (CH3)2C=CH-: So that's a (CH3)2C group double-bonded to CH.

Then comes -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So let's count each bond.

Wait, maybe another approach: the molecule is a polyalkene, with two double bonds. Let me see:

Looking for all the bonds:

Each carbon in the molecule is connected by either single or double bonds.

Wait, perhaps counting the number of each type of bond.

Let me consider each atom:

Each (CH3) group has 3 C-H bonds. So, for each (CH3), 3 C-H.

Looking at the structure:

1. The first part is (CH3)2C=CH-: So this means that the central C is connected to two CH3 groups and a CH group via a double bond. So for that part:

- Each CH3 has 3 C-H bonds. Two CH3 groups: 2 *3 =6 C-H.

The central C is connected via a double bond to another C (the CH part). So that's a C=C bond.

Then, the CH group is connected to a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look at all the bonds. Let me count.

Total number of C atoms? The formula is: CH3 groups, each contributing 1 C, then each (CH3)2C has another C, and so on. Alternatively, perhaps I can count the number of each bond.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approach it as follows: the molecule has a certain number of C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds. Each bond contributes to the enthalpy.

Wait, but perhaps another approach. The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula:

Î”Hf = (sum of bond energies of bonds broken) - (sum of bond energies of bonds formed)

But wait, no, wait: the enthalpy of formation is the energy change when 1 mole of the compound is formed from its elements. So, for each element, we have to consider the bonds broken in the elements and bonds formed in the compound.

So, for carbon, which is in graphite or diamond, but since the enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol, which is the energy to break C-C bonds in graphite. So, each C atom in the compound comes from breaking C-C bonds. So for each C atom, we have to put in 1000 kJ/mol? No, wait, no. Because if graphite has C-C bonds, and each C is bonded to three others (in a hexagonal lattice), but for simplicity, perhaps the enthalpy of atomization
