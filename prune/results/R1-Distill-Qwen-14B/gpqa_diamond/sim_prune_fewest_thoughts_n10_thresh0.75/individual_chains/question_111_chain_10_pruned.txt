Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's a multiple-choice question with two separate reactions to consider. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. The second reaction involves 1-nitropropane, KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. I need to find the major products A and B and then match them with the options given.

Starting with Reaction A: The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. That structure sounds a bit complex. Let me visualize it. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1 (so, the ring's numbering would have the ketone at carbon 1). At position 2, there's an ethyl group, and at position 6, a methyl group. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the ketone is at carbon 1. Then, carbon 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl substituent, but wait, 2,6-dimethyl. Oh, right, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6. So, carbon 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl? Wait no, 2-ethyl would mean an ethyl group at position 2, and since it's 2,6-dimethyl, that means methyl groups at positions 2 and 6 as well? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, wait. The formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the substituents are: at position 2, an ethyl group and a methyl group. Wait, that would make it 2-ethyl and 2-methyl, but the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. No, wait, the substituents are at 2 and 6. So, 2 has an ethyl and a methyl, and 6 has a methyl. Or wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me think again.

The name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. Then, at position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group (since 2-ethyl and 2-methyl). Similarly, position 6 has a methyl group. So, the structure would have a ketone at C1, and at C2, both ethyl and methyl substituents. At C6, a methyl.

Wait, but wait, how many substituents can a cyclo
