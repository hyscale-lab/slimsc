Okay, I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read the question carefully and then start thinking.

So the problem is about some mixtures of liquids reacting under certain conditions, leading to a specific product. The key is to figure out the number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X.

Let me jot down the important points:

1. Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. That means they probably have double bonds because alkenes and alkynes can decolorize bromine (Br2) through addition reactions.

2. When mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction and forms mixture Y. Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids that don't decolorize bromine water. So, Y doesn’t have the kind of unsaturation that reacts with bromine. Maybe the double bonds were hydrogenated or something.

3. Hydrogenation of both X and Y with Pt under severe conditions gives only one substance, Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Z is a constituent of Y and is a widely used solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, implying it's fully saturated, maybe an alkane.

4. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X. So X's components don't have conjugated double bonds, which probably means each molecule has isolated double bonds or something.

Hmm, okay. Let's think about each part.

First, mixture X has two liquids that can decolorize bromine water. So each of them probably has at least one double bond. Since they are equimolar, perhaps they are alkenes. But wait, maybe one is an alkene and the other an alkyne? Because both can add bromine, but reaction conditions might matter.

Wait, but when X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation to form Y. Disproportionation means one substance is both oxidized and reduced. Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids. Oh, wait, the reaction is with Pt, which is a catalyst. So perhaps each component of X is undergoing some kind of hydrogenation or other reaction.

Wait, but the formation of Y is a result of a disproportionation. So perhaps one component is getting hydrogenated, and another is getting dehydrogenated? Or maybe one is adding hydrogen (hydrogenation) and another is losing it (dehydrogenation), but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps each component is breaking into smaller molecules or something.

Wait, but the result of treating X with Pt and heat is Y, which is a mixture that doesn't decolorize bromine. So Y's components are saturated, no double bonds. Because if they had double bonds, they would decolorize bromine.

So when X is treated with Pt and heated, it's probably a hydrogenation reaction. Wait, but hydrogenation usually adds H2 across double bonds. So if X's components are unsaturated, after hydrogenation, Y's components are saturated.

But wait, the problem says that Y is formed by a disproportionation. Hmm, that's confusing. Disproportionation usually is a redox reaction where an element is both oxidized and reduced. So perhaps one of the components in X undergoes some kind of disproportionation.

Wait, another thought: maybe X is a mixture of ethylene and another di-substituted alkene, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of different alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, form different alkanes.

Wait, but let's look at the product Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% hydrogen by mass. Let me calculate the molecular formula for Z.

The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. So the molecular weight of Z is such that H's mass is 1/7 of the total.

Hydrogen has an atomic weight of 1. Let’s say the formula is CnHm. The mass of H is (m * 1) / (12n + m) = 1/7.

So, (m) / (12n + m) = 1/7 → 7m = 12n + m → 6m =12n → m=2n.

So the formula is CnH2n. That's the general formula for an alkene, but wait, but Z is a constituent of Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine. So that can't be an alkene. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck my calculation.

Hydrogen's mass fraction is 14.28% which is 1/7. So,

( m * 1 ) / (12n + m ) = 1/7 → Cross multiply → 7m = 12n + m → 6m =12n → m = 2n.

So yes, the formula is CnH2n, which is an alkene, but Z is in Y, which doesn't have double bonds. So that's a contradiction. So perhaps Z is a cycloalkane? Because cycloalkanes are saturated but can have a formula like CnH2n. For example, cyclohexane is C6H12, which fits CnH2n with n=6.

Wait, cyclohexane is C6H12, and its hydrogen mass fraction is (12)/(72 + 12) *100 = (12/84)*100 ≈ 14.28%. Oh, that's exactly 14.28% (since 12/84 is 1/7). So Z is cyclohexane.

So Z is cyclohexane. And it's a constituent of Y, which is the product of treating X with Pt and heating. So Y is a mixture that includes cyclohexane and another component. But wait, Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, and upon hydrogenation, both X and Y produce only Z.

Wait, no: The problem states that hydrogenation of both X and Y in the presence of platinum under severe conditions gives only Z. So X, when hydrogenated, gives Z, and Y, when hydrogenated, also gives Z.

Wait, but Y includes Z already. Hmm, that doesn't quite fit. Let me re-read.

"Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z [...] which is a constituent of mixture Y [...]"

Ah, so when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z. Similarly, when Y is hydrogenated, it also gives Z. Because Y is a mixture, perhaps the other component in Y is something that upon hydrogenation gives Z as well. Alternatively, maybe Y's components are already Z and something else that can hydrogenate to Z.

Wait, but Y is a mixture of two liquids that don't decolorize bromine because they don't have double bonds. So the components of Y are saturated (like alkanes, cycloalkanes, etc.), but one of them is Z, cyclohexane.

So, when Y is hydrogenated, perhaps the other component is a different saturated compound that, upon hydrogenation, becomes cyclohexane. Hmm, but cyclohexane is already fully saturated. Unless the other component is a different cycloalkane that can undergo ring-opening or something, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the other component is a larger alkane that, when hydrogenated, reduces in size? That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps X and Y are mixtures of dienes or something else. Let me go back.

X is a mixture of two liquids that can decolorize bromine. So each has at least one double bond. When X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. Disproportionation usually involves an element changing oxidation states. So perhaps one of the components in X is a diene, and under certain conditions, it breaks into smaller fragments. Or maybe there's a shift in hydrogenation.

Wait, but Y is a mixture of two liquids that don't react with bromine. So their structures don't have double bonds. So X's components must have double bonds, and Y's don't. So X's components are possibly alkenes or alkynes, and Y's are alkanes.

But Y is a result of a disproportionation. Hmm, maybe the reaction isn't hydrogenation but something else. Let me think: If X is a mixture of alkenes, and upon treatment with Pt and heat, they undergo some kind of reaction. But I'm not sure what that would be.

Wait, another angle: the problem says that when X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes disproportionation. So perhaps one of the components in X is being both oxidized and reduced. For instance, something like the decomposition of a di-substituted alkene to form different molecules, perhaps with different degrees of unsaturation.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of ethene and another alkene, and when treated with Pt, it undergoes some reaction that leads to cyclohexane. But I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, let's think about the hydrogenation part. When X is hydrogenated, it gives Z, which is cyclohexane. So, the components of X must be such that upon hydrogenation, they become cyclohexane. So, each component must be a compound that can hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Let's consider what that could be.

Hydrogenation adds H2 across double bonds. So, if X is a mixture of alkenes that upon hydrogenation form cyclohexane, what would those alkenes be?

Wait, but cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. To form that via hydrogenation, perhaps the starting material is a diene or something else. Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are different.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the components of X are 1,3-dienes. Upon hydrogenation, they would add H2 and become alkanes. But cyclohexane is a ring structure. Alternatively, perhaps X contains cyclohexene, which upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane. But then X would be a mixture of cyclohexene and another compound. Let me think.

Suppose X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another compound. When X is hydrogenated, cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane. If the other compound also becomes cyclohexane upon hydrogenation, that makes sense. But wait, what's the other compound in X?

Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids that each can decolorize bromine. So both must have unsaturated bonds. So, maybe one is cyclohexene, and the other is another di-substituted alkene, perhaps 1,3-cyclohexadiene or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, both form cyclohexane. That would mean that each of these alkenes, when hydrogenated, becomes cyclohexane. Hmm, but that would require each to have a structure that, upon hydrogenation, forms the same product. How is that possible?

Wait, perhaps the alkenes are isomers. For example, maybe they are cis and trans isomers of the same di-substituted alkene. But when hydrogenated, they both would become the same alkane. Wait, but then X wouldn't be a mixture of two different liquids; it would be a mixture of two isomers of the same compound, which would still be a single substance, not a mixture of two different liquids. Unless they have different structures but same formula.

Wait, perhaps the two components are different alkenes that, when hydrogenated, form cyclohexane. That seems unlikely because you'd need each alkene to somehow form cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. Alternatively, maybe one is a different ring structure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about possible compounds that hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Cyclohexane is C6H12. So, the compound must have a molecular formula that upon hydrogenation (adding H2) gives C6H12.

Wait no, hydrogenation adds H2, so the starting material would have fewer H's. For example, cyclohexene is C6H10, which upon hydrogenation becomes C6H12.

So, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another alkene that upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.

Wait, but wait: if X is a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and something else, say, another di-substituted alkene with the same number of carbons, then upon hydrogenation, they would become cyclohexane and another alkane. But the problem says both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give only Z (cyclohexane). So perhaps both components of X upon hydrogenation give cyclohexane.

So, the other component in X must be a compound that, upon hydrogenation, gives cyclohexane. What's that? Maybe a di-substituted alkene with a ring. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the other component is 1,3,5-cyclohexatriene. No, that's unlikely because trienes are less common and would decolorize bromine more vigorously, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the other component is a different diene, but I'm not getting it.

Wait, another angle: since Y is a mixture of two liquids that don't react with bromine, meaning they are saturated. One of them is Z, cyclohexane.

So, when X (the mixture of alkenes) is treated with Pt and heated, it forms Y, which is a mixture containing cyclohexane and another saturated compound.

So, perhaps the reaction is a hydrogenation of X's components. So X's components are alkenes that hydrogenate to form alkanes, which are Y's components.

But Y is an equimolar mixture of two alkanes, one of which is cyclohexane (Z). So, the other component in Y must be another alkane, perhaps a linear alkane.

Wait, but the problem states that Y is formed via a disproportionation reaction, which is a type of redox reaction. So perhaps one component in X is being hydrogenated (adding H2, reduction), and another is being dehydrogenated (oxidation, losing H2), but that would require them to be unsaturated and possibly have functional groups that can change.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the possible structures.

Suppose X is a mixture of two alkenes: one is cyclohexene (C6H10) and another is something else, perhaps something that upon hydrogenation becomes another alkane. But upon hydrogenation, X gives only Z, which is cyclohexane. So, the other component in X must hydrogenate to cyclohexane as well.

Wait, that would require the other component in X to be another di-substituted alkene that, when hydrogenated, forms cyclohexane. Hmm, but that's confusing. Because only cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. So, unless the other component is a different structure that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane. I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, both of which upon hydrogenation give cyclohexane. That would require both alkenes to be isomers that, when hydrogenated, give the same product. For example, cyclohexene and another cycloalkene isomer. But cyclohexene is a single isomer, so that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe one of the components in X is a different diene that upon hydrogenation forms cyclohexane. But that seems unlikely because a diene would require adding two H2 molecules, which would result in a more saturated structure.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another alkene that is not a ring compound. For example, suppose the other alkene is 1,3-pentadiene. But when hydrogenated, it would form pentane, which is a different compound. So that can't be, because the product is only Z.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think about the possible structures for X and Y.

Since Z is cyclohexane, which is C6H12.

When X is hydrogenated, both components become cyclohexane. So, the components of X must be such that upon hydrogenation, each becomes cyclohexane. That means each has a structure that, when hydrogen added, forms cyclohexane. So, their structures must be cyclohexene and another compound that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane. Wait, but cyclohexene is the only ring structure here.

Wait, perhaps the other component is 1,3-cyclohexadiene. If that's hydrogenated, it would become cyclohexane as well. So, X could be a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,3-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Let me see: treating them with H2 and Pt would hydrogenate the double bonds to form C6H12 (cyclohexane). So, X is a mixture of C6H10 and C6H8. When hydrogenated, both become C6H12.

But wait, the problem says that mixture X is treated with Pt when heated, which leads to a disproportionation to form Y. So, perhaps the reaction isn't hydrogenation but some other reaction.

Alternatively, maybe when X is treated with Pt, it undergoes a hydrogenation reaction, but some kind of isomerization. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, give the same product cyclohexane. Then, Y would be a mixture of two alkanes, one of which is cyclohexane (Z) and the other is another alkane. But the problem states that Y does not decolorize bromine, so both are alkanes.

But the problem states that Y is formed via a disproportionation reaction. So perhaps one component in X is being hydrogenated (reduction), and another is being dehydrogenated (oxidation). But that would require the other component in X to have a hydrogen that can be removed, which seems unlikely for alkenes.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening or something else. I think I'm stuck. Let me try a different approach.

Let me consider that Z is cyclohexane, which comes from X and Y upon hydrogenation. So, the components in X must be such that when hydrogenated, they become cyclohexane.

If X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane, then each must have a structure that, when hydrogenated, forms cyclohexane. That seems only possible if both alkenes are cyclohexene and perhaps another cycloalkene with more than one double bond.

Wait, cyclohexene (C6H10) upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane (C6H12). If another component in X is 1,3-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), upon hydrogenation, it would become cyclohexane as well. So, X is a mixture of cyclohexene and 1,3-cyclohexadiene. Both would hydrogenate to cyclohexane.

So, when X is treated with Pt and H2, both components become cyclohexane.

But wait, the problem states that X is treated with Pt and heated, leading to Y. So, perhaps X undergoes a reaction with Pt without hydrogen. Hmm, but the problem says that hydrogenation (which is a reaction with H2) is done separately.

Wait, no, the treatment with Pt and heating is a separate step that leads to Y. So, perhaps that step is not hydrogenation. Let me re-read.

Ah, the question says: "treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation".

So, the treatment is with Pt and heat, which might be a catalyst for a different reaction, perhaps isomerization or a rearrangement.

So, if X is a mixture of two alkenes, upon treatment with Pt and heat, they rearrange into two other substances, which are Y's components. But Y is a mixture of two alkanes (since they don't decolorize bromine).

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrogenation, but that doesn't explain the disproportionation.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrogenation, but that would require X's components to lose H2, but that doesn't make sense for alkenes.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that, when treated with Pt and heat, undergo some kind of isomerization. For example, cyclohexene isomerizing into another structure. But I'm not seeing how that leads to a mixture of alkanes.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of an alkene and an alkyne. So, when treated with Pt, the alkyne could hydrogenate to an alkene, but then that would still leave the alkene in the mixture. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrogenation without adding H2. But that doesn't quite make sense. Alternatively, perhaps Pt is causing some kind of decomposition.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the possible structures of X and Y.

X is mixture of two alkenes (since they decolorize Br2). Y is a mixture of two alkanes (since they don't react with Br2). Y includes Z, which is cyclohexane.

So, Y is equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and another alkane. Let's say Y is a mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and, say, hexane (C6H14), but that's just a guess.

Wait, but when X is hydrogenated, both components become Z, which is cyclohexane. So, the other component in X must hydrogenate to cyclohexane as well. So, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,3-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), both would hydrogenate to cyclohexane (C6H12). So, when X is hydrogenated, you get only cyclohexane.

Then, Y is a mixture of cyclohexane (Z) and another component, which is also an alkane. So, when Y is hydrogenated, the other component must also hydrogenate to cyclohexane. But cyclohexane is already saturated; how can it hydrogenate further? It can't. So that can't be.

Wait, but when Y is hydrogenated, it gives Z. So, the other component in Y must hydrogenate to Z. But Z is already an alkane. So, the other component in Y must be an alkene that upon hydrogenation becomes Z. But wait, Y's components don't react with bromine, so they are alkanes. So, how can they hydrogenate further? They can't. So, perhaps Y's other component is a different alkane that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alkanes don't react with hydrogen under normal conditions; they're already saturated. So Y's other component must be an alkane that when hydrogenated becomes cyclohexane. But that's impossible because alkanes don't undergo hydrogenation. So, maybe the other component in Y is a cycloalkane with more hydrogen, which upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane? No, that doesn’t make sense.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to summarize:

- X: 2 alkenes → decolorize Br2.
- After treatment with Pt and heat → Y: 2 alkanes → no Br2 reaction.
- Y contains Z (cyclohexane).
- X, when hydrogenated, gives only Z.
- Y, when hydrogenated, gives only Z.
- Z is 6 carbons, 12 H (C6H12), mass H fraction 14.28%.

So, for Y, the other component must be another alkane that, upon hydrogenation, becomes Z. But that can't happen. So perhaps Y's other component is a different cycloalkane, which upon hydrogenation becomes Z. But cyclohexane is already a cycloalkane; how would that happen? Maybe it's a larger ring?

Alternatively, perhaps Y's other component is a different structure, like a bicyclic compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the other component in Y is an alkane with a double bond, but that contradicts Y's property of not decolorizing bromine. So, no, Y's components are alkanes.

Hmm, perhaps I should think differently. Let's think about the possible number of hydrogen atoms in X's components.

If X is a mixture of two alkenes, each with n carbons, and each having a certain number of H atoms.

We need to find the total number of H atoms in the two liquids of X.

Each component of X is an alkene, which when hydrogenated gives Z, cyclohexane (C6H12).

So each component of X must have a structure that, when hydrogenated, forms C6H12. So, let's imagine each component in X is an alkene with 6 carbons.

Wait, if a component is C6H10 (cyclohexene), upon hydrogenation becomes C6H12.

If another component is C6H8 (1,3-cyclohexadiene), upon hydrogenation becomes C6H12.

So, X is a mixture of cyclohexene and 1,3-cyclohexadiene, each in equimolar amounts.

So, each molecule of X's components has:

- Cyclohexene: C6H10 → 10 H per molecule.
- 1,3-Cyclohexadiene: C6H8 → 8 H per molecule.

Wait, but the problem says X is an equimolar mixture. So, if each component is 1 mole, then the total H in X would be (10 +8) * 1 = 18 H. But wait, I'm not sure if each component is one mole in X. Wait, X is an equimolar mixture, so for each mole of one component, there's one mole of the other.

So, if each component has 10 and 8 H respectively, then per mole of X (which is 1 mole of each component), the total H would be (10 +8) = 18.

Wait, but each molecule of X's components has 10 and 8 H, respectively. So, for 1 mole of each, the total H would be 10 +8 =18 H atoms (since 1 mole is Avogadro's number of molecules, but the question asks for the total number of H atoms in two liquids of X. Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question says: "Indicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X." So, for each component in X, how many H atoms?

Wait, X is a mixture of two liquids, so it's two different compounds, each present in equimolar amounts. Let's say each component has a molecular formula C6H10 and C6H8.

Each molecule of the first component (C6H10) has 10 H atoms.

Each molecule of the second component (C6H8) has 8 H atoms.

Since X is an equimolar mixture, say n moles of each.

So the total number of H atoms in X would be (n *10) + (n *8) = 18n.

But the question is about the total number, not per mole. So, if X is 1 mole in total (n=1 for each component), then H atoms would be 18.

Looking at the options, option B is 18.

But wait, let me make sure.

Wait, perhaps X's components are 1-butene and another alkene. But 1-butene upon hydrogenation becomes butane, which is not cyclohexane. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the components are 1,3-cyclohexadiene and another di-substituted alkene that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X's components are two different alkenes, each with 6 carbons, each upon hydrogenation giving cyclohexane.

Wait, but 1,3-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) and cyclohexene (C6H10) upon hydrogenation would give cyclohexane. So X is a mixture of these two, each in equimolar amounts.

So, each component contributes 10 and 8 H per molecule, respectively. So, for 1 mole of each, the total H is 18.

So the answer would be 18, which is option B.


The problem involves analyzing the reactions and properties of mixtures X, Y, and Z. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Mixture X**:  
   - X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water, indicating the presence of unsaturation (likely alkenes or alkynes).  
   - When X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y.  

2. **Mixture Y**:  
   - Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that do not decolorize bromine water, meaning they are saturated (alkanes).  
   - Y contains Z, which is identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).  

3. **Hydrogenation**:  
   - Hydrogenation of X under severe conditions with platinum produces only Z (cyclohexane).  
   - Similarly, hydrogenation of Y also produces only Z. This implies that the components of X must hydrogenate to form cyclohexane, and the other component of Y must also hydrogenate to cyclohexane.  

4. **Properties of Z**:  
   - Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%, which corresponds to cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).  
   - Z is a constituent of Y and is widely used as a solvent.  

5. **Disproportionation of X**:  
   - X is a mixture of two alkenes. Upon treatment with platinum and heat, these alkenes rearrange or react to form Y, which contains cyclohexane and another alkane.  

6. **Hydrogenation of X**:  
   - The components of X must hydrogenate to form cyclohexane. A plausible scenario is that X contains cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,3-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). Both of these, upon hydrogenation, form cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).  

7. **Total Hydrogen Atoms in X**:  
   - Each molecule of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) contains 10 hydrogen atoms.  
   - Each molecule of 1,3-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) contains 8 hydrogen atoms.  
   - Since X is an equimolar mixture of these two compounds, the total number of hydrogen atoms per mole of X is:  
     \[
     10 + 8 = 18
     \]

Thus, the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X is **18**.

Answer: B
