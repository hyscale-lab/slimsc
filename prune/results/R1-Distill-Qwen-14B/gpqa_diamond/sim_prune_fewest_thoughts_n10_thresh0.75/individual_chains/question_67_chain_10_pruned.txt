Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, let me read it again. 

The question is about two electrons in p orbitals. Each p orbital has an angular momentum quantum number l=1. So, both electrons have l1 and l2 equal to 1. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, wait. The state is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. But wait, wait—hold on, isn't the maximum possible l when combining two l=1 particles equal to 2? Because when you add angular momenta, l can be l1 + l2, l1 + l2 -1, ..., down to |l1 - l2|. So for l1=1 and l2=1, the possible total l values are 2, 1, 0. So the given state has l=2, which makes sense. And m is -1 in this case.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. We're supposed to find the joint probability that both L1z and L2z have eigenvalues of -ħ. 

Wait, wait. The orbital angular momentum operators are L1z and L2z. For each electron, the eigenvalue of L1z is m1 * ħ, and similarly for L2z, it's m2 * ħ. So for each, m can be -1, 0, +1 because l=1. So the possible eigenvalues are -ħ, 0, +ħ.

The question is asking for the probability that both are measured to be -ħ. So that would correspond to m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

But how does that tie into the state |1,1,2,-1>? I think I need to look into how this coupled state breaks down into the product states of individual m's.

The coupled state |l1, l2, l, m> is the same as |1,1,2,-1>. But wait, each electron's orbital angular momentum is in their own state. So the total state is a combination of the individual m states.

Wait, when you have a coupled state, it's a linear combination of the product states. The product states are |m1, m2>, where m1 is the m of the first electron and m2 the second. So for example, |1,1> would be m1=1, m2=1. But our total m is -1.

In the coupled state, the |1,1,2,-1> state must be expressed in terms of the product states |m1, m2>. So I need to find the expansion coefficients for each |m1, m2> in the |1,1,2,-1> state.

But wait, how do you express the coupled state in terms of the product states? I remember that the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are used for this purpose. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients (CG coefficients) relate the coupled states |l1, l2, l, m> to the product states |m1, m2>.

So for the state |1,1,2,-1>, which is a coupled state, we can write it as a linear combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = M, and M in this case is -1.

Wait, because the total m is the sum of individual m's. So for the coupled state with m_total = -1, the product states must have m1 + m2 = -1. So possible (m1, m2) pairs are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1). Because 1 and -2 is not possible since m can't be less than -1 for l=1.

Wait, wait. Let me list all possible m1 and m2 where m1 + m2 = -1.

Possible m1 values are -1, 0, +1.

Possible m2 values are same.

So the possible pairs:

m1=-1, m2=0: sum is -1.

m1=0, m2=-1: sum is -1.

m1=1, m2=-2: but m2 can't be -2, since l=1. So that's invalid.

Similarly, m1=-2 is invalid. So the only possible pairs are ( -1, 0 ) and ( 0, -1 ).

So in the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, it's a linear combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

But what are the coefficients for these?

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two l=1 states to get l=2, m=-1.

I think the formula for CG coefficients when combining two angular momenta is something like:

|l1, l2, l, m> = sum_{m1 + m2 = m} [ CG(l1, l2, l, m1, m2) ] * |m1, m2>.

In our case, l1 = 1, l2 =1, l=2, m=-1.

So the possible m1 and m2 are as above.

The CG coefficients for this case.

I recall that for two l=1 states adding to l=2, the CG coefficients can be found from standard tables or formulas.

Alternatively, I might remember that for the state |1,1,2,-1>, it's a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, but how are the coefficients determined?

The general formula for CG coefficients when adding two angular momenta is a bit involved, but
