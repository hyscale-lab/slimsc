Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it carefully again.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics are involved, which brings in considerations of isospin, angular momentum, and spin.

The key equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So T is the isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state. The problem states that T(NN) is 0, and we need to determine which partial wave isn't allowed based on conservation laws.

The options are four different transitions, each involving the emission of a different particle (p, f, etc.) and ending in a different state. We have to figure out which one violates the conservation of angular momentum and parity.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, the initial state is 1S0. Using the notation (2S+1)L(J), so 1S0 would mean 2S+1 = 1 → S=0, L=0 (since S0), and J=0. So the initial state has spin S=0, orbital angular momentum L=0, and total angular momentum J=0.

When the two nucleons emit a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of the emitted particle is -1.

In terms of conservation, parity is conserved in strong interactions (which this seems to be, since it's about nucleons and p emission is a common strong decay). So the parity of the initial state must equal the product of the parity of the final NN state and the parity of the emitted particle.

The parity of a state is given by (-1)^{L}, where L is the orbital angular momentum. The initial state is 1S0, so L=0. Its parity is (-1)^0 = +1.

The final NN state has some T, S, and L, and we're told T=0. So from the equation T = S + L +1 mod 2. Let's plug T=0 into that. So 0 ≡ S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2.

So S and L must have opposite parity—meaning one is even and the other is odd.

Now, considering the parity conservation. The total parity after emission is the parity of the NN state multiplied by the parity of X.

So initial parity (P_initial) = P_final * P_X.

P_initial is +1. P_X is -1. So P_final = P_initial / P_X = (1)/(-1) )= -1.

Wait, no, wait. Parity is a multiplicative quantum number. So P_initial = P_final * P_X.

So 1 = P_final * (-1). So P_final must be -1. Because 1 = (-1)*(-1) → P_final is -1.

So the parity of the final NN state is -1. The parity of the NN state is (-1)^L_final. So (-1)^L_final = -1 → L_final must be odd. Because (-1)^{odd} = -1.

So L_final is an odd integer. Possible values are 1,3,5 etc., but in the options, I think the possible L's are given by the letters.

Wait, looking at the options, each option is 3P0, 3S1, etc. But the final state's L is given by the letter. Because the spectroscopic notation is (2S+1)LJ. So for example, option D is 3P0: which would be S=1 (since 2S+1=3 → S=1), L= P → which is 1, and J=0.

So the final state's L must be odd. So the possible L values in the options must be odd.

Looking at each option:

Options:
A) 7D1: D is L=2. Wait, no, wait: D is L=2? Wait, no: in spectroscopic notation, the letters are S=0, P=1, D=2, F=3, etc. So A is 7D1: L=2 (since D is 2). Wait, but earlier we concluded that L_final must be odd. So if L=2 is even, then this can't happen. Hmm, but wait, wait, let me check each option.

Wait, the final state is the NN state, which must have L_final being odd because the parity is -1.

So let me list each option's L:

Option A: 7D1 → L=2 → even. Parity would be (+1) since L is even. But we need P_final = -1. So this would be a problem. So this option might be invalid.

Option B: 3S1 → S=1, L=0 (S). L=0 is even. Parity would be (+1). That's a problem because we need P_final = -1. So this option would have a parity of +1, which doesn't match. So B is invalid.

Option C: 3D3 → L=2. Again even. So parity would be +1. Not allowed, but we're told the parity needs to be -1. So C is also invalid.

Option D: 3P0 → L=1. Parity would be (-1)^1 = -1. So that works.

Wait, but let me think again. Because the problem is about which partial wave is not permitted. So if the final state's L is even, then its parity is +1, which doesn't match the required -1. So any option where L is even can't be allowed.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: L=2 → even → P = +1 → not allowed. So this option is invalid.

Option B: L=0 → even → P = +1 → invalid.

Option C: L=2 → even → P=+1→ invalid.

Option D: L=1 → P=-1 → valid.

So the only valid option is D. The others have even L and thus parity +1, which would make the product P_final * P_X = (+1)*(-1) = -1, but the initial is +1. So that can't be correct. So the initial parity is +1, the final parity must be (parity of NN state) * (parity of X). So 1 = (parity of NN) * (-1). So parity of NN must be -1. So L must be odd.

So in that case, any option where the final state has even L is invalid. So options A, B, and C have even L, but D has L=1 (odd), so it's allowed.

Wait, but the question is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So which options have L even, making their parity +1, which is not allowed, because the product would be +1 * (-1) = -1, but initial parity is +1, so that's a problem.

Wait, wait, let me re-express the parity equation:

Initial parity (P_initial) = P_final (NN) * P_X.

P_initial is 1, P_X is -1.

So 1 = P_final * (-1) → P_final = -1.

So the parity of the NN state
