Okay, I need to solve this physics problem. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about the uncertainty principle. It says that an electron is traveling at a speed v = 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its location (Δx) is 0.1 nm. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron. The options are A to D, each with different orders of magnitude in Joules.

Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties can be known. For position and momentum, the principle is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh, right, and since the problem asks for the minimum uncertainty, I'll use the equality: Δx * Δp = ħ/2.

Wait, but how does this relate to energy uncertainty? Oh, because energy is related to momentum through the kinetic energy formula. So, the uncertainty in energy ΔE will be related to the uncertainty in momentum Δp. Because of the uncertainty principle, ΔE would be at least on the order of the kinetic energy associated with Δp.

So the steps I think I should take are:

1. Calculate Δp using the uncertainty principle.
2. Use Δp to find the minimum uncertainty in momentum.
3. Convert that into energy using the kinetic energy formula, since the electron's speed is given.

Wait, but wait. The kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², but when dealing with uncertainties, is it correct to just use that formula? Or should I use the relativistic formula? Hmm. The speed given is v = 2e8 m/s. Let's check: the speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. So 2e8 is roughly 2/3 the speed of light. That's pretty fast, so relativistic effects might be significant. Oh, but let me calculate the momentum and see whether relativistic considerations are necessary.

Alternatively, I could compute the momentum using relativistic equations, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here. Maybe the problem expects a non-relativistic approach.

Wait, the problem gives the speed as v, so perhaps it's better to proceed with non-relativistic calculations unless told otherwise.

So, let's proceed step by step.

First, calculate Δp using the uncertainty principle.
