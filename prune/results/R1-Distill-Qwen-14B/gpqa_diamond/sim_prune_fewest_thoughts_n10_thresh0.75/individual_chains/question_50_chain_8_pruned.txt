Alright, so I've got this physics question here about Feynman diagrams and loop calculations in quantum field theory. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Okay, the question is about determining the number of loops in a Feynman diagram based on the "size estimate" written next to it. The expression given is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. I remember that in loop calculations, certain factors come into play based on the number of loops.

Wait, I think each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of (4π)^{-n}, where n is the number of loops. Because each loop integral typically brings in a factor of 1/(4π)^something. Oh right, for each loop, you usually have a 1/(4π)^d, where d depends on the spacetime dimensions and the loop order.

Also, alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is e^2/(4πε₀ħc), but in terms of Feynman diagrams, each vertex in a diagram contributes a factor of alpha. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in QED, each photon vertex contributes a factor of e, and alpha is e^2/(4π) approximately. So for each photon line in a diagram, you get an e, and so for each loop, the number of vertices affects the power of alpha.

Wait, but in a Feynman diagram, the number of loops relates to the order of the process. For example, a tree-level diagram has zero loops. One loop would be a loop correction, like a loop with one circle. Each loop typically increases the number of integrals and hence the factors in the amplitude.

Let me think about how the factors scale with loops. Each loop contributes a factor of (1/(4π))^something. Wait, in dimensional regularization, the loop integrals often result in factors like 1/(16π²) per loop. Wait, for a one-loop diagram, the integral might give something like 1/(16π²), which is (1/(4π))^2. Wait, wait, 16π² is (4π)^2, so 1/(16π²) is 1/(4π)^2. So each loop contributes a factor of 1/(4π)^2 per loop.

So, let
