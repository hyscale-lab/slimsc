Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

The question says: A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r² from the origin. The magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇·f, inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on vector calculus, but let me try to remember. So, the divergence of a vector field gives us a scalar field, and integrating that over a volume gives us the total divergence or something like the flux through the surface, according to the divergence theorem.

Wait, the divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the surface integral of the vector field. So, ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA, where n is the outward unit normal vector on the surface. So maybe I can compute either the volume integral or the surface integral to find the answer.

But wait, the problem is asking for the volume integral, but perhaps computing it directly would be easier. Alternatively, I can compute the surface integral, which might be simpler in this case because the field is radial.

Let me think: For a radial vector field, the divergence in spherical coordinates is given by a specific formula. The general expression for the divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field with only the radial component (let's say F = F_r e_r) is:

∇·F = (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F_r)

Because in spherical coordinates, the divergence simplifies when the field is purely radial. So that's the formula I remember.

Given that F(r) = 1/r², then F_r = 1/r², and the other components (like theta and phi) are zero. So let me plug this into the divergence formula.

So, ∇·F = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) 

Let me compute the term inside the derivative first. r² * (1/r²) is just 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is 0. So ∇·F = (1/r²) * 0 = 0. Wait, does that mean the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin?

Wait, but wait a second. Is that correct? Because for r not equal to zero, the divergence is zero. But at r=0, the field isn't defined because it's 1/r², which goes to infinity as r approaches zero. So the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin.

But wait, the integral over the volume would then be zero, because the divergence is zero everywhere in the volume except at a single point. But integrals in calculus often ignore points because they have zero measure. So the volume integral would be zero. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I remember that for the electric field, which is similar, the divergence is zero except at the charge, but the integral over a volume enclosing the charge would give a non-zero value.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The divergence is zero except at r=0, but the function isn't defined there. So maybe I should think about the integral in a region excluding the origin, but in this problem, the sphere includes the origin because it's centered there.

Ah, right. So the vector field has a point source at the origin. So in reality, the divergence is a delta function at the origin. So the integral of ∇·f over the sphere would be the same as the integral of the surface flux through the sphere.

Wait, but let me think about that. According to the divergence theorem, the integral of ∇·f over the volume would be the flux through the surface. So maybe a better approach is to compute the flux through the surface of the sphere of radius R, and that will give me the integral.

The flux Φ is the integral of f · n dA over the surface. Since the field is radial, f · n is just f(r) times 1 (because n is radial) on
