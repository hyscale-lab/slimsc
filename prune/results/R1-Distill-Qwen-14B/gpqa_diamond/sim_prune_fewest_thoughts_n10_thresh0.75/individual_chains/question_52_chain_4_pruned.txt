Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the setup: There's a star with certain characteristics. The star has 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. Without any spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. So, when the star has spots, the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2 decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The options are A to D.

Hmm. So I think this is about the Boltzmann equation. Because in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. The equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2 - E1)/(k*T)) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E is energy difference, k is Boltzmann constant, T is temperature.

Wait, but the ratio is n1/n2, because the question says that when there are spots, the ratio decreases. Let me think again. The observed ratio n1/n2 decreases when spots are present. So when the star is spotted, the ratio is lower than when it's not. So without spots, the ratio is higher.

So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots. Which would be [ (n1/n2)_Teff=6000 ] divided by [ (n1/n2)_Teff=5500 ].

Wait, yes. Because the ratio when no spots (6000K) is higher than when spots (5500K), so the factor would be greater than 1.

So using the Boltzmann equation, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). Because E2>E1, so (E2-E1) is positive. So as temperature decreases, the exponent becomes smaller, making the ratio smaller. Hence, n1/n2 decreases. Which matches the scenario in the question.

So the factor is [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T2)) ] ), since the statistical weights (g1 and g2) are the same in both cases, they cancel out. So the factor is exp( (ΔE/(k T1)) - (ΔE/(k T
