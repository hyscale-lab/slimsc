Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. Hmm.

Alright, let's read the problem again. The potential is given as V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²(θ). I need to find the energy levels. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different expressions involving n_x, n_y, and some coefficients.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, when dealing with potentials, sometimes you can separate the variables into radial and angular parts. If the potential depends on r and θ, maybe it's a polar coordinate system problem. So, perhaps I can rewrite the potential in terms of r and θ and see if it's separable.

Looking at V(r,θ), it's the sum of two terms: (1/2)kr² and (3/2)kr² cos²θ. The first term is just a function of r, and the second term depends on both r and θ. Hmm, but the second term has cos²θ. Maybe we can factor this.

Wait, cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity. Right, cos²θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² [ (1 + cos 2θ)/2 ].

Let me compute that. So the second term becomes (3/2) * kr² * (1/2 + (cos 2θ)/2). That would be (3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos 2θ. So combining the terms, the potential is:

V(r,θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/4 kr² + (3/4) kr² cos 2θ.

Wait, adding the first and third terms? No, wait, first term is 1/2 kr², then the second part is 3/4 kr² multiplied by 1 (from (1 + cos 2θ)/2). So the first part is 1/2 kr², and the second part is 3/4 kr². So adding
