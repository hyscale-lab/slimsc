Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm. The Hamiltonian given is H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n vectors. Oh wait, sigma is the Pauli spin matrices, right? And n is a unit vector, so it's direction arbitrary. 

Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Each of them are 2x2 matrices. The dot product of sigma and n would be n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z. So H is epsilon multiplied by that sum. 

But wait, the eigenvalues of a matrix depend on its structure. I recall that for a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of the spin operator in any direction are ±ħ/2. But wait, this is the Hamiltonian, which is like the energy operator. 

Wait, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so H must be Hermitian because it's an observable (Hamiltonian). The eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix are real. 

So, the question is about the eigenvalues of H. Let me think about the general form. The Pauli matrices have the property that when you take their trace (sum of diagonal elements), it's zero because each Pauli matrix has trace zero. Also, each Pauli matrix squared is the identity matrix. So sigma_x squared, sigma_y squared, sigma_z squared all equal I, the identity matrix. 

So, let's model H as H = epsilon (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z). Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. 

Now, to find the eigenvalues of H, I can think of H as epsilon times a vector in the space of spin operators. The eigenvalues would be related to the magnitude of this operator. 

Wait, the eigenvalues of a matrix of the form a sigma_x + b sigma_y + c sigma_z would be plus and minus the square root of (a² + b² + c²), multiplied by some factor. Wait, no, wait. Because sigma matrices anti-commute, but when you have a linear combination like a sigma_x + b sigma_y + c sigma_z, the square of this matrix would be (a sigma_x + b sigma_y + c sigma_z)^2 = a² sigma_x² + b² sigma_y² + c² sigma_z² + 2ab (sigma_x sigma_y + sigma_y sigma_x) ) and so on for cross terms. But since sigma_i squared is I for each i, and sigma_i sigma_j = i epsilon_ijk sigma_k (for i != j), so the cross terms would involve terms like 2ab (i sigma_z) for sigma_x sigma_y? Wait, maybe I'm getting into too much detail here. 

Alternatively, I can think about the operator H. Since H is proportional to a vector in spin space, its eigenvalues should correspond to the magnitude of that vector times some factor. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that any such spin operator's eigenvalues are ± some value. 

Wait, in the case where H is epsilon times sigma·n, then the magnitude of sigma·n would be the same as the sum of the squares. Wait, (sigma·n)^2 would be (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z)^2. Let me compute this. 

Expanding that, each sigma_i squared is I, so n_x^2 I + n_y^2 I + n_z^2 I + terms from cross products. The cross terms are 2n_x n_y sigma_x sigma_y + 2n_x n_z sigma_x sigma_z + 2n_y n_z sigma_y sigma_z.

But sigma_x sigma_y = i sigma_z, sigma_x sigma_z = -i sigma_y, and sigma_y sigma_z = i sigma_x. Wait, actually, the cross terms would be 2n_x n_y (i sigma_z) + 2n_x n_z (-i sigma_y) + 2n_y n_z (i sigma_x). Hmm, but when we take (sigma·n)^2, we're adding all these terms. 

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the trace and determinant to find eigenvalues. Because for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found from the trace (sum of eigenvalues) and determinant (product of eigenvalues).

The trace of H is trace(epsilon (n·sigma)). Since each Pauli matrix has trace zero, the trace of H is zero. So the sum of eigenvalues is zero. So the eigenvalues must be symmetric around zero.

The determinant of H is det(epsilon (n·sigma)). Since det(aA) = a^2 det(A) for a scalar a, and det(sigma·n) is the determinant of a 2x2 matrix. For a 2x2 matrix, the determinant is (product of diagonal elements) - (product of off-diagonal elements). Let's see, for sigma·n, written as a matrix:

sigma·n = n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_y [[0,-i],[i,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]]
So sigma·n is a 2x2 matrix:

[ n_z, n_x - i n_y ]
[ n_x + i n_y, -n_z ]

So the determinant of this matrix is (n_z)(-n_z) - (n_x - i n_y)(n_x + i n_y). Let's compute this.

First term: (n_z)(-n_z) = -n_z^2.

Second term: (n_x - i n_y)(n_x + i n_y) = n_x^2 + (n_y)^2, because (a - ib)(a + ib) = a² + b².

So determinant is (-n_z^2) - (n_x^2 + n_y^2) ) = -(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) ) = -1, since n is a unit vector. 

So the determinant of sigma·n is -1. Then the determinant of H is (epsilon)^2 times det(sigma·n) = epsilon^2 * (-1). 

So for the eigenvalues, the product of the eigenvalues is det(H) = -epsilon^2. Since the sum is zero, the eigenvalues are the roots of lambda^2 - (trace) lambda + det(H) = 0. So lambda^2 - 0 lambda - epsilon^2 = 0. 

Solving this quadratic: lambda = sqrt(epsilon^2) * ... Wait no, wait, the equation is lambda^2 = epsilon^2. So lambda = +epsilon and -epsilon. 

Wait wait, wait. Because the equation is lambda^2 - (0) lambda + (det H) = 0. So lambda^2 + |
