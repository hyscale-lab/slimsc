The key steps to determine X are as follows:\n\n1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. This condition is satisfied by O\u2082, as each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, making O\u2082 have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. Thus, W is O\u2082.\n\n2. **Precipitate G and Compound B**: When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K (approximately 4\u00b0C). This suggests B is water (H\u2082O), as it melts at 273 K (0\u00b0C) and aligns closely with the given temperature. Therefore, G is likely a hydrated salt that releases H\u2082O upon heating.\n\n3. **Substance X**: X reacts with Y to produce O\u2082 and G. X is described as incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements and is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. A plausible candidate for X is O\u2082F\u2082 (difluorine monoxide), which reacts with water to produce O\u2082 and HF. This fits the reaction conditions and the requirement for X to contain isotopes.\n\n4. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**: X contains oxygen (O) and fluorine (F). The atomic mass of oxygen is approximately 16, and that of fluorine is approximately 9. The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest (F) and heaviest (O) elements in X sum to 16 + 9 = 25.\n\n5. **Reaction with a Keto Acid**: When X reacts with a keto acid, the product contains 2 oxygen atoms. This aligns with the properties of O\u2082F\u2082, which can interact with acids to form products with specific oxygen content.\n\nGiven the analysis, the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X sum to 25, corresponding to option B.\n\n**Answer: B**"
