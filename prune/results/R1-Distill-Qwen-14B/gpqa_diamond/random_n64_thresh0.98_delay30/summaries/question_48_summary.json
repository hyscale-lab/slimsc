Here's the analysis:\n\n1. **Reaction 1: Cyclohexanone + Br\u2082 \u2192 Product 1**  \n   Cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Bromination occurs at the alpha carbons (C2 and C6), leading to the formation of 2,6-dibromocyclohexanone (product 1).\n\n2. **Reaction 2: Product 1 + NaOH (heat) \u2192 Product 2**  \n   Heating 2,6-dibromocyclohexanone with NaOH results in an elimination reaction. Two molecules of HBr are removed, forming a double bond between C2 and C3. This produces 1,2-cyclohexenone (product 2).\n\n3. **Reaction 3: Product 2 + SOCl\u2082/pyridine \u2192 Product 3**  \n   Thionyl chloride converts the ketone group in 1,2-cyclohexenone into an acid chloride, yielding 1-chloro-1,2-cyclohexenone (product 3).\n\n4. **Reaction 4: Product 3 + LiAlH\u2084 \u2192 Product 4**  \n   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride reduces the acid chloride to a primary alcohol. The carbonyl group is replaced with a CH\u2082OH group, resulting in 1-cyclohexenol (product 4).\n\n5. **Structure of Product 4 (1-Cyclohexenol)**  \n   The final structure is a six-membered ring with an -OH group at C1 and a double bond between C2 and C3. The positions of the hydrogens are as follows:  \n   - C1: CH\u2082OH (2 equivalent hydrogens).  \n   - C2: CH (1 unique hydrogen, sp\u00b2 hybridized).  \n   - C3: CH (1 unique hydrogen, sp\u00b2 hybridized).  \n   - C4: CH\u2082 (2 equivalent hydrogens).  \n   - C5: CH\u2082 (2 equivalent hydrogens).  \n   - C6: CH\u2082 (2 equivalent hydrogens).  \n\n6. **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms**  \n   - C1 contributes 1 set of equivalent hydrogens.  \n   - C2 contributes 1 unique set of hydrogens.  \n   - C3 contributes 1 unique set of hydrogens.  \n   - C4, C5, and C6 each contribute 1 set of equivalent hydrogens.  \n   Total: **6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms**.\n\nThus, the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4 is **6**.\n\nAnswer: A)6"
