Here's the analysis:\n\n1. **Compound A**: The IR spectrum shows a strong peak at 1750 cm\u207b\u00b9, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group. The Wittig reaction product (1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane) suggests that A is a cyclopentanone with methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, and a ketone at position 3. Thus, A is identified as **1,2-dimethylcyclopentan-3-one**.\n\n2. **Compound B**: Reaction of A with HCN forms a cyanohydrin. This adds a hydroxyl (-OH) and nitrile (-CN) group adjacent to the carbonyl, resulting in **3-(cyanohydroxymethyl)-1,2-dimethylcyclopentane**.\n\n3. **Compound C**: Reduction of B with H\u2082 and Pd reduces the nitrile group (-CN) to a primary amine (-CH\u2082NH\u2082), while the hydroxyl group (-OH) remains unchanged. Thus, C is **3-(aminomethyl)-1,2-dimethylcyclopentanol**.\n\n4. **Compound D**: Reaction of C with HNO\u2082 converts the primary amine (-CH\u2082NH\u2082) into a diazonium salt (-CH\u2082N\u2082\u207a). This intermediate is unstable and sets up for the elimination step.\n\n5. **Compound E**: Elimination of an inert gas (likely N\u2082) from the diazonium salt leads to the formation of a ketone. The elimination process involves rearrangement, likely forming a smaller ring (cyclobutane) and placing the ketone at position 1. The substituents adjust accordingly, resulting in **2,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclobutan-1-one**.\n\n### Critical Analysis of Options:\n- **Option D (2,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclobutan-1-one)**: Matches the expected product after ring contraction and rearrangement. The ketone is at position 1, and the substituents are positioned as described.\n\nThe most plausible answer is **Option D**, as it aligns with the reaction sequence, IR data, and structural transformations.\n\nAnswer: D"
