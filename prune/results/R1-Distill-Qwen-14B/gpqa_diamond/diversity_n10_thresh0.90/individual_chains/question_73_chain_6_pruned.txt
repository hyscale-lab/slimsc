Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem states that there are two astronauts. The first has a mass of 2m moving at 0.6c, and the second has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait, wait. Oh, wait, the relative speed. Since they're moving in the same direction, I can't just subtract their speeds like I would in classical mechanics. I remember that at relativistic speeds, you can't do that because of the velocity addition formula. Right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity.

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me write that down. So v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). 

Wait, but wait a second. Oh wait, no. Because in this case, the astronauts are in the same frame, or is it the relative speed from one's perspective? Hmm, no, the relative speed as observed from one astronaut's frame. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, then from A's perspective, how fast is B moving?

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says "relative speed". So if both are going in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference, but adjusted for relativity. So using the velocity addition formula. Let's compute that.

v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c^2)).

Simplify numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel = (0.1c)/0.7 = 1/7 c ≈ 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c when rounded to two decimal places. So looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Now the total energy of the system. Since each astronaut is a relativistic mass, their energies are each their rest mass energy multiplied by gamma.

Wait, wait. The rest energy is mc² for each, but each has a gamma factor based on their speed.

So for astronaut 1: mass is 2m, speed is 0.6c. Gamma for 0.6c is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = gamma * m_rest * c². The rest mass here is 2m, so E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the rest mass is 2m, so its rest energy is 2m c². So E1 would be gamma multiplied by 2m c². So yes, 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Similarly, astronaut 2: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈
