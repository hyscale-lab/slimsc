Okay, so I need to figure out the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the lab. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem. 

The setup is a glass moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. The light is moving toward the observer, and the glass is also moving in the same direction. Wait, no, wait. The glass is moving toward the observer, so if the light is in the same direction, that means the light is moving towards the observer, but the glass is moving towards the observer as well. Oh wait, no, the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is towards the observer. So the glass is moving in the direction of the beam, which is towards the observer. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me re-read the question.

"A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory."

Wait, so the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, and toward the observer. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction. So the glass is moving towards the observer as well? Or is it that the beam is moving toward the observer, but the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which would be towards the observer. So both the glass and the light are moving towards the observer, but the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is going towards the observer, the glass is moving in the same direction—so same path as the beam.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the reference frames. The lab frame is the observer's frame. The glass is moving with velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, which is towards the observer. So from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving towards the observer at speed v, and the light is moving towards the observer as well, but in the glass medium.

Wait, but the speed of light in a medium is different. The speed of light in the glass is c/n, where n is the refractive index. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the glass, right? Because when the glass is stationary, light slows down to c/n. But when the glass is moving, how does that affect the speed of the light as seen from the lab frame?

Oh wait, I think I need to apply special relativity here. Because when the medium itself is moving, the speed of light in that medium as observed in the lab frame isn't just c/n. Because the medium is moving, so we have to consider how velocities add in relativity.

Wait, but I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think. The speed of light in the glass in its rest frame is v_glass = c/n. But when the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame, how does that affect the speed of the light beam observed in the lab?

In special relativity, velocities don't simply add linearly. The formula for adding velocities is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²), right? Where u is the velocity in the rest frame of the medium, and v is the velocity of the medium relative to the lab. 

Wait, but in this case, the light's velocity in the glass's frame is v_light = c/n. So the direction is the same as the glass's motion. So from the lab frame, the velocity of the light would be (c/n + v) / (1 + (c/(n c)) v) ), right? Because u would be c/n, and v is the speed of the glass.

Wait, let me correct that. The formula for adding velocities is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/c²). Here, u is the velocity of the light in the glass's frame, which is c/n. v is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab. Since both are in the same direction, it's positive.

So plugging in, u' = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ]

Simplify denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)).

So u' = (c/n + v) / (1 + (v)/(n
