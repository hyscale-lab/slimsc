Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question gives me the density matrix rho as (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So this rho is a density matrix for a qubit.

Wait, what's the geometrical position of a density matrix in qubit space? Oh right, the Bloch sphere! The Bloch sphere is a way to represent all possible states of a qubit. Each point on the sphere corresponds to a quantum state. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

The standard form for a density matrix of a qubit is rho = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector pointing from the origin to a point on the Bloch sphere, and σ are the Pauli matrices. So r has components (x, y, z), and the vector would be (x, y, z).

So, the given rho is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me rewrite |0><0| and |1><1| in terms of the Pauli matrices. Wait, I think |0><0| is equal to (I + σ_z)/2, and |1><1| is (I - σ_z)/2. Let me check that.

Yes, because |0> is (1, 0) and |1> is (0, 1). So |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So when I take the average (since rho is multiplied by 1/2), the sum of |0><0| and |1><1| is I, so rho becomes (I)/2.

Wait, but the standard form is (I + r·σ)/2. So if I'm comparing rho = (I + 0·σ)/2, that means r·σ = 0. Which implies that r must be the zero vector, right? Because the only way the vector r multiplied by the Pauli matrices (which are non-zero) sums to zero is if r itself is zero.

So the vector r would be (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So this must be the case.

Wait a second, what does that mean for the state? If r is zero, then the density matrix is (I/2), which is a completely mixed state. That makes sense because a mixed state with equal probabilities of being in |0> and |1> would be a maximally mixed state, which is represented by the center of the Bloch sphere. So the geometrical position is the origin.

So the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} = (x, y, z) \) is a vector pointing to a point on the Bloch sphere, and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \( \rho \), we note that \( \rho = \frac{I}{2} \), which implies \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0 \). The only way this can happen is if \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), meaning the density matrix corresponds to the completely mixed state.

This mixed state is represented geometrically as the origin of the Bloch sphere. Among the given options, the correct position is \( r = (0, 0, 0) \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
