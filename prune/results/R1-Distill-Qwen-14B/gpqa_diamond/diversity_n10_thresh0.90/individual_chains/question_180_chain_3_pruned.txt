Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the minimum energy of a system of charges. Alright, let's break it down.

So, there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has 2 times that. And their masses are negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that—just potential energy maybe.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. Oh, and the thirteenth charge is fixed at P. So, point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other 12 are all at 2 meters away from P. Interesting setup.

The question asks for the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals. So I'm guessing it's the potential energy we're looking for here.

Wait, potential energy in an electrostatic system... I remember that the potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. But when you have multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. Oh right, because each pair contributes to the total.

But wait, wait—that might be overcomplicating it. Let me think. When all the charges are the same and arranged symmetrically, maybe there's a formula for the potential energy of a configuration.

Wait, the setup here is that 12 charges are all at the same distance from P, and the 13th is at P. So, each of the 12 is 2 meters away from P, where the 13th is. So for each of the 12 charges, their distance from the 13th is 2 meters.

So the potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies between each of the 12 charges and the 13th, plus the potential energies between the 12 charges themselves?

Wait, but wait a minute. Are the 12 charges free to move except for being at 2m from P? The problem says they are 'constrained' to stay at 2m, so I think they form some sort of spherical arrangement, maybe a regular dodecahedron or something, but in any case, they are all equidistant from P. But since all the 1
