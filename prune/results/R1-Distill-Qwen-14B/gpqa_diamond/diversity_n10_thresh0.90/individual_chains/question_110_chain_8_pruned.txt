Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO and HIRES. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let's read the question again carefully.

The question says that ESPRESSO at Paranal can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So, that means it can detect stars up to 17 mag or brighter. Wait, wait, no, actually, the way it's phrased, it's stars brighter than 17 mag. Wait, in astronomy, lower magnitude numbers mean brighter objects. So, a star with V magnitude 17 is fainter than a star with V mag 16. So ESPRESSO can see up to 17 mag. So any star with apparent V mag less than or equal to 17 is observable by ESPRESSO.

Similarly, HIRES at Keck can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, apparent V mag <=16. So if a star has apparent V mag less than or equal to 16, it can be detected by HIRES.

But wait, the question is, which stars can be detected by both? So the star's apparent V magnitude must be <=17 (so ESPRESSO can see it) and <=16 (so HIRES can see it). Oh wait, no, wait. Because HIRES can see stars down to V mag 16, but ESPRESSO can see down to 17. So for a star to be seen by both, its apparent V magnitude must be <=16, because if it's above 16, ESPRESSO can see it (since 17 is the limit), but HIRES can't. Wait, no. Wait, let me rephrase: For a star to be detected by both, it must be bright enough for both instruments. So it must have apparent V mag <=16, because that's the stricter limit. Because if it's 17, HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can. So the star must have apparent V mag <=16 to be detectable by both.

Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 can be observed. That means apparent V mag <17. Similarly, for HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag are observed, so apparent V mag <16. So for a star to be detected by both, it must have apparent V mag less than 16. Because if it's 16, HIRES can't observe (since it's brighter than 16, which is the limit). No, wait. Wait, the way it's phrased: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So the condition is V_mag < 17 (since brighter is lower magnitude). Similarly, for HIRES, V_mag <16.

So for a star to be detected by both instruments, V_mag must be less than 16, because that's the stricter condition. Because if the V_mag is 16, it's within ESPRESSO's limit (since 16<17), but HIRES can't observe it because it's exactly 16; wait, no, because the condition is "brighter than 16", so V_mag must be less than 16 to be observed by HIRES. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be less than 16 for both to observe it.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The question says, with ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So, m_V <17. With HIRES, m_V <16. So, for a star to be observable by both, it must satisfy both conditions. So m_V has to be less than 16, because 16 is the stricter condition. So only stars with m_V <16 can be seen by both.

Wait, but I should
