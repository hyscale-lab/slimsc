Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. So, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their properties are given, and I need to find out by how much Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. Hmm.

Let me read the details again. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. And its mass is also 1.5 times larger. Wait, but the question is about luminosities, so maybe the mass isn't directly relevant here. Oh, but wait, maybe it's a red herring or maybe it's not needed. Let me think. Luminosity relates to radius and temperature, right? Because the Stefan-Boltzmann law says L = 4πR²σT⁴. So, L depends on R squared and temperature to the fourth power.

The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a blackbody is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 = T2.

Wait, so if they have the same temperature, then the luminosity difference depends only on their radii. So L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴). But since T1 = T2, this simplifies to (R1/R2)². R1 is 1.5 times R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the factor is about 2.25, which would be option A.

But wait, wait. Did I miss anything else? The problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has 0 km/s, Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does radial velocity affect luminosity? Hmm. Oh, wait, luminosity as observed is intrinsic luminosity, right? Radial velocity affects the observed flux because of Doppler shift, but the problem states that the stars' wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So maybe the Doppler shift is accounted for in their observed brightness. Wait, but I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, and moving away is redshifted. But the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the Doppler shift has been accounted for, and the temperatures are already corrected. Or does the temperature calculation take into account the Doppler shift?

Wait, the problem says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and they are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. But the actual temperature would differ because of the Doppler effect. Because the star moving away (Star_2, velocity 700 km/s) would have its light redshifted. So the observed λ_max would be longer than the actual λ_max. Conversely, Star_1 has zero velocity, so its observed λ_max is the same as its actual. But wait, the problem says their observed λ_max are same, so perhaps the actual temperatures are different?

Hmm, this complicates things. So I need to consider the Doppler effect on the observed wavelengths. Let me think again. Let's denote:

λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) )

Wait, no, the Doppler shift formula is a bit more involved. For a source moving with velocity v relative to the observer, the observed wavelength λ' is given by:

λ' = λ * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) )

Wait, no, wait, the relativistic Doppler shift formula is λ' = λ * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ) ), where β = v/c. But I think the formula depends on whether the source is moving towards or away. For a source moving away, v is positive, so λ' > λ. For a source moving towards, v is negative, so λ' < λ.

Wait, but in this problem, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. What's the direction? The problem says radial velocity is 700 km/s. Radial velocity can be positive (moving away) or negative (moving toward). Since it's given as 700, perhaps it's moving away. So for Star_2, v = +700 km/s. Star_1 has v=0.

But the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So let me denote:

For Star_1: λ1_obs = λ1_emit

For Star_2: λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v2/(c) ) / (1 - v2/(c) ) )

But the problem says λ1_obs = λ2_obs = same value.

So λ1_emit = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v2/(c) ) / (1 - v2/(c) ) )

But from Wien's law, λ_max is proportional to 1/T, so λ1_emit = b / T1, λ2_emit = b / T2.

So substituting:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c) )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Take reciprocal:

T1 = T2 / sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Which simplifies to:

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

Hmm, so T1 is T2 multiplied by that square root term.

So the temperatures of the two stars are different because of their Doppler shifts. So the initial assumption that they have the same temperature was incorrect because I didn't account for Doppler. So this changes things.

So the luminosity L is proportional to R² T⁴.

So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4

We have R1 = 1.5 R2. So (1.5)^2 is 2.25.

But what about T1/T2? From earlier, T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

So T1/T2 = sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

What's v2? It's 700 km/s. Let me compute v2/c.

c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300000 ≈ 0.002333... So about 0.002333.

So 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.002333, 1 - v2/c ≈ 0.997667.

So (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) ≈ (0.997667)/(1.002333) ≈ approx 0.99537.

Taking the square root of that gives approx sqrt(0.99537) ≈ 0.99768.

So T1/T2 ≈ 0.99768.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.99768)^4.

Calculating that: 0.99768^2 is about 0.99537, then squared again is about 0.99075.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.99075.

So putting it all together: L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99075 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99075.

Let me calculate that: 2.25 * 0.99 is 2.2275. But more accurately,

0.99075 * 2.25 = ?

Let me compute 2.25 * 0.99075.

Well, 2 * 0.99075 = 1.9815.

0.25 * 0.99075 = 0.2476875.

Adding them together: 1.9815 + 0.2476875 = 2.2291875.

So approximately 2.229.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which is very close. Option A is ~2.25, which is the factor without considering the Doppler shift.

So yes, the correct factor is about 2.23, which is option D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

The ratio of the luminosities is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5
\]

Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The problem also states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Using Wien's law, the observed wavelength is related to the temperature by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

For Star_1 (with radial velocity \(v_1 = 0\)), the observed wavelength is the same as the emitted wavelength:

\[
\lambda_{1,\text{obs}} = \lambda_{1,\text{emit}} = \frac{b}{T_1}
\]

For Star_2 (with radial velocity \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\)), the observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler effect. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

\[
\lambda_{2,\text{obs}} = \lambda_{2,\text{emit}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Since \(\lambda_{1,\text{obs}} = \lambda_{2,\text{obs}}\), we equate the two expressions:

\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Canceling \(b\) and rearranging:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}
\]

The speed of light \(c \approx 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\), so:

\[
\frac{v_2}{c} = \frac{700}{3 \times 10^5} \approx 0.002333
\]

Substituting:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - 0.002333}{1 + 0.002333}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.997667}{1.002333}} \approx \sqrt{0.99537} \approx 0.99768
\]

Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (0.99768)^4 \approx 0.99075
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
Substituting the values into the luminosity ratio:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = 2.25 \times 0.99075 \approx 2.229
\]

### Step 4: Match to Options
The closest option is:

**D) ~2.23**
