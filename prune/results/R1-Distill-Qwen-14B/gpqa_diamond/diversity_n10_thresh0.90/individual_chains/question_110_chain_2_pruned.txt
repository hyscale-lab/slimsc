Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs. But each has different capabilities in terms of the brightness of the stars they can observe. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars up to V magnitude 17, while HIRES can go down to 16 in V mag. So a star must be bright enough (apparent magnitude less than or equal to 16 for HIRES and 17 for ESPRESSO) to be detected by both.

Wait, but the question is which stars can be detected with both. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be <=16 for HIRES and <=17 for ESPRESSO. So any star with apparent V mag <=16 would be detectable by both, because it's within the lower limit of both. If a star is between 16 and 17 mag, it can be detected by ESPRESSO but not HIRES. But for both, it needs to be <=16, right?

Wait, no. Wait, the question says, which stars can be detected with both. So the star must be observable by both. So the apparent magnitude must be <=16 and also <=17. So the stricter condition is that the apparent V mag must be <=16. Because if it's 17, ESPRESSO can see it, but HIRES can't. So only stars with V mag <=16 can be seen by both.

Wait, no. Wait, think again. HIRES can see up to 16 mag. So any star with V mag <=16 can be seen by HIRES. ESPRESSO can see up to 17, so same stars plus those with 16.1 to 17. So for a star to be detected by both, it must be <=16 mag in V. So the star's apparent magnitude needs to be <=16. Because if it's brighter than 16 (lower number), both can see it. If it's 16.5, HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can.

Wait, but the question is which stars can be detected by both. So the
