Okay, so I've got this question here about the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that molecules can be modeled using both rotation and vibration models, but this is the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, no, the question says it's the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also known as the non-rigid rotor model. Right, because the rigid rotor assumes the bond length is fixed, but the non-rigid one allows for some stretching, so it includes both rotational and vibrational energy levels.

The molecule is diatomic, made of elements X and Y. The masses are given: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The question is about a photon being absorbed, causing the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state. So, I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. Fundamental state usually means the lowest energy state, but I think in the context of vibrational and rotational energy states, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0) for a diatomic. But wait, the question says it's in the fundamental state, which may imply the ground state of the system. So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So what's the next state?

In quantum mechanics, transitions can involve changes in both vibrational and rotational states. But in the context of photon absorption, the energy absorbed would typically cause a change in either the vibrational or rotational state. Since the question is about the 'next' state with the lowest possible energy, I think it's referring to the lowest possible energy increment. So perhaps the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0) and the ground rotational state (J=0). When it absorbs a photon, it can either go to the next vibrational state (v=1) or the next rotational state (J=1). Which transition requires less energy?

The energy levels for rotation and vibration are different. The vibrational energy levels are quantized and have a spacing of ħw, where w is the angular frequency. The rotational energy levels have spacing of (ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, let me think. The energy levels for rotation are given by E_J = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2I), so the spacing between adjacent J levels increases with J. For a rigid rotor, the energy of the J level is proportional to J(J+1), so the transition from J=0 to J=1 would require an energy of 2B, where B is the rotational constant. The rotational constant B is ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

The vibrational energy levels are given by E_v = (v + 1/2) ħw. So the transition from v=0 to v=1 would require an energy of ħw.

So which is smaller, ħw or 2B? Because the photon's energy must match the energy difference. But wait, the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think is E=0 (v=0, J=0). The next state would be the first excited state with the lowest energy. So which transition requires less energy: vibrational or rotational?

I need to calculate both energy differences and compare them.

First, let's compute the moment of inertia I. I for a diatomic is I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass of the two atoms.

Masses: Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. So the reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but I need to convert this into kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ let's calculate that.

1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ approx 3.017e-27 kg.

Wait, wait, let me compute that precisely. 1.818 * 1.6605 is approximately 3.0179. So μ ≈ 3.0179e-27 kg.

R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ R² = 3.0179e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

Compute that: (2e-1
