Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but let's see.

The problem says we have a large number of identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (the x-axis). The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Wait, so the wave function is a complex number because of the i term.

But the important thing here is that when we measure the position of the particles, none were found outside the region x between 1 and 3. So the wave function must be zero outside this interval. Hmm, wait, actually no, because the wave function's modulus squared gives the probability density. So, if the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, that means the wave function must be zero outside that region. But wait, the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That doesn't look like it's zero except maybe at specific points. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait a second, perhaps the wave function is only defined in the region where the particles exist, meaning that it's zero outside x=1 to x=3. But the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, no, the wave function given is for the part of space where the particles can exist. So, perhaps in the region x between 1 and 3, the wave function is as given, and it's zero elsewhere. But wait, the wave function as given isn't zero; it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That's only zero if (a/sqrt(1+x)) = 0.5i, but a is a real number (I think), so that would require sqrt(1+x) to be imaginary, which isn't the case in real x. So maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is given as the part where it's non-zero, and the modulus squared should integrate to 1 to normalize it. Because the wave function must be normalized. So the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1. Because the system is confined between 1 and 3, the wave function is zero outside, but the part given is the non-zero portion.

Wait, the given wave function is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5i. Wait, that can't be right because ψ(x) should be a function that's non-zero only in a certain interval. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is given as a function that's non-zero between x=1 and x=3 and zero outside. But the expression provided is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, maybe that's not the case. Maybe the given wave function is correct, and it's non-zero only between 1 and 3. Hmm, but how does that square with the form given?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about normalization. The wave function must satisfy the normalization condition: the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from -∞ to ∞ must equal 1. But since the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3, the integral reduces to the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx equals 1.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = a / sqrt(1 + x) - 0.5i. Wait, but that would make ψ(x) a complex number. The modulus squared would then be (a/(sqrt(1+x)))^2 + (0.5)^2. So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but if ψ(x) is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, then the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2, because when you have a complex number z = a + ib, |z|^2 = a² + b².

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me write that out:

Integral (from 1 to 3) of [ (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2 ] dx = 1.

Wait, but wait. Because that would be adding two terms. Let me compute each term separately.

First term: a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3.

Second term: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3.

Compute first integral: the integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to 3, that's ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So putting it all together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Thus, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's ln(2) approximately? It's about 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202.

Then a is the square root of that. So sqrt(0.7202) is approximately 0.8485, which is about 0.85.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

But wait, let me double-check my math. Because I might have made a mistake in the integration.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5i.

Wait, that's a complex function. So when we compute the modulus squared, it's |ψ(x)|² = (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2. Because for a complex number z = a + ib, |z|² = a² + b².

Wait, but in this case, a is a real number (I think), so the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when you square their magnitudes, it's (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So the integral is from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Yes, that seems correct.

So integrating a²/(1+x) from 1 to 3 is a² * [ln(1+x)] from 1 to 3. So ln(4) - ln(2) is ln(2), so a² * ln(2) is the first part.

The second part is 0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.5.

So a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² * ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Calculating that:

ln(2) ≈ 0.693147.

0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.7202.

sqrt(0.7202) is approximately 0.8485, which is about 0.85. So the value of a is approximately 0.85, which is option B.

Wait, but another thought: did I consider the possibility that the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3? Because the way the problem is phrased, "the wave function of each particle, in a part of space where it can exist, can be described as..." So perhaps ψ(x) is only non-zero in that region. So our calculation is correct because we're only considering x from 1 to 3.

So the correct answer should be option B, 0.85.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by normalizing the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The normalization condition requires that the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over all space equals 1. Since the wave function is zero outside \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \), the integral reduces to:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

The modulus squared of \( \psi(x) \) is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Thus, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) \, dx = 1
\]

We split the integral into two parts:

1. **First term**: \( a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx \)

   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

   \[
   a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second term**: \( 0.25 \int_1^3 dx \)

   This evaluates to:

   \[
   0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
   \]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7202
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7202} \approx 0.8485 \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
