Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about the luminosities of two stars. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through it.

Alright, the problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Wait, but how does mass relate to luminosity? Hmm, I remember that for stars, luminosity depends on both radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. But wait, what's the relation between mass and temperature here? Or maybe I'm mixing up things. Because actually, for main-sequence stars, there's a mass-luminosity relation where L is proportional to M^3 or something like that. But I'm not sure if that applies here, because the problem says they radiate as black bodies. Oh, right, the question says to assume they're black bodies. So I think I should stick with the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

Wait, but the problem also mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. The peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature, according to Wien's law: λ_max * T = constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same? Wait, let me think. Wien's law says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then T must be the same. Because if λ1_max = λ2_max, then T1 = T2. Oh, that's interesting. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait no, wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So yes, same λ_max implies same temperature. So T1 = T2. That's a key point.

So, both stars have the same temperature. Then, the luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L1 / L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4). Since T1 = T2, this simplifies to (R1²)/(R2²) = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the factor is 2.25, which is option A: ~2.25. But wait, the options don't have exactly 2.25. Let me look: A is ~2.25, D is ~2.23. Hmm, but why are there other options?

Wait, perhaps I missed something. The problem also mentions the radial velocities. Star_1 has velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Oh, wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So if a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength shifts. So, the peak wavelength is shifted. But the problem says the peak wavelengths as observed are the same. Wait, no, the question says they are the same. So that would mean that the Doppler shift doesn't change the conclusion about their temperatures. Because if Star_2 is moving with a radial velocity, its observed wavelength would be shifted relative to its rest wavelength.

Wait a second. Let me think. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. So the observed wavelength λ_observed would be λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) or something like that. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula. Let me recall the relativistic Doppler shift formula. It should be λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ), when moving away. But wait, in this case, if Star_2 is moving towards us, the observed wavelength would be blue-shifted, and if moving away, red-shifted. But in the problem, the radial velocities are given as 0 (Star_1) and 700 km/s (Star_2). Wait, Star_1's velocity is 0, so its observed wavelength is its rest wavelength. Star_2's observed wavelength is shifted by 700 km/s. But the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, the observed λ_max for both is the same.

Wait, so that means the rest wavelengths are different, but due to Doppler shift, they appear the same. Oh, that complicates things because then their actual temperatures would be different. Because the observed λ_max is the same, but their rest λ_max (which is proportional to 1/T) would be different if their velocities are different.

Wait, this is more complicated than I thought. Let me try to structure this.

Let me denote:

For Star_1: observed λ_max1 = λ_max_rest1 * Doppler factor.

For Star_2: observed λ_max2 = λ_max_rest2 * Doppler factor.

But in the problem, λ_max1 (observed) = λ_max2 (observed). So:

λ_max_rest1 * Doppler1 = λ_max_rest2 * Doppler2.

But Doppler factors depend on their velocities.

Wait, but what's the velocity direction? The problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. So perhaps Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, while Star_1 is at rest. Or maybe Star_2 is moving towards us. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the direction, only the magnitude. Hmm. But for the Doppler shift, the sign matters. If a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), so λ_observed > λ_rest. If moving towards, λ_observed < λ_rest.

But the problem states that the observed λ_max is same for both. So, if Star_2 is moving, its λ_rest would have to be such that after applying the Doppler shift, it equals Star_1's λ_rest.

Wait, perhaps I should model this.

Let me denote:

λ_max_observed = λ_max_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But only if the star is moving away (v positive). If moving towards, v is negative, so (1 + v/c) becomes less than 1, and (1 - v/c) becomes bigger.

Wait, actually, the formula for Doppler shift depends on the relative velocity. For a source moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). For a source moving towards, it's shorter (blueshifted).

The exact formula is:

λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r / c) / (1 - v_r / c) )

where v_r is the radial velocity. So, if the star is moving away, v_r is positive, and λ_observed > λ_rest. If moving towards, v_r is negative, and λ_observed < λ_rest.

In this problem, Star_1 has v_r = 0, so λ_observed1 = λ_rest1. Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s. But we don't know the direction. So, we have to consider both possibilities.

But the problem says that the observed λ_max is same for both. So, λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * Doppler_factor.

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * Doppler_factor.

But what's the Doppler factor.

Wait, let's compute the Doppler shift for Star_2.

v = 700 km/s. Let's compute this as a fraction of c. c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So, 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.02333. So, v/c ≈ 0.02333.

So, the Doppler factor depends on velocity. So for Star_2, moving with v=700 km/s, let's suppose it's moving away. Then,

Doppler_factor = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Let me compute that.

(1 + 0.02333)/(1 - 0.02333) = (1.02333)/(0.97667) ≈ 1.0479.

So sqrt(1.0479) ≈ 1.0236.

So, Doppler_factor ≈ 1.0236.

If Star_2 is moving towards us, v is negative, so:

(1 + (-0.02333)) / (1 - (-0.02333)) = (0.97667)/(1.02333) ≈ 0.9534.

sqrt(0.9534) ≈ 0.9765.

So, if Star_2 is moving towards us, the Doppler factor is approximately 0.9765.

Now, back to the equation:

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * Doppler_factor.

But, from Wien's law, λ_rest is proportional to 1/T. So, λ_rest1 = b / T1, λ_rest2 = b / T2.

So, if λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * Doppler_factor,

then,

( b / T1 ) = ( b / T2 ) * Doppler_factor.

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * Doppler_factor.

So,

T1 = T2 / Doppler_factor.

So, if Star_2 is moving away, Doppler_factor is ~1.0236, so T1 = T2 / 1.0236 ≈ 0.9765 T2.

If Star_2 is moving towards us, Doppler_factor is ~0.9765, so T1 = T2 / 0.9765 ≈ 1.024 T2.

But earlier, I thought T1 = T2 because their observed λ_max are same. But that was neglecting the Doppler effect, which seems crucial here.

So now, I need to find the actual T1 and T2, considering the Doppler shift.

Wait, but the problem states that the observed λ_max is same for both. So, that leads us to the relation between their rest wavelengths and velocities.

Wait, perhaps I should express the ratio of their luminosities, considering their real (unshifted) temperatures and radii.

So, L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4,

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4.

Thus,

L1 / L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1² / T2²).

Because (T1^4)/(T2^4) = (T1^2 / T2^2)^2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, (T1^4)/(T2^4) = (T1/T2)^4. So,

L1/L2 = (R1²/R2²) * (T1^4/T2^4).

But from earlier, R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5,

so (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

And from the Doppler shift, we have T1 = T2 / Doppler_factor, depending on whether Star_2 is moving away or towards.

So, let's compute T1 in terms of T2.

Case 1: Star_2 is moving away (v_r positive).

Then,

Doppler_factor = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ≈ 1.0236.

So, T1 = T2 / 1.0236 ≈ 0.9765 T2.

So,

(T1 / T2 ) = 0.9765.

Thus,

(T1^4)/(T2^4) = (0.9765)^4 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

0.9765^2 = approximately 0.9534.

Then, 0.9534^2 = approx (0.95)^2 is 0.9025, but more accurately:

0.9534 * 0.9534:

Let me compute 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025.

0.0034 * 0.95 = 0.00323.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 0.9534^2:

(9534e-4)^2 ≈ (9534)^2 * 1e-8.

But maybe better to approximate:

0.9534 * 0.9534 ≈ (0.95 + 0.0034)^2 = 0.95² + 2*(0.95)(0.0034) + (0.0034)^2.

0.95^2 = 0.9025.

2*(0.95)(0.0034) = 2*0.00323 = 0.00646.

(0.0034)^2 = 0.00001156.

Adding up: 0.9025 + 0.00646 = 0.90896 + 0.00001156 ≈ 0.90897.

So, 0.9534^2 ≈ 0.90897.

So, (0.9765)^4 = (0.9765^2)^2 ≈ (0.9534)^2 ≈ 0.90897.

So, approximately 0.909.

So, L1/L2 in this case would be 2.25 * 0.909 ≈ ?

2.25 * 0.909 = 2.04075. So approximately 2.04.

Case 2: Star_2 is moving towards us (v_r negative).

In this case, Doppler_factor = sqrt( (1 - |v/c| )/(1 + |v/c| )) ≈ 0.9765.

So, T1 = T2 / 0.9765 ≈ 1.024 T2.

So, T1 / T2 = 1.024.

(T1^4)/(T2^4) = (1.024)^4.

Compute that: 1.024 squared is about 1.048576. Then squared again: 1.048576² ≈ approx 1.1 (since 1.05² is 1.1025). Wait, let me compute 1.048576 * 1.048576.

1.048576 * 1.048576:

Well, 1.048576 is approximately 1.0486.

1.0486 * 1.0486:

= (1 + 0.0486)^2 = 1 + 2*0.0486 + (0.0486)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.0972 + 0.00236 ≈ 1.100 (approximately).

So, (1.024)^4 ≈ 1.100.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.100 = 2.475.

Wait, but what's the correct scenario? The problem says that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. So which one is moving towards us and which away? The problem doesn't specify direction, but the velocities are given as 0 and 700. So perhaps we're to assume that Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, but the direction isn't specified. But since the observed λ_max is same, I think we have to consider both possibilities.

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away, then its observed λ_max is longer than its rest λ_max, but Star_1's observed λ_max is same as its rest, so for the observed λ's to be same, Star_2's rest λ must be shorter than Star_1's. Because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ is longer than its rest λ. For the observed λ's to be same, Star_1's rest λ must be longer than Star_2's rest λ.

But from Wien's law, λ_rest = b / T. So, if λ1_rest is longer than λ2_rest, then T1 < T2.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the Doppler shift would affect the observed λ, not the rest λ. So, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me try this again. Let me denote:

λ_obs = observed wavelength.

λ_rest = wavelength at rest frame of the star.

For Star_1, λ_obs1 = λ_rest1. Because its radial velocity is 0.

For Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * Doppler_factor.

But the problem says λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * Doppler_factor.

Which implies that λ_rest1 > λ_rest2 if Doppler_factor >1 (if Star_2 is moving away), because Doppler_factor would be >1, so λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (something >1) → λ_rest1 > λ_rest2.

If Star_2 is moving towards us, Doppler_factor <1, so λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (something <1) → λ_rest1 < λ_rest2.

But since λ_rest is inversely proportional to T, λ_rest1 = b / T1.

So, if λ_rest1 > λ_rest2, then T1 < T2.

If λ_rest1 < λ_rest2, then T1 > T2.

So, in the scenario where Star_2 is moving away, T1 < T2, and L1 = (R1²/R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4) → 2.25 * (0.9765)^4 ≈ 2.25 * 0.909 ≈ 2.04.

In the scenario where Star_2 is moving towards us, T1 > T2, so L1 would be 2.25 * (1.024)^4 ≈ 2.25 * 1.100 ≈ 2.475.

But the problem says that the observed λ's are the same, so we need to determine which scenario applies.

Wait, but the problem doesn't state the direction of Star_2's velocity. So perhaps we need to take the absolute value of the Doppler factor?

Wait, no. Because the Doppler factor depends on the direction of motion. For Star_2, whether it's moving towards or away determines whether its observed wavelength is shorter or longer.

But since the observed λ's are same, perhaps the problem is assuming that their rest λ's are same? But that contradicts the Doppler shift.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says that the stars are observed to have the same wavelength at which they appear brightest. So, their observed λ_max are same. But their rest λ_max might be different due to their velocities.

So, let's model this.

For Star_1: λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

For Star_2: λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * Doppler_factor.

Given that λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, so λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * Doppler_factor.

And since λ_rest is proportional to 1/T, then T1 = T2 / Doppler_factor.

So, T1 is less than T2 if Doppler_factor is greater than 1 (Star_2 moving away), and greater than T2 if Doppler_factor is less than 1 (Star_2 moving towards).

But without knowing the direction, perhaps we can't proceed. But the problem gives radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s, but doesn't specify direction. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the radial velocity refers to the component along the line of sight. If it's 700 km/s, perhaps it's moving away. Or maybe it's moving towards. The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I need another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the Doppler shift doesn't affect the calculation since the observed λ_max is same. But earlier analysis shows that the Doppler shift does affect the relation between T1 and T2.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed by considering that the observed λ_max is same for both, so λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 = λ.

But from the Doppler effect, λ_obs depends on the rest frame λ and velocity.

So,

λ = λ1_rest * sqrt( (1 + v1/c)/(1 - v1/c) )

Similarly,

λ = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But v1 is 0, so:

λ = λ1_rest.

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But λ1_rest is the rest wavelength of Star_1, which is (using Wien's law) b / T1.

Similarly, λ2_rest = b / T2.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Simplify:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

So,

T1 = T2 / sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Which is,

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

Now, v2 is 700 km/s. Let's compute v2/c.

v2 = 700e3 m/s / (3e8 m/s) ) → Wait, no, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So, v2/c = 700,000 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.02333.

So,

(1 - v2/c) = 1 - 0.02333 ≈ 0.97667.

(1 + v2/c) = 1 + 0.02333 ≈ 1.02333.

So,

(1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) = 0.97667 / 1.02333 ≈ 0.9534.

So,

sqrt(0.9534) ≈ 0.9765.

Thus,

T1 = T2 * 0.9765.

So, T1 is 0.9765 times T2.

So, T1 = 0.9765 T2.

Now, back to the luminosity ratio.

L1 = 4π R1^2 σ T1^4,

L2 = 4π R2^2 σ T2^4.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

R1/R2 = 1.5 → R1^2/R2^2 = 2.25.

T1/T2 = 0.9765 → (T1/T2)^4 = (0.9765)^4 ≈ 0.909.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.909 ≈ 2.04.

Wait, but the options don't have 2.04. The options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

Hmm, so none of these options match 2.04. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the Doppler formula.

Wait, let me re-calculate the Doppler shift factor.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r / c) / (1 - v_r / c) )

But v_r is the radial velocity. If the star is moving away, v_r is positive, and λ_obs > λ_rest.

In this problem, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, but the problem doesn't specify direction. Let's assume it's moving away, so v_r is positive.

So,

λ_obs = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + 0.02333)/(1 - 0.02333) )

Which is approximately sqrt(1.02333 / 0.97667) ≈ sqrt(1.0479) ≈ 1.0236.

So,

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * 1.0236.

But λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

And λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * 1.0236.

But λ_rest = b / T, so,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * 1.0236 → T1 = T2 / 1.0236 ≈ 0.9765 T2.

Which is what I did earlier.

So, then,

L1/L2 = (1.5^2) * (0.9765^4) ≈ 2.25 * (0.909) ≈ 2.04.

But that doesn't match any given options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the ratio L1 / L2, but I computed 2.04, which is not among the options. So maybe I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, another way to approach this is to compute the luminosity ratio considering the observed temperatures.

Wait, but observed luminosity depends on the star's actual temperature and radius, but when observed through a Doppler shift, does that affect anything else? Or perhaps the observed flux is affected by the Doppler shift.

Wait, the problem says they are computing the luminosity assuming they are black bodies. So, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, but the actual luminosity is independent of the Doppler shift.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The luminosity L is intrinsic to the star, given by L = 4πR²σT⁴.

When you observe the star with a Doppler shift, the observed flux F is affected. But the star's intrinsic luminosity (L) is the same regardless of motion.

Wait, the observed flux F is given by F = L / (4π d²), where d is distance.

But if the star is moving, the observed flux can change due to relativistic effects, like beaming. But I'm not sure if that's considered here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the Doppler shift when computing the luminosity, but the question states that the stars are radiating as black bodies, so maybe the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength but not the intrinsic luminosity.

But wait, the problem says that the observed wavelengths are same, so that's taken into account when determining the temperatures, which then affects the luminosity ratio.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, let's re-calculate (0.9765)^4.

0.9765^2 is approximately (0.9765 * 0.9765).

Let me compute:

0.9765 * 0.9765:

First, compute 0.9765 * 0.9765.

Let me compute 9765 * 9765 and then adjust for the decimal.

But that's time-consuming. Alternatively, let's compute it as (1 - 0.0235)^2.

(1 - 0.0235)^2 = 1 - 2*0.0235 + (0.0235)^2 ≈ 0.9527 + 0.000552 = 0.953252.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b².

So,

(0.9765)^2 = (1 - 0.0235)^2 = 1 - 2*(0.0235) + (0.0235)^2.

Compute each term:

1 is 1.

2*0.0235 = 0.047.

0.0235^2 = 0.00055225.

So,

1 - 0.047 + 0.00055225 = 0.95355225.

So, 0.9765^2 ≈ 0.95355.

Then, (0.9765)^4 is (0.95355)^2.

Compute 0.95355^2.

Again, using (a - b)^2 approach, a=0.95, b=0.00355.

Wait, 0.95355 = 0.95 + 0.00355.

So,

(0.95 + 0.00355)^2 = 0.95^2 + 2*0.95*0.00355 + (0.00355)^2.

Compute each:

0.95^2 = 0.9025.

2*0.95 * 0.00355 = 2 * 0.0033725 = 0.006745.

(0.00355)^2 ≈ 0.0000126.

Adding up: 0.9025 + 0.006745 = 0.909245 + 0.0000126 ≈ 0.9092576.

So, (0.9765)^4 ≈ 0.9092576.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9092576 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9092576.

Let me compute that:

2.25 * 0.9 → 2.025.

2.25 * 0.0092576 ≈ 2.25 * 0.009 ≈ 0.02025.

So total ≈ 2.025 + 0.02025 ≈ 2.04525.

So, approximately 2.045.

But the options don't include anything near 2.04. The closest option is D) ~2.23, which is higher than 2.04, but others are higher too.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift handling. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should not consider the Doppler shift when computing the luminosity ratio. But the problem says that the observed λ_max is same for both. Without considering Doppler, earlier I thought L1/L2 is 2.25, which is option A. But the problem gives radial velocities, so I must consider them.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler effect affects the observed flux, but the stars' intrinsic luminosity is calculated without considering velocity. Let me think.

If the observed λ_max is same, but Doppler shifts cause the rest λ_max to be different, which affects their temperatures, which in turn affects their luminosities. So, the Doppler effect must be considered.

Wait, but why isn't the luminosity ratio 2.25 as before? Because earlier I thought that if T1 = T2, the ratio is 2.25, but that was without considering Doppler.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the luminosity ratio considering that the observed λ_max are same, but the Doppler effect implies different rest temperatures. So, the ratio is approximately 2.04, which isn't among the options. Hence, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider relativistic Doppler shifts. Maybe using the full formula instead of the approximation.

The exact Doppler shift formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) )

But v_r is 700 km/s. Let me compute it exactly.

v_r = 700 km/s.

c = 299,792 km/s ≈ 3e5 km/s for approximation.

So, v_r / c = 700 / 3e5 = 7/(3e2) ≈ 0.002333.

Wait, wait, 3e5 km/s is 300,000 km/s.

So, 700 / 300,000 = 7/(3e5) = 7/300,000 = 0.002333... So, v_r/c ≈ 0.002333.

So, (1 + v_r/c) = 1.002333.

(1 - v_r/c) = 0.997667.

So,

(1.002333)/(0.997667) ≈ let's compute that.

Dividing 1.002333 by 0.997667.

Approximate: 1.002333 / 0.997667 ≈ 1.0047.

So, sqrt(1.0047) ≈ 1.00235.

So, the Doppler factor is approximately 1.00235.

So, the ratio (T1 / T2) = 1 / 1.00235 ≈ 0.99766.

So, T1 = T2 * 0.99766.

Thus,

(T1 / T2) = 0.99766.

So,

(T1^4)/(T2^4) = (0.99766)^4.

Compute that: 0.99766^2 is approximately (1 - 0.00234)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00234 + (0.00234)^2 ≈ 0.99532 + 0.0000055 ≈ 0.995325.

Then, (0.99766)^4 = (0.995325)^2 ≈ ?

Compute 0.995325^2:

= (1 - 0.004675)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.004675 + (0.004675)^2 ≈ 0.99065 - 0.0000218 ≈ ~0.99063.

So,

(T1^4)/(T2^4) ≈ 0.99063.

So,

L1/L2 = (1.5^2) * 0.99063 = 2.25 * 0.99063 ≈ 2.226.

Which is approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

Wait, but earlier with v_r/c=0.02333 (which is incorrect, correct is v_r/c=0.002333), I had a larger Doppler effect, but with the correct v_r/c, the effect is much smaller.

So, the correct ratio is approximately 2.23, which is option D.


To determine the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = 1.5^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The problem also states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Using Wien's law, the observed wavelength is related to the temperature and velocity of the star via the relativistic Doppler shift formula:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_r/c}{1 - v_r/c}}
\]

For Star_1, the radial velocity is \(v_r = 0\), so \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}}\). For Star_2, the radial velocity is \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\). The observed wavelengths are equal, so:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_r/c}{1 - v_r/c}}
\]

From Wien's law, \(\lambda_{\text{rest}} \propto 1/T\), so:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - v_r/c}{1 + v_r/c}}
\]

The speed of light is \(c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s}\), so:

\[
\frac{v_r}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]

Substituting into the temperature ratio:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - 0.002333}{1 + 0.002333}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.997667}{1.002333}} \approx \sqrt{0.99533} \approx 0.99766
\]

Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (0.99766)^4 \approx 0.99063
\]

### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
Substituting the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = 2.25 \times 0.99063 \approx 2.226
\]

### Step 4: Final Answer
The closest option to the calculated ratio is:

**D) ~2.23**
