Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let me think. The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The problem is about finding the correct equation relating their effective temperatures, T1 and T2, assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

Wait, LTE means that the gas in the photosphere behaves like a blackbody at a certain temperature, right? So the excitation of atoms depends on the thermal energy of the gas. I remember something called the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the population of different energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels is given by:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where g2 and g1 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energies, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's call the two energy levels E1 and E2, with E2 being higher than E1. So ΔE = E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J.

Star_1 has twice as many atoms in the excited state as star_2. So for star_1, n2/n1 = 2, and for star_2, n2/n1 = 1 (since it's half). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. Oh, so n2 (excited) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps for star_1, the number of atoms in the excited state is twice that of star_2. So if I let n1 be the number in the lower state, and n2 the excited, then for star_1, n2_1 / n1_1 = 2. For star_2, n2_2 / n1_2 = 1, perhaps? Or maybe I'm getting the ratio wrong. Wait, the question says that in star_1, the excited level is twice as excited as in star_2. So for each star, the ratio of excited to non-excited is given.

Let me clarify: For star_1, the ratio (n2_1)/(n1_1) is 2. For star_2, it's (n2_2)/(n1_2) = 1. Because twice as excited means higher population in the excited state.

Assuming that the statistical weights are the same for both stars (same element, same transition), so g2/g1 cancels out or is the same. So the equation for each star would be:

For star 1: 2 = exp( - (ΔE)/(k T1) )

Wait, wait. Because in the Boltzmann equation, it's (E2 - E1)/(k T). So if E2 > E1, the
