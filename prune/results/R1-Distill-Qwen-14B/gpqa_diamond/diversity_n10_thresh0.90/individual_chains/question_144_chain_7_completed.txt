--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters.

I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! The width Γ is the total decay width, which is inversely proportional to the particle's lifetime τ. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I need to get the units right here.

Wait, ħ (h-bar) is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. So, since Γ is given in MeV, I should convert that to GeV to match units. Γ_X is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So, τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging in the numbers: 6.582e-25 GeV·s divided by 0.32 GeV. Let me compute that. 6.582e-25 / 0.32 equals approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Hmm, that's the lifetime.

But the question is about the mean decay distance, not the lifetime. Oh right, the decay distance L is the product of the lifetime τ and the velocity v of the particle. So L = v * τ.

Wait, what's the velocity v of the meson? For high-energy particles, we can use relativistic mechanics. The energy E is given as 8 GeV, and the rest mass m is 1.2 GeV. So the total energy E is related to the rest mass by E = γ m c². Wait, but since the units are in GeV and mass is in GeV/c², perhaps I should express it properly.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the velocity using the relation between energy and momentum. The relativistic energy is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So I can solve for p (momentum) as p = sqrt( (E² - (m c²)²) ) / c.

Let me compute that. E is 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV. So E² is 64 (GeV)², m² c^4 is (1.2)^2 = 1.44 (GeV)². Subtracting, 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. So sqrt(62.56) is around 7.91 GeV. So p = 7.91 GeV/c.

Wait, but wait, the units might complicate things. Let me think in terms of beta (β) and gamma (γ) factors. The velocity beta is v/c. Gamma is E/(m c²) = 8/(1.2) = 6.666... So γ is about 6.667. 

Beta and gamma are related by γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). So let's solve for β. Rearranging, 1 - β² = 1/γ². γ is 6.667, so γ² is approximately 44.44. So 1 - β² = 1/44.44 ≈ 0.0225. So β squared is 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Taking the square root, β ≈ sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887c.

But perhaps a more accurate way is to calculate β from E and m. Another approach is that in natural units (where c=1), E² = p² + m². But to get velocity, perhaps another approach is better.

Wait, alternatively, gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667, so gamma is 20/3. Then, beta can be found using gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). So, beta² = 1 - (1/(gamma^2)). So beta squared is 1 - (9/400) because gamma is 20/3, so gamma squared is (400/9). So 1/(gamma^2) is 9/400 = 0.0225. So beta squared is 0.9775, so beta is about 0.9887, as I had before. So v is approximately 0.9887c.

But since the meson is moving at a high speed, the mean decay length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau. Wait, because the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime (tau_0 = tau). Hmm, wait, no. The mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime (tau_0). Because the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. So tau = gamma * tau_0.

Wait, but tau_0 is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame, which is tau_0 = ħ / (m_width). Because the width is the same in all frames. So perhaps I need to compute tau_0 first, then multiply by gamma to get the lab frame lifetime tau.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify:

The width Γ (total decay width) is related to the mean lifetime tau_0 (proper lifetime, in the particle's rest frame) by Γ = ħ / tau_0. So tau_0 = ħ / Γ.

But in the lab frame, the lifetime is dilated. So tau = gamma * tau_0.

So the mean decay length L is v * tau. Which is v * gamma * tau_0.

But wait, v is already in terms of beta c, which incorporates gamma. Let me write this out.

L = v * tau = (beta c) * gamma tau_0.

But tau_0 is ħ / Γ.

So putting it all together:

L = beta * gamma * c * (ħ / Γ).

Wait, but beta * gamma can be simplified. Let me think about beta gamma. Beta is v/c, gamma is 1/sqrt(1-beta²). So beta gamma = (v/c) * (1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))) ). Alternatively, another expression for beta gamma is (E)/(m c²) * (v/c). Hmm, maybe it's better to compute it numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute gamma and beta, multiply them, then find L.

We already have gamma as 6.6667, beta as approximately 0.9887.

So beta * gamma = 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.6.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 0.9887 * 6.666667.

0.9887 * 6 = 5.9322, 0.9887 * 0.666667 ≈ 0.659. So total is about 5.9322 + 0.659 = 6.5912.

So beta gamma ≈ 6.59.

So L = beta gamma c tau_0.

But tau_0 = ħ / Γ. Let me plug in the numbers.

First, ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So tau_0 = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = approx 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Then, L = beta gamma c tau_0.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So L = 6.59 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute that:

Multiply 6.59 * 3e8 = 1.977e9.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24: 1.977e9 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

1.977 * 2.056875 ≈ approx 4.0655.

Then 1e9 * 1e-24 = 1e-15.

So L ≈ 4.0655e-15 meters.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations:

6.59 * 3e8 = 6.59 * 3 = 19.77, times 1e8 is 1.977e9.

1.977e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.977 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

Compute 1.977 * 2.056875:

Let me do this:

1.977 * 2 = 3.954

1.977 * 0.056875 = approx 0.112 (since 0.056875 is about 0.056875, so 1.977 * 0.056875 ≈ 0.1120 approximately).

Adding together, 3.954 + 0.112 ≈ 4.066.

So L ≈ 4.066e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Wait, but wait another thing: Did I correctly compute beta gamma? Let me recalculate beta and gamma.

Gamma is E/(m c²) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... So gamma is 20/3 ≈ 6.6667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So 1/gamma squared is 1/(400/9) = 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So beta * gamma = 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.591.

Hmm, so that's correct.

Wait, let me compute beta gamma more accurately. 6.6667 * 0.9887.

6.6667 * 0.9887.

6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322

0.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.6591.

So total is 5.9322 + 0.6591 = 6.5913.

So beta gamma is about 6.5913.

So back to computing L:

L = beta gamma * c * tau_0.

c is 3e8 m/s.

Tau_0 is 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approx 2.056875e-24 s.

So beta gamma * c * tau_0 = 6.5913 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, 6.5913 * 3e8 = 1.97739e9.

Multiply that by 2.056875e-24:

1.97739e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.97739 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

Compute 1.97739 * 2.056875.

Let me do it more precisely.

1.97739 * 2.056875.

Let me break it down:

2.056875 = 2 + 0.05 + 0.006875.

1.97739 * 2 = 3.95478.

1.97739 * 0.05 = 0.0988695.

1.97739 * 0.006875 = approx 0.0135624 (since 0.006875 is 11/1600 approx? Let me compute 1.97739 * 6.875e-3:

1.97739 * 0.006875 = 0.0135624 approximately.

Now sum all three parts:

3.95478 + 0.0988695 = 4.0536495.

Plus 0.0135624 → 4.0536495 + 0.0135624 = 4.0672119.

So 4.0672e-15 meters. Hmm, but the options are B: 4.0655e-15 and C: 5.0223e-15.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact values without approximations.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect.

Wait, another approach: The decay length is given by L = (gamma * beta * c) * tau.

Wait, no, that's not correct. I think the correct formula is L = v * gamma * tau_0.

Because tau_0 is the proper lifetime. So, in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau_0.

So, decay distance is velocity times the lifetime in the lab frame.

v is beta c.

So, L = beta c * gamma tau_0.

Which is the same as (beta gamma) * c tau_0.

Which is what I did earlier.

So, perhaps the precise calculation with exact numbers.

Let me recompute:

tau_0 = ħ / Γ.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV s.

Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So tau_0 = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.

6.582 / 0.32 → let me compute: 0.32 * 20 = 6.4, so 6.582 - 6.4 is 0.182. So 20 + 0.182 / 0.32.

0.182 / 0.32 = approximately 0.56875.

So tau_0 ≈ 20.56875e-25 s? Wait, no. Wait, 6.582 / 0.32 is equal to (6.582 ÷ 0.32).

Let me compute 6.582 ÷ 0.32.

0.32 * 20 = 6.4, as before.

6.582 - 6.4 = 0.182.

0.182 ÷ 0.32 = 0.56875.

So total is 20.56875.

So tau_0 = 20.56875e-25 s? Wait, no. Wait no, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.

6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875.

So tau_0 = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Then, beta gamma is 6.5913.

So L = 6.5913 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, let's compute 6.5913 multiplied by 3e8.

6.5913 * 3e8 = 1.97739e9 m/s.

Now, multiply this by tau_0 (2.056875e-24 s):

1.97739e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = (1.97739 * 2.056875) * 1e-15 m.

Compute 1.97739 * 2.056875.

Let me compute this exactly.

1.97739 * 2 = 3.95478

1.97739 * 0.056875 = let's compute:

1.97739 * 0.05 = 0.0988695.

1.97739 * 0.006875 = 0.0135624.

Adding these: 0.0988695 + 0.0135624 = 0.1124319.

So total is 3.95478 + 0.1124319 = 4.0672119.

So L ≈ 4.0672e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. Maybe due to more precise calculations, perhaps I made a slight error in approximations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for ħ and gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise beta and gamma.

Let me compute gamma exactly. gamma is E/(m) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666666666... (20/3).

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma)^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1/(400/9))) = sqrt(1 - 9/400) = sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.98869.

Wait, exact value of sqrt(391/400) is sqrt(391)/20. What's sqrt(391)?

Well, 19^2 is 361, 20^2 is 400, so sqrt(391) is between 19.7 and 19.8.

Let me compute 19.77^2: 19.77 * 19.77.

19*19=361.

19 * 0.77=14.63.

0.77*19=14.63.

0.77*0.77=0.5929.

Wait, perhaps a better way: (a+b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b².

Let me compute 19.77^2:

= (19 + 0.77)^2 = 19^2 + 2*19*0.77 + 0.77^2.

19^2 = 361.

2*19*0.77 = 38 * 0.77 = 29.26.

0.77^2 = 0.5929.

Sum: 361 + 29.26 = 390.26 → +0.5929 → 390.8529.

But 19.77^2 is 390.8529, which is under 391. So perhaps 19.775^2.

Compute 19.775^2:

= (19.77 + 0.005)^2 = 19.77^2 + 2*19.77*0.005 + (0.005)^2.

19.77^2 is 390.8529.

2*19.77*0.005 = 0.1977.

(0.005)^2 = 0.000025.

So total is 390.8529 + 0.1977 = 391.0506 + 0.000025 = 391.050625.

So 19.775^2 = 391.0506 > 391, so sqrt(391) is approximately 19.775 - some.

Wait, 19.775^2 is 391.0506, which is 0.0506 above 391.

So sqrt(391) ≈ 19.775 - (0.0506)/(2*19.775).

The derivative of x² at x=19.775 is 2x=39.55. So delta x ≈ delta (x²) / (2x).

delta x² is (391.0506 - 391) = 0.0506. So delta x ≈ 0.0506 / (2 *19.775) ) ≈ 0.0506 / 39.55 ≈ 0.00128.

So sqrt(391) ≈ 19.775 - 0.00128 ≈ 19.7737.

So beta is 19.7737 / 20 ≈ 0.988685.

So beta is approximately 0.988685.

Gamma is exactly 20/3 ≈6.6666666667.

So beta * gamma = 0.988685 *6.6666666667.

Compute 0.988685 *6 =5.93211.

0.988685 *0.6666666667 = approx 0.659123.

Adding together:5.93211 +0.659123≈6.59123.

So beta gamma ≈6.59123.

Now, L = beta gamma * c * tau_0.

Tau_0 is 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.

c is 2.99792458e8 m/s, but for simplicity I've used 3e8 m/s. Let's use the more precise value.

So c = 2.99792458e8 m/s.

Compute L:

L =6.59123 * 2.99792458e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute 6.59123 * 2.99792458e8.

6.59123 * 2.99792458e8 ≈6.59123 * 3e8 ≈1.977369e9, but more accurately:

Compute 6.59123 * 2.99792458.

6 * 2.99792458 =17.9875475.

0.59123 *2.99792458 ≈approx 1.7725.

Total ≈17.9875475 +1.7725≈19.76.

Wait, perhaps precise calculation:

6.59123 *2.99792458 → breaking it down:

2.99792458 *6 =17.9875475.

2.99792458 *0.59123.

0.5 *2.99792458=1.49896.

0.09123 *2.99792458 ≈0.27347.

So 1.49896 +0.27347 ≈1.77243.

So total is 17.9875475 +1.77243=19.7599775.

So 6.59123 *2.99792458e8 =19.7599775e8 m/s.

Now, multiply by tau_0 =2.056875e-24 s.

So 19.7599775e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

= 19.7599775 *2.056875e-16.

Compute 19.76 *2.056875.

19 *2.056875=39.080625.

0.76 *2.056875= approx 1.563.

Total ≈39.080625 +1.563=40.643625.

But with precise calculation:

19.7599775 *2.056875.

Let me compute 19 *2.056875=39.080625.

0.7599775 *2.056875.

Compute 0.7 *2.056875=1.4398125.

0.0599775 *2.056875≈0.123383.

So total for 0.7599775 is 1.4398125 +0.123383≈1.563195.

So overall, 39.080625 +1.563195=40.64382.

So 40.64382e-16 m.

Wait, no, wait. 19.7599775e8 *2.056875e-24 = (19.7599775 *2.056875) * (1e8 *1e-24) = 40.64382 *1e-16 =4.064382e-15 meters.

So L ≈4.0644e-15 m, which is very close to option B, 4.0655e-15 m.

The slight discrepancy is due to rounding during intermediate steps. So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the relationship \( L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0 \), where \( \tau_0 = \hbar / \Gamma \), \( \beta = v/c \), and \( \gamma = E / (m c^2) \). The given parameters are \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \), and \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). The reduced Planck constant is \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \), and the speed of light is \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).

### Step 1: Compute \( \tau_0 \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \) is given by:
\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is:
\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
\]
The velocity factor \( \beta \) is derived from:
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.988685.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \beta \gamma \)
The product \( \beta \gamma \) is:
\[
\beta \gamma = 0.988685 \times 6.6667 \approx 6.59123.
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( L \)
The mean decay distance \( L \) is:
\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0 = 6.59123 \times (3 \times 10^8) \times (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}).
\]
First, compute \( 6.59123 \times 3 \times 10^8 = 1.977369 \times 10^9 \, \text{m/s} \). Then, multiply by \( 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):
\[
L = 1.977369 \times 10^9 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 4.0644 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with options
The computed value \( L \approx 4.0644 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B**, \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), with minor discrepancies due to rounding during intermediate steps.

**Answer: B**
