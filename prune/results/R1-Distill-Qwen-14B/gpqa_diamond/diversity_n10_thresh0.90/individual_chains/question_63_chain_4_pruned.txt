Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, let's see. The question is about what momentum a photon must have for the molecule to switch to the next energy state when it absorbs it. 

Alright, the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, and it's in its fundamental state. I remember that in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state for both rotation and vibration.

So the molecule in its fundamental state means both the vibrational and rotational states are at their lowest. The next state with the lowest possible energy would probably be the next vibrational state or the next rotational state, whichever requires less energy. But wait, the question specifies the next state with the lowest possible energy. I think in such models, the energy levels are quantized, and transitions are based on absorbing a photon that provides the exact energy difference.

Wait, the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state. So what's the next state? Oh right, the next state would be the first excited state. But in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized and the transitions could involve either a change in vibrational state, rotational state, or both. But the question says the photon is absorbed to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think it's the lowest energy transition possible, which would be the first possible transition from the ground state. 

Wait, no. Since the molecule is in the fundamental (ground) state, the next state would be the next higher energy state. But what's the composition of that state? For a diatomic molecule, the total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies.

Hmm, perhaps the fundamental state is the state where both rotation and vibration are in their ground states. The next state would be the next higher energy state, which could be a higher rotational state or a higher vibrational state. But which transition requires less energy?

I think that usually, the vibrational energy levels are spaced further apart than the rotational ones because the vibrational energy depends on the bond's force constant, which is higher. So the vibrational energy levels are higher in spacing. So the first transition would be a vibrational transition, but wait, no, because sometimes the rotational transitions can be in between. Wait, but the question specifies that the photon is absorbed to go to the next state with the lowest energy possible. So I need to find the photon's momentum that corresponds to the minimum energy needed for a transition from the ground state to the next possible state.

Wait, the energy of the photon must match the energy difference between the initial and final states. So the photon's energy should be equal to the energy difference between the ground state and the next state. But what's the next state? Since the ground state has the lowest energy, the next state would be the first excited state, which could be either a vibrational or rotational state, whichever requires less energy.

Wait, but in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are given by a combination of rotational and vibrational terms. The total energy is E = E_vibrational + E_rotational. The fundamental state is when both v=0 (vibrational ground) and J=0 (rotational ground). The next state could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1, whichever has a lower energy. So which of these two transitions requires less energy?

The vibrational energy levels are given by E_v = (hω/2)(2n + 1), where n is the vibrational quantum number. For n=0 (ground), E_v = (hω/2)(1) = hω/2. For n=1, E_v = hω/2*(3) = 3hω/2. So the energy difference ΔE_v for a vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1 is 3hω/2 - hω/2 = hω.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_J = (ħ²/(2I)) J(J+1), where I is the moment of inertia. For J=0, E_J=0. For J=1, E_J = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2. So the energy difference ΔE_rot for a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is E_J=1 - E_J=0 = (ħ²/(2I))(2) = ħ²/(I).

So which energy is smaller, ΔE_v or ΔE_rot?

Let me compute both.

Given:

Masses: Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. So the reduced mass μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Wait, but 1 amu is 1.66e-27 kg, so μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ let me calculate that. 1.818 * 1.66 is about 3.01, so 3.01e-27 kg.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

The moment of inertia I = μ R².

So I = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m².

Now, compute ΔE_rot = ħ²/(2I) * 2. Wait, wait, E_J = (ħ²/(2I)) J(J+1). So for J=0 to J=1, the energy change is E(1) - E(0) = (ħ²/(2I))(2) - 0 = ħ²/(I).

So ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I). Let's compute that.

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² ≈ (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ħ²/(I) = 1.112e-68 / 1.204e-46 ≈ (1.112 / 1.204) * 1e-22 ≈ approx 0.924 * 1e-22 = 9.24e-23 J.

But wait, the vibrational energy difference is hω. Let me compute that.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s. ω is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So hω = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So comparing the two energy differences: ΔE_rot ≈9.24e-23 J and ΔE_vib = 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires much less energy. Therefore, the next state would be the first rotational state, J=1, with v=0.

So the energy of the photon must be equal to ΔE_rot = h * (rotational frequency) ?

Wait, no, the photon's energy is E_photon = ΔE. Since ΔE_rot is 9.24e-23 J, but wait, let me recheck the calculations because those numbers seem a bit small.

Wait maybe I made a mistake in the moment of inertia calculation. Let's re-calculate I.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20u * 2u)/(22u) )= (40)/(22) u = 40/22 ≈1.818 amu.

Converting 1.818 amu to kg: 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg, so 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.015e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.015e-27 *4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg m².

Now, ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ħ²/(I) = 1.112e-68 / 1.206e-46 ≈ (1.112 /1.206 ) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.922 *1e-22 = 9.22e-23 J.

And hω = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 ≈ 2.65e-19 J.

So yes, ΔE_rot is much smaller. So the photon's energy must be 9.22e-23 J.

Wait, but the question is about the momentum of the photon. Because photon's energy is E = pc, where p is momentum, so p = E/c.

So p = (9.22e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are that small. Wait, let me check the options again. 

Options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns (which is kg m/s, same as Ns)
B) 2.3e-27 kg m/s
C) 1.1e-27 kg m/s
D) 1.4e-28 kg m/s

Hmm, my calculation gives p ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is much smaller than any of the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I confused the model. The problem says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, in the rigid rotor model, the bond length is fixed, but the non-rigid rotor allows for bond stretching, which couples rotation and vibration. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure how that affects the energy levels.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the simultaneous change in both rotational and vibrational states. But that would complicate things, and the question states the next state with the lowest possible energy, which I thought would be the rotational transition.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the energy difference. Let me double-check the rotational energy calculation.

Rotational energy levels are E_J = (ħ²/(2I)) J(J+1). So for J=0 to J=1, the energy increases by E = (ħ²/(2I)) (2) = ħ²/(I). So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I used the wrong formula for the energy. In the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are E_J = (h²/(8π² I)) J(J+1). Alternatively, I might have the formula wrong.

Alternatively, sometimes the rotational energy is written as E_J = (J (J+1) h c B ) where B is the rotational constant. B is given by B = ħ²/(2I c), but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the rotational constant B is defined as B = h/(8π² I c). Or, perhaps another way, B = ħ²/(2I c). Wait, maybe I should compute B.

Wait, the rotational constant B is given by B = ħ²/(2I c), where c is the speed of light.

Wait, but why am I involving c here? Because in spectroscopy, sometimes energy is expressed in wavenumbers, which involve c. Maybe I got confused between the energy expressions. Alternatively, perhaps the energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1) h c, where B is in cm^-1.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the energy formula. Let me think again. The rotational energy is E_J = (ħ²/(2I)) J(J+1). That's correct. So for J=0, E=0. For J=1, E=(ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/(I). So that's correct.

So the energy difference is ħ²/(I) = 9.22e-23 J. So photon energy E_photon = 9.22e-23 J. Then, since E=pc, p=E/c = 9.22e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s. That's about 3e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are in the order of 1e-28, which is three orders of magnitude larger. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the rotational energy using the moment of inertia I, but perhaps I used the wrong value for I.

Wait, I used the reduced mass correctly. Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. Reduced mass μ = (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Correct.

R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. Correct.

I = μ R² = 1.818 amu * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, wait! No, the moment of inertia is I = μ r². But wait, r is the bond length, which is 2 angstroms. So yes, 2e-10 m. So I = 1.818e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 1.818e-27 *4e-20 = 7.272e-47 kg m². Wait, wait! Did I do that right earlier?

Wait, earlier I thought μ was 3.01e-27 kg, but wait, wait. μ = 1.818 amu.

Wait, 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg. So 1.818 amu = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.015e-27 kg. Oh wait, no, that's correct. So I = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2. So (2e-10)^2 is 4e-20 m². So 3.015e-27 *4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg m². So that's correct. So I = 1.206e-46 kg m².

Wait, so that's correct. So the calculation for I was right.

So the problem must be elsewhere. Let me think: perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first energy level, which could be the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0), because that requires less energy than the rotational transition.

Wait, wait, earlier I thought the rotational energy difference was 9.2e-23 J, and the vibrational was 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires about 3e-23 J, which is much less than the vibrational. So the molecule would transition to the next state (J=1, v=0) which requires lower energy than the vibrational transition.

But the options don't include anything near 3e-31 kg m/s. So perhaps I made a mistake in which transition is considered.

Wait, perhaps the model assumes that for the fundamental state, the next state is the first vibrational state, not the rotational. Or perhaps I'm supposed to consider the transition that requires the least energy, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me compute both energy differences again.

ΔE_vibrational = hω = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

ΔE_rotational = ħ²/(I) ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

So the rotational transition requires much less energy. So the photon's energy should match the rotational transition.

But according to my calculation, the momentum p would be E/c = 9.22e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is about 3e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options are near that. The options are 1e-28, which is bigger by 3 orders of magnitude (1e-28 is 1e3 * 1e-31).

Wait, did I make a mistake in the units? Let me check the moment of inertia again.

Ah, wait! 1e-27 kg is 1e-24 grams, but perhaps I made a calculation mistake in the moment of inertia. Let's recalculate I.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.015e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ R² = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.015e-27 *4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg m².

Yes, correct. So ħ² is (1.055e-34)^2 ≈ 1.11e-68.

So (ħ²)/(I) = 1.11e-68 / 1.206e-46 = approximately 9.22e-23 J.

Wait, another thought: maybe the selection rules allow for a simultaneous change in both rotational and vibrational states, but that's more complicated. Or perhaps I'm supposed to find the transition that requires the least energy but is allowed by selection rules. But I'm not sure about the selection rules for this model.

Wait, perhaps the model is the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator model, where the energy levels are E = E_vib + E_rot. In that case, the fundamental state is the lowest energy (v=0, J=0).
