Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Let's break this down.

First, I remember that in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized. The molecule can change its state by absorbing a photon with the right energy. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so the next state must be the next higher energy level.

Wait, the question mentions the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, right, that probably means the next energy level that's higher than the fundamental. So, for a diatomic molecule, the energy levels are quantized and depend on both rotational and vibrational states.

But wait, the problem specifies it's modeled using the non-rigid rotor model, which I think is the rotation-vibration model. So, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational energies.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state would be the lowest energy state, which is the v=0 vibrational state and the J=0 rotational state, right? Because vibrational states start at v=0 and rotational at J=0.

Now, when it absorbs a photon, it can transition to a higher state. But the next state with the lowest possible energy—so that would be the next energy level, which I think is either an increase in vibrational energy (v=1) or rotational (J=1). But which transition has the lower energy requirement?

Wait, but the question says the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon's energy should be the minimum required for the transition. So I need to find the energy difference between the fundamental state and the next possible state.

So the next state could involve an increase in either vibrational or rotational quantum number. Which has a lower energy difference?

Let me think about the energies. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω, where ω is the angular frequency. The rotational energy is E_rot = [ (J(J+1) ) / (2I) ] * ħ², where I is the moment of inertia.

But in the non-rigid rotor model, perhaps the energy levels also account for centrifugal distortion, but I'm not sure if that's needed here since the problem doesn't provide any information about that.

Wait, the problem gives the angular frequency of vibration, ω. So maybe the main transition here is the vibrational one, but the molecule could also rotate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0), and the next state could be either v=1 or J=1. But which one has a lower energy difference?

Let me calculate both possibilities.

First, the energy of a photon is E_photon = hν, where ν is the frequency. The momentum p of the photon is p = E/c. But let's think about both transitions.

The energy for the vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1 is ΔE_vib = ( (1 + ½) - (0 + ½) ) hν = hν. Wait, the energy levels are E_v = (v + ½) ħω. So ΔE_vib = (1) ħω = ħω.

Alternatively, the rotational transition. The rotational energy is E_rot = [ J (J + 1) ] (ħ² / (2I) ). For J=0 to J=1, the energy change is from 0 to [ 2 * (ħ²/(2I) ) ] = ħ²/(I).

So compute both ΔE_vib = ħω and ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I).

Which one is smaller? The photon's energy must match the energy difference of the transition.

So I need to calculate both and see which is smaller.

The given data are:

Mx = 20 amu (atomic mass units)
My = 2 amu
Bond length R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.
Angular frequency ω = 4e14 rad/s.

First, calculate the moment of inertia I for the molecule. I is given by I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Let's compute that.

Mx and My are in amu. 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg.

So Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-26 kg.
My = 2 amu = 2 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40 /22 amu = (20/11) amu ≈1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.025e-27 kg.

R is 2e-10 m, so I = μ R² = 3.025e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.025e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.21e-46 kg·m².

Now ΔE_rot = ħ² / (I) where ħ is h/(2π), approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

Wait, but I think I might have miscalculated. Let me write it step by step.

Wait, ΔE_rot = (ħ²) / I.

Let me compute that value.

ħ² = (1.0545718e-34 J·s)^2 ≈ (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

I is 1.21e-46 kg·m².

So ΔE_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.21e-46 ≈ (1.112 / 1.21) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.919 * 1e-22 = 9.19e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it more accurately.

1.112e-68 / 1.21e-46 = (1.112/1.21) * 1e-22.

1.112 / 1.21 ≈ 0.919.

So 0.919e-22 J ≈9.19e-23 J.

Now, what is ΔE_vib? It's ħω.

ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s, ω is 4e14 rad/s.

So ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

Comparing the two, ΔE_vib is 4.2e-20 J and ΔE_rot is ~9e-23 J.

So 4.2e-20 is much larger than 9e-23. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the molecule can transition to a higher rotational state with a smaller photon energy.

Wait, but wait, the question is to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state (the higher energy one) that the molecule can reach with the least energy would be the rotational transition.

Because that requires a photon with energy 9.19e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should consider that the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0 and J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would be either J=1 or v=1. But since the energy required for J=1 is lower than for v=1, the photon energy needed for J=1 is smaller.

So the photon must supply the energy difference for the rotational transition, which is ΔE_rot =9.19e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, the photon's energy is E_photon = ΔE. So E_photon = 9.19e-23 J.

Now, the photon's momentum p is related to its energy. Since E = pc (because for photons, E = pc), so p = E / c.

c is speed of light, approx 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.19e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.06e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of the options are close to 3e-31. The options are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I got the wrong energy difference. Alternatively, perhaps the transition is a combination of both vibrational and rotational changes? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the moment of inertia.

Wait, let me double-check the moment of inertia calculation.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) in kg.

Mx = 20 amu =20 * 1.66e-27 kg =3.32e-26 kg.

My=2 amu=3.32e-27 kg.

μ = (3.32e-26 kg * 3.32e-27 kg) / (3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27) kg.

Wait, no, μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My).

So Mx is 3.32e-26 kg, My is 3.32e-27 kg.

So Mx + My = 3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27 =3.652e-26 kg.

Mx*My = (3.32e-26 kg) * (3.32e-27 kg) = 1.10224e-52 kg².

So μ = 1.10224e-52 / 3.652e-26 = approx 3.018e-27 kg.

Ah, so earlier calculation was correct, μ≈3.02e-27 kg.

Then, I = μ R² =3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2=4e-20 m².

So I=3.02e-27 *4e-20= 1.208e-46 kg m².

Then, ħ²/(2I) is not what I used earlier. Wait, no—rotational energy is E_rot = [ J (J+1) ] * (ħ²/(2I) ). So the energy difference for J=0 to J=1 is [2* (ħ²/(2I) ) ] - 0 = ħ²/(I).

Wait, let me compute ħ²/(I).

ħ =1.0545718e-34 J·s.

ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

I is 1.208e-46 kg m².

So ħ²/(I) = 1.112e-68 / 1.208e-46 = approx 9.20e-23 J. Same as before.

So the energy required for rotational transition is 9.2e-23 J.

But the options are way larger, like 1e-27 N s.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in calculating the energy. Because when a molecule absorbs a photon, it can undergo a transition involving both rotation and vibration, but in this problem, I'm supposed to find the photon that makes it switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the photon provides both a vibrational and rotational transition, but in the minimal way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a vibrational transition, not a rotational one. Because the rotational energy levels are much closer together, but the question might be designed differently.

Wait, perhaps the question is in the context of the diatomic molecule's fundamental state (v=0, J=0) and the next state is (v=1, J=0), but I'm not sure.

Wait, but earlier, the vibrational transition's energy is 4.2e-20 J, which is much larger than the rotational. So if the molecule is in the ground state, the next state (lowest energy) would be the J=1 state, requiring less energy.

So the photon's momentum is E/c = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But looking at the options, none of them are on the order of 1e-31. The options are orders of
