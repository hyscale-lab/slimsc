Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The setup is such that when we observe the star, the brightness variations due to the spots' rotation could mimic those caused by an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. The task is to find out what the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation as the spots.

Hmm. I remember that the brightness change (the dip in light curve) depends on the area of the object blocking the light. For an exoplanet, the dip is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. But in this case, the spots on the star are causing a variation. So I need to model the brightness change caused by the spots and then compare it to the dip from the planet.

Wait, but the problem says that if the star wasn't covered by spots, what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude. So I need to compute the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same amplitude.

The star's brightness is also affected by the temperature variations of the spots. Since the spots are cooler, when they are on the side facing us (as the star rotates), the total brightness emitted will decrease. So the observed brightness depends on the area covered by the spots and their temperature difference.

Let me break down what I know:

- Star radius, R_star = R_sun = let's say R (but since ratios are involved, maybe the actual value doesn't matter)
- Filling factor, f = 20% or 0.2. This is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. Wait, but the spots are on one hemisphere, so maybe the filling factor is for that hemisphere only. So the total area covered by spots is f * (π R²), because a hemisphere is half the star's surface. Wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the entire star's surface covered by spots? Or just the hemisphere? Hmm, the problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So maybe the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * ( (4π R²)/2 ) = 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R². Wait, no, that can’t be right. Let me think again. The star's total surface area is 4π R². If one hemisphere is entirely covered by spots which have a filling factor of 20%, that means 20% of the hemisphere's surface is spots. So hemisphere area is 2π R². So spots area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, maybe I should think of it this way: The entire star's surface is
