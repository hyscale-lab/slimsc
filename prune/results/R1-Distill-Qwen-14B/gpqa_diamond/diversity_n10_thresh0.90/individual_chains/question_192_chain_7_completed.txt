Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The cavity isn't at the center because the center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R, the radius of the conductor. So, the cavity is shifted off-center. 

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the center of the cavity is l, with both l and L being greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are four different expressions for E, each involving these variables. So, I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that conductors have some properties regarding charges and electric fields. For a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor material is zero. Also, any excess charge resides on the surface. But wait, in this case, the conductor was initially uncharged, and then a charge +q is placed inside the cavity. 

Wait, the conductor itself is uncharged. So when you put a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's charges will redistribute. But since the conductor is neutral, how does that work?

I think that when a charge is placed inside the cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge equal and opposite to the charge inside. So, the inner surface would have -q, and the outer surface would have +q because the conductor was initially neutral. Wait, no. Let me think again. If the conductor is neutral, and the cavity has +q, then the inner surface must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner -q.

Wait, no. If the conductor is neutral, the total charge on it is zero. So, the inner surface must have a charge of -q (induced by the +q inside the cavity). Since the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance this. Because the total conductor's charge is the sum of inner and outer surface: (-q) + (+q) = 0.

So, for a point outside the conductor (since P is outside, L > R), the electric field would be due to the total charge on the conductor. Because outside a conductor, the field is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So, for point P, the field would be due to the total charge on the conductor, which is +q.

Wait, but wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So the total charge on the conductor is zero. Oh wait, no. Because the conductor is neutral, but when the charge +q is placed in the cavity, the inner surface will have -q, and the outer surface will have +q, so that the conductor's total charge is zero. So, yes, the outer surface has +q.

So, the external field is due to the +q charge on the outer surface. But wait, the conductor's outer surface is a spherical shell. The electric field outside a spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were at the center. So, the field at any point outside would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_enclosed)/(r²), where r is the distance from the center.

In this case, the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. So, the electric field should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²). Because the outer surface's charge is +q, and the field outside depends only on the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface, which in this case is the +q.

Wait, but the question says the conductor is uncharged. Oh wait, the conductor's total charge is zero. Because the inner surface has -q and the outer has +q. So net charge of the conductor is zero. But the outer charge is +q, so when considering the field outside, that's the charge that matters.

Wait, but the conductor itself was uncharged, so it's neutral. So the total charge on the conductor is zero. So, the outer surface charge is +q, and the inner is -q, so the conductor's total is zero. So, when considering the field outside, it's as if the charge at the center is the same as the outer charge, but wait, the conductor is a sphere, so the field outside is due to the charges on its outer surface.

But wait, the conductor is spherical, so regardless of where the cavity is, the outer surface will adjust to maintain a spherically symmetric charge distribution. So, the field outside should be as if all the charge is at the center, regardless of the position of the cavity.

So, for a point P outside, the field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L². Because the outer surface has +q, so that's the charge outside the Gaussian surface (which is point P, so the surface is of radius L).

Looking at the options, option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So, that's the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. The point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, but the center of the cavity is at a distance s from the center, and the point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, with angle theta between l and s.

Wait, but when considering the electric field outside the conductor, the field is determined by the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q, regardless of where the inner charge is placed. Because the conductor shields the interior from the outside. So, whether the charge q is in the center or off-center, the outer surface will have the same effect because the conductor is a sphere. So the field outside is as if the charge is at the center of the conductor.

So, the answer should be option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor with a small, off-center cavity. A positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and a distance $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ (the distance between the centers of the conductor and the cavity) is $\theta$.

For a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor material is zero. When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor induces a charge $-q$ to cancel the field within the conductor. Since the conductor is initially neutral, the outer surface must have a charge $+q$ to maintain charge neutrality. The field outside the conductor is determined by the total charge on the outer surface, which is $+q$, and is independent of the position of the cavity or the charge distribution within it.

The electric field outside a spherical conductor is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge located at the center of the conductor. Thus, at point $P$, which is a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor, the electric field is given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

This matches option B. The other options are incorrect because they involve unnecessary dependencies on $l$, $s$, or $\theta$, which do not affect the field outside the conductor due to its spherical symmetry.

Answer: B
