Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the probability of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates of an operator and also calculating the average value of that operator. Let me read the problem again.

The state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Oh wait, so |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. So that means our basis here is the standard spin-up and spin-down along the z-axis.

The operator's matrix representation is given by Aij = ħ/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, so let me think about what that matrix looks like. For a 2x2 system, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So the matrix would be:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0  ]

Wait, but what's the significance of this operator? Oh right, this reminds me of the Pauli matrices. The Pauli X matrix has ones in the off-diagonals and zeros on the diagonal. So this operator A must be (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], and A is [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2,0]], so yes, A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

So the eigenstates of A would be the eigenstates of σ_x. Because if σ_x has eigenvectors |+x> and |-x>, then multiplying by a scalar (ħ/2) doesn't change the eigenvectors, only the eigenvalues. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σ_x.

Wait, but what are the eigenstates of σ_x? They are the superpositions (|up> + |down>)/√2 and (|up> - |down>)/√2. So the eigenstates of operator A are these states |+x> and |-x>.

The problem is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of operator A. So essentially, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A and find the coefficients, whose squared magnitudes will give the probabilities.

But wait, the given |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let me normalize it first, I think. Because the state should be a unit vector.

Wait, the state is given as proportional, so I need to find the normalization factor. Let's compute the norm of (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

The inner product is (1+i)(1-i) + (2 - i)(2 + i). Let's compute each part:

(1+i)(1-i) = 1 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2.

(2 - i)(2 + i) = 4 + 2i -2i -i^2 = 4 - (-1) =5.

So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So the norm squared is 7, so the normalization factor is 1/√7. Therefore, |alpha> is (1/√7)[(1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>].

Now, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>. Let me recall that |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/√2 and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/√2.

Wait, but wait. Let me write |+x> and |-x> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|+x> = (1/√2)|up> + (1/√2)|down>

|-x> = (1/√2)|up> - (1/√2)|down>

So, perhaps I can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me denote |alpha> = c1|+x> + c2|−x>.

So, substituting the expressions for |+x> and |-x>:

(1/√7)( (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ) = c1 [ (1/√2)|up> + (1/√2)|down> ] + c2 [ (1/√2)|up> - (1/√2)|down> ]

Let me collect terms for |up> and |down>.

For |up>:

(1+i)/√7 = [ c1 (1/√2) + c2
