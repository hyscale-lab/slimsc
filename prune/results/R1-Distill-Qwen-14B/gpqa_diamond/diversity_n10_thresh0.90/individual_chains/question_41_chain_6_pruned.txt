Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm. Let's see what the question is asking. Alright, a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is given by v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. But in this case, the medium (the glass) is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed?

I think this is a case where special relativity comes into play, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. I recall that the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, regardless of the motion of the source or medium. So if the glass is moving, but light is moving through it, does that change anything? Or is the speed of light still c as measured by the observer in the lab?

Wait, no, wait. Because the light is in the glass, which has an index of refraction. So the speed of light within the glass is c/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v. So how does the observer perceive this?

Let me think about relative velocities. If the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving at c/n in the glass. From the lab frame, the light's speed would be the vector sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity within the glass. But wait, this might not be as straightforward as just adding the velocities, especially if they're in the same direction.

Wait, but in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. There's the velocity addition formula, right? The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/(cÂ²)), where u is the velocity of the object in the original frame, and v is the velocity of the original frame relative to the new frame. Wait, but in this case, the light's velocity in the glass is c/n. Wait, maybe I should model it this way.

Wait, actually, the glass is moving at velocity v. From the lab frame, the glass is moving, and the light is moving through the glass at c/n relative to the glass. So to find the light's velocity in the lab frame, we
