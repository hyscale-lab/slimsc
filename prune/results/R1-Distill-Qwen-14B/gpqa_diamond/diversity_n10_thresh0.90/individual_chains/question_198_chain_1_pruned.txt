Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, a bit tricky, but let's try to break it down.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, okay, so I remember that stability constants (β) indicate how stable a complex is. Higher β means the complex is more stable. Each β corresponds to a different complex. Oh, right! For Co(II) with SCN-, the complexes would be [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n), where n is the number of SCN- ligands attached.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the dithiocyanato would be the Co with two SCN- ligands, right? So that's probably [Co(SCN)₂]^0, since each SCN- is -1, so two would make it neutral. So n=2 here.

Wait, the problem gives four β values, β1 to β4. So each β corresponds to a different n. So β1 is for n=1, β2 for n=2, β3 for n=3, β4 for n=4, I suppose. Wait, but wait, the β values are given in order: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, so each higher β would mean a more stable complex, but wait, no, because β4 is 16 which is lower than β3. So maybe the complexes form up to a certain n, and beyond that, maybe they don't form as much? Or perhaps higher β indicates more stability, but maybe the order is n=1, 2, 3, 4.

Wait, but the way the stability constants are used is for each step. For example, the formation of [CoSCN]^+ from Co^2+ and SCN^- would have β1. Then the formation of [Co(SCN)₂]^0 would have β2, and so on. Each βn is the formation constant for adding the nth SCN- ion.

So the overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) would be the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn. Or is each βn a stepwise constant? Oh right, I think βn is the stepwise constant for adding the nth SCN- to form [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) from [Co(SCN)_{n-1}]^(2−(n−1))} and SCN^-.

So the overall formation constant K for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) is the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, but for the distribution of species, I need to calculate the fraction of each possible complex. So the species present would be Co^2+ (n=0), [CoSCN]^+ (n=1), [Co(SCN)₂]^0 (n=2), [Co(SCN)3]^- (n=3), and [Co(SCN)4]^{2-} (n=4). 

But the problem is to find the percentage of dithiocyanato complexes, which is [Co(SCN)₂]^0. So I need to calculate the fraction of this species relative to all possible cobalt species.

To find the distribution, I think we can use the concept of log K for each species and calculate the fraction based on their stability.

But wait, the approach is to calculate the fraction of each species using their respective formation constants. The fraction of each complex is given by (K_n * [SCN]^(n) ) / (1 + sum of K_i [SCN]^i for i=0 to 4}), but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, the general approach is that for each possible complex, you compute the formation constant, then the fraction is (β1 * β2 * ... βn [SCN]^n) divided by the sum of all such terms for n=0 to 4.

But wait, let me think. For a metal M and ligand L, the fraction of the complex with n ligands is (β_1 * β_2 ... β_n [L]^n) / (sum_{k=0}^4 (β1 β2 ... βk) [L]^k)).

Wait, but wait. No, because each β is stepwise, so the overall K for the complex [ML_n] is K_n = β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

So the concentration of each complex is [CoL_n] = K_n [Co] [L]^n / ([L]^n + ... ), but actually, the exact way to calculate the distribution is through the formation of each species step by step.

Alternatively, using the method of successive approximations, the fraction f_n of each complex is given by:

f_n = (K_n [L]^n) / (1 + sum_{i=1}^4 K_i [L]^i )

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again.

Wait, the total concentration of Co is the sum of all species: Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^0, [Co(SCN)3]^- , and [Co(SCN)4]^{2-}.

Let me denote the total concentration as c = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)₂^0] + [Co(SCN)3^-] + [Co(SCN)4^{2-} }.

But [Co^2+] = c * ( [SCN]^0 ) / (1 + sum_{n=1 to 4} K_n [SCN]^n ), where K_n is the overall formation constant for the nth complex.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of each complex's concentration in terms of the stepwise β's.

Alternatively, for each species, the concentration is [ML_n] = β_1 * β_2 * ... * β_n [ML_{n-1}] [L].

But maybe a better approach is to model the fractions using the formation constants.

Each species' fraction can be found using the formula:

f_n = (K_n [L]^n ) / (1 + sum_{k=1}^4 K_k [L]^k )

But wait, that might not be accurate. Because the initial [Co^2+] is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

Wait, perhaps I should model the fractions as:

The fraction f_n is (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n) / D, where D is the sum over m=0 to 4 of (β1 β2 ... βm [SCN]^m), with the understanding that m=0 gives 1.

Wait, no, because for m=0, it's [Co^2+], which isn't multiplied by any β. So the denominator D would be 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4}.

Wait, but wait, because each β is stepwise, so the overall K for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) is K_n = β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

So the concentration of [Co(SCN)_n] is [Co]_total * K_n [SCN]^n / (1 + sum_{k=0}^{4} K_k [SCN]^k ), where K_0 =1.

Wait, no, because the [Co]_total is the sum of all the species. So each species' concentration is [Co(SCN)_n] = (K_n [SCN]^n ) / (1 + sum_{k=1}^4 K_k [SCN]^k ) * c_total.

Wait, maybe I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to approach this step by step.

First, compute the overall formation constants for each species.

For n=0: just Co^2+, K0=1.

n=1: K1 = β1 =9.

n=2: K2 = β1 * β2 =9 *40 =360.

n=3: K3= β1 β2 β3 =9*40*63= 9*40=360, 360 *63= 22680.

n=4: K4= β1 β2 β3 β4 = 22680 *16 = 362880.

Wait, is that correct? Wait, β4 is 16, so yes.

Now, the concentrations of each species are proportional to K_n [SCN]^n.

So the relative concentrations (fractions) are:

For each n, the fraction f_n = (K_n [SCN]^n) / D, where D is the sum of K_m [SCN]^m for m=0 to 4.

Wait, but K_0 is 1, and [SCN]^0 is 1. So D = 1*(1) + K1*(0.1) + K2*(0.1)^2 + K3*(0.1)^3 + K4*(0.1)^4.

Wait, because [SCN] is 0.1 M.

So computing each term:

n=0: K0*[SCN]^0 =1*1=1.

n=1: K1*[SCN]^1=9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2: K2*[SCN]^2=360*(0.1)^2=360*0.01=3.6.

n=3: K3*[SCN]^3=22680*(0.1)^3=22680 * 0.001=22.68.

n=4: K4*[SCN]^4=362880*(0.1)^4=362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

Wait, wait, let me compute each term:

- K0: 1 * (0.1)^0 =1.

- K1:9 *0.1=0.9.

- K2:360 *0.1^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

- K3:22680 *0.1^3=22680 *0.001=22.68.

- K4: 362880 *0.1^4=362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

So sum all these up:

Sum = 1 +0.9=1.9; 1.9+3.6=5.5; +22.68=2
