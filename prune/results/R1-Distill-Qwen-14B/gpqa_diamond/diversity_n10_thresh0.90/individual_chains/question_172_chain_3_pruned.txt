Okay, so I've got this question about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the visible part of a star where light is emitted, right. And the question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. 

The problem states that both photospheres are in LTE, which is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, I think that means I can use the Boltzmann equation here. The Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of particles in different energy states at thermal equilibrium. The formula is something like the ratio of populations in two states is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference over (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature.

So the Boltzmann equation would be n2/n1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Wait, but in this question, the energy difference is given as ΔE, and E2 is higher than E1, right? Because the atoms are excited to a higher energy level. So if star_1 has twice as many excited atoms, n1 is higher than n2.

Wait, the question says the level is twice as excited in star_1 compared to star_2. So for star_1, n1 is twice n2. Or wait, maybe I should think of it as the ratio (n1/n2) = 2, since star_1 has twice as much excitation in that level.

So, for each star, we can model this. Let's denote the ratio for star_1 as (n1)/(n_ground) = something, and for star_2 as (n2)/(n_ground) = something else. But perhaps a better approach is to take the ratio of the excited state to the ground state for each star.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So maybe the ratio of the excited state population to the total (or ground state) is higher. But perhaps it's better to think in terms of the population ratio between the two energy levels.

Wait, the problem says that the energy difference between the levels is approximately 1.38e-23 J. So that's ΔE = E_upper - E_lower = 1.38e-23 J.

Now, for each star, the ratio of the populations in the upper energy level (n_upper) to the lower (n_lower) is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star_1, n_upper1 / n_lower1 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ), and same for star_2, n_upper2 / n_lower2 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) )

But the problem says that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So I'm assuming that n_upper1 is twice n_upper2, but wait, that's not necessarily correct. Alternatively, the question states that the excited level is twice as excited in star_1. So perhaps the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Wait, no, that's not necessarily correct. Let me read again: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So I think the number of atoms in the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Hmm, but wait, the number density depends on temperature because higher temperature makes more atoms excited.

Wait, but perhaps the question is referring to the ratio of the excited state to the ground state, or perhaps the ratio of the populations between the two stars. Let's clarify.

So, let's say for star_1, the population in the excited state is n1, and for star_2, it's n2. The problem says n1 = 2 n2. Because star_1's atoms are twice as excited, perhaps in the same energy
