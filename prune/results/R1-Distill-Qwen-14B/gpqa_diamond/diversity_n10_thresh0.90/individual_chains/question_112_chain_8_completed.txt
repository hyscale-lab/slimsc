Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that there's an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So I know that the spin states along z are typically |up> and |down>, which are orthonormal. That probably means that the inner product <up|down> is zero and each has norm 1.

First, I think I need to normalize the state |alpha>, because it's only given as proportional. So I have to find the normalization constant. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, so the normalization factor would be 1 over the square root of the sum of the squares (in absolute value) of the coefficients.

Let me compute that. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). The squared magnitudes are |1+i|² and |2-i|². |1+i| is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2), so |1+i|² is 2. Similarly, |2-i| is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(5), so |2-i|² is 5. So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Next, the question asks to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator with matrix elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So the operator is a 2x2 matrix in the spin-z basis. Let me write that matrix out. The diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2.

So the matrix looks like:
[ 0     ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   0  ]

Wait, wait. Because A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j. So for a 2x2 matrix, the (1,2) and (2,1) elements are hbar/2, and the diagonals are zero. So the matrix is:

[[0, ħ/2],
 [ħ/2, 0]]

Hmm, this operator looks familiar. It seems like it's proportional to the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this operator is (ħ/2) X.

Wait, but then again, the Pauli matrices are usually defined with eigenvalues ±1. So if this operator is (ħ/2) X, then its eigenstates are the same as those of X, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So the eigenstates of this operator are those states.

Wait, but the operator is given, and we're supposed to find the eigenstates in terms of which the state |alpha> can be expressed. Or perhaps, since the operator is given, the eigenstates are the basis for measurement. So when the question says "the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates", I think it's asking for the probability that the measurement yields each eigenvalue. So each eigenstate corresponds to a specific eigenvalue.

But wait, perhaps I should find the eigenvectors of this operator A. Let me try that.

The operator A is:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   0 ]

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve det(A - λ I) = 0.

So the determinant is (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (ħ/2)^2 = λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0.

So λ² = ħ²/4 → λ = ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2. That makes sense because the operator is (ħ/2)σ_x, so its eigenvalues are (ħ/2)(1) and (ħ/2)(-1).

The eigenvectors can be found for each eigenvalue.

For λ = ħ/2:

(A - λ I) v = 0 → [ -λ   ħ/2 ]   [v1]   = [0]
               [ ħ/2  -λ ]

Plugging λ=ħ/2:

[ -ħ/2   ħ/2 ] [v1]   = [0]
[ ħ/2  -ħ/2 ] [v2]

From the first equation: (-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → -v1 +v2=0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of [1, 1]^T, normalized. So the eigenstate is (|up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2) → let's denote this as |+x> state.

Similarly, for λ= -ħ/2:

(A + λ I) v =0 → [ ħ/2   ħ/2 ] [v1]   = [0]
               [ ħ/2  ħ/2 ]

Wait, no. A is [0, h/2; h/2, 0], and λ is -h/2. So A - (-h/2) I = [h/2, h/2; h/2, h/2].

So the equations are:

( h/2 ) v1 + ( h/2 ) v2 =0 → v1 + v2 =0 → v2 = -v1.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [1, -1]^T, which is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) → the |−x> state.

So the operator's eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but in the problem, the state |alpha> is expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, so to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>, and then the coefficients' squared magnitudes will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities can be found by projecting |alpha> onto each eigenstate.

So, first, let me express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>, then the coefficients squared give the probabilities.

Wait, let me write down the state |alpha>.

Earlier, I found that |alpha> is ( (1+i)|up> + (2 − i)|down> ) / sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 − i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, I need to express this in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

Because |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> is (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2).

Let me denote |+x> as (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) → coefficient 1/sqrt(2) each.

Similarly, |−x> as (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2) → 1/sqrt(2) and -1/sqrt(2).

So any state can be written as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>.

Let me let |alpha> = a|+x> + b|−x>.

So substituting:

|alpha> = a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2)

= [ (a + b)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (a - b)/sqrt(2) ] |down>.

But |alpha> is also equal to ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) |up> + ( (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) |down>.

So the coefficients must match:

( a + b ) / sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
( a − b ) / sqrt(2) = (2−i)/sqrt(7)

So two equations:

( a + b ) = (1+i) * sqrt(2/7)
( a − b ) = (2−i) * sqrt(2/7 )

Let me write these as:

Equation 1: a + b = (1+i) * sqrt(2/7)
Equation 2: a − b = (2−i) * sqrt(2/7 )

Let me add the two equations:

2a = [ (1+i) + (2−i) ) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= (3) * sqrt(2/7)
So a = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7)
= 3/(2) * sqrt(2/7) → simplifying.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(2/7) as sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) → so 3/(2) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)).

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

2b = [ (1+i) − (2−i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= (−1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7)
So b = (−1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7) / 2 → [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ]/(2 sqrt(7)).

But wait, perhaps it's easier to compute a and b numerically.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the probabilities are |a|² and |b|².

Because |alpha> is expressed as a|+x> + b|−x>, so the probabilities are |a|² and |b|².

So, compute |a|² and |b|².

Let me compute a:

a = [ (1+i) + (2−i) ] * sqrt(2/7) / 2.

Wait, no. Wait, from earlier:

a = [ (1+i) + (2−i) ] * sqrt(2/7) / 2.

Wait, no, wait, more accurately:

From the equations:

a = [ ( (1+i) + (2−i) ) * sqrt(2/7) ] / 2.

Wait, let me compute (1+i) + (2−i) = 3 + 0i → 3.

So a = 3 * sqrt(2/7) / 2.

So |a|² is (9) * (2/7) ) /4 → (18)/(28) )= 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, compute b.

From equation 2: a − b = (2−i) * sqrt(2/7).

We have a =3 * sqrt(2/7) /2.

So substituting into equation 2:

3*sqrt(2/7)/2 - b = (2−i) * sqrt(2/7)

→ b = [3 sqrt(2/7) /2 ] - (2−i) sqrt(2/7 )

= sqrt(2/7) [ 3/2 - (2 - i) ]

= sqrt(2/7) [ (3/2) -2 +i ]

= sqrt(2/7) [ (-1/2) +i ]

So b = sqrt(2/7) [ (-1 + 2i) / 2 ].

So |b|² is [ | (-1 + 2i)/2 |² ] * (2/7 )

Compute |(-1 + 2i)|² = (1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5 → so |(-1 +2i)/2 |² is 5/4.

So |b|² = (5/4) * (2/7 ) = (5 *2 )/(4 *7 )= 10/28 =5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Hmm, but wait, |a|² + |b|² should be 1 because the state is normalized. Let's check: 9/14 +5/14=14/14=1. Yes, correct.

So the probabilities are |a|²=9/14 ≈0.642857 and |b|²=5/14≈0.357, which rounds to 0.64 and 0.36. So looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36. But let's check the third part of the question.

The question also asks for the average value (expectation value) of the operator A. The operator is A, with eigenvalues λ_+ = ħ/2 and λ_- = -ħ/2.

The expectation value <A> is given by <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is a combination of the eigenstates |+x> and |−x>, which are eigenstates of A with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively, the expectation value would be |a|^2*(ħ/2) + |b|^2*(-ħ/2).

So <A> = |a|^2*(ħ/2) + |b|^2*(-ħ/2).

Substituting the values:

|a|^2 =9/14, |b|^2=5/14.

So <A> = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) → [ (9)(1) -5 ] (ħ/(2*14)) )

Which is (4) (ħ/(28)) ) → 4 ħ /28 → ħ/7.

So the average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64,0.36 and ħ/7 → matches.

Wait, option A is 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. So that's our choice.

But wait, let me double-check.

Another approach to compute <A> is using the matrix elements.

The operator A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]], and the state |alpha> is (1+i|up> + 2 -i |down> ) / sqrt(7).

So |alpha> is a column vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then, <A> = alpha† A alpha → compute alpha† A alpha.

So compute the matrix product:

A alpha is:

[ 0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (ħ/2)(2-i)/sqrt(7) ]
[ (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2-i)/sqrt(7) ]

So A alpha is ( ħ/2 (2-i) ) / sqrt(7) in the first component, and ( ħ/2 (1+i) ) / sqrt(7) in the second component.

Then, alpha† is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ].

So alpha† A alpha is:

(1-i)/sqrt(7) * [ ħ/2 (2-i) / sqrt(7) ] + (2+i)/sqrt(7) * [ ħ/2 (1+i) / sqrt(7) ]

Compute each term:

First term:

(1-i)(2-i) ħ/(2*7) → Multiply (1-i)(2-i) = 2 - i -2i +i² → 2-3i -1 → (1 -3i).

So first term: (1-3i) * ħ/(14)

Second term:

(2+i)(1+i) → 2(1) + 2i +i(1) +i² → 2 +3i -1 → 1 +3i.

So second term: (1+3i) * ħ/(14)

Adding both terms:

(1-3i +1 +3i) * ħ/14 → (2) * ħ/14 → ħ/7.

Which matches the earlier result. So <A> is indeed ħ/7.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7. So the correct option is A.


To solve the problem, we start with the given state:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}
\]

### Step 1: Probabilities of Measuring Eigenstates of the Operator \(A\)
The operator \(A\) is given by the matrix:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\]

This operator has eigenvalues \(\lambda_+ = \frac{\hbar}{2}\) and \(\lambda_- = -\frac{\hbar}{2}\), with corresponding eigenstates:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates \(|+x\rangle\) and \(|-x\rangle\), we express \(|\alpha\rangle\) in terms of these eigenstates:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = a|+x\rangle + b|-x\rangle
\]

Substituting the expressions for \(|+x\rangle\) and \(|-x\rangle\), we solve for \(a\) and \(b\):

\[
a = \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{7}\sqrt{2}}, \quad b = \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{7}\sqrt{2}}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
a = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad b = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of \(a\) and \(b\):

\[
|a|^2 = \frac{9}{14}, \quad |b|^2 = \frac{5}{14}
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \(0.64\) and \(0.36\).

### Step 2: Average Value of the Operator \(A\)
The expectation value of \(A\) is given by:

\[
\langle A \rangle = |a|^2 \lambda_+ + |b|^2 \lambda_-
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9\hbar}{28} - \frac{5\hbar}{28} = \frac{\hbar}{7}
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are \(0.64\) and \(0.36\), and the average value of the operator is \(\frac{\hbar}{7}\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
