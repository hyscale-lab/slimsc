Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But wait, the question isn't about mass directly—it's about luminosity. Hmm.

Astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission depends on its temperature. The formula for that is Wien's Law, which says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but in the problem, the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Oh, right, radial velocity is the speed at which the star is moving towards or away from us. But how does that affect temperature? Oh, wait, no. The peak wavelength observed is affected by the Doppler effect. Because if a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted, which would shift the observed wavelength. So the actual emission peak is at λ0, but because of the star's velocity, we see it at λ_observed.

Wait, so the problem says that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same for both. But their actual emission peaks might be different if they have different velocities.

But wait, let me think. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 (so no Doppler shift), while Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. So Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, which would blueshift its light. So the observed λ_max for Star_2 would be shorter than its actual emitted λ_max.

But the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So if Star_1 has λ_max1 = b / T1, and Star_2 has λ_max2_observed = λ_max1. But Star_2's actual λ_max2_emit is different because it's blueshifted.

Wait, because the observed λ_max for Star_2 is λ_max2_emit adjusted by the Doppler shift. So we can relate the two.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_observed = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), but wait, no—actually, the relativistic Doppler shift is λ = λ0 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), where v is the radial velocity. But since 700 km/s is much less than the speed of light (which is about 3e5 km/s), maybe we can approximate it with the non-relativistic formula. Or perhaps the problem expects us to use the relativistic formula.

Wait, let me think. The Doppler shift formula when the source is moving towards the observer can be approximated as λ_obs ≈ λ_emit * (1 - v/c), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the exact formula is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ). But v is 700 km/s, which is 0.7 million meters per second, and c is about 3e5 km/s = 3e8 m/s. So v is 7e5 m/s, which is about 0.00233c. So v is small compared to c, so approximations might be okay.

Wait, but maybe I should use the relativistic formula here to be precise.

So, for Star_2, which has a radial velocity v = 700 km/s towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter than the emitted wavelength. So the observed λ_max is λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) )

Wait, no, wait. If the source is moving towards the observer, the observed wavelength is shorter than the emitted. So λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ), right? Let me think. Because blueshift occurs when approaching. So if a star emits at λ_emit, and it's moving towards us, the observed λ would be less than λ_emit. The formula for λ_obs is λ_emit multiplied by sqrt( (c - v)/(c + v) ) ), which is the same as sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ).

Yes, that makes sense. So λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (c - v)/(c + v) )

Wait, no, actually the correct Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is f = f0 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), where f0 is the emitted frequency, and v is the approach velocity. Since λ = c/f, λ_obs = c/(f0 * sqrt(...) ) ) = λ0 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So yes, λ_obs = λ0 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So, for Star_2, the observed λ_max is λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

But according to the problem, λ1_emit = λ2_obs because both have the same observed peak wavelength. Since Star_1 has radial velocity zero, its emitted λ_max is λ1_emit = b / T1. Similarly, Star_2's emitted λ_max is λ2_emit = b / T2.

But we have λ1_emit = λ2_obs. So:

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Substituting λ1_emit and λ2_emit from Wien's law:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Simplify this equation:

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Multiply both sides by T2:

T2 / T1 = sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So the temperature ratio T2 / T1 is sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Now, given that v is 700 km/s, which is 7e5 m/s. c is 3e8 m/s. So v/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.002333...

So let's compute (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c):

(1 - 0.002333) / (1 + 0.002333) ≈ (0.997667) / (1.002333) ≈ 0.99537.

Taking the square root: sqrt(0.99537) ≈ approximately 0.99768.

So T2 / T1 ≈ 0.99768.

Which means T1 ≈ T2 / 0.99768 ≈ T2 * 1.00234.

So the temperature difference is small, but not zero.

So now, the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

The problem says that Star_1 has radius R1 = 1.5 R2, and mass 1.5 M2. But since the question is about luminosity, the mass probably isn't relevant here unless it's a red herring
