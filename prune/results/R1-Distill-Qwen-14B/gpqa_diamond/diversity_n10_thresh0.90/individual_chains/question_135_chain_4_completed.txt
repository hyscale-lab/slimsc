Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by the Lagrangian L(y) = -λfψ̄f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm not entirely sure what the exact form means, but I think it's a Yukawa interaction term. So the boson X couples to fermions with some coupling constant λ, and there's a vacuum expectation value υ involved. Wait, but in the standard model, the Higgs field has a vev, and that gives masses to fermions. So maybe X is something similar, like maybe a heavy Higgs or another scalar boson.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. Oh wait, that's kind of a heavy boson. Wait, the Higgs is about 125 GeV, so X is half its mass. But maybe it's a different particle. Anyway, the question is about the possible decay channels of X at the lowest order.

At lowest order, the decays would be the tree-level processes. So X would decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The possible decay products depend on the mass of X and the masses of the fermions it can couple to.

The Lagrangian term is similar to Yukawa coupling, so X couples to fermions with a mass term. So the mass of the fermion must be less than or equal to X's mass divided by 2, because in decay X → ff̄, each fermion would carry away some energy, but for the decay to be allowed, the sum of the fermion masses must be less than X's mass.

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. The rest mass of each fermion must be less than X's mass. Because in the rest frame of X, the fermions can have any energy up to X's mass. Oh wait no, the maximum mass allowed for each fermion in the decay X → ff̄ is when they are at rest, meaning each has mass ≤ X's mass. But wait, the sum of their rest masses must be less than X's mass, because in the decay, the energy must be enough to create both particles. So for a spin-0 boson decaying into fermions, each fermion must have mass less than (X mass)/2. Because if each has mass m, then 2m ≤ M_X. So m ≤ M_X/2.

Wait, M_X is 6 GeV. So M_X/2 is 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be decay products.

But wait, looking at known fermion masses. Let me think: the top quark is around 173 GeV, way too heavy. So it's out. The bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV, so also out. The charm quark is about 1.2-1.5 GeV, which is under 3 GeV. Similarly, the strange quark is about 95-100 MeV, so way under. The up and down quarks are even lighter, around 2-5 MeV. Then, the tau lepton is about 1.78 GeV, which is under 3 GeV. The muon is about 0.1 GeV, and the electron is 0.0005 GeV.

Wait, but wait. The fermion masses in the standard model are in the context of their Yukawa couplings. But in this problem, the interaction is given, so perhaps X couples to all the fermions, regardless of their Yukawa couplings? Or maybe the Yukawa coupling is such that it can interact with all of them.

Wait, the Lagrangian is L = -λf ψ̄f (v + X) ψf. So the interaction term is proportional to X ψ̄ ψ. So X couples to all fermions f. So for any fermion f where the coupling λf is non-zero, X can decay into f f̄.

But fermions have different masses, so the decay kinematics depend on whether their rest mass is less than M_X/2.

Wait, but also, for a decay to be allowed, the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. Because, in the rest frame of X, the fermions must have enough energy to be created. So the combined rest mass of the two fermions must be less than X's mass. But wait, for a spin-0 boson decaying into two particles, the condition is that each particle's rest mass must be ≤ M_X/2.

Wait, let me think. The conservation of four-momentum: when X is at rest, the two fermions must have equal and opposite momenta. The minimal energy they need is when they are produced at rest, which would require their masses to satisfy 2m <= M_X. So each fermion's mass must be <= M_X / 2. So for M_X =6 GeV, each fermion must have m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So let me list the fermion masses:

Electron: negligible, ~0.0005 GeV → allowed.

Muon: ~0.105 GeV → allowed.

Tau: ~1.78 GeV → allowed.

Quarks:

Up: ~2 MeV → allowed.

Down: ~4-5 MeV → allowed.

Strange: ~95 MeV → allowed.

Charm: ~1.2-1.5 GeV → allowed.

Bottom: ~4.5 GeV → M_X is 6 GeV. So M_X/2 is 3 GeV. 4.5 > 3, so bottom quark is too heavy.

Top: way too heavy, but it's already way beyond.

So X can decay into any fermion pair where m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So the possible decay pairs are:

e+ e-

mu+ mu-

tau+ tau-

u ū

d d̄

s s̄

c c̄

Wait, but what about the charm quark? m_c is about 1.3 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV, so it's allowed. So X can decay into c c̄.

But wait, the options given in the multiple-choice don't all include c c̄.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, e+ e-

But wait, the b quark is 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV, so X can't decay into b b̄. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

So that includes c c̄, which is allowed. The tau is allowed, mu and e as well. So this set is possible.

Option C: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

Wait, the top quark is way too heavy. So this option includes t t̄, which is impossible because m_t is about 173 GeV, which is way above 3 GeV. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

Again, b quark is too heavy. So only option B has the correct fermions.

Wait, but wait. Let me check all the masses again.

Charm quark mass: yes, about 1.5 GeV. So 1.5 < 3 GeV → allowed.

So in the Lagrangian, does X couple to all these fermions? The problem statement says the interaction is given, so X can decay to any of them as long as the mass condition is satisfied.

So the possible decay modes are e+ e-; mu+ mu-; tau+ tau-; u ū; d d̄; s s̄; c c̄.

So which option includes all these? Option B has all except the top, which isn't present. So option B is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. The tau is about 1.78 GeV, so yes, allowed. The muon is 0.105 GeV, allowed. Electron is allowed.

So the correct decay channels are c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Looking at the options, option B includes all those.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction term in the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) \left(\upsilon + X(y)\right) \psi_f(y).
\]

This indicates that \( X \) couples to fermions via a Yukawa-like interaction. The decay products of \( X \) depend on the masses of the fermions it can couple to. For \( X \to f\bar{f} \), the fermion mass \( m_f \) must satisfy \( m_f \leq M_X/2 \), where \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Thus, \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses and Allowed Decays:
- **Electron (\( e \)):** \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Muon (\( \mu \)):** \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Tau (\( \tau \)):** \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Up quark (\( u \)):** \( m_u \approx 2 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
- **Down quark (\( d \)):** \( m_d \approx 4-5 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
- **Strange quark (\( s \)):** \( m_s \approx 95 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
- **Charm quark (\( c \)):** \( m_c \approx 1.2-1.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- **Bottom quark (\( b \)):** \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).
- **Top quark (\( t \)):** \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( m_t \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).

Thus, the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are:

\[
X \to e^+e^-, \, \mu^+\mu^-, \, \tau^+\tau^-, \, u\bar{u}, \, d\bar{d}, \, s\bar{s}, \, c\bar{c}.
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect.**
- **Option B:** Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Correct.**
- **Option C:** Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( m_t \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect.**
- **Option D:** Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect.**

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.

**Answer: B**
