Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So, the question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet, both similar to Neptune in mass. The planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected them by looking at the Doppler shift of spectral lines. 

Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula I think is something like v = (G * M * P) / (2 * π * (M + m)^something), but wait, since the planet mass is much smaller than the star, M + m is approximately M, the star's mass. So maybe it's v = ( (G * M)^(1/3) ) * (P) ) ... no, wait, let me get the right formula.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * (M_p)^3 ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/ (P * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) )) 

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formulas. Alternatively, I recall that for the same star mass, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so the denominator becomes 1.

Wait, but in the question, both planets have the same mass, similar to Neptune. So M_p is the same for both. The stars are same mass as Sun, so M_star is same for both. So M_star >> M_p, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) times some function of the orbital period.

Wait, I think I need to find the relationship between K and the orbital period P. Let me think about the formula again. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) )^(1/3) * ( sin i )

But since e=0 and M_star >> M_p, this simplifies. Let me write it more accurately.

The formula is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(P)) )^(1/3) * (2π / (c * sqrt(1 - e²)) )) )

Wait, maybe I should look for the relation between K and P. Alternatively, another way to think: the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the star's velocity due to the planet. The star's velocity is given by:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )^(1/ (P)^(1/3) ) )

But perhaps a better approach is to use the more precise formula.

Wait, the correct formula is:

K = [ (G * M_p^3 ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( sin i )

Since e=0, sin i is approximately 1 (assuming edge-on orbit, which is the case for maximum RV signal), so it's just K = [ ( G M_p³ ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 P ) ]^(1/3)

But because M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So,

K ≈ [ ( G M_p³ ) / ( M_star² P ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify that expression:

K ≈ ( G^(1/3) M_p (M_p^2)^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps better to write exponents:

K ≈ ( G M_p³ )^(1/3) / [ ( M_star² P )^(1/3) ) ]

Which is same as:

K ≈ ( G^(1/3) M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

So, K is proportional to (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Since M_p is same for both planets, and M_star is same for both stars, the ratio K1 / K2 would be (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, wait. Let's think about it. Let's denote:

K1 = [ (G M_p^3) / ( M_star^2 P1 ) ]^(1/3 )

Similarly,

K2 = [ (G M_p^3) / ( M_star^2 P2 ) ]^(1/3 )

So, K1 = ( G M_p^3 / (M_star^2 P1) )^(1/3 )

Similarly for K2. Taking the ratio K1/K2:

K1 / K2 = [ ( G M_p^3 / (M_star^2 P1) ) / ( G M_p^3 / (M_star^2 P2) ) ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify inside the brackets:

The G, M_p^3, and M_star^2 terms cancel out, leaving ( P2 / P1 )

So,

K1/K2 = ( (P2 / P1) )^(1/3 )

Wait, but wait: [ ( ... ) ]^(1/3 )

So,

K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3 )

Alternatively, (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1

Wait, let me make sure. Let me compute the ratio inside the cube root:

[ ( (1/P1) ) /
