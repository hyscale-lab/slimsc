Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's read the problem again.

We've got 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in the same conditions. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. When they measured the positions, all the particles were between x=1 and x=3. So the question is to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, right. I remember that the wave function needs to be normalized for probabilities. So the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function over all space should be 1. Oh wait, but in this case, the wave function is given, and the particles are only found in a specific region, so maybe the wave function is already normalized there.

Wait, the wave function is ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But wait, that seems a bit odd because wave functions usually have real and imaginary parts, but I think the modulus squared would involve both. Oh right, the modulus squared is |ψ|^2 = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2, since the imaginary part is 0.5i. So the total probability is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ|² dx equals 1.

Wait, but the wave function is given, and the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, so I think the wave function must be zero outside that interval. So the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

So let's write that out. The probability is the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 ] dx = 1.

Wait, wait a second. Let me think. The wave function is ψ(x) = [ a / sqrt(1+x) ) ] - 0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5.

So the square of the absolute value is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. So the integral of that from x=1 to x=3 must be 1.

So setting up the integral:

∫₁³ [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Now, let's split the integral into two parts:

a² ∫₁³ (1/(1+x)) dx + 0.25 ∫₁³ dx = 1.

Compute each integral separately.

First, ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3. The antiderivative is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

Second integral: ∫ dx from 1 to 3 is 2, since 3-1=2.

So putting it back:

a² * ln(2) + 0.25 * 2 = 1.

Which simplifies to:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides:

a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a squared is about 0.7213, so a is the square root of that. Let me calculate sqrt(0.7213).

What's sqrt(0.72)? Well, 0.8^2 is 0.64, 0.85^2 is 0.7225. Oh wait, 0.85 squared is 0.7225, which is just about 0.7213. So a is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that should be the answer.


To solve the problem, we start by noting that the wave function must be normalized, meaning the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function over the region where the particle exists (x=1 to x=3) must equal 1. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The absolute square of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx + 0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 1
\]

1. Compute the first integral:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_1^3 = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2) \approx 0.6931
\]

2. Compute the second integral:

\[
\int_1^3 dx = 3 - 1 = 2
\]

Substituting these results back, the equation becomes:

\[
a^2 \cdot \ln(2) + 0.25 \cdot 2 = 1
\]

Simplify:

\[
a^2 \cdot \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Subtract 0.5 from both sides:

\[
a^2 \cdot \ln(2) = 0.5
\]

Solve for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)} \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Take the square root to find \(a\):

\[
a = \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \(a\) is approximately 0.85, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
