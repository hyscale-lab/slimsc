Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should choose that one. Let me think through this step by step.

Both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, shorter period means it's closer to its star, right? Because according to Kepler's laws, the closer a planet is to its star, the shorter the orbital period.

The host stars have the same radii but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But since both stars have the same radius, that's interesting. Oh wait, more massive stars can have larger radii, but here they're the same. So maybe the stars are in different stages of evolution. Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but their radii are the same.

Transit probability depends on the planet's orbital distance and the star's size. The probability is higher when the planet's orbit is more edge-on relative to our line of sight. But another factor is the size of the planet relative to the star and the distance of the orbit, which affects the chance of the planet passing in front of the star.

Wait, the probability of a transit is given by the formula (R_p / a)^2 * ( (R_*) / a )^(-1) ? Or maybe I'm mixing things up. I think the main formula for the transit probability is (R_p / R_*)^2 multiplied by the probability that the orbital plane is aligned such that the planet transits. The latter part depends on the star's radius and the planet's orbital distance. Wait, no, I think the main factor for the alignment is the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the geometric probability of a transit is given by (R_* + R_p) / a, where R_* is the star's radius, R_p is planet radius, and a is the orbital distance. But wait, actually, I think it's approximately (R_* / a) because R_p is much smaller than R_*. So the transit probability increases when a is smaller because the denominator is smaller, making the whole fraction larger. But wait, if a is smaller, the planet is closer, right? So a higher probability.

Wait, let me get this right. The probability P is proportional to (R_* / a). Because the planet has to pass in front of the star, and the area that allows that is like the star's radius over the distance. So if a is smaller, the probability is higher.

So for each planet, P = (R_* / a). But wait, actually, I remember that the geometric probability is (R_* / a) multiplied by some factor, maybe square it or something. Or maybe it's (R_* / a) squared? No, I might be confusing. Let me think again. The probability of transit is the ratio of the star's radius plus planet's radius to the orbital distance. But since the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, we can approximate it as R_* / (a). So the transit probability is directly proportional to R_* / a.

So for each planet, we have to calculate R_* / a, and whichever is larger will have a higher probability.

Now, the question is, what's a for each planet? a is the semi-major axis, which can be found using Kepler's third law. The period and the mass of the star are given, so we can find a.

Kepler's third law formula: P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, we can approximate M + m ≈ M. So P² = (4π² / (G M)) * a³. Rearranging, a³ = (G M P²)/(4π²), so a = [ (G M P²) / (4π²) ]^(1/3)

But since G, π are constants, and for each planet we can compute a relative to each other.

Wait, but since both planets have same masses, but different periods and different host star masses. Let's compute the ratio a1 / a2.

Let me denote planet 1 as P1 and planet 2 as P2.

For P1: M1 = 2 M2 (because M1 is twice M2), P1 = P2 /3.

Compute a1 in terms of a2.

a1^3 / a2^3 = [ (M2) / (M1) ) * (P1^2) / (P2^2) ) ] 

Wait, let me think in terms of a proportional.

Using Kepler's third law:

a³ ∝ (M_star) ^ (-1) * P²

So a1³ / a2³ = (M2 / M1) * (P1² / P2² )

But M1 = 2 M2, so M2/M1 = 1/2.

P1 = (1/3) P2, so P1² = (1/9) P2².

So a1³/a2³ = (1/2) * (1/9) ) = 1/18.

So a1 = a2 * (1/18)^(1/3)

The cube root of 1/18 is (18)^(-1/3). Let me compute that.

18 is 2 * 3². So 18^(1/3) is approximately 2.6207. So 1/18^(1/3) ≈ 0.381.

So a1 ≈ 0.381 * a2.

So a1 is about 0.38 times a2. So a1 is smaller than a2.

Now, the transit probability is proportional to R_* / a.

But both stars have the same radius, R_*. So for each planet, P1 is R_* / a1, and P2 is R_* / a2.

Thus, P1 = R*/a1 = R* / (0.381 a2) ≈ (R* / a2) * 2.623.

Wait, because 1/0.381 is approximately 2.623.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is about 2.623 times that of Planet_2.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute the exact ratio.

Compute (R_*/a1) / (R_*/a2) = a2 / a1 = a2 / (0.381 a2) ) = 1 / 0.381 ≈ 2.623.

So the probability for P1 is about 2.62 times higher than that of P2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability to transit.

But wait, wait, wait. Wait, the probability is proportional to R_* / a. So if a is smaller, R_*/a is larger, so higher probability.

So since a1 is smaller, R_*/a1 is larger.

So Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting.

So the researchers should prefer observing Planet_1.

But wait, let me check the options.

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says ~2.7 times. Hmm, wait, 2.62 is close to 2.7, which is option D.

So why is that?

Wait, let me re-calculate a1/a2.

We had a1³ = (M2 / M1) * (P1² / P2²) * a2³.

M1 = 2 M2 => M2/M1 = 1/2.

P1 = P2/3 => P1² = P2²/9.

So a1³ = (1/2) * (1/9) * a2³ = (1/18) a2³.

So a1 = a2 * (1/18)^(1/3) = a2 * (18)^(-1/3).

Cube root of 18 is approximately 2.6207, so 18^(-1/3) is ~0.381.

So a1 is 0.381 a2.

So R_*/a1 = (R_*/a2) * (1/0.381) = (R_*/a2) * 2.623.

So the ratio of probabilities P1/P2 is 2.623.

So approximately 2.6 times higher.

Looking at the options, option D says 2.7 times, which is close. Option C is 1.65, which is less.

So the correct answer would be D, choosing Planet_1 because it has a ~2.7 times higher probability.

Wait, but let me think again. Are there any other factors I might have missed?

Wait, the transit probability also depends on the inclination of the planet's orbit relative to our line of sight. But the RV method already gives us the minimum mass, which tells us about the sin of the inclination. But in terms of the actual geometric probability, the RV method doesn't provide the exact inclination. Because the RV method can't determine the inclination directly—it can only give a minimum mass. So for the transit method, the geometric probability is as I computed earlier, but the RV method tells us that the planet is at least a certain mass, but doesn't inform the transit probability beyond what's given by the orbital period and star mass.

Wait, but the question says that both planets have already been detected via RV, so the inclination is known to some extent. Because from RV, you can get the velocity semi-amplitude, which depends on sin(i), where i is the inclination. But without knowing i, you can't get the exact mass, only the minimum mass. But if the planet is detected via RV, it's possible that the inclination is close to 90 degrees (edge-on), which would maximize the RV signal. Wait, no, the RV method is sensitive to the component of the velocity along our line of sight, so higher inclination (closer to 90 degrees) leads to higher RV signal, hence higher measured velocity semi-amplitude.

Wait, but the actual inclination is not known exactly from RV—it just gives a lower limit on the mass. So for the purpose of calculating the transit probability, which is purely a function of a and R*, the RV detection doesn't affect it. Because even if the planet's orbit is edge-on, which would give a higher RV measurement, the probability of transit is still a geometric factor based on the star's size and the planet's orbital distance.

So the conclusion remains the same: since a1 is smaller, R_*/a1 is larger, so transit probability is higher for Planet_1.

So the correct answer should be D, because Planet_1 has a higher probability, about 2.7 times higher.

Wait, but let me make sure about the calculation.

Compute a1/a2 = (M2/(2 M2))^(1/3) * (P1^2/(P2^2))^(1/3)

Because a ∝ (M)^(-1/3) * P^(2/3)

So a ratio a1/a2 = [ (M2/(2 M2)) * ( (P1^2)/(P2^2) ) ]^(1/3)

Which is ( (1/2) * (1/3^2) )^(1/3) ) = ( (1/2) * (1/9) )^(1/3) ) = (1/18)^(1/3) ≈ 0.380.

So a1 = 0.38 a2.

Thus, R*/a1 = R*/(0.38 a2) ≈ 2.63 (R*/a2).

Which is approximately 2.63 times higher probability for Planet_1.

Looking at the options, option D says ~2.7 times, which is the closest. So the answer must be D.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the star's radius and \( a \) is the planet's orbital distance. Since both stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the key factor is the ratio \( \frac{1}{a} \), meaning a smaller \( a \) corresponds to a higher transit probability.

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto \frac{P^2}{M_*} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period and \( M_* \) is the star's mass, we calculate the relative semi-major axes of Planet_1 and Planet_2. For Planet_1, the host star's mass is twice that of Planet_2's host star (\( M_1 = 2M_2 \)), and the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter (\( P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2 \)).

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{M_2 / M_1}{P_1^2 / P_2^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{1/2}{(1/3)^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{1/2}{1/9} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{9}{2} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.381.
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.381a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's orbital distance is smaller than Planet_2's. Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), the ratio of the transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{0.381} \approx 2.623.
\]

This indicates that Planet_1 has approximately 2.6 times higher transit probability than Planet_2. Among the options, the closest value is 2.7 times, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
