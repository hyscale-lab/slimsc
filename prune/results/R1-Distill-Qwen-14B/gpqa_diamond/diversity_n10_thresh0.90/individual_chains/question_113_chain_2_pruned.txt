Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The compound's formula is among four options: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

Alright, let's break down each piece of data.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches. A broad peak could be from an alcohol (maybe like an -OH group) or maybe a carbonyl with hydrogen bonding, but wait, the other peaks are at 1700 and 1650. Those are important too. 1700 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl group like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. The 1650 might be another carbonyl, maybe an conjugated one, or maybe an aromatic ring with some sort of substitution. Alternatively, maybe an amide, but I don't see any nitrogen in the options, so probably not that.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the Hs on a double bond, like in an alkene. So that suggests the compound has an alkene group. So, maybe something like an ester with a double bond nearby, or perhaps a ketone with a double bond.

Then, the Mass Spec shows a fragment at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let me think. 45 is the molecular weight of CH3OCH2CH2? No, wait. Wait, 45 is often a carbonyl fragment. For example, maybe a CH3CO+ ion, which is 43? Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene ion or another type. Oh, wait, the molecular formula could give a clue. Let me think about the options.

Options are:
A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation for each.

Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since no X or N here, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

For each option:

Option A: C6H12O2 → DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So one ring or double bond or two double bonds, etc.

Option B: C6H10O → (14-10)/2 =2. So two rings or a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2 → (14 -10)/2=2. So same as B, two DoU.

Option D: C6H12O → (14-12)/2=1. One DoU.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond. So the compound has at least one double bond. So the DoU should be at least one. All options except maybe have that.

Wait, the FTIR shows a peak at 1700, which suggests a carbonyl group. So each of these compounds must have a carbonyl. Let's think about what each option could be.

Looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. That could be something like an ester (RCOOR'), which has two oxygen-containing groups. Since IR shows a carbonyl, that fits. Esters have carbonyls around 1700-1750 cm^-1. Also, if it's an ester, perhaps with an alkene, that explains the vinyl Hs.

Option B: C6H10O. That's a six-carbon with one oxygen. It could be a ketone (RCOR') but with one oxygen. If it's a ketone, the IR would have a peak around 1700. But where's the other oxygen? Wait, the FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an O-H group. So if the compound has both a carbonyl and an O-H, that points to a structure with two oxygen-containing groups. So option B (which has only one O) might not fit because the IR shows a broad peak (O-H) and a carbonyl. So that would require two O's, so option B is probably out.

Option C: C6H10O2. That has two oxygen atoms. So could be an ester, which would have O-C-O. Or maybe a ketone and an alcohol? Or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, a carboxylic acid would have a very strong O-H stretch, usually broad around 2500-3300. But the IR here shows a broad peak around 3000. Also, a carboxylic acid would have a carbonyl around 1700, which is covered. The other peak at 1650 might be the O-H bend, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl or something else.

Option D: C6H12O. So one oxygen. But again, the IR shows both O-H and carbonyl, which would require two O's. So D is out because it only has one O.

So now, possible options are A and C.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation is 1. So one ring or one double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond. So if DoU is 1, that would mean one double bond. So perhaps an ester with a double bond, like methyl vinyl ester or something.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation is 2. So either two double bonds, or a ring plus a double bond, or two rings. But if there's a double bond (as indicated by the vinyl Hs), and a carbonyl, that's two DoU. So that could be possible.

Wait, let's think about the IR. Two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, another possibility is that one is a carbonyl and the other could be an aromatic ring (like C=C). But in the NMR, they see vinyl Hs, so maybe an alkene. So perhaps the 1650 is from conjugated double bonds, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

So if the compound has an ester group (so O=C-O-) and an alkene, that fits with the IR and NMR. So that would be something like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, something like CH2=CHCOO-R. The ester group would have a carbonyl around 1700, and the conjugated double bond (alpha,beta) would have a C=C absorption around 1650.

So the structure would have both an ester and an alkene. So the formula would need to have six carbons, with two oxygen atoms. Let's see.

So for an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, the general formula is like CH2=CHCOOR. Let's see, for example, let's take methyl acrylate: CH2=CHCOOCH3. Its formula is C4H6O2. But our options have C6H... so perhaps a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester with a vinyl group. For example, something like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, but that's more carbons.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3, but that would be C6H10O2. Let's count: CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3 has 6 carbons: CH2=CH (2) + CH2COO (3) + CH2CH3 (2 more?) Wait, no, wait. Let me see: The structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CO-O-CH2CH3. So that's 2 (from CH2=CH) + 1 (CH2) + 2 (COO) + 2 (CH2CH3) → Wait, no. Let me count each carbon: The first group is CH2=CH (2 carbons), then CH2 (1), COO (2, but wait, COO is one O, no, the COO is two oxygen, but it's one C each. So COO is two carbons: the carbonyl C and the O connected to another C (the ester O). So in the ester part, it's R-O-CO-R'. So in the example I gave, the R is CH2CH2CH3? Wait, perhaps I should consider the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester, but that's a different structure.

But maybe the molecular formula of the compound is C6H10O2. That would match option C. Let's check, for C6H10O2, the molecular weight is (6*12) + (10*1) + (2*16) → 72 +10 +32=114 g/mol.

Wait, but the mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z=45. Let me think about possible fragments.

Option C is C6H10O2. Let's imagine it's something like methyl vinyl ester. Wait, what would the fragmentation look like? If it's something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 (but wait, that's more than six carbons). Alternatively, perhaps the ester is something more compact.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like an aromatic compound. Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl Hs, not aromatic. So it's an alkene, not benzene.

Wait, another approach: the m/z=45. 45 is the molecular weight of CH3COO- (which is 45: 12+1+12+16+16= 63? Wait, no. Wait, molecular weight of CH3COO- is (12*2)+(1*4)+(16*2) = 24 +4 +32 =60. Hmm, that's not 45. Wait, 45 is 45 amu; what has that molecular weight?

Wait, 45 is (assuming it's CH2O) 12+2+16=30. No, that's not it. Wait, 45 could be (maybe) HCOOCH3, which is methyl formate: HCOOCH3, which has a molecular weight of 12*2 (from two COO groups?) Wait, no. HCOOCH3 is HCO-O-CH3. The molecular formula is C2H4O2. Its molecular weight is (2*12) + (4*1) + (2*16)=24 +4 +32=60. Not 45.

Hmm, maybe the fragment is (CH3)2COH+? No, that would be 59 (2*12 + 3*1 + 16 + 1= 24+3+16+1=44? No, 2*12=24, 3*1=3, 16(O), H is 1. 24+3=27, 27+16=43, 43+1=44. Close but not 45.

Alternatively, maybe it's an acylium ion or something else. Or perhaps the fragment is at m/z=45 corresponds to a CH3CO+ group, but wait, CH3CO+ is (12*2)+(1*3) =24+3=27, plus O (16) would be 43. No, that's 43, not 45. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: 45 could be the loss of a fragment from the main molecule. Let's see. Suppose the compound is an ester with an alkene. For example, if it's an ester like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3, which is methyl acrylate. Its molecular formula is C4H6O2. Wait, but our options are C6H... something. So perhaps the compound is a di-ester or a longer chain.

Wait, alternative thought: m/z=45 could be an aldehyde group. Wait, aldehyde would be more like CH3CHO, which has a molecular weight of 44 (12*2 + 1*4 + 16 = 24 +4 +16=44). So maybe the fragment is CH3CHO+ or something like that. But not sure.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the molecular formula is C6H10O2. So the molecular weight is 6*12=72, 10 H is 10, O2 is 32. So total 72+10+32=114. So the molecular ion would be at m/z=114. But the question is about a fragment. So what's the fragment at 45.

Wait, 45 is 45, and 114-45=69. So if the molecular ion is at 114, and a fragment breaks off a 45, then the remaining would be 69. But what would make a 45 fragment in an ester with a double bond?

Alternatively, maybe the compound is something like cyclohexene with an ester group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from the ester group. For example, the ester could break into a carbonyl and an alkyl group. Let me think, the ester: R-O-CO-O-R', but that's not the structure. Wait, no. Esters are R-O-CO-R'. So during fragmentation, the ester could cleave. If the ester breaks at the carbonyl, then the carbonyl group (COO-) could combine with an adjacent R group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester group could form a fragment like CH3COO+, which is m/z=45? Let me calculate: CH3COO+ has (12*2) + (3*1) + (16*2) = 24 +3 +32=59. No, that's not 45. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the fragment is from the alkenyl part. If the compound has a CH2=CHCOOR group, perhaps the breaking occurs between the double bond and the carbonyl. For example, the fragment could be CH2=CHCOO+ (CH2=CHCOO has molecular weight 72 (from C3H4O2: 3*12=36, H4=4, O2=32 → 36+4=40+32=72. No, that's 72, which doesn't match 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is the acylium ion. Wait, acylium ion would be R-CO+. For example, CH2=CHCOO-R could lose the R-O- part, leaving CH2=CHCO+ which is 59 (CH2=CHCO is C3H4O: 36 +4 +16=56? Wait, CH2=CHCO is (2 C from CH2, 1 from CO) → 3 C. So 3*12 =36, 4 H, 1 O: 36+4=40 +16=56. So 56. But the fragment is at 45.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the m/z=45 is the molecular ion of a smaller fragment. Let's consider the possible structure.

Looking back, the FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an O-H group. So the compound has both an O-H and a carbonyl. That would mean the structure has two oxygen-containing groups. So perhaps it's an ester with an alcohol, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, a hemiacetal or something else. Wait, no, hemiacetals have more oxygen.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a beta-keto ester. Beta-keto esters have two carbonyl groups. The IR would then show two strong peaks. For example, a structure like CH2=C(COOR)COOR. Hmm, but perhaps that's overcomplicating.

Wait, the IR has two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is likely a carbonyl, and 1650 might be an aromatic ring or conjugated double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl Hs, so it's an alkene, not an aromatic ring. So the 1650 peak is from the alkene conjugated to the carbonyl. So that makes sense for an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

Now, considering the options.

Option A is C6H12O2. Degree of unsaturation is (2*6+2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU. So one ring or one double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl Hs, so a double bond. So the structure must have a double bond. But with a DoU of 1, that would mean the rest is a single bond structure. So perhaps an ester with a double bond and no rings.

Option C is C6H10O2 → DoU= (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. Could be a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds. But with a vinyl group, that suggests at least one double bond. So perhaps another double bond elsewhere, or a ring. But the NMR doesn't indicate a ring, only vinyl Hs.

So, if the compound has a double bond (DoU 1) and a carbonyl (another DoU), that would make two DoU, which is option C.

So, if option C is C6H10O2, with two DoU, which could be a double bond and a carbonyl.

But wait, the mass spec shows a fragment at m/z=45. Let me think about the possible structure and its fragments.

Suppose the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester: something like CH2=CHCOOR. Let's say it's CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, but that would be C6H10O2. Let's count: CH2=CH (2 C), COO (2 C), and CH2CH2CH3 (3 C?), but wait that's 2+2+3=7 C, which is more than 6. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. That's C5H10O2. No, but we have C6. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is propyl something.

Wait, maybe the structure is cyclopentene with an ester group? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an ester with a vinyl group, like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, but that would be C6H10O2. Let me count. CH2=CHCOO is 4 carbons, and then CH2CH2CH3 is 3, but that's 7 carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond, but that's a different scenario.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a di-ester, but that would complicate things.

Wait, perhaps it's more straightforward with the mass spec. The fragment at m/z=45. What if the fragment is a (CH3)2CO+ ion, which is 58? No, that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe a CH2O group, which is formaldehyde, but that's 30. Hmm.

Wait, 45 could be a fragment from the ester cleavage. For example, in an ester, the oxygen might cleave, leading to two fragments. If the ester is RCOOR', during fragmentation, it could break into RCO+ and R'O- or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps the R' group is a CH2CH2CH3, and the R part is a CH2=CHCOO-.

Wait, not sure. Maybe the ester group (O-CO-O) breaks. Alternatively, perhaps the ester breaks into a smaller fragment.

Wait, another approach: the molecular ion is at m/z=114 (if the formula is C6H10O2, 6*12=72, 10*1=10, 2*16=32 → 72+10=82+32=114). So the molecular ion is 114. If the fragment is at 45, then 114-45=69. So the remaining part would be 69. What's 69? Let's see: 69 is C3H7O (3*12=36 +7=43 +16=59 → no, that's 59). Alternatively, 69 could be C3H3F (but fluorine isn't in the options). Hmm, perhaps 69 is C4H9 (57), but no. Alternatively, 69 could be C5H11 (69: 5*12=60 +11=71 → no). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is not from losing a 45, but perhaps the 45 is a major fragment. For example, the ester group could break off as a fragment. For instance, if the ester is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, the ester part (COOCH2CH2CH3) has a molecular weight of (12+16*2 + (3*12 + 6*1)) → wait, COOCH2CH2CH3 is (COO is 44) plus CH2CH2CH3 (58? No, wait: CH2CH2CH3 is propane: C3H7, which is 3*12 +7= 43. So COOCH2CH2CH3 would be 44 +43=87? That doesn't match 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the acyl group. For example, if the ester breaks to form the acyl cation, like CH2=CHCO+ (which is 59 as earlier). Hmm, not 45.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the fragment is a simple ketone, like (CH3)2CO, which is 59 again. Not 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is the methyl group attached to the ester. For example, if the ester is methyl something, then the fragment could be CH3+ (15) or maybe OCH3 (which is 31). Hmm, not matching 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is from the vinyl group. For example, CH2=CH-CO-O-R could lose the R-O-CO part, leaving CH2=CH+ which is 28. Not 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a larger unit. Let's think: 45 is 45, which could be C3H7O or something. Wait, 45: C=3 → 3*12=36, H
