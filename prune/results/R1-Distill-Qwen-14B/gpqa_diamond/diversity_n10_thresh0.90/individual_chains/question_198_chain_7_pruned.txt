Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about coordination complexes and stability constants. I remember that stability constants (β) are involved in determining the concentration of metal complexes in solution, but I'm not entirely clear on the details. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The β values given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I'm supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, first, I need to understand what these β values represent. Stability constants, right. They measure the stability of a complex in solution. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, βn is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex with n SCN- ligands.

The general reaction for the nth complex would be:
Co(SCN)_n^2+ ↔ Co^(2+) + n SCN^-

Wait, no, actually, the formation equation for each complex. For example, the first complex (n=1) would be:
Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ CoSCN^2+; β1 = [CoSCN^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-])

Similarly, for n=2:
CoSCN^2+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_2^2+; β2 = [Co(SCN)_2^2+]/([CoSCN^2+][SCN^-])

Wait, but that's the stepwise formation. Alternatively, the overall formation from Co^2+ to the complex would involve the product of the stepwise βs. Oh, wait, the β given is the overall stability constant for each complex. Or maybe each βn is the cumulative one. Wait, the problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So, I think each β represents the cumulative constant for the complex with n ligands. So, β1 is the constant for [Co(SCN)]^2+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, and so on up to β4.

Wait, but sometimes stability constants can be stepwise or cumulative. Stepwise is the constant for adding one ligand, and cumulative is the product up to that point. The question says "stability constants," but without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. Oh, but the way the problem is framed, I think each βn is the cumulative constant for the complex with n ligands. So, β1 is for [CoSCN]^2+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, etc.

So, the complexes are Co^2+ (n=0), [CoSCN]^2+ (n=1), [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ (n=2), [Co(SCN)_3]^2+ (n=3), and maybe [Co(SCN)_4]^2+ (n=4). Wait, but the β4 is 16. So, perhaps the complexes are up to n=4, but the β values are for each step. Alternatively, β1 is the first step, β2 is the second step, etc. But I'm a bit confused now. Alternatively, perhaps the β values are the sequential (stepwise) formation constants. So, β1 is K1 = [CoSCN^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]), β2 is K2 = [Co(SCN)_2^2+]/([CoSCN^2+][SCN^-]), and so on. Then, the overall βn for the nth complex would be the product of K1 to Kn.

Wait, but the question says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thi
