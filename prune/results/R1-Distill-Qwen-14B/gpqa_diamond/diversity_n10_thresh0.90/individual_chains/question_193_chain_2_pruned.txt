Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question again carefully.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the power of 5. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Hmm, right. I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relationship. 

Wait, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star due to the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that distance d (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by the parallax (d = 1/plx). So, plx is inversely proportional to distance. Oh, right, because closer stars have larger parallaxes. So, if plx increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

So, if N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/d, substituting that in might help. Let me write that down.

N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 → N ∝ (d)^5, because plx = 1/d. Wait, let me think again. If plx is 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So 1/(plx)^5 is (d)^5. So N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars is proportional to the fifth power of the distance.

But wait, the question is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. Oh, I think "per unit range" refers to the rate at which the number of stars increases or decreases as you move a certain distance. So, like, the derivative of N with respect to r.

So, if N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr would be 5*d^4. But wait, what's d in this context? Oh, wait, d is the distance. So, for each unit change in r (distance), how does N change? Or is it the density of stars as a function of distance?

Wait, maybe another approach. The number of stars observed in a region is proportional to the volume of space you're looking at, but also considering how many stars are present per unit volume. But I'm not sure if that's the right angle here. Alternatively, perhaps the question is more
