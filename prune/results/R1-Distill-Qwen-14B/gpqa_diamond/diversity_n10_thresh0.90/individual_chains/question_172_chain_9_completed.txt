Okay, so I've got this question about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my studies that in stellar atmospheres, under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation of atoms can be described by the Boltzmann equation. 

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Wait, no, actually, the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level. Oh wait, no, wait, the description says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So the number of excited atoms in a specific energy level is higher in star_1 compared to star_2. Right, so the excitation level is higher.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Hmm, that's a specific value. I think that's the energy difference ΔE. Oh wait, but the key here is about the ratio of the populations in the two levels.

The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The equation is n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE / (k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights. But in this case, the problem is comparing two stars, so maybe it's better to think in terms of each star's conditions.

Wait, each star has its own temperature. So for star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratio would be different. Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and star_2 as R2.

So R1 = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) 
R2 = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

But wait, since the problem states that the same energy difference is considered for both stars, the g factors (statistical weights) are the same for both, right? Because it's the same element, same transition. So the g ratio cancels out when taking the ratio of the populations.

The problem says that in star 1, the excited state is twice as populated as in star 2. Wait, no: wait, the question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2. So maybe the ratio is that R1 = 2 * R2.

Wait, no. Wait, the excitation is the population in the excited state. So if star_1 has twice as many in a specific energy level, perhaps the ratio n1_upper / n1_lower is twice n2_upper / n2_lower. But wait, the problem says that the excited level is twice as populated in star 1. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.

Wait, the question says the iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So perhaps for a particular energy level, the number of atoms in that level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Let's say the level is level E2, and the lower level is E1. So n1(E2) = 2 * n2(E2). But I'm not sure if that's the right way to model it. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is n_upper/n_lower for each star.

Wait, but the problem states that the energy difference between the levels is known, so ΔE = E_upper - E_lower is given. So for each star, the population ratio is determined by the Boltzmann factor.

So, for star_1: n1_upper / n1_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T1))
For star_2: n2_upper / n2_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

But the question says that the amount of excited atoms (n_upper) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Wait, no, not necessarily. The question says that in star_1, the excited level is twice as excited compared to star_2. Wait, perhaps the ratio of n_upper to n_lower is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2? Or maybe the absolute number is twice. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me read the question again.

Wait, the actual statement is: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps for the same energy level, the population in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But that might not make sense because the level's population depends on both temperature and the partition function.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the excited state to the ground state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. That is, (n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower).

Wait, but the ratio n_upper/n_lower is given by the Boltzmann factor. So,

(n_upper / n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So for star_1, (n1_upper/n1_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
For star_2, (n2_upper/n2_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The ratio of these two would be:

( (n1_upper/n1_lower) ) / ( (n2_upper/n2_lower) ) ) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) )

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

The problem states that this ratio is 2 (since star_1 is twice as excited in that level). So:

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = 2

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = ln(2)

Rearranging:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (ln(2) * k ) / ΔE

But let's plug in the numbers. Wait, the problem gives the energy difference as 1.38e-23 J. Hmm, 1.38e-23 is close to k in J/K, because k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, that's exactly the value of Boltzmann's constant.

Ah, so ΔE = 1.38e-23 J = k. So substituting into the equation:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (ln(2) * k ) / k 

Simplifying:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Hmm, but wait, let me make sure. So:

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J = k (1.38e-23 J/K) → So, ΔE = k * (1 J/K / K) → Wait, no, J is kg m²/s². K is Kelvin.

Wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. That's exactly equal to k, because k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So, ΔE = k. So substituting into the equation:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE → [ ln(2) * k ] / k = ln(2)

So 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2)

Wait, but that gives:

1/T2 = 1/T1 + ln(2)

Which can be rewritten as:

1/T2 = 1/T1 + ln(2)

Wait, but wait, let's look at the options. The options are all in terms of T1 and T2, and involve ln(2). Let me see the options:

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1*T2)

Wait, let's see. Let me manipulate the equation.

We have:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2)

That can be written as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Because:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which can be rearranged to ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the correct equation is option D.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps.

The key steps are:

- The ratio of the excitation levels is 2 (n_upper/n_lower) in star_1 compared to star_2.

- Using the Boltzmann equation, the ratio is exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

- So that ratio is 2 → exp(ΔE/(k)(1/T2-1/T1)) = 2 → take ln → ΔE/(k)(1/T2 -1/T1) ) = ln(2)

- Given ΔE = k → so 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2)

- Rearranged → (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 ) = ln(2)

Which matches option D.


The question involves comparing the excitation levels of iron atoms in the photospheres of two stars under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann equation governs the population ratio of two energy levels in such conditions:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right)
\]

For star_1 and star_2, the respective ratios are:

\[
\frac{n_{1,\text{upper}}}{n_{1,\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)
\]
\[
\frac{n_{2,\text{upper}}}{n_{2,\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)
\]

The problem states that the excitation level in star_1 is twice that in star_2, meaning:

\[
\frac{n_{1,\text{upper}}}{n_{1,\text{lower}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2,\text{upper}}}{n_{2,\text{lower}}}
\]

Taking the ratio of the two Boltzmann factors:

\[
\frac{\frac{n_{1,\text{upper}}}{n_{1,\text{lower}}}}{\frac{n_{2,\text{upper}}}{n_{2,\text{lower}}}} = \exp\left(\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right)
\]

Substituting the given ratio of 2:

\[
\exp\left(\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2)
\]

Given that the energy difference is \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), which matches the value of \(k\) (Boltzmann's constant), we simplify:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2)
\]

Rewriting this equation:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2)
\]

This matches the form of option D. The other options do not align with the derived equation.

**Answer: D**
