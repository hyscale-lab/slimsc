Okay, I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory, meaning it's used when some new physics is at a high energy scale, and we're working at lower energies where that new physics is integrated out.

The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. Let me think about each one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, right? Because it's a low-energy effective theory of the Standard Model. So all the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. That means operators have to be Lorentz scalars. So Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like shift in space and time). Wait, but I remember that in effective theories, the operators can have non-zero vacuum expectation values or other things that might break Poincare? Or maybe not. Wait, no. Effective theories still respect Poincare symmetry because they are formulated in the same spacetime. I think all the operators in SMEFT are Poincare-invariant. So Poincare symmetry (2) is also a must.

Wait, but wait. SMEFT is like a low-energy effective theory, so when you expand around a vacuum, maybe the vacuum breaks some symmetries. Or does Poincare symmetry hold regardless of the vacuum? I think Poincare symmetry is a spacetime symmetry, so it's part of the framework. So yes, operators must respect Poincare symmetry.

Now, CP symmetry. CP is Charge conjugation and Parity. The Standard Model isn't CP symmetric because of processes like CP violation in the CKM matrix. But in SMEFT, do the operators have to preserve CP? Hmm. I think SMEFT itself doesn't enforce any of the SM symmetries unless they're built into the operators. Since the SM already has CP violation, SMEFT can have operators that violate CP. Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the SM doesn't respect CP, then SMEFT operators don't have to either. So CP symmetry (3) is not a must.

What about CPT symmetry? CPT is the combination of charge, parity, and time reversal. The Standard Model is CPT symmetric, and I think effective theories like SMEFT also respect CPT. Because any term that violates CPT would lead to serious issues, like acausality or non-unitarity. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry (4).

So now let's recap. Which symmetries must be respected by all SMEFT operators? Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2) must be, because they are part of the framework. CPT (4) must be. CP (3) isn't a must because the SM already violates it, so SMEFT can include operators that violate CP.

So the symmetries required are 1,2,4. Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Option C is choice C.


In the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), operators must respect certain symmetries based on the framework's structure and the Standard Model's properties. Here's the analysis of the given symmetries:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, as it is an effective field theory built upon the Standard Model, which respects Lorentz symmetry. All operators in SMEFT must therefore respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and spacetime translations. Since SMEFT is formulated in a spacetime framework that respects Poincaré symmetry, all operators must also respect this symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model already violates CP symmetry (e.g., through CP violation in the CKM matrix). Consequently, SMEFT operators are not required to preserve CP symmetry, as the framework allows for CP-violating terms.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, and its violation would lead to serious issues like non-unitarity or causality violations. SMEFT operators must therefore respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Among the given options, the correct choice is **C) 1,2,4**.

Answer: C
