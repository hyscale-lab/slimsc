Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow and think it through.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when dibromides react with a strong base like KOH, they typically undergo an elimination reaction. Dibromides are good candidates for dehydrohalogenation, especially vicinal dihalides, which form alkenes when two H's are removed. So, heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH would probably form an alkene. The product is a light yellow solid, which makes sense because alkenes are typically less polar and might be solids at room temperature.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: the 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a high ppm, likely for an -OH group or maybe an epoxide. Wait, but KOH is a base. If it's an elimination, maybe it's forming an alkene. Wait, no, another possibility: since adamantane is a highly branched structure, perhaps the product is an epoxide? Hmm, but the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. That sounds like a carbonyl group. Oh wait, maybe it's an elimination to form a ketone? No, wait. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH, perhaps it's a dielimination. Oh, wait, if it's 1,3 diBr, maybe it's forming a diene? No, more likely, each Br would eliminate, but since they're on adjacent carbons, maybe forming a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I got this wrong. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane structure: Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so perhaps the 1 and 3 positions are adjacent in a way that allows for a double bond. But wait, the KOH is in excess, so maybe it's a double elimination. Wait, wait—another approach: maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation twice. Each Br would lead to a double bond when eliminated. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on adjacent carbons? Or are they on opposite positions? Maybe I should draw the structure.

Adamantane has a structure like a diamond, with four cyclohexane rings. The 1 and 3 positions—maybe they're on adjacent carbons. So, each Br is on a carbon that's attached to another Br. So when KOH is heated with it, each Br would eliminate, forming a double bond. So, product 1 would be 1,3-diene? Wait, that doesn't fit the NMR. Alternatively, maybe it's a single elimination, but with two Br atoms, perhaps it's forming an alkene.

Wait, but perhaps I should think of the reaction as a Dieckmann-type elimination. Wait, no, Dieckmann is for cyclic ketones. So maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a diene.

But looking at the NMR, the 4.79 ppm is two protons. That makes me think of an epoxide. Because epoxide protons are usually between 3-4 ppm, but sometimes a bit higher. Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. How would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a conjugate addition or elimination. Alternatively, maybe the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, and elimination leads to a double bond. But then the product would be an alkene, and the NMR would show a peak for the alkene protons. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be the end of the double bond, perhaps as a trans coupling.

Wait, but in the IR, a peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group. So maybe the product is a ketone. How would that happen? Oh! If each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a tertiary carbon, perhaps the elimination leads to a carbonyl. Wait, but elimination usually forms alkenes, not ketones. Unless it's a ring contraction or expansion, or some kind of elimination that forms a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a double elimination, leading to the formation of a carbonyl. For example, if two HBr molecules are eliminated, and the remaining structure forms a carbonyl. So, perhaps the product is a ketone.

Wait, let me think about the structure. Adamantane has four bridgehead carbons. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on two bridgehead carbons. Heating with KOH (a strong base) would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr. But since both Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads, perhaps the elimination leads to a conjugated diene? Or maybe a bridge contraction.

Wait, maybe it's forming an enol. But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of the possible structures.

Wait, another angle: the 1H NMR of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 10H in that region suggests perhaps a cyclohexane ring or similar, as the adamantane structure would have multiple CH2 groups. The 4.79 (2H) could be an -OCH2- group, perhaps part of an epoxide. But the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, which matches a ketone or ester. Epoxides don't have carbonyls. So maybe the product isn't an epoxide.

Wait, maybe the product is a dik
