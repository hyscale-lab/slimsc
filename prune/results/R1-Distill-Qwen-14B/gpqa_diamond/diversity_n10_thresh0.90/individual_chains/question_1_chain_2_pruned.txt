Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish the two levels. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. 

Wait, but in this case, the lifetimes given are the lifetimes of each state. So each state has its own lifetime. I think the time uncertainty Δt for each state is the lifetime itself. So for E1, Δt would be 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, it's 1e-8 seconds. 

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So the energy difference ΔE must be such that the uncertainty in energy (from each state's lifetime) is smaller than the actual energy difference. Otherwise, the two states might not be distinguishable. 

So, the uncertainty in energy for each state would be ħ divided by the lifetime. Let me calculate that. The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. 

For E1: ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J. To convert that into eV because the options are in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602176634e-19 joules. So, 1.05e-25 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = approximately 6.56e-7 eV. So about 6.56e-7 eV uncertainty for E1. 

Similarly, for E2: τ2 is 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J. Converting to eV: 1.05e-26 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 6.56e-8 eV. So about 6.56e-8 eV uncertainty for E2. 

Wait, but what's the total uncertainty in the energy difference between E1 and E2? Hmm, I think when considering the energy difference, it's the uncertainty in each state that contributes. So the total uncertainty in ΔE would be the sum of the individual uncertainties, because for each state, their energy is uncertain by their own ΔE. Or maybe I should think about the uncertainty in the difference, which would be the maximum of the two? Or perhaps the sum? 

Wait, no, actually, the energy difference is E2 - E1. The uncertainty in that difference would be ΔE2 + ΔE1, because if E2 is uncertain by ΔE2 and E1 by ΔE1, their difference's uncertainty is the combination. Because when you subtract two independent uncertainties, the maximum possible is the sum. So ΔE_diff ≈ ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So plugging in the numbers: 6.56e-7 eV + 6.56e-8 eV. Let's see, 6.56e-7 is 65.6e-8, adding 6.56e-8 gives us about 72.16e-8 eV. So roughly 7.2e-7 eV. 

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's exactly correct. Another thought: perhaps the energy difference's uncertainty is the smaller of the two, because if the lifetimes are different, the more precise measurement comes from the longer lifetime. Or wait, no. Each state's lifetime
