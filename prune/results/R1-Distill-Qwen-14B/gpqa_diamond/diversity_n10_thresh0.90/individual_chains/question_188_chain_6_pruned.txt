Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, let's see what I remember.

First, I remember that interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The formula I think I need is the interplanar spacing formula for crystals. I think it's something involving the reciprocal of the plane indices and the lattice parameters.

Wait, the crystal in question is rhombohedral. Oh right, a rhombohedral lattice has all sides equal (a = b = c) and all angles equal (alpha = beta = gamma). In this case, the angles are all 30 degrees. So, the lattice is rhombohedral with a = 10 Angstroms and angles 30 degrees each.

The interplanar distance formula for a cubic system is d = a/(sqrt(h² + k² + l²)) for the (hkl) plane. But wait, rhombohedral isn't cubic. So the formula must be more general.

I recall that the general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is:

d = [ (a² (sin α sin β sin γ) )^(1/2) ] / [ sqrt( (h^2/k^2 + ... ) ) ]

Wait, no. Maybe I should think about the Miller indices and the structure factor. Alternatively, perhaps I should refer to the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

Wait, another approach. The interplanar distance is given by the formula:

d_{hkl} = (1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * (cos θ) )) ) * (a / sqrt( (1 + (2 cos θ)) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Oh, right, in a rhombohedral system, the formula simplifies because a = b = c, and the angles are the same. So perhaps there's a specific formula for that.

I remember that for a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar distance can be calculated using:

d_{hkl} = [ a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - hk - hl - kl ) ] * [1 / sqrt
