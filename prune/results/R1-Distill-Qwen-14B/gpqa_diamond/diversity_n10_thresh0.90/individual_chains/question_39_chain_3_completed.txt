Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, we have a large number of identical systems—10,000 of them. Each system has a particle, and each particle is moving along a tube, which is along the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. I remember that i is the square root of -1, so that's the imaginary unit. 

The problem states that when they measured the position of the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So the particles are localized between x=1 and x=3. That probably means the wave function is zero outside this region because the probability of finding the particle there is zero. Wait, but wait—the wave function given here is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Because typically, the wave function should be zero outside the allowed region, but here, it's given as a function that includes a complex part. Oh wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should focus on the boundary conditions. If the wave function is zero at x=1 and x=3, that would make sense because the particle can't be found outside those points. So perhaps the wave function is zero at x=1 and x=3. That would be the boundary conditions for this system. So I can use those points to solve for a.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But wait, wait a minute. The wave function for a particle in a box usually is sinusoidal, but this one is different. Maybe this is a specific form given by the Schrödinger equation solution for certain boundary conditions.

But wait, the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. Hmm, but the wave function should be zero at x=1 and x=3 because the particle can't be found outside that interval. So the function ψ(x) should be zero at x=1 and x=3. Let me plug in x=1 and x=3 into the equation and set them to zero.

So, for x=1: ψ(1) = (a/sqrt(2)) - 0.5i = 0. Similarly, at x=3: ψ(3) = (a/sqrt(4)) - 0.5i = 0.

Wait, but if I set ψ(1) to zero, that would mean (a/sqrt(2)) - 0.5i = 0. That would imply that a/sqrt(2) equals 0.5i. But a is a real number, right? Because the wave function typically has real and imaginary parts, but in this case, the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. Wait, wait, wait, maybe I misread the wave function. Let me look again.

Wait, the wave function is written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh, so the entire wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So it's a complex function. But a is a real constant. So that would mean that the function has a real part (a/sqrt(1+x)) and an imaginary part (-0.5). Hmm, that seems a bit odd. I'm trying to think if that makes sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because usually, the wave function for a particle in a box is either real or has no imaginary part. So maybe I should question whether this is the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is given in a way that the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is a constant, but that would mean that the wave function is non-zero across the entire x where 1+x is positive, which is x> -1. But the measurements show that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, so the wave function must be zero outside that interval. 

Wait, perhaps the wave function given is only the part inside the region x=1 to x=3. Because if the wave function is zero outside, then the expression given applies only between x=1 and x=3. But the wave function as given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So, perhaps the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5, but that doesn't make much sense because the wave function should probably vanish at x=1 and x=3.

Alternatively, maybe the wave function is being written as having both real and imaginary components, but perhaps the boundary conditions are such that the wave function must be zero at x=1 and x=3. So, let's set ψ(1) = 0 and ψ(3) = 0.

Wait, but let's compute ψ(1) and ψ(3):

At x=1: ψ(1) = a/sqrt(2) - 0.5i.

At x=3: ψ(3) = a/sqrt(4) - 0.5i = a/2 - 0.5i.

If the wave function is zero at x=1 and x=3, then both of these expressions must be zero. So:

At x=1: a/sqrt(2) = 0.5i.

At x=3: a/2 = 0.5i.

Wait, but a is a real number, right? Because the coefficient in the wave function is a real constant. So if a is real, then a/sqrt(2) is real, and 0.5i is imaginary. So a real number can't equal an imaginary number. That's impossible. So that suggests that this approach is wrong.

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read the problem again.

The wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So perhaps the entire function is written as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but that would mean that the wave function is a complex function with both real and imaginary parts. But the boundary conditions for a particle in a box (like this scenario) require that the wave function must be zero at the boundaries (x=1 and x=3). So, setting ψ(1)=0 and ψ(3)=0.

But when I plug in x=1, I get (a/sqrt(2)) - 0.5i = 0. So this would mean that the real part is zero and the imaginary part is zero. So a/sqrt(2) = 0 and -0.5i = 0. But that's impossible because 0.5i isn't zero. So that suggests that perhaps the wave function isn't zero at x=1 and x=3, which is confusing because the measurement shows that particles aren't found outside that region. Alternatively, maybe the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, so we should normalize the wave function in that interval.

Wait a minute, perhaps the wave function is given such that the real part is zero outside x=1 to x=3. So perhaps the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So the given expression is valid between x=1 and x=3, and zero outside. But that doesn't solve the problem with the boundary conditions as I thought earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function as given is a standing wave, but I'm not sure. Another approach is to find the normalization condition. The total probability of finding the particle between x=1 and x=3 must be 1. So I'll integrate the square of the absolute value of the wave function over x=1 to x=3 and set it equal to 1.

So, the wave function is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. The absolute square is |ψ(x)|² = [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) ]² + [ (-0.5) ]², since the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is (-0.5). Wait, because the modulus squared of a complex number a + ib is a² + b².

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

We need to integrate this from x=1 to x=3 and set it equal to 1.

So the integral ∫ (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Let me compute this integral:

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx is a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3.

Integral of 0.25 dx is 0.25 x evaluated from 1 to 3.

So putting it all together:

a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] + 0.25*(3 - 1) = 1.

Simplify:

a² [ ln(4/2) ] + 0.5 = 1.

Because ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So, a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides:

a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

So, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Calculate that:

ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let's make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the approach.

I assumed that the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and that it's given by the expression provided. Then, I integrated the square of the absolute value from 1 to 3 to find the normalization constant a. That makes sense because the wave function must be normalized, and the probability of finding the particle in the allowed region must be 1.

So the steps are correct. The integral was set up properly, and the calculation for a seems correct. So the answer should be option B) 0.85.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the wave function provided: 

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The wave function is complex, with a real part \(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\) and an imaginary part \(-0.5\). The problem states that particles are only found between \(x=1\) and \(x=3\), meaning the wave function must be normalized over this interval. The normalization condition requires that the total probability of finding the particle in the region \(x=1\) to \(x=3\) is 1. 

The probability density is given by the modulus squared of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

Substituting \(|\psi(x)|^2\), we compute:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral splits into two parts:

1. \(\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = a^2 \ln(4) - a^2 \ln(2) = a^2 \ln(2)\)
2. \(\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5\)

Adding these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Rearranging:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \(a\) is approximately \(0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
