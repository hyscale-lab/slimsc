Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The star moves back and forth due to the planet's gravity, right? So the spectral lines shift a little.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass, each hosting a planet similar to Neptune. Both have circular orbits. The RV method detected the planets. 

Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1. 

Wait, the RV method's shift depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and other factors. Oh right, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )) )^(1/3) * ( 1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_*) ) )

But since the planets are Neptune-like, their masses are much smaller than the stars, so M_* >> M_p. So M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and the denominator (1 + M_p/M_*) is roughly 1. So maybe I can simplify the formula.

Wait, another approach: the RV signal (K) is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(1/3) P^(1/3)) ). Or wait, maybe K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(1/3) P^(1/3)) ), since the mass of the star is the same for both.

Wait, wait, the star mass is the same for both. Since both stars have same mass as Sun, M_* is the same for both. So K is proportional to M_p / (P^(1/3)) ). Because in the formula, K is proportional to (M_p / ( (M_*)^2 ) )^(1/3) ) / P^(1/3). Hmm, maybe I should get the exact formula.

Looking up, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Given that both planets have similar masses, so M_p is the same for both. And the inclination i is the same? Or wait, the question doesn't specify, but perhaps it's assumed that sin i is the same, or maybe that i is 90 degrees, so sin i = 1. But the problem says both are in circular orbits, which probably just means they have the same shape, not necessarily the same inclination. Hmm, but the question says both stars have same masses and both planets have similar masses. So maybe the only variables are the shifts (K), which are given.

Wait, let's think again. Both have same M_* (since same as Sun), and same M_p (Neptune-like). So the only variable here is P, the orbital period.

But K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

Given that, for the two planets, K1 and K2 are 5 and 7 milliangstroms respectively.

So K1/K2 = (1 / (P1^(1/3))) / (1 / (P2^(1/3))) ) => K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Rearranging, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, no. Let's see:

K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), so K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) => P ∝ 1/K^(3).

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, let's see, if K1 is smaller than K2, then P2 is longer than P1? Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so if K increases, P decreases.

Wait, for example, if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1? Wait no, because K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3). So if K increases, P must decrease.

Wait, let me think. Let's imagine K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). For planet 1, K1 is 5, planet 2, K2 is 7. Since 7 >5, then K2 is bigger, so P2 must be smaller than P1. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K2 is bigger, then P2 is smaller. So the orbital period of planet 2 is shorter than that of planet 1.

But the question is how many times longer is P2 compared to P1. So P2 is shorter, so the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1. Wait, but the options have options like 0.36, which is less than 1, and others. So let's compute what that ratio is.

So, using the proportionality: K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

So K1 = 5, K2 =7.

The ratio (K1/K2) =5/7.

So since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), P is proportional to 1/K^3.

Wait, wait, let me be precise.

From K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) => P ≈ (1/K)^3.

So P1 = C / K1^3, P2= C / K2^3, where C is a constant.

Thus, the ratio P2/P1 = (C/(K2^3)) / (C/(K1^3)) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, but that would mean P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1. So the
