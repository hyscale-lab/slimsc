Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf fbar ψ(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). I'm a bit rusty on my QFT, but I think I can work through this.

First, the mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So I need to find which fermions it can decay into, right? Because the decay products must have enough mass to be produced.

The interaction term in the Lagrangian probably tells me which fermions X can interact with. The term is λf fbar ψ X ψ. Wait, wait, wait—actually, looking at the Lagrangian, it's written as -λf \bar{ψ} f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). I think that might be a typo in the question, but assuming that the X field is coupled to fermion fields, so the interaction term would be something like X ψ ψ-bar, meaning X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs.

So the general form is like X ψ ψ-bar, which would imply that X can decay into a fermion and its antiparticle. So the decay X → f f-bar is possible. Now, the question is, which fermions f are allowed based on the mass of X being 6 GeV.

Each fermion has its mass. The rest mass is important here because the sum of the masses of the decay products has to be less than the mass of X (by conservation of energy; the rest mass energy must be less than or equal to X's mass for the decay to be possible).

Let me list the masses of the known fermions:

- e- (electron): ~0.511 MeV
- mu+: ~105.7 MeV
- tau+: ~1.78 GeV
- u: around 2.2 MeV (current quark masses, but for decay products, we consider the actual particles. Wait, but wait, in terms of hadrons, it's different. But when a boson decays into quarks, it's into a quark-antiquark pair, which then hadronize. But for the decay to happen, the X must have enough mass to produce the quark pair. The quark masses are light, so maybe all quarks are possible except maybe top quark because X is 6 GeV.)

Wait, the top quark is about 173 GeV, which is way higher than X's mass, so X can't decay into top quarks. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be produced, because each fermion contributes about half the mass (since it's a pair: m_fermion *2 must be <= 6 GeV).

So let's go through each fermion:

Electron (e+ e-): mass is negligible, so 2*0.5 MeV <<6 GeV. So allowed.

Muon (mu+ mu-): each is about 105 MeV, so together 211 MeV <<6 GeV. Allowed.

Tau (tau+ tau-): each is ~1.78 GeV. So together, 3.56 GeV. 3.56 GeV is less than 6 GeV. So allowed.

Now the quarks:

u quark: mass ~2 MeV, so pair is 4 MeV. Allowed.

d quark: similar to u, maybe a bit heavier but still way less than 3 GeV. So allowed.

s quark: around 100 MeV? Or is it higher? Wait, the current quark masses are u~2, d~5, s~100 MeV, etc. So s quark pair would be like 200 MeV. Also allowed.

c quark: current quark mass is about 1.5 GeV. Wait wait, but the charm quark's mass is around 1.27 GeV (I think), so a c quark-antiquark pair would sum to about 2.54 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So allowed.

Wait, but earlier I thought that X can't decay into top quarks because top is about 173 GeV, which is way higher than X's mass. But what about bottom quarks? The bottom quark's mass is around 4.5 GeV, I think. So a b quark pair would require 9 GeV, which is more than X's mass of 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar.

Wait, wait, but let me get the exact numbers right because this is crucial. Let's list the masses:

Electron: ~0.511 MeV → 2 * 0.511 = ~1 MeV → allowed.

Muon: ~105.7 MeV → 2*105.7 ≈ 211 MeV → allowed.

Tau: ~1.78 GeV → 3.56 GeV → allowed (3.56 <6).

u quark: ~1.5 MeV (or 2? I'm a bit fuzzy) → 3 MeV → allowed.

d quark: ~3-5 MeV → 6-10 MeV → allowed.

s quark: ~95 MeV → 190 MeV → allowed.

c quark: ~1.27 GeV → 2.54 GeV → allowed.

b quark: ~4.5 GeV → 9 GeV → X is 6 GeV, so 9>6 → not allowed.

t quark: ~173 GeV → way over → not allowed.

So the possible fermion pairs are all except for bottom and top quarks.

Wait, the Lagrangian in the problem says λ f fbar ψ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Maybe I should look at which fermions are present in the interaction. Oh wait, the coupling is to a fermion ψ(y), but perhaps the actual fermions that X can decay into are all those that the Lagrangian couples to. Wait, but the problem says the interaction is given, and the Lagrangian is probably a Yukawa-type interaction, where X couples to a fermion-antifermion pair.

So the possible decay products are any fermions with mass less than 3 GeV each, because the X is 6 GeV, so each fermion must be ≤3 GeV.

Wait, but let me think about the decay process. For X to decay into a pair of fermions, the sum of their rest masses must be less than the mass of X. So each fermion must be less than or equal to 3 GeV (since 2 * 3 GeV = 6 GeV). So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be produced. Because if each is 3 GeV, the pair is exactly 6 GeV. So the X can decay into any such pair.

So which fermions have a mass ≤3 GeV?

Electron: 0.511 MeV → yes.

Muon: 105.7 MeV → yes.

Tau: 1.78 GeV → 1.78 <3 → yes.

u quark: ~2 MeV → yes.

d quark: ~5 MeV → yes.

s quark: ~95 MeV → yes.

c quark: ~1.27 GeV → 1.27 <3 → yes.

b quark: ~4.5 GeV → no, because 4.5 >3 → can't decay into b.

t quark: way higher → no.

So the possible decay channels are any fermion pairs where each is ≤3 GeV.

So the possible decay products are:

e+ e-

mu+ mu-

tau+ tau-

u u-bar

d d-bar

s s-bar

c c-bar.

Wait, but what about the charged leptons? Because when X decays, it can emit any pair as long as the sum is <=6 GeV.

So the decay options are:

X → e+ e-

X → mu+ mu-

X → tau+ tau-.

And the quark pairs:

X → u u-bar,

X → d d-bar,

X → s s-bar,

X → c c-bar.

Wait, but wait: the tau is okay because 1.78*2=3.56 <6. So that's allowed.

The c quark is 1.27*2=2.54 <6 → allowed.

But the b quark is 4.5*2=9>6 → not allowed.

So the possible decay options are all the leptons mentioned (e, mu, tau) and the quarks (u, d, s, c).

Now, looking at the options given:

Option A: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but b quark is 4.5 GeV, which would require 9 GeV. So option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, because c is allowed (mass 1.27 GeV), tau is allowed, and the others are all below.

Wait, but wait, does the coupling in the Lagrangian allow for all these fermions? The problem states the interaction is given; perhaps it's only coupling to certain fermions. But the question is about kinematics, not the coupling. Because the problem states, "what are the kinematically allowed decays", so it's only about whether the mass allows it, not whether the interaction exists.

Wait, that's correct. Because the question is about the kinematics. So even if the Lagrangian only has a specific coupling, the kinematic possibility is about whether the mass allows decay. But wait, wait, the interaction must exist for the decay to occur. Because if X doesn't couple to a certain fermion, it can't decay into that pair. So, for example, if X only couples to leptons and not to quarks, then it can't decay into quarks, even if the mass allows it.

Wait, but the problem states the interaction is given as L(y) = -λ f fbar ψ(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the notation. The term looks like it's an interaction between X and a fermion ψ.

Wait, perhaps the interaction term is X ψ ψ-bar, so X couples to ψ and ψ-bar (fermions). So the fermions that X can couple to are those ψ. So, if the interaction is given, then the possible decay products are whatever fermions ψ are present in the Lagrangian.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify which fermions ψ are in the interaction. So perhaps the interaction is written in a general form, so all fermions are allowed unless specified otherwise.

Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is written as X coupling to a fermion ψ, which could be any fermion, so all possible fermions are allowed as decay products if their masses are under 3 GeV.

So, perhaps we can assume that X can decay into any fermion pair where each has mass ≤3 GeV.

So the possible decays would be:

- e+ e-,

- mu+ mu-,

- tau+ tau-,

- u u-bar,

- d d-bar,

- s s-bar,

- c c-bar.

So the possible options are the ones that include these.

Looking at the options:

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all of the above except for b and t.

Option C includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. Wait, but t is top quark, which is way above 6 GeV. So that can't be right.

Option D includes b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But b is too heavy, so X can't decay into b.

So option B is the correct one because it includes all the allowed decay channels except for the ones that are too massive.

Wait, looking at option B: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, which matches all the required fermions.

So the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction term in the Lagrangian, \( \mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi} f(y)(\upsilon + X(y))\psi_{f}(y) \), indicates that \( X \) couples to fermion-antifermion pairs. The kinematic constraint for decay is that the total rest mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of each fermion in the pair.

### Analysis of Fermion Masses:
1. **Electron (\( e^+e^- \)):** \( m_e \approx 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \), so \( 2m_e \approx 1 \, \text{MeV} \), which is much less than 6 GeV. Allowed.
2. **Muon (\( \mu^+\mu^- \)):** \( m_\mu \approx 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \), so \( 2m_\mu \approx 211 \, \text{MeV} \), which is less than 6 GeV. Allowed.
3. **Tau (\( \tau^+\tau^- \)):** \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than 6 GeV. Allowed.
4. **Up Quark (\( u\bar{u} \)):** \( m_u \approx 2 \, \text{MeV} \), so \( 2m_u \approx 4 \, \text{MeV} \), which is much less than 6 GeV. Allowed.
5. **Down Quark (\( d\bar{d} \)):** \( m_d \approx 5 \, \text{MeV} \), so \( 2m_d \approx 10 \, \text{MeV} \), which is much less than 6 GeV. Allowed.
6. **Strange Quark (\( s\bar{s} \)):** \( m_s \approx 100 \, \text{MeV} \), so \( 2m_s \approx 200 \, \text{MeV} \), which is less than 6 GeV. Allowed.
7. **Charm Quark (\( c\bar{c} \)):** \( m_c \approx 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_c \approx 2.54 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than 6 GeV. Allowed.
8. **Bottom Quark (\( b\bar{b} \)):** \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_b \approx 9 \, \text{GeV} \), which is greater than 6 GeV. Not allowed.
9. **Top Quark (\( t\bar{t} \)):** \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \), which is far greater than 6 GeV. Not allowed.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B:** Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C:** Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_t > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D:** Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) based on its mass of 6 GeV.

Answer: B
