Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different values in meters.

Alright, I remember that the mean decay distance (also called the decay length) is related to the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. The formula, if I recall correctly, is L = gamma * beta * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is the velocity in terms of the speed of light, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

Wait, but how do I get tau? Oh right, the mean lifetime tau is related to the width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. I think the relation is tau ≈ ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, I should double-check the units. Because Γ is given in MeV, which is an energy unit, and tau should be in seconds. So I need to convert Γ into appropriate units.

Wait, but another approach: the decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime by Γ = ħ / tau. So tau = ħ / Γ. But let's make sure about the units. Let me write down the units.

Gamma (Γ) is given in MeV. So I need to convert that into Joules. Because 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 Joules. So 320 MeV is 320 * 1e6 eV. Let me calculate that. 320 MeV = 3.2e8 eV. Multiply by 1.60218e-19 J/eV gives 3.2e8 * 1.60218e-19 = let's see, 3.2 *1.60218 = about 5.12698, times 1e-11 (since 1e8 * 1e-19 is 1e-11). So Γ ≈ 5.12698e-11 J.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should think in terms of natural units where ħc is expressed in GeV fm or something like that. Because dealing with unit conversions can get messy. Oh, right! Because in particle physics, people often use units where ħ = c = 1, but when calculating distances and times, you have to reintroduce the constants.

Wait, maybe another approach. The mean decay length L is given by L = (gamma * beta) * c * tau. But tau is ħ / Γ. So putting it all together, L = (gamma beta) * (c * ħ) / Γ.

Wait, but gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma = E / (m c²), but since we're using units where c=1, it's E / m. Here, E is the production energy, which is 8 GeV, and m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Beta is v/c, and v can be found from gamma and the mass. Alternatively, since beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)) when gamma is large, but perhaps it's easier to compute beta from E. Because E = gamma m c², and the energy is given as 8 GeV. So gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

Wait, but beta can also be found from beta = p c / E, where p is the momentum. And since E² = (pc)² + (m c²)², so p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) ), but again, in units where c=1, p = sqrt(E² - m²). So p = sqrt(8^2 - 1.2^2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV. Then beta = p * c / E. Wait, but in units where c=1, beta is p/E. So beta = 7.91 / 8 ≈ 0.98875.

So, gamma is about 6.6667, beta is approximately 0.98875.

Putting it all together, L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Tau is the mean lifetime, which is ħ / Γ. Let me compute tau. Since Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So tau = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but ħ in units where c=1 and ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm (I remember that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, so ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm)/c. But wait, if c=1 in these units, then ħ is 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, tau = ħ / Γ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / (0.32 GeV). Wait, 0.32 GeV is 320 MeV. So tau = (197.33 MeV·fm) / (320 MeV) )= 197.33 / 320 fm ≈ 0.61665 fm. That's femtometers, right? Because 1 fm is 1e-15 meters.

Wait, but wait: units again. So 197.33 MeV·fm divided by 320 MeV gives fm. So yes, tau is about 0.61665 fm in units where c=1, but wait, no, because tau is in seconds. Hmm, I think I'm mixing up units here. Let me clarify.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to use natural units for the calculation and then convert to meters. Because in natural units, c=1 and ħ=1 (or 6.582e-25 GeV·s), but wait, no, 1 GeV is about 1.602e-10 J, and ħ is about 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So perhaps I should compute tau in seconds.

Let me try that again. Gamma is 320 MeV which is 0.32 GeV. ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) )= (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Hmm, but wait, that seems too small. Let me double-check. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is about 2.056e-24 s? Wait, 0.32 is 3.2e-1, so 6.582e-25 /3.2e-1 = 6.582/(3.2) * 1e-24 = approx 2.056e-24 s. That's correct.

So tau is about 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, the decay length L is gamma * beta * c * tau.

Gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV ≈ 6.6667.

Beta is v/c ≈ sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)), but since gamma is high, beta is close to 1. Alternatively, from earlier, beta is approximately 0.98875.

So, gamma * beta = 6.6667 * 0.98875 ≈ let's compute that. 6.6667 * 0.98875. 6 * 0.98875 is about 5.9325, and 0.6667 * 0.98875 is approx 0.65916. So total is about 5.9325 + 0.65916 ≈ 6.5917.

So, gamma * beta ≈ 6.5917.

Then, c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

Multiply all together: L = 6.5917 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 6.5917 * 3e8 = 1.97751e9.

Then, multiply by 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So 1.97751e9 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.97751 * 2.056875 * 1e-15.

Calculating 1.97751 * 2.056875.

Well, 2 * 2.056875 is about 4.11375. But since it's 1.97751, which is about 2 - 0.02249. So 2.056875 * (2 - 0.02249) = 4.11375 - 2.056875 * 0.02249.

What's 2.056875 * 0.02249? Approximately 0.04627.

So 4.11375 - 0.04627 ≈ 4.06748.

So 4.06748e-15 meters.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. 1.97751 * 2.056875.

Compute 2 * 2.056875 =4.11375.

But 1.97751 is 2 minus 0.02249. So, (2 - 0.02249) * 2.056875 = 2*2.056875 - 0.02249 * 2.056875.

Which is 4.11375 - (approx 0.04627) = 4.06748.

So 4.06748e-15 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, option C is 5.0223e-15, etc.

Hmm, so my calculation gives approximately 4.067e-15 m, which is very close to option B's 4.0655e-15.

Wait, but let me check the exact calculation.

Wait, gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666... So perhaps I can compute gamma * beta more accurately.

Beta is p/E, where p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2).

E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV.

p = sqrt(8^2 - 1.
