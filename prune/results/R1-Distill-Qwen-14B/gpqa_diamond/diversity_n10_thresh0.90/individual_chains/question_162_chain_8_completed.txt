Okay, so I've got this question here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step. Let me start by recalling what I know about metrics and pseudospheres.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit unusual. I remember that metrics can describe the geometry of a space, and in this case, it's probably a two-dimensional space since there are two coordinates, x and y.

Pseudospheres are surfaces with constant negative curvature, right? But wait, sometimes pseudosphere refers to the tractricoid, which is a specific surface. However, in the context of general relativity or differential geometry, a pseudosphere might mean a surface with a metric that has a certain form. Alternatively, maybe it's a hyperbolic space described by this metric.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere. So I'm thinking about the area of a surface. But pseudospheres are usually infinite in extent, like hyperbolic space. Let me think about that.

In two dimensions, the metric given is conformally flat because it's a scalar multiple of the Euclidean metric (dx² + dy²). The conformal factor here is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the metric can be written as ds² = f(x,y) (dx² + dy²), where f(x,y) = 32/(4 - x² - y²).

But wait, for the area, I think I need to compute the area of the surface defined by this metric. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the area of the pseudosphere. Wait, pseudospheres are typically compact, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the metric describes a hyperbolic space. Hyperbolic spaces have infinite area, but perhaps under certain restrictions.

Wait, the denominator is 4 - x² - y². So the condition is that 4 - x² - y² > 0, because otherwise the conformal factor would be negative or undefined. So x² + y² <4. That defines a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. So this metric is defined on the interior of a circle with radius 2. But wait, if it's a pseudosphere, maybe this is a model of hyperbolic geometry, like the Poincaré disk model.

In the Poincaré disk model, the metric is (4/(1 - r²)^2)(dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate. But in our case, the conformal factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Let me see: 32 is 8*4, so 32/(4(1 - (x² + y^2)/4 )) = 8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So if r is sqrt(x² + y²), then the denominator is 1 - r²/(4). So the conformal factor becomes 8/(1 - r²/4). So the metric is 8/(1 - r²/4) (dr² + r² dθ²). Wait, comparing to the standard Poincaré disk model, which is [4/(1 - r²)^2](dr² + r² dθ²). Hmm, maybe I'm not getting the scaling right.

Wait, 8/(1 - r²/4) is the same as 8*(4/(4 - r²)) = 32/(4 - r²). Oh, but wait, in the standard model, the denominator is (1 - r²), and the numerator is 4. So perhaps our metric is similar but scaled.

In the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic space, the metric is (4/(1 - r²)^2)(dr² + r² dθ²). So when I compute the area, for hyperbolic space, the area of a disk of radius R (in hyperbolic terms) is 4π sinh²(R), but wait, that's not right. Alternatively, the area element in the Poincaré disk model is (4/(1 - r²)^2) r dr dθ. Integrating over the entire disk (r from 0 to 1, θ from 0 to 2π) gives the area as 4π ∫0^1 (r/(1 - r²)^2) dr. Let me compute that integral:

Let me set u = 1 - r², then du = -2r dr. So (r dr) = -du/2. When r=0, u=1; r=1, u=0. So the integral becomes ∫1^0 [ (-du/2) / u² ] = (1/2) ∫0^1 u^{-2} du = (1/2) [ -u^{-1} ] from 0 to1. Wait, as u approaches 0, u^{-1} goes to infinity, so the integral diverges. That means the area of the entire hyperbolic plane is infinite.

But in our case, the denominator is 4 - x² - y² = 4(1 - (r²)/4), so the metric is f(r) = 32/(4 - r²) = 8/(1 - (r²)/4). So the area element would be f(r) r dr dθ = [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ.

But wait, the radius in this case goes up to 2, because 4 - r² >0 → r <2. So the area of the entire space is the integral from r=0 to 2, θ=0 to 2π of [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ.

Let's compute that:

Area = ∫0^{2π} ∫0^2 [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ.

Take out the constants: 32 * ∫0^{2π} dθ ∫0^2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Compute the θ integral first: 32 * 2π ∫0^2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Now, compute the r integral: ∫ [ r dr ]/(4 - r²). Let u=4 - r² → du= -2r dr → r dr = - du/2.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫4^0 ( (-du/2) ) / u → (1/2) ∫0^4 (1/u) du = (1/2) [ ln u ] from 0 to4.

Wait, but ln u as u approaches 0 is negative infinity. So the integral ∫0^4 (1/u) du diverges. So the area is infinite.

Wait, but in our case, the upper limit is r=2, so when r approaches 2, u approaches 0. So the integral from 0 to2 is ∫0^2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr = (1/2) ln(4/(4 - r²)) evaluated from 0 to2? Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me try again.

u =4 - r² → du = -2 r dr → -du/(2 r) = dr.

So ∫ [ r dr ] / (4 - r²) = ∫ [ r dr ] / u = ∫ [ r dr ] / u.

Wait, perhaps another substitution: let me set u =4 - r², then du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [r dr]/u = ∫ (-1/2) du / u → (-1/2) ln|u| + C.

So integrating from r=0 to r=2, u goes from 4 to 0.

So the integral becomes (-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] → ln(0) is negative infinity. So the integral is (-1/2)( -infty - ln4 ), which is positive infinity. So the area is 32 * 2π * (diverges) → so overall, the area is infinite.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused between the model and the actual surface.

Wait, another approach: the standard pseudosphere, like the tractricoid, has finite area. But I think that's only in the sense of its 3D surface. Wait, but in 3D, the tractrix is a curve, and the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. However, the area of the pseudosphere is finite. But wait, I'm not so sure. I remember that the tractricoid has finite area, yes.

Wait, but the metric given is in two dimensions. So perhaps the metric represents a two-dimensional pseudosphere. But in two dimensions, a pseudosphere would correspond to a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. But the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2. Maybe it's a hyperbolic disk with radius 2.

Wait, in the Poincaré disk model, the radius R of the disk in the model is related to the hyperbolic radius r by R = (1/(1 + r)) or something like that. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Alternatively, perhaps the metric defines a hyperbolic space, and the area would be infinite, but the question is about whether the pseudosphere's area is finite.

Wait, the options are given. Let's look: the options are A) 0, B)4π(x²+y²), C)4π(x²−y²), D)+infty.

Wait, the question is asking for the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. But in this metric, the maximum x² + y² is 4, so the radius is 2. So perhaps the area is finite.

Wait, but in the Poincaré disk model, the area of the entire hyperbolic plane is infinite. If the pseudosphere is modeled by this metric, then the area would be infinite. So the answer would be D) +infty.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the pseudosphere is a compact surface, but in two dimensions, I can't imagine a compact pseudosphere. Because in two dimensions, the pseudosphere would have a point at infinity, making it non-compact and thus having infinite area.

Alternatively, maybe the given metric is not of the entire hyperbolic plane but a finite area. Wait, the conformal factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²) → the metric is defined for x² + y² <4, so it's a disk of radius 2. But even so, the area of that disk under this metric would be infinite because the integral diverges as you approach the boundary.

Wait, but maybe I'm miscalculating the area. Let me compute it again.

Area = ∫∫ sqrt( determinant of the metric ) dx dy.

The metric is diagonal, so the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2 * (1)(1) = (32)^2/(4 - r²)^2. The square root is 32/(4 - r²). So the area element is (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy.

But in polar coordinates, dx dy = r dr dθ. So the area becomes ∫θ=0 to 2π ∫r=0 to 2 [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ.

So compute the integral ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me make substitution u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

When r=0, u=4. r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫4^0 [32 * (-du/2) ] / u → 32*(-1/2) ∫4^0 ( du/u ) → 32*(-1/2) [ ln u ] from 4 to 0.

Wait, [ln u] from 4 to 0 is ln(0) - ln(4) = (-infty) - ln4. So the integral becomes (32 * 1/2) )*( [ln u] 0 to4 ) → (16) [ (ln 0) - ln4 ] → (16) ( -infty - ln4 ) → which is -infinity. But since we're taking the absolute value (because area can't be negative), it's positive infinity. So the area is infinite.

So the correct answer should be D) +infty.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional space. The metric is conformally flat, meaning it is a scalar multiple of the Euclidean metric \(dx^2 + dy^2\), with the conformal factor \(f(x, y) = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\). The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) imposes the condition \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), meaning the metric is defined on a disk of radius 2 in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane.

To compute the area of the space described by this metric, the area element is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\text{det}(g)} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \(\text{det}(g)\) is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is:

\[
\text{det}(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\)), the area element is:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, compute the radial integral:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), or \(r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du\), the limits change from \(r = 0\) (\(u = 4\)) to \(r = 2\) (\(u = 0\)). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_4^0 \frac{-\frac{1}{2}}{u} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \(\int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du\) diverges because \(\ln u\) approaches \(-\infty\) as \(u \to 0\). This indicates that the area of the space described by the metric is infinite.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.
