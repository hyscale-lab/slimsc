Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about the area of a pseudosphere given a specific metric. Hmm, I remember that in general relativity and differential geometry, the metric tensor describes the geometry of spacetime, and from it, we can compute various quantities like area or volume.

The given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, but this looks a bit strange because the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). Oh wait, maybe I should think about what kind of manifold this represents. Since it's in two dimensions, perhaps it's a surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space, or maybe it's a 2D spacetime.

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere sounds like a surface with constant negative curvature, like a hyperbolic surface. But wait, a pseudosphere is also sometimes used in the context of anti-de Sitter space, or maybe it's a surface in Minkowski space.

Wait, the metric given is in terms of x and y, so it's probably a 2D metric. But the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should think about the properties of the metric and how to compute the area.

The area element in a metric is usually computed as the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times dx dy, but wait, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. So first, I need to find the metric tensor components.

Looking at the metric ds², it's given as (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). So in tensor form, this is g_{xx} = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and g_{xy} = 0, same for g_{yx}=0, and g_{yy}=32/(4 - x² - y²). So the metric tensor is diagonal with both components equal.

The determinant of the metric tensor g is (g_xx * g_yy) - (g_xy)^2. Since g_xy is zero, it's just g_xx * g_yy. So det(g) = [32/(4 - x² - y²)]².

But wait, the area element is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. So sqrt of that would be 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area would be the integral of that over all x and y where the metric is defined.

Wait, but where is the metric defined? The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which must be non-zero. So 4 - x² - y² ≠ 0 → x² + y² ≠4. Hmm, so the region where the metric is defined is the points where x² + y² <4, because if x² + y² >4, the denominator becomes negative, which would make the metric have negative components. Hmm, but in that case, the metric would describe a Lorentzian signature (if one component is negative), but perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, the radius in a pseudosphere would refer to its curvature. The radius of curvature (or the "pseudoradius") is related to the curvature. For a pseudosphere (which is a surface of constant negative curvature), the Gaussian curvature K is -1/(r^2), where r is the pseudoradius. But wait, I'm a bit hazy on that.

Alternatively, for a pseudosphere, the area might be computed from the metric. Let me think: the metric given is certainly a function of x and y, but maybe it's better to switch to polar coordinates to evaluate the area.

Let me change variables to (r, θ), where x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then, dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ².

Wait, but the given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So in polar coordinates, it's [32/(4 - r²)] dr² + [32 r²/(4 - r²)] dθ².

But the area element is sqrt(det(g)) dr dθ. Because the metric in polar coordinates would have g_rr = 32/(4 - r²), g_θθ = 32 r²/(4 - r²), and the cross terms zero. So det(g) = g_rr * g_θθ - (g_rθ)^2. Since g_rθ is zero, det(g) = (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) ) = (32^2 r²) / (4 - r²)^2.

So sqrt(det(g)) = (32 r)/(4 - r²). So the area element dA = (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ.

But wait, the area of the entire pseudosphere would require integrating r from 0 to some maximum value. Wait, the denominator (4 - r²) must be positive, so 4 - r² >0 → r² <4 → r <2. So the region where the metric is defined is r <2. So integrating from r=0 to r=2.

Wait, but when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, so the area element becomes very large. Let's see, integrating from 0 to 2:

Area = ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Let me compute the inner integral first: ∫ [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr from r=0 to r=2.

Let me make a substitution: Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → -du/2 = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 r dr ] / (4 - r²) = ∫ (32) [ r dr ] / u.

Expressed in terms of u, r dr = - du/2.

So substituting, 32 * ∫ [ (- du/2) ] / u → 32*(-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du.

Which is -16 ∫ (1/u) du → -16 ln|u| + C.

Evaluating from r=0 to r=2:

At r=2: u =4 - (2)^2=0 → ln(0) is negative infinity.

Wait, but as r approaches 2 from below, u approaches zero from above. So the integral becomes -16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

Wait, ln(0) is negative infinity, so the integral diverges to positive infinity, because the negative sign in front would make it positive. So the inner integral ∫ r dr [ ... ] from 0 to 2 is infinite.

Then the area would be integrating that over θ from 0 to 2π. So the entire area would be ∫0^{2π} [ infinite ] dθ, which is infinite.

But wait, that's the calculation. So the area is infinite. Looking back at the options, option D is +infty. So the answer is D.

Another way to think about it: the metric has a singularity at r=2 because of the denominator. So the region up to r=2 is like a cone that pinches off at r=2. But integrating up to r=2, the area element becomes infinite as we approach r=2. So the entire area would be infinite.

Alternatively, maybe I got the metric wrong. Wait, I should double-check. The metric is given as 32/(4 -x² -y²) times (dx² + dy²). So in polar coordinates, 32/(4 - r²) times (dr² + r² dθ²). So the sqrt(det(g)) would be sqrt( (32/(4-r²))^2 r² ) = 32 r/(4 - r²). Yes, that's correct.

So the area is the integral over r from 0 to 2 and θ from 0 to 2π. But as r approaches 2,
