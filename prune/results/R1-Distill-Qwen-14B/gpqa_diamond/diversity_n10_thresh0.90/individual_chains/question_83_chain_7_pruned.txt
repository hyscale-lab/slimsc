Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration calculations. Let me take it step by step.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and we have to choose the correct pair.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So, the reaction should be a neutralization where the acid reacts with the base to form acetate ions and water.

Let me jot down what I know:

- Initial volume of acetic acid (CH3COOH) = 20.00 cm³ = 0.020 L
- Initial concentration of CH3COOH = 0.05 M
- Diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, so total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.040 L)
- Concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M
- Ka of acetic acid = 1.85x10^-5

Wait, the first step is to find the concentrations after dilution. Oh right, when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. So the initial moles of acetic acid are Molarity * Volume. Let's see:

Moles of acetic acid initially = 0.05 M * 0.020 L = 0.001 moles.

After adding 20 cm³ (0.020 L) of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.040 L). So the new concentration is moles / volume, which is 0.001 / 0.040 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid = 0.001 mol (from earlier). So, moles of NaOH needed for equivalence: 0.001 mol.

The volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration. So 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

Wait, but the question isn't about the equivalence point directly, but the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, wait. At 25% titration, that means we've added 25% of the NaOH needed to reach equivalence. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³.

So, let's tackle the 25% titration point first.

At 25% titration, how much NaOH has been added? 2.5 cm³. Let's find the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

So, since each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O

So, initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 mol.

Moles reacted with NaOH = 0.00025 mol.

So, remaining moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed = 0.00025 mol.

So, the solution now is a buffer solution of acetic acid and its conjugate base. Henderson-Hasselbalch equation will be useful here.

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

Where [A^-] is the concentration of acetate, and [HA] is the concentration of acetic acid.

But wait, the total volume at this point is the diluted acetic acid (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added (2.5 cm³), so total volume is 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So, concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that.

log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5) → 0.267 + (-5) = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Now, plug into Henderson equation:

pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647 )

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333.

log(0.333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. So approximately 4.26.

Now, looking at the options, which options have the first pH around 4.26? Option A is 4.26; option D is 4.57. So that's one part done.

Next, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate.

So, moles of acetate = original moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol.

The solution is now sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate dissociates completely, so the concentration of acetate ions is 0.001 mol divided by the total volume, which is 40 cm³ (original diluted solution) + 10 cm³ (equivalence point) → 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

So, [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Since acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C.

Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Then, the concentration of OH- can be found using the Kb and the approximation that [OH-] is sqrt(Kb * c), because Kb is very small.

So, c is 0.02 M.

[OH-] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

Then, pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98.

pH = 14 - pOH → 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have 9.02. Hmm. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Kb. Let me recalculate:

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Wait, but maybe the assumption that [OH-] is sqrt(Kb * c) is incorrect. Because if the solution is a weak base, and when c is not very high, maybe the approximation holds. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately using the formula:

For a weak base, Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is the [OH^-], then:

Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) → approximately x² / 0.02 = Kb.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH-] is 1.04e-5, which leads to pOH of about 4.98, pH of 9.02.

But looking at the options, none of them have the equivalence point near 9. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume? Let me check.

At equivalence, the total volume is the original 40 cm³ (diluted solution) plus the 10 cm³ of NaOH added. 40 + 10 =50 cm³ = 0.05 L. So it's correct.

Wait, but wait. When you add a strong base to a weak acid, the equivalence point solution is a solution of the conjugate base. So, the pH is determined by the Kb of the conjugate base. So the calculation is correct.

Looking back at the options, option D has 6.92 at equivalence. That's way too low. What's going on here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me recheck:

Wait, the volume of the diluted acetic acid solution is 40 cm³, and when titrating, the NaOH volume is 10 cm³ at equivalence. So total volume is 50 cm³.

Wait, another approach: moles of acetate is 0.001 mol. Volume is 0.05 L. So [acetate] is 0.02 M.

Using the Kb equation: Kb = 5.405e-10.

So Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = 1.04e-5.

pOH is -log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04) is about 0.017, so log(1e-5) is 5, so 5 - 0.017 → 4.983 → pOH ≈ 4.98 → pH ≈ 14-4.98=9.02.

But none of the options have 9.02 for the equivalence point. So I'm probably making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the initial dilution. Let me recheck that.

Original volume of acetic acid: 20 cm³ → 0.02 L, 0.05 M.

Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol.

Diluted with 20 cm³ → 0.04 L. So new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.

At equivalence, we've added 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH → 10 cm³ is 0.01 L, so moles NaOH = 0.1 * 0.01 = 0.001 mol. Correct.

Moles of acetate: 0.001 mol. Volume: 50 cm³ → 0.05 L. So [acetate] is 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the Kb isn't correct. Let me calculate Kb again.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 → let's compute that.

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 → approximately 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10. That's correct.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of pH. Let's calculate it more accurately.

[OH-] = sqrt( Kb * C ) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So, pOH = -log(1.04e-5) → let me calculate that more accurately.

log(1.04) is approximately 0.017, so log(1.04e-5) is 0.017 -5 = -4.983. So pOH is 4.983 → pH = 14 -4.983 = 9.017.

Hmm, but none of the options have a pH near 9. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait a minute, wait. Maybe the way the solution is set up is different. Let me think again: when we add NaOH to acetic acid, the reaction produces the sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So the solution should be basic, but maybe I miscalculated the Kb.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the pH using another approach, such as the exact solution of the quadratic equation.

So, let's set up Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO
