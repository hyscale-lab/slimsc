Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details right.

So, the question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. When the star rotates, these spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. The tricky part is that this situation can mimic the presence of an exoplanet when looking at the light curve. The question is asking what the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation amplitude as these spots.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that the brightness change when a planet transits a star is calculated based on the areas involved. The formula I recall is that the change in brightness (delta F) is proportional to (Rp/Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet radius and Rstar is the star's radius. But wait, this scenario isn't exactly a transit, it's more like a spot causing a dip when it faces us.

Wait, but the star is showing brightness variations because of spots. So when the spots are on the side facing us, they make the star appear a bit dimmer because they're cooler. As the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go away, causing the brightness to dip and then rise again. So the total brightness variation is due to the spots blocking some light.

But in the case of an exoplanet, when it transits in front of the star, it blocks a part of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of that dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star.

So the problem is asking what planet radius would cause the same dip as the spots. So I need to calculate the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots and set that equal to the dip caused by the planet, then solve for Rp/Rstar.

Wait, but how does the spot coverage and temperature affect the brightness? Let's break it down.

First, the star's total luminosity without spots. The Stefan-Boltzmann law says L = 4πR²σTeff⁴. So the star's luminosity is based on its radius and temperature. But when spots are present, they are cooler, so they emit less.

The filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, so each hemisphere has a spot area of 0.2. Since the total surface area of the star is 4πR², the area of the spots would be 0.2 * (2πR²) because it's one hemisphere. Wait, no. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So each spot hemisphere contributes 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR². But wait, if the star is a sphere, each hemisphere is 2πR². So one hemisphere is 2πR², and 20% of that is 0.4πR². So the total area of the spots is 0.4πR².

Each spot has a temperature of Teff - 1000 K, which is 5000 K. So the flux from the spots is lower.

The total flux from the star when the spots are facing us is the normal flux minus the flux from the spots.

Wait, more accurately, the star's total flux without spots is L_star = 4πR²σTeff⁴. When spots are present, each spot emits less. The flux from the spots is σT_spot⁴ times their area. So the total flux when spots are visible is L = L_star - (filling factor) * (4πR²) * (σT_spot⁴ / σTeff⁴).

Wait, perhaps a better way is to calculate the fraction of the star's light that is blocked. Wait, but no, spots are not blocking the light, they are just emitting less. So the total light is the sum of the unspotted regions and the spotted regions.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the change in flux when the spots are visible. The star's flux without spots is F0 = σTeff⁴. When some fraction of the surface is cooler, the flux is F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot, where f is the filling factor, and F_spot = σ(Teff - ΔT)^4.

So the change in flux is F = F0 [ (1 - f) + f ( (Teff - ΔT)/Teff )^4 ]

Then the fractional change in brightness would be (F - F0) / F0 = (1 - f) + f ( (Teff - ΔT)/Teff )^4 - 1 = -f [ 1 - ( (Teff - ΔT)/Teff )^4 ]

So the fractional dip is f [ 1 - ( (5000 /6000 )^4 ) ]

Wait, because Teff is 6000 K and spots are 5000 K, so (5000/6000) is 5/6.

So the fractional dip ΔF / F0 = f [ 1 - (5/6)^4 ]

Hmm, but wait, this is the dip when the spots are fully on the visible hemisphere. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, when the star rotates, the spots come into view, and then go away. So the maximum dip would be when the spots are fully visible, which is when the star has rotated so that the spotty hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, but the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, so f = 0.2. But wait, the way I wrote it earlier, when the entire hemisphere is observed, the f is 0.2 of the hemisphere. But since the star is a sphere, the total area is 4πR². When one hemisphere is spotty, the maximum observed area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². But when the star rotates, the portion of the spotty hemisphere that is visible changes. Wait, no, because the star is rotating, and we're observing a time series. So the maximum dip occurs when the spotty hemisphere is fully facing us. So the dip would be the area of the spots on that hemisphere, which is 0.2*(2πR²) = 0.4πR².

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The filling factor is the fraction of the surface that is spots. So the total area of spots is f * 4π R². Wait, no, because the entire surface has 4πR² area. Filling factor is the fraction of the surface that is spots. Wait, but in the question, it says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So that would mean that 20% of the surface is spots, but only on one hemisphere. Wait, no, that can't be right because the hemisphere is half the surface area. Hmm.

Wait, no, the way it's phrased: One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R². So the total area of spots on the star is 0.4 π R².

When the star rotates, the spots come into view. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots are visible, and when the other hemisphere (non-spotty) is facing us, the spots are not visible.

So the maximum dip in brightness occurs when the spots are fully visible, which is when the spotty hemisphere is 100% facing us. So the observed area is 0.4 π R².

Wait, no. The area of the spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere's area). Hemisphere area is 2π R², so 0.2*2π R² = 0.4π R². So when the entire hemisphere is visible, the spots contribute 0.4π R². But when the star is viewed at other angles (like during rotation), perhaps the visible spot area changes. Hmm, but for the maximum brightness variation, the maximum dip is when the entire spotty area is in view. So that would be when the spotty hemisphere is directly facing us.

So the fractional dip is the area of the spots divided by the total area of the star as seen from Earth, which is π R² (since we see a hemisphere). Wait, no, the star's radius is R, so the area we see is π R² (the hemisphere). Wait, no, the star is a sphere, so when viewed from Earth, the area is a circle with radius R, so area is π R².

Wait, but in that case, the maximum area of the spots that can be seen is when the entire spotty hemisphere is facing us. Wait no, the spotty hemisphere is a hemisphere, and when viewed from Earth, the visible area is the same as the hemisphere's area. So the maximum spot area visible is 0.4 π R².

Wait, but the star's total area is 4 π R². The area we see is π R². So the spots on the opposite side wouldn't be visible. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots' area visible is 0.4 π R². So the fractional dip is (0.4 π R² ) / (π R²) ) = 0.4.

But that's not considering the temperature difference. Because the spots are cooler, each spot emits less flux than the surrounding area. So the dip isn't just the area fraction, but the area times the temperature difference.

So the dip would be the sum of the flux from the unspotted areas plus the flux from the spots when they are visible. So when the spots are facing us, the total flux is less.

The flux from the star when the spots are visible is:

F = F0 * (1 - f) + f * (F_spot / F0)

Wait, no. Let me think again. The total flux without spots is F0 = 4π R² σ Teff^4 / (4π) ) = σ Teff^4 * (π R²). Wait, no, F is the flux, which is power per unit area. Hmm, maybe I should compute the total luminosity and then the observed flux.

Total luminosity of the star without spots is L0 = 4 π R² σ Teff^4.

When spots are present, the total luminosity is L = (1 - f) * L0 + f * L_spot.

Wait, no, because each spot has a lower temperature. So L_spot per unit area is σ (T_spot)^4.

So L = (1 - f) * L0 + f * L0 * (T_spot / Teff)^4.

Because the area of the spots is f * (hemisphere's area), which is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R². So since the star's total area is 4 π R², the spots cover (0.4 π R²)/(4 π R²) = 0.1, so 10% of the total area? Wait, no, because the question says one hemisphere is covered with a 20% filling factor. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2 π R²) = 0.4 π R². The total area of the star is 4 π R². So f (the fraction of the star covered by spots) is 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1, or 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, but the question says, "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So the spots' area is 0.2 * (2 π R²) ) = 0.4 π R². But the star's total area is 4 π R², so the fraction of the star's area covered by spots is 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1, or 10%.

Wait, but when the star rotates, the area of the spots that's visible can vary. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover 0.4 π R². The area we see is π R² (the hemisphere). So the fraction of the visible area covered by spots is 0.4 π R² / π R² = 0.4, or 40%. So when the spots are fully visible, 40% of the area we observe is spots.

So the flux from the star when the spots are fully visible is:

F = (1 - 0.4) * F0 + 0.4 * F_spot.

Where F0 is the flux per unit area of the star's normal surface, which is σ Teff^4. F_spot is σ T_spot^4.

Wait, no. The star's total flux when the spots are visible is (unspotted area fraction) * F0 + (spotted area fraction) * F_spot.

Wait, the unspotted area fraction is (1 - 0.4) = 0.6, but wait, that's within the hemisphere we're viewing. So the unspotted area is 60% of the hemisphere, and the spotted area is 40% of the hemisphere.

So the total flux when spots are visible is:

F = 0.6 * F0 + 0.4 * F_spot.

Because each part of the hemisphere contributes to the total flux.

So the fractional change in flux is:

(F - F0) / F0 = [0.6 F0 + 0.4 F_spot ] / F0 - 1 = 0.6 + 0.4 (F_spot / F0 ) -1 = -0.4 (1 - (F_spot / F0) )

F_spot is σ (5000)^4, F0 is σ (6000)^4.

So (F_spot / F0) = (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

Calculating (5/6)^4: 5^4 is 625, 6^4 is 1296. 625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - (5/6)^4 ≈ 1 - 0.482253 ≈ 0.517747.

So putting it all together:

(F - F0)/F0 = -0.4 * 0.517747 ≈ -0.2071.

So the fractional dip is approximately -0.2071, which is about a 20.7% dip in brightness when the spots are fully visible.

Wait, but that seems quite large. The spots covering 40% of the visible hemisphere and being 1000 K cooler would cause a noticeable dip.

Now, in the case of a planet, the dip in brightness when it transits is given by (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area of the planet's disk is π Rp², and the area of the star's disk is π Rstar². So the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Wait, but in this star's case, the dip caused by the spots is about 20.7%. So we need to find Rp such that (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.2071.

Wait, no, because the question says "to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!)". Oh wait, that's confusing. So the scenario is that without spots, what would the planet's radius be to cause the same brightness variation as the spots cause.

Wait, but the star without spots would have a different light curve. If there were no spots, the brightness variation would be due to the planet transiting. So the amplitude of the variation is the same as that caused by the spots. So both scenarios (spots and planet) would cause a dip of the same fractional change in brightness.

So the planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.2071.

Wait, no. Because the dip caused by the planet is when the planet blocks some of the star's light. The area blocked is (Rp/Rstar)^2 of the star's area, so the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

But wait, in the case of the spots, the dip was 0.2071, so the planet's dip should be the same. So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.2071.

Wait, but 0.2071 is approximately 0.207, so square root is around 0.455. So Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.455.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.39, D is ~0.32, C is ~0.11, B is ~0.07. Hmm, none of them is about 0.45. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, that can't be right. Because a planet with 45% the radius of the star would be really big, bigger than Jupiter (which is about 10% of the Sun's radius). Also, in the problem, the star is the same radius as the Sun. So a planet with 0.45 solar radii would be larger than Jupiter, which is possible but uncommon.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the fractional dip. Let me go back.

Wait, when the star is observed, the flux is F = 0.6 F0 + 0.4 F_spot.

So the dip is (F - F0) / F0 = [0.6 F0 + 0.4 F_spot] / F0 - 1 = 0.6 + 0.4 (F_spot/F0) - 1.

F_spot = σ (5000)^4; F0 = σ (6000)^4.

So F_spot / F0 = (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

So 0.6 + 0.4*(0.482253) = 0.6 + 0.1929 ≈ 0.7929.

So F = 0.7929 F0.

So the fractional dip is (0.7929 F0 - F0 ) / F0 = -0.2071, so a 20.71% dip. So the dip caused by the spots is ~20.71%.

If a planet were to cause the same dip, then (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.2071. So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.2071) ≈ 0.455, which is about 0.46. But none of the options are close to that. So maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I got the spot coverage wrong. Let me think again. The filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * (2 π R²) )= 0.4 π R². But when the star is viewed from Earth, the area we see is a hemisphere, π R². So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover 0.4 π R² of the π R² area we see. So the fraction is 0.4.

So the flux is F = (1 - 0.4) F0 + 0.4 F_spot.

Yes, that's correct. So the dip is ~20.7%.

But the options don't have a 0.45 option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm considering the spot coverage.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the star's brightness variation is similar to the planet's transit, so the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same. For the planet, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. For the spots, the maximum dip is 0.2071.

Wait, but we need to find Rp such that (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.2071. So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.2071) ≈ 0.455. But the options don't have this. Closest I see is option A (~0.39) or D (~0.32). So perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the dip caused by the spots is the sum of all spots on the star when we see a hemisphere. Wait, the star's entire surface has 10% spots (as calculated earlier). So when the star rotates, the spots come into view in steps.

Wait, but the maximum dip is when the entire spot area is visible, which is 10% of the star's total surface. But when viewed from Earth, the area we see is a hemisphere, which is half the star's surface. So the spot coverage in the observed hemisphere is 10% of the total surface, which would be 5% of the observed hemisphere.

Wait, wait no. Let me think again. Star's total surface area is 4 π R². Spots cover 10% of that, so 0.4 π R². When the star is viewed from Earth, the visible area is π R². So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spot area in the observed hemisphere is 0.4 π R², which is 40% of the observed area (π R²). Because 0.4 π R² / π R² = 0.4.

Wait, so that would mean that 40% of the observed area is spots. So the dip would be 40% of the observed area, each spot being cooler by a certain amount.

Wait, but earlier when I computed, I got a dip of about 20.7%. So the dip is about 0.2071. So for the planet, (Rp/Rstar)^2 should be 0.2071, so Rp/Rstar is ~0.455.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I messed up the calculation of the dip.

Alternative approach: perhaps the brightness variation is the same as the planet causing a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2, which is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

Wait, but the dip caused by the spots is when the spots are on the visible hemisphere. So the dip is 20.7% as I calculated.

So Rp^2/Rstar^2 = 0.2071 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.455.

But no option is that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the spot calculation.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the flux from the spots correctly. Let me re-calculate.

The star's total flux is L0 = 4 π R² σ Teff^4.

When spots are present, the flux is:

L = (1 - f_total) * L0 + f_total * L_spot,

where f_total is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots.

f_total = (0.2 * 2 π R²) ) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.2 * 2 /4 = 0.1.

So f_total = 0.1.

So L = 0.9 * L0 + 0.1 * (σ (5000)^4 ) * (4 π R²) )

Wait, no, the area of the spots is 0.1 * 4 π R². So the spots' luminosity is (4 π R²) * (0.1) * σ (5000)^4.

So L = (4 π R² σ (6000)^4 ) * 0.9 + (4 π R² σ (5000)^4 ) * 0.1.

Divide both sides by 4 π R² σ, we get:

L = 4 π R² σ [ 0.9 * 6000^4 + 0.1 * 5000^4 ].

The flux we observe when the spots are on the near side is this L. However, when the spots are on the far side, the flux is L0.

Wait, but wait, for the brightness variation, the maximum dip is when the spots are on the near side, so the flux is L as above, and the maximum brightness is L0 when no spots are visible.

The fractional dip is (L - L0) / L0.

So:

(L - L0)/L0 = [ (0.9 * 6000^4 + 0.1 * 5000^4 ) - 6000^4 ] / 6000^4

= [ -0.1 * 6000^4 + 0.1 * 5000^4 ] / (6000^4 )

= 0.1 [ (5000^4 - 6000^4 ) / 6000^4 ]

= 0.1 [ (5/6)^4 - 1 ] 

= 0.1 * [ (625/1296) -1 ]

= 0.1 * [ (625 - 1296)/1296 ]

= 0.1 * ( -671 / 1296 ) 

≈ 0.1 * (-0.5177) ≈ -0.05177.

So the fractional dip is approximately -5.177%.

Wait, that's a lot different than before. So this approach gives a dip of about 5.18%, not 20.7%. So which approach is correct?

Hmm, I think I confused the area in the previous calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, the spots cover 10% of the total surface. So when the star is viewed, the fraction of the surface area that is spots is 10%. But when the star is rotating, the spots come into and out of view. So the maximum dip occurs when all 10% of the star's surface (spots) are visible from Earth. Because the star is a sphere, the maximum fraction of the surface that is visible is 50% (a hemisphere), so the spots can contribute up to 10% of the star's surface when the spot hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, no. Because the spot coverage is 10% of the entire star. So when the spot hemisphere is facing us, 10% of the star's surface is spots, and the other 90% is normal. So in the observed hemisphere, the area of the spots is 10%, and the unspotted area is 90%.

So the observed flux when spots are fully visible is:

F = (0.9 * F0) + (0.1 * F_spot).

Where F0 is the flux per unit area when the star is unspotted, F_spot is the flux per unit area from the spots.

So the fractional dip is:

( (0.9 F0 + 0.1 F_spot) - F0 ) / F0 = ( -0.1 F0 + 0.1 F_spot ) / F0 = 0.1 (F_spot / F0 - 1 )

F_spot = (5000/6000)^4 F0 = (5/6)^4 F0 ≈ 0.482253 F0.

So 0.1 (0.482253 - 1 ) = 0.1 (-0.517747) ≈ -0.05177, which is a 5.177% dip.

So the dip is about 5.18%.

Wait, that makes more sense. So the dip caused by the spots is about 5.18%, not 20.7%. So earlier I was miscalculating the spot area in the observed hemisphere. So the correct dip is about 5.18%.

So now, the planet's dip should be the same. So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: ~0.32 is higher, option A is ~0.39, but 0.2275 is about 0.23, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

Wait, in this approach, when the spots are 10% of the star's surface, and when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the area of spots visible is 10% of the star's surface. But the area we see is a hemisphere, which is 50% of the surface. So the fraction in the observed area is 10% / 50% = 20%.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. The star's total surface is 4π R². The spotty area is 0.1 *4π R²=0.4 π R². When the star is viewed from Earth, the area we see is a hemisphere, π R². So the fraction of the observed area covered by spots is 0.4 π R² / π R² = 0.4. So 40% of the observed area is spots.

So that would mean when the spots are fully visible, 40% of the observed area is spots. So the flux is (1 - 0.4) F0 + 0.4 F_spot.

Wait, but earlier I thought f_total is 0.1. So which is correct?

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me outline:

Total star surface area: 4π R².

Filling factor for one hemisphere: 20% of that hemisphere. So area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Total star surface area: 4π R². So f_total = 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1, or 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots.

When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the area of spots visible is 0.4 π R², which is the entire spot area. The observed area is π R². So the fraction of the observed area covered by spots is 0.4 π R² / π R² = 0.4, or 40%.

So in this case, the flux is 0.6 F0 + 0.4 F_spot.

So dip is (0.6 F0 + 0.4 F_spot) - F0 = -0.4 F0 + 0.4 F_spot.

Divide by F0: dip = 0.4 (F_spot / F0 - 1 ) = 0.4 ( (5000/6000)^4 - 1 )

As before, (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

So dip is 0.4 (0.482253 - 1 ) = 0.4 (-0.517747 ) ≈ -0.2071, which is about 20.7% dip.

But earlier, when considering the spots as 10% of the total surface, the dip was only about 5%. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in how the spot coverage is calculated. The problem states that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the spots are 20% of that hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R². So when viewed from Earth, the area of the star is π R². So the spots' area is 0.4 π R² / π R² = 0.4, or 40%. So the fraction of the observed area covered by spots is 40%.

Thus, the dip is 20.7%, which would require the planet to have (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.2071, so Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.455.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem interpretation.

Wait, perhaps the dip isn't 20.7% but 5.18% as calculated earlier. Because when the spots are 10% of the total surface, and the observed area is 50% of the star, the fraction is 10% / 50% = 20%, not 40%. So perhaps I messed up the observed area.

Wait, no. Because when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the entire spotty area is visible. So the area of the spots is 0.4 π R², and the area we see is π R². So 0.4 / π R² over π R² is 0.4, which is 40% coverage.

Wait, that seems correct. So earlier calculation of dip at 20.7% is correct, but the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but the closest is option A (~0.39), which is about 0.4 squared.

Wait, 0.39 squared is about 0.15, which is less than 0.207. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the problem differently. The star's brightness variation is due to the spots. The same amplitude would be caused by a planet blocking the same fraction of the star's light.

The star's luminosity with spots is a bit lower than without, but the planet's transit would block a part of the star's light, causing a dip.

Wait, perhaps the star's brightness is lower due to spots, but when the planet transits, it blocks the same amount of light as the spot covers. So the dip caused by the planet is due to the area blocked, while the dip caused by the spot is due to the area of cooler spots.

But the question says that the star's light curve would show the same amplitude if the star wasn't spotty. So the brightness variation due to the planet would be the same as that caused by the spots.

So the dip caused by the planet is (Rp / Rstar)^2. The dip caused by the spots when fully visible is 0.4*(F_spot - F0)/F0.

Wait, that dip is 0.4*(F_spot/F0 -1) which is 0.4*(0.482253 -1 )= 0.4*(-0.517747)= -0.2071.

So dip is -0.2071, which is about 20.7% dip.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.2071 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.455, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the brightness variation is the same when the star is not spotty. So without spots, the star's brightness is F0. When the planet transits, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

But when the star has spots, the dip is 0.2071, so to have the same dip, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.2071.

But again, that's about 0.455, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the flux from the spots correctly.

The star's flux when the spots are visible is:

F = (1 - f_visible) * F0 + f_visible * F_spot,

where f_visible is the fraction of the observed area covered by spots.

In this case, f_visible is 0.4, as discussed.

So F = 0.6 F0 + 0.4 F_spot.

F_spot = (5000/6000)^4 F0 = (5/6)^4 F0 ≈ 0.482253 F0.

So F = 0.6 F0 + 0.4 * 0.482253 F0 = [0.6 + 0.4 *0.482253 ] F0.

Compute 0.4 *0.482253 = 0.1929012.

0.6 + 0.1929012 = 0.7929012.

So F = 0.7929012 F0.

So the dip is (0.7929 F0 - F0 ) / F0 = ( -0.2070988 ) F0 / F0 ) = -0.2070988, which is approximately a 20.71% dip.

So the planet's dip must be the same, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.2071 → Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.2071) ≈ 0.455.

But no option is close. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the star's brightness variation is not just the spot's area, but also due to rotation. But the problem says it's only one hemisphere, so the other hemisphere is spot-free. So when the star rotates, the spot area comes into view. So the dip is the same as the spot area fraction times the temperature difference.

Wait, another thought: The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are 5000 K. The flux from the spots is less, but when the spots are not in view, the flux is higher because the unspotted areas are at 6000 K. So when the spots are on the far side, the star appears brighter. But when the spots are on the near side, the star appears dimmer. So the net effect is a dip when the spots are visible and a rise when they are not.

But the question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness.

Wait, when the spots are on the far side, the flux is higher, because the entire visible hemisphere is unspotted, so F = F0. When the spots are on the near side, F = 0.6 F0 + 0.4 F_spot.

So the maximum brightness is F0.

The minimum brightness is F = 0.7929 F0.

So the amplitude is F0 - F = 0.2071 F0, which is a 20.71% variation.

So the planet's transit must cause the same amplitude. So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.2071 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.455.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the star's brightness variation isn't about the dip, but about the change when spots rotate in and out of view, causing the star to appear dimmer and then brighter. So the maximum dip is when spots are on the near side, and the maximum brightness is when the spots are on the far side. So the amplitude of the variation is (F_max - F_min)/F0.

F_max is F0, when no spots are visible.

F_min is F = 0.7929 F0.

So amplitude is (F0 - 0.7929 F0 ) = 0.2071 F0, which gives a fractional amplitude of 0.2071, or 20.71%.

So the planet would need to cause the same amplitude, which is 0.2071. So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.2071.

Again, same as before.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. Let me look again.

Options:

A) ~0.39 → (0.39)^2= 0.1521 → 15.21% amplitude.

B) ~0.07 → 0.0049 → 0.49% → too small.

C) ~0.11 → 0.0121 → 1.21% → too small.

D) ~0.32 → 0.1024 → 10.24% → not matching.

Wait, but the problem says "the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!)". So perhaps the star's brightness variation is not the dip, but the variation due to the spot rotation. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view, making the star dip, and then go away, making it bright again. The amplitude is the difference between when the spots are fully visible and when they are not. So the amplitude is the dip, 20.71%.

So the planet's transit must cause the same amplitude. So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.2071.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute the relative brightness variation due to the spots as the difference between when they are facing us and when they are not.

Wait, when the star is viewed with the spotty hemisphere facing us, the flux is 0.7929 F0. When the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F0. The amplitude would be (F0 - 0.7929 F0) = 0.2071 F0, which is a 20.71% variation.

So the planet must cause a variation of the same amplitude, which would require (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.2071 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.455.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer isn't present, but the closest is option A (0.39) which gives about 15.2% amplitude. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the spot calculation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the star's brightness variation is due to the spot causing the star to appear dimmer when the spots are on the visible side, and brighter when they are on the far side. So the maximum and minimum brightness are F0 and F respectively. So the amplitude is (F0 - F), which is 0.2071 F0.

But when the planet transits, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 F0. So the amplitude due to the planet is that dip, which is (Rp/Rstar)^2 F0.

So to have the same amplitude, (Rp/Rstar)^2 F0 = 0.2071 F0 → (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.2071 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.455.

Again, same conclusion. So I'm stuck because none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the star's brightness variation is the same as the planet's. So the planet's transit causes a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2, which equals the spot's dip of 0.2071.

But again, same result.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the flux as a fraction of the star's total flux when the spots are present.

Wait, the star's total flux when spots are present is L = 0.9 L0 + 0.1 L_spot.

So L = 0.9 L0 + 0.1 * (5000/6000)^4 L0.

= L0 [ 0.9 + 0.1*(5/6)^4 ]

= L0 [ 0.9 + 0.1 * 0.482253 ]

= L0 [ 0.9 + 0.0482253 ]

= L0 * 0.9482253.

So the star's total flux is 94.82% of L0 when spots are present.

But when the spots are on the far side, the star's flux is L0.

So the amplitude of the variation is (L0 - 0.9482253 L0 ) = 0.0517747 L0 → 5.177% variation.

So the amplitude is 5.177%.

So for the planet, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2276.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.32 → (0.32)^2=0.1024→ 10.24% → too big.

Option C is 0.11→ ~1.21%.

Option D: 0.32→ ~10.24%.

Hmm, 0.2276 is approximately 0.23, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct calculation is the 5.18% dip.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the spot coverage.

Wait, perhaps the star's effective brightness variation is not the dip when the spots are on the near side, but the average brightness change due to the spot coverage. But that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation is due to the spots being on the surface, but the planet's transit is a one-time dip, while the spots cause a periodic variation. So the amplitude in the light curve is the same as the dip caused by the planet.

So with the dip being 5.177%, the planet's (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2276.

But again, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation is the same as the planet's, but the planet's brightness variation is the same as the spot's brightness variation. So if the spot causes a 5.18% dip, the planet would have to cause a 5.18% dip, requiring Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2276.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I need to re-examine the problem.

Wait, wait! The problem states that the star has an effective temperature of 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So the spots are 5000 K.

But the star is the same size as the Sun. So the star's flux is F0 = σ (6000)^4.

The spots' flux is F_spot = σ (5000)^4.

So the fractional dip when the spots are visible is [ (F0 - F_spot) ] / F0 = 1 - (5000/6000)^4 = 1 - (5/6)^4 ≈ 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

But wait, that's the case when the entire area is spots. But in reality, only 20% of the hemisphere is spots, so f = 0.2.

So the dip is f * (1 - (T_spot/Teff)^4 ) → 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) → 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.10355.

So dip is ~10.355%.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355 → Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

Which is approximately 0.32, which is option D.

Ah! So that's the correct approach. Because the spots are only 20% of the hemisphere, the dip is 20% of the maximum possible dip if the entire hemisphere was spots.

So the calculation is dip = f * (1 - (T_spot/Teff)^4 ) = 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.10355.

Thus, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355 → Rp ≈ 0.3218 Rstar.

So the closest option is D) ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the star's dark spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Same as the Sun.
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Spots are cooler, with \( T_{\text{spot}} = T_{\text{eff}} - 1000 \, \text{K} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's brightness variation is caused by the rotational modulation of the spots. When the spotty hemisphere faces Earth, the observed flux decreases due to the cooler spots.
   - The fractional change in brightness is proportional to the area of the spots and their temperature difference relative to the star.

3. **Planet's Brightness Variation**:
   - The brightness dip caused by a planet transiting the star is given by \( \left(\frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 \), where \( R_p \) is the planet's radius and \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the star's radius.
   - To match the amplitude of the star's brightness variation caused by the spots, the planet's dip must equal the spot-induced dip.

### Calculation:
1. **Spot-Induced Brightness Variation**:
   - The filling factor of the spots is 20%, meaning 20% of the spotty hemisphere is covered by spots.
   - The area of the spotty hemisphere is \( 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \), so the area of the spots is \( 0.2 \times 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - When the spotty hemisphere faces Earth, the fraction of the observed area covered by spots is:
     \[
     f_{\text{visible}} = \frac{\text{Area of spots}}{\text{Observed area}} = \frac{0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2}{\pi R_{\text{star}}^2} = 0.4.
     \]
   - The fractional brightness dip is:
     \[
     \Delta F = f_{\text{visible}} \left(1 - \left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}}\right)^4\right),
     \]
     where \( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} = \frac{5000}{6000} = \frac{5}{6} \). Using \( \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 \approx 0.482253 \), we find:
     \[
     \Delta F = 0.4 \left(1 - 0.482253\right) = 0.4 \times 0.517747 \approx 0.2071.
     \]
     Thus, the fractional brightness dip caused by the spots is approximately \( 20.71\% \).

2. **Planet's Radius**:
   - To produce the same amplitude in the light curve, the planet's brightness dip must satisfy:
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = \Delta F = 0.2071.
     \]
   - Solving for \( \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.2071} \approx 0.455.
     \]

3. **Closest Option**:
   - Comparing this result to the provided options:
     - \( \text{A} \approx 0.39 \)
     - \( \text{B} \approx 0.07 \)
     - \( \text{C} \approx 0.11 \)
     - \( \text{D} \approx 0.32 \)
   - The calculated value \( 0.455 \) is closest to \( \text{A} \approx 0.39 \).

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spots is approximately **0.39**.
