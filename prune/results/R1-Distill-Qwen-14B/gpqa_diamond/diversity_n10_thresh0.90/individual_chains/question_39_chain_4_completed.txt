Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. Hmm.

Alright, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i. Wait, but wait. In quantum mechanics, the wave function must satisfy certain conditions. Oh right, the wave function must be normalizable. That means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must be 1. But wait, wait! Also, in this case, the problem states that when measuring the position, particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So that means the wave function is zero outside this region, but inside, it's given by that expression. Or perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3, meaning it's zero elsewhere, but the given expression is valid between 1 and 3.

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-read the question. Oh, the wave function is described as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i in a part of space where it can exist, which is between x=1 and x=3. So maybe the wave function is non-zero only in that region. So, for x <1 or x>3, the wave function is zero, and between 1 and 3, it's that expression.

But wait, that doesn't sound right. Because the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but wait, if the wave function is zero outside 1-3, then the form inside is correct. So, the wave function ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x) ) - 0.5i when x is between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere.

But wait, another thought: the wave function in quantum mechanics is a function that must be square-integrable, meaning the integral of |ψ|² over all space must be finite (and equal to 1 for normalization). So, the wave function must be zero outside x=1 and x=3.

But looking at the given ψ(x), it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Wait, that's a complex function. Oh, right, that's okay because wave functions can be complex. So, the modulus squared is |ψ|², which is [ (a/(sqrt(1+x)))^2 + (0.5)^2 ] because when you square a complex number a + ib, it's (a^2 + b^2).

So, the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx equals 1.

So, let's write that out. The integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 ] dx equals 1.

Let me compute that integral. Let's split it into two parts:

Integral (a²/(1+x)) dx + Integral (0.25) dx, both from 1 to 3.

First part: the integral of a²/(1+x) dx is a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3. So a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ) ].

Wait, because 1+x from x=1 is 2, and x=3 is 4. So ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So the first part is a² * ln(2).

Second part: integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2)

Compute ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213, so a = sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So when I square its magnitude, it's (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2.

So yes, that's correct.

Another thing to check: is the wave function normalized? Let's plug in a=0.85.

Compute a² ln(2) +0.5 = (0.85)^2 * 0.6931 +0.5.

0.85^2 is 0.7225. 0.7225 * 0.6931 ≈ 0.7225 * 0.693 ≈ let's compute 0.7225 * 0.7 = 0.50575; but actual 0.693 is about 0.693*0.7225 ≈ 0.7225 * 0.693 ≈ let's compute:

0.7 * 0.7225 = 0.50575

0.093 * 0.7225 ≈ 0.0672.

So total around 0.50575 + 0.0672 = 0.57295.

Then, adding the 0.5 from the second part gives 0.57295 + 0.5 = 1.07295, which is more than 1. Oh wait, that can't be right. Hmm, did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait wait, I think I messed up the calculation when plugging in a=0.85. Let me re-calculate.

Because a^2 is 0.85^2 = 0.7225. Then a^2 * ln(2) = 0.7225 * 0.6931 ≈ let's compute 0.7 * 0.7225 is 0.50575, and 0.0931 * 0.7225 ≈ approx 0.0672. So total a^2 ln(2) ≈ 0.50575 + 0.0672 = 0.57295. Then the second term is 0.5. So 0.57295 + 0.5 = 1.07295, which is greater than 1. But the normalization condition is that the integral equals 1, so this would imply that a is too large.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, wait, the condition is that the integral equals 1. So, the equation is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. That matches option B.

But when I plug a=0.85 into the equation, the integral becomes more than 1. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 0.85² * ln(2) + 0.5 = ?

0.85² is 0.7225.

0.7225 * 0.6931 = let me compute accurately: 0.7225 * 0.6931.

Calculate 0.7225 * 0.6 = 0.4335.

0.7225 * 0.09 = 0.065025.

0.7225 * 0.0031 ≈ 0.00223975.

Adding them up: 0.4335 + 0.065025 = 0.498525 + 0.00223975 ≈ 0.498525 + 0.00224 ≈ 0.500765.

So 0.7225 * 0.6931 ≈ 0.500765.

So a² ln(2) = approximately 0.500765.

Adding 0.5 gives 1.000765, which is just over 1. Hmm, that's a problem because the integral should be exactly 1.

Thus, perhaps the correct value of a is a bit less than 0.85 to make the integral exactly 1.

Let me compute a^2 ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5/(ln 2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.721347.

So a = sqrt(0.721347) ≈ let me compute this more accurately.

What's sqrt(0.721347)? Let's think:

0.8^2 = 0.64.

0.84^2 = 0.7056.

0.85^2 = 0.7225.

Wait, so 0.85^2 is 0.7225, which is a bit higher than 0.721347.

So sqrt(0.721347) is slightly less than 0.85.

Wait, 0.849^2 = (0.85 - 0.001)^2 = 0.85² - 2*0.85*0.001 + (0.001)^2 ≈ 0.7225 - 0.0017 + 0.000001 ≈ 0.7208.

Hmm, 0.7208 is less than 0.721347.

What about 0.849^2 is 0.7208, 0.85^2 is 0.7225. Our a² is 0.721347, which is between 0.7208 and 0.7225.

So, 0.849^2 = approx 0.7208.

0.8495^2 = let's compute.

0.8495 * 0.8495

= (0.85 - 0.0005)^2

= 0.85^2 - 2*0.85*0.0005 + (0.0005)^2

= 0.7225 - 0.00085 + 0.00000025

≈ 0.72165.

Hmm, that's 0.72165.

But the desired a² is 0.721347. So perhaps a is approximately 0.8493.

But looking at the options, the options are B) 0.85 and D) 0.6.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is B, 0.85, but the integral comes out a little over 1. But perhaps the approximation is close enough.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup of the problem. Let me recheck.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i.

Wait, but wait, when integrating |ψ(x)|², the expression is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + [0.5]^2.

So, correct. So the integral becomes:

Integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Ah, so that's correct. So we proceed.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value of a.

Compute a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.69314718056 ≈ 0.721347.

So a ≈ sqrt(0.721347) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, the closest is 0.85 (option B). So that's the answer.


The problem involves determining the value of "a" in the wave function of a particle, given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

where the particle is confined between \(x = 1\) and \(x = 3\), and the wave function is zero outside this region. The wave function must be normalized, meaning the integral of \(|\psi(x)|^2\) over the interval \([1, 3]\) must equal 1.

### Step 1: Normalize the wave function
The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \(|\psi(x)|^2\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 1.
\]

### Step 2: Evaluate the integrals
1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5.
   \]

Combining these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \(a\)
Rearranging for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The closest value to \(a \approx 0.849\) among the given options is **0.85**.

### Final Answer:
The value of "a" is approximately **0.85**.

Answer: B
