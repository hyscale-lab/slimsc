Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about how the number of stars changes with distance based on their parallax. The question states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the formula given must be N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

Wait, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/d, where d is distance. Or wait, is it the other way around? Oh yes, distance d is 1/plx. So plx is inversely proportional to distance. So, plx = 1/d implies that d = 1/plx.

So if the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, I can substitute plx as 1/d. Let me write that out: N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Simplifying that, 1/(1/d)^5 is the same as d^5, because (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, and the reciprocal is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Let me double-check that. If N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/d, then substituting plx gives N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5 ) = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. That would mean as distance increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power. But wait, that doesn't make sense because stars are more numerous in the direction where you can see more of them. Wait, but the question is about how the number changes with distance. Hmm, but wait, the question says "per unit range of distance, r". Oh, so maybe I'm thinking about the differential number of stars, like how many stars are there per unit distance. Or perhaps it's the number density.

Wait, let's think more carefully. The number of stars you observe with a certain parallax (plx) depends on the volume of space you're looking at. Because as you look further, the volume increases, which would mean more stars, but the number per unit volume might be constant, so the total number would
