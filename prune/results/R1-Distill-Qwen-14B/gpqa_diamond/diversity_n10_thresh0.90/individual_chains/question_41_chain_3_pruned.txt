Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. So the question is about a light beam moving through glass, and the glass itself is moving toward the observer at a constant velocity v. I need to find the speed of light relative to the observer in the laboratory. The options are given, and I have to pick the correct one.

Wait, I remember from my studies that when a medium is moving, the speed of light in that medium can change as observed from a different frame. But wait, isn't the speed of light in a vacuum always c, regardless of the observer's movement? Oh right, that's the postulate of special relativity. But this is about light in a medium, which behaves differently.

So the glass has an index of refraction n. The speed of light in the glass when it's at rest is c/n, right? Because the formula for the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. So when the glass is stationary, the light's speed is c/n. But now the glass is moving.

Wait, but how does the motion of the medium affect the speed of light observed? I think in classical mechanics, velocities just add up. So if the medium is moving towards the observer at velocity v, then the speed of the light as observed would be (c/n) + v? Or wait, no, that's not right because light's speed isn't just additive in that way. Oh wait, maybe I should think about the medium's velocity and the light's velocity in that medium.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider the frame of the lab and the frame of the moving glass. Wait, in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So from the lab frame, the light is propagating through the moving glass. How does that affect its speed?

Wait, another approach: When a medium is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, what happens to the light's speed? I think the speed of light in the medium would be v_light = (c/n) + v_medium? No, that can't be right because of relativity. Because in a different frame, velocities don't just add like that for light.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the velocity addition formula from special relativity. But wait, the velocity addition formula is used when you have velocities in two different frames. Hmm. So in this problem, the glass medium is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. The light's speed
