Okay, so I'm trying to figure out where the given density matrix ρ is located in the qubit space. The matrix is given as ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Hmm, I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. 

Wait, so |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1| are projectors onto the states |0⟩ and |1⟩, respectively. Adding them together and scaling by 1/2 would give a mixed state that's an equal mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩. So this is a completely mixed state for a single qubit, right? Because each outcome (0 or 1) has a probability of 1/2.

I think the Bloch sphere represents the state of a qubit. For a pure state |ψ⟩, the density matrix is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, which lies on the surface of the Bloch sphere. But a completely mixed state, which is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, should be at the center of the Bloch sphere. Because the Bloch sphere has a radius of 1, the center is at (0,0,0).

Wait, let me make sure. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit can be written as:

ρ = [ [ (1 + a_z)/2 , (a_x - i a_y)/2 ],
       [ (a_x + i a_y)/2 , (1 - a_z)/2 ] ]

where a = (a_x, a_y, a_z) is the Bloch vector, with |a| ≤ 1.

For a completely mixed state, ρ should be I/2. So substituting that in:

ρ = (1/2) I = [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]

Comparing to the general form:

(1 + a_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + a_z = 1 → a_z = 0.

Similarly, (a_x - i a_y)/2 = 0 → a_x = 0 and a_y = 0.

So the Bloch vector is (0,0,0), which is the origin. So the density matrix is at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So that's the correct one.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit, where the system is equally likely to be in the states \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, a pure state lies on the surface of the sphere, while a mixed state lies inside it. For a completely mixed state, the density matrix corresponds to the identity matrix scaled by \(1/2\), which geometrically places it at the center of the Bloch sphere. 

The Bloch vector for this state is \((0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the origin in the qubit space. Among the given options, the correct geometrical position is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
