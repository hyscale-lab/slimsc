Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question says that the solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I remember stability constants are the equilibrium constants for the formation of complexes, right? So, higher β means more stable complexes.

Wait, but what are the possible complexes here? Cobalt can form different complexes with thiocyanate, varying in the number of SCN- ligands. The dithiocyanato complex would be the one with two SCN- ions, I think. But I need to clarify: the stability constants are for each step of complexation.

So, Co^2+ can form Co(SCN)_n^(2-n) complexes. The stability constants given are for each successive addition of SCN-.

Wait, stability constants are usually for the formation of each subsequent complex. So β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 is for Co(SCN)_2, and so on. Or wait, actually, the stability constant for the nth complex is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Co^(n-2+) + n SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_n^(2-n+). Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of stepwise formation constants.

Alternatively, the overall stability constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands is the product of the stepwise β's up to that n. So, for Co(SCN)_n^(2−n), the overall β is β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no. The stepwise formation constants are for each addition. So, the first complex is Co(SCN)^(+), formed from Co^2+ and SCN^-: Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)^+, β1 = [Co(SCN)]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]) = 9.

The second complex would be Co(SCN)_2^0, formed by adding another SCN^- to Co(SCN)^+:

Co(SCN)^+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_2^0, β2 = 40. So the overall β for Co(SCN)_2^0 is β1 * β2 = 9 * 40 = 360.

Similarly, the third complex would be Co(SCN)_3^2-, with overall β= β1*β2*β3 =9*40*63= 22680.

And the fourth is Co(SCN)_4^4- with β=9*40*63*16= 362880. Wait, but wait, the problem gives β4 as 16. So each β is for each step.

But wait, the stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the stepwise constants are for each addition.

Now, the problem asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I'm assuming that the blue complexes are the ones with two SCN- ions, so Co(SCN)_2^0. So I need to find the fraction of Co in the form of Co(SCN)_2^0 among all Co species.

To find the distribution of Co among all possible complexes, we need to consider all possible species: Co^2+, Co(SCN)^+, Co(SCN)_2^0, Co(SCN)_3^2-, and Co(SCN)_4^4−. Wait, but sometimes, depending on the metal and ligand, only certain complexes may be significant. But we have to consider all possible here.

Wait, but the problem states that the stability constants
