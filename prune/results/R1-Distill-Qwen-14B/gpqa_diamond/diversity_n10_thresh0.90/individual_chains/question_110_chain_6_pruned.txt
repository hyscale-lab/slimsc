Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs. The two spectrographs are ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I remember from the question that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES can see stars brighter than 16 V mag. So I need to figure out which stars are bright enough in V magnitude for both instruments to detect.

Wait, but the question specifies that the stars can be detected with both spectrographs. That means each star must be observable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES. So their apparent V magnitude must be below the brightness limit of both. Since ESPRESSO's limit is 17 mag and HIRES is 16 mag, the star's apparent V must be <=16 mag because HIRES can't see beyond 16. Because if a star is brighter than (apparent V <=16), both can see it. Wait, wait, no: the question says which stars can be detected with both. So the star's apparent V must be <=17 (because ESPRESSO can't see fainter than 17) and <=16 (because HIRES can't see fainter than 16). So the maximum apparent V is 16 mag for both.

Wait, no, let me think again. For a star to be observed by both, it needs to be brighter than both's limits. Let me see: ESPRESSO observes stars brighter than 17 mag. So apparent V <=17. HIRES observes stars brighter than 16 mag, so apparent V <=16. So the star's apparent V must be <=16, because that's the lower limit. Because if it's, say, 15 mag, it can be seen by both. If it's 16.5, it's only seen by ESPRESSO. And if it's 16, it's seen by both.

Wait, no: the way the question is phrased, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. Wait, magnitude works such that lower numbers are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, meaning apparent V <=17, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can see stars brighter than 16 mag, so apparent V <=16.

So for a star to be seen by both, it must have apparent V <=16 mag. Because if it's 17, ESPRESSO can see it, but HIRES can't. So the star must have V <=16 for both.

So each star's apparent V magnitude needs to be <=16 to be detected by both. Let's look at each star.

Star1: Absolute V is 15.5 mag, distance is 10 pc. To find apparent V, use the distance modulus: m - M = 5 log10(d/10). So d is 10 pc, so log(1)=0. So m -15.5 =0 â†’ m=15.5. So apparent V is 15.5, which is <=16. So
