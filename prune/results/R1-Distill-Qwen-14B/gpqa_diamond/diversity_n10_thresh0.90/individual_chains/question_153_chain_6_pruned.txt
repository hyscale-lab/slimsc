Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to a beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. These reactions are named after Michael BÃ©champ, right? Oh wait, no, it's actually named after another guy. Never mind, the key point is the reaction mechanism.

So the problem has three parts: A, B, and C. Each part is a Michael addition, and I need to find the reactants and products for each. Then, the options give possible products for each, and I need to choose the correct one.

Let me start with the first reaction (A):

The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The conditions are NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). 

Wait, what's the structure of dimethyl malonate? It's (CH3CO)2CH2O- etc. No, more accurately, it's CH2(COOCH3)2. So it's a diester with two methyl groups and a central CH2 connected to two carbonyl groups.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3, but wait, wait. Actually, the formula is CH2-CH-C(O)OCH3 with the substituents in the E configuration. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, with the p-tolyl group on C3 as the substituent. Wait, no, maybe. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the p-tolyl is on carbon 3. Oh, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR, but if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, then it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)COOR? Or maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)COOCH3. Hmm.

Wait, I think I need to clarify the structure. The correct structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the p-tolyl is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3. But wait, is the carbonyl group present? Wait, acrylate is an unsaturated ester, so the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH3. But if it's 3-(p-tolyl), perhaps the substituent is on the middle carbon. So maybe the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. But wait, the numbering might be different. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the middle carbon. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as the substituent is on the beta position relative to the carbonyl. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3? Or perhaps it's CH2=C(CO-OCH3)(p-tolyl). Wait, that's probably not correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, the p-tolyl is on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3. That's a bit confusing, but I think I'll proceed with that.

In the Michael reaction, one
