Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, first, what do I remember about SMEFT? SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible Lorentz-invariant operators constructed from the Standard Model fields, with coefficients that are dimension-dependent. So, I think that means the operators must respect the symmetries of the Standard Model, right?

So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a big one. Because if operators aren't Lorentz-invariant, the theory wouldn't make sense—it wouldn't respect the principles of special relativity. So option 1 is a must.

What about Poincaré symmetry? Poincaré includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Oh wait, but isn't Poincaré a broader symmetry that includes both? Because the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and Lorentz symmetry is part of Poincaré. So if the theory respects Poincaré, then Lorentz is automatically included. But wait, the question is about which must be respected by all operators. So if an operator respects Lorentz, it doesn't necessarily respect Poincaré unless it also respects translations. But wait, in a theory, translation invariance is tied to momentum conservation, and that's a broader thing. I'm a bit confused. Wait, the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, but does it necessarily respect Poincaré? Because Poincaré includes translations, which are about the symmetry of the theory under shifts in position. But if the theory includes interactions, like in the Standard Model, then translation symmetry is part of the model. So I think all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincaré symmetry as well. So options 1 and 2 are both required.

Wait, but wait. Poincare is a combination of Lorentz and translation symmetries. So if the operators already respect Lorentz symmetry (option 1), do they automatically respect Poincare? Or is Poincare a separate symmetry? I'm a bit unclear on this. Alternatively, perhaps the SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry but not necessarily Poincaré unless the theory is also translationally invariant. But if the theory is formulated in a way that's translationally invariant, which it is because the effective theory is renormalizable-like in a way, then operators would respect both Lorentz and Poincare. So the operators must respect both symmetries. So options 1 and 2 are correct.

Next, CP symmetry. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. But I'm not sure if all SMEFT operators have to respect CP. Wait, the Standard Model isn't CP symmetric. It has CP violation, especially in the CKM matrix. So the SMEFT includes all possible operators, including those that violate CP. So operators in SMEFT might not necessarily respect CP. Therefore, option 3 (CP symmetry) is not necessarily a must.

What about CPT symmetry? CPT is Charge, Parity, Time reversal. I think the CPT theorem states that in any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry must hold. Because the operators respect Lorentz symmetry, and Lorentz symmetry implies CPT symmetry. So all operators must respect CPT. So option 4 is correct.

So putting it together, the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but earlier I thought that if they respect Lorentz, they might automatically respect Poincare. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that Poincare includes Lorentz, so if the theory is Lorentz-invariant, it's automatically Poincare-invariant as well. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, another approach: The SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so operators must be Lorentz scalars. That takes care of option 1.

Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. So operators must also be translation-invariant. But translation invariance is tied to momentum conservation, which is a part of the theory's framework. So yes, operators must respect Poincare symmetry (option 2).

So options 1 and 2 are correct. Then option 4, CPT, is correct because the theory is Lorentz-invariant, and CPT is a consequence of Lorentz symmetry. So all operators must respect CPT.

Wait, but wait. The question is which must be respected by all operators. So all operators must be Lorentz-invariant, which is 1; must respect Poincare (2), which includes Lorentz and translations; and must respect CPT (4).

So the correct options are 1,2,4. Looking at the choices, option C is 1,2,4. Option C is option C) 1,2,4.

Wait, but wait. I thought that Poincare is a combination of Lorentz and translation, but the operators are part of the theory. So if the theory is Lorentz-invariant, but for Poincare, the operators must also be translation-invariant, which is a separate condition. Or is that automatically satisfied because the theory is built in a way that's translation-invariant? I'm not certain.

Another angle: SMEFT operators have to have the same quantum numbers as the Standard Model fields, and be Lorentz-invariant. But Poincare symmetry includes translation invariance. So when you construct operators, they must be invariant under the full Poincare group. Because if they weren't, the theory would not be translation-invariant, which is a part of Poincare.

So yes, operators in SMEFT must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries.

So the correct symmetries are 1, 2, and 4. So the options are C (1,2,4) and option C is one of the choices.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4. So the correct answer would be C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework that includes all possible Lorentz-invariant operators constructed from Standard Model fields, with coefficients suppressed by powers of a high-energy scale. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, meaning all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. This ensures the theory is consistent with the principles of special relativity. Therefore, option 1 is correct.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation invariance. Since SMEFT is formulated in a way that respects translation invariance, all operators must also respect Poincaré symmetry. Thus, option 2 is correct.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model itself is not CP-symmetric, and SMEFT includes operators that can violate CP symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a requirement for all operators in SMEFT, making option 3 incorrect.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant theory must respect CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, all operators must respect CPT symmetry. Thus, option 4 is correct.

Combining these, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
