Alright, so I've got this question about transit detection probabilities for two Earth-like planets. Hmm, okay, let me try to break it down.

So, both planets have been found using the radial velocity (RV) method. That means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, so mass isn't a factor here. But their orbital periods are different; Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star because a shorter orbital period usually means a smaller orbit (since it's closer).

The host stars have the same radii. Interesting. But the star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. Oh, right, because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but they have the same size. So same radius but different masses. Hmm.

Wait, transit probability depends on a few factors. I remember that the probability (P) that a planet transits its star is given by the formula P = (R_planet + R_star) / a_planet, but wait, actually, the exact formula I'm a bit fuzzy on. Let me think. Oh right, the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by the impact parameter, but the impact parameter depends on the alignment. Since we don't have any other info, maybe we can assume the best case scenario, but I think the probability is actually (R_star / a_planet), but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, more accurately, the probability that a planet transits is the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, but actually, I think it's (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by the inverse of the eccentricity, but since both have circular orbits, eccentricity is zero, but wait, that's not correct because eccentricity can't be zero. Wait, no, wait, wait, in the case of circular orbits, the probability is (R_star / a_planet) times (1 / (1 - e^2)^0.5) ), but since e=0, that becomes R_star/(a_planet), but wait, no, I think I might be mixing up some concepts.

Wait, no, maybe the formula is (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / sin i), but sin i for edge-on is 1, so the probability is R_star/(a_planet). Wait, no,
