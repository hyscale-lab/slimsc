Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is all about.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere of this star is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the area of the spots compared to the whole star. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because the star is rotating, when the spots come into and out of view, the observed brightness changes, and this can mimic the presence of an exoplanet. The question is asking, if instead of spots, there's a planet causing the same brightness variation, what would be the radius of the planet relative to the star?

Hmm. So, I need to compare the signal from the spots with that from a planet. The key here is to find the ratio Rpl/Rstar that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spots do.

Wait, but first, I should figure out what causes the brightness change. For the star with spots: when the spots are facing us, the total brightness decreases because the spots are cooler and emit less light. The same effect when a planet transits the star—blocking some of the light. But wait, the problem says that the star is not covered by spots, but if we're comparing the exoplanet's effect to the spot's effect. No, wait, the problem says that in the scenario without spots, an exoplanet would produce the same amplitude. So I think the brightness variation comes from the spots in the observed case, and we need to find a planet that would cause the same variation.

Wait, maybe I need to model the brightness change due to the spots and the planet and set their maximum changes equal.

Let me think about the flux from the star. The star emits a certain amount of light, and when spots are visible, they reduce the total flux. The planet, when it transits, blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness.

But wait, let me be precise. The star's total flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted areas and the spotted areas. Each part emits based on its area and temperature.

So, the star's flux without any spots would be F_total = 4πRstar² * σ * Teff^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But when spots are present, the flux becomes F = F_unspotted + F_spotted.

The filling factor is 20%, so 0.2 of the star's surface is spots. Wait, but the star's total surface area is 4πRstar². So the spotted area is 0.2 * 4πRstar². But how does this affect the flux?

The flux from the unspotted part would be F_unspotted = (1 - 0.2) * 4πRstar² * σ * Teff^4. The spotted part is F_spotted = 0.2 * 4πRstar² * σ * (Teff - ΔT)^4. Wait, no, the spots are cooler, so their temperature is Teff - 1000 K. So, (6000 - 1000) = 5000 K.

So, the total flux when spots are visible is F = (0.8 * 4πRstar² σ (6000)^4) + (0.2 * 4πRstar² σ (5000)^4). Without any spots, the flux would have been 4πRstar² σ (6000)^4, right?

Wait, no. Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So, when the spots are on the side facing us, the flux is lower. When the spots are not facing us (like when the star rotates and spots are on the far side), the flux is higher. But the question says that the brightness variations are due to rotational modulation, so the spots come into and out of view as the star rotates. So the maximum brightness change would be when the spots are fully visible, right? So the maximum drop in brightness is when the spots are fully in view.

Wait, but the problem says that the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So when the spots are on the side facing us, the star's brightness is lower. When the star is observed edge-on, the spots would come into and out of view, causing dips in brightness. Similarly, a planet transiting the star would block some of the light, causing a dip.

So, the brightness variation caused by the spots is the same as the variation caused by the planet. We need to find the planet's radius such that the maximum dip is the same in both cases.

But wait, the star's brightness variation due to spots is a bit different. Because the spots are cooler, the star's brightness when the spots are visible is less than when they're not. So the maximum brightness is when no spots are visible (the spots are on the far side), and the minimum is when the maximum number of spots are visible.

Wait, actually, wait—the star's total brightness would vary as the spots rotate into and out of view. The spots are in one hemisphere, so when the star's face with spots is facing us, we see the spots, and the brightness drops. When the other hemisphere (without spots) is facing us, the brightness is higher.

So, to find the amplitude of the brightness variation, we need to compute the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness, and set that equal to the dip caused by the planet.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to model the situation.

Case 1: Star with spots.

The maximum brightness occurs when the unspotted side is facing us, i.e., when the spots are on the far side. The minimum brightness is when the spotted side is facing us.

Wait no, wait: if the spots are on one hemisphere, then when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots are visible, so the flux is lower. When the other hemisphere is facing us, the spots are not visible, so the flux is higher.

So, the maximum flux is when the spots are not visible (i.e., the unspotted hemisphere is facing us), and the minimum flux is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, but the star's surface is a sphere, so the hemisphere with spots is one side. So the maximum flux is when the spot side is turned away, so the entire unspotted area is visible. Wait, no: the star is a sphere, so when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots. When it's the other way, we see the unspotted hemisphere.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The star has one hemisphere with spots. So, when the star rotates such that the spotted hemisphere is on the near side, the spots are visible. When it's on the far side, the spots are not visible. So the brightness will vary as the star rotates.

So, the maximum brightness is when the spotted hemisphere is not visible (all unspotted area is visible), and the minimum brightness is when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

Wait, but when the star is viewed from Earth, as it rotates, the amount of spotted area visible will vary. So if the star's rotation period is such that we see the entire spotted area come into view, the brightness will dip to the minimum when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, and rise again as the star rotates.

So, the maximum brightness is when the unspotted area is fully facing us, and minimum when the spotted area is fully facing us.

So, the maximum flux F_max = flux from unspotted hemisphere. Wait, but the star's total flux is F_total = 4πRstar² σ Teff^4, but when only the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is (assuming a star as a sphere, and the spots are on one hemisphere). So, when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the area is 2πRstar² (a hemisphere area is 2πR²), and the flux is 2πRstar² σ Teff^4.

Wait, no, wait. Let me be precise. The star's surface area is 4πRstar². Each hemisphere ( northern and southern) is 2πRstar². The spots cover 20% of the entire surface. So, the spotted area is 0.2 * 4πR² = 0.8π R². So, the unspotted area is 4π R² - 0.8π R² = 3.2 π R². Wait, but that can't be right, because 20% is 0.2, so the spotted area is 0.2 * 4π R² = 0.8π R². So, the spotted area is 0.8 π R².

But wait, the spots are on one hemisphere. So, when the star rotates so that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the area we see is 2π R². But of that, 0.2 * 4π R² is the total spots. Wait, no, if the spots are spread over one hemisphere, the area of spots on that hemisphere is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². Because the total spotted area is 0.2 of the entire star, which is 4π R². So each hemisphere is 2π R², so the spotted area on one hemisphere is (0.2) * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R². So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the area of spots visible is 0.4 π R².

So, the flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is:

F_spotted = (unspotted area on this hemisphere) * σ Teff^4 + (spotted area) * σ (Teff - ΔT)^4.

Wait, but no. The unspotted area on the hemisphere facing us is 2π R² minus the spotted area on that hemisphere.

Wait, the unspotted area on the hemisphere is (2π R²) - (0.4 π R²) ) = 1.6 π R².

So, the flux from the unspotted part is 1.6 π R² * σ (6000)^4.

The flux from the spotted part is 0.4 π R² * σ (5000)^4.

So, total flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:

F_spotted_total = 1.6 π R² σ (6000^4) + 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4 )

When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

F_unspotted_total = 2π R² σ (6000^4). Because the entire hemisphere is unspotted.

So, the maximum flux is F_unspotted_total, and the minimum is F_spotted_total.

Wait, but wait a second: when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire 2π R² is unspotted, so that's correct. And when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the unspotted area is 1.6 π R², and spots are 0.4 π R².

So, the brightness variation is F_max - F_min.

Wait, no, actually, the brightness variation is F_min - F_max. Or is it the other way around? Because when the spots are visible, the flux is lower, so F_spotted_total < F_unspotted_total.

So, the amplitude (the change in brightness) is F_unspotted_total - F_spotted_total.

Wait, but in reality, the maximum brightness is F_unspotted_total, and the minimum is F_spotted_total. So the change is F_unspotted_total - F_spotted_total.

So, let's compute that.

Compute F_unspotted_total:

F_un = 2 π R² σ (6000)^4.

Compute F_spotted_total:

F_sp = [ (1.6 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 ) + (0.4 π R²) * σ (5000)^4 ) ]

So, F_sp = π R² σ [ 1.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(5000^4) ]

So, the difference ΔF is F_un - F_sp.

ΔF = 2 π R² σ (6000^4) - [ π R² σ (1.6 *6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4) ]

Factor out π R² σ:

ΔF = π R² σ [ 2*(6000^4) - (1.6*6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4 ) ]

Simplify inside the brackets:

= [ 2 * 6000^4 - 1.6 *6000^4 - 0.4 *5000^4 ]

= (0.4 *6000^4 ) - (0.4 *5000^4 )

= 0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 )

So, ΔF = π R² σ * 0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute this numerical value.

But perhaps I can find the fractional change in brightness.

The relative change in brightness would be ΔF / F_un.

Because F_un is the maximum brightness, and F_sp is the minimum.

So, fractional change (deltaF / F_un) = [ ΔF ] / F_un.

Compute that.

ΔF = F_un - F_sp.

So, (ΔF)/(F_un) = [ F_un - F_sp ] / F_un = 1 - (F_sp / F_un )

Compute F_sp / F_un:

F_sp = π R² σ [ 1.6*(6000^4 ) + 0.4*(5000^4) ]

F_un = 2 π R² σ (6000^4 )

So, F_sp / F_un = [1.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(5000^4) ] / (2 *6000^4 )

Factor numerator:

= [ (1.6 *6000^4 ) + (0.4 *5000^4 ) ] / (2 *6000^4 )

= [ (1.6 + 0.4 (5000/6000)^4 ) *6000^4 ] / (2 *6000^4 )

Simplify:

= [1.6 + 0.4 (5/6)^4 ] / 2

Compute (5/6)^4.

5/6 is approximately 0.8333. (0.8333)^4 is roughly (0.8333)^2 = ~0.6944, squared again is ~0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823.

So,

≈ 1.6 + 0.4 * 0.4823 = 1.6 + 0.1929 = 1.7929.

Divide by 2: 1.7929 / 2 ≈ 0.89645.

So, F_sp / F_un ≈ 0.89645.

So, (ΔF) / F_un = 1 - 0.89645 = 0.10355, or about 10.355%.

So, the fractional change in brightness due to the spots is about 10.355%.

Wait, but wait. Is this correct? Because when the star is without spots (the other hemisphere), the flux is higher. So, when the spots are visible, the flux is lower, which would cause the light curve to dip by 10.355% relative to the maximum.

Wait, but wait, when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is higher than the average, and when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is lower than the average.

Wait, perhaps the average flux is between F_un and F_sp. So, the actual amplitude of the light curve would be the difference between F_un and F_sp, which is about 10.355% of F_un.

So, the brightness variation amplitude is about 10.355%.

Wait, but how does this compare to the planet's effect?

When a planet transits the star, it blocks some of the light. The dip in brightness is given by (Area of planet / Area of star) * ( (Teff)^4 / (Teff)^4 ), but wait, no, because the planet only blocks the light, so the flux dip is (R_planet^2) / (R_star^2) ) times the total flux.

Wait, the dip is (R_p / R_s)^2 * F_total.

Wait, assuming the star is a perfect blackbody, but during transit, the dip is simply the ratio of the areas. Because the planet blocks a part of the star, so the observed flux is F_total * (1 - (R_p/R_s)^2 ). So the dip is (R_p/R_s)^2 * F_total.

So, the fractional dip is (R_p/R_s)^2.

In this case, the fractional change we found earlier due to the spots is about 10.355%. So, we need to set (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.10355.

Wait, but wait. Because the star's brightness variation due to the spots is a dip of about 10.355% when the spots are fully visible. So, the amplitude is 10.355%.

So, for the planet, the amplitude would be (R_p/R_s)^2, which we need to set equal to 10.355%.

So, set (R_p/R_s)^2 ≈ 0.10355.

Taking square root: R_p/R_s ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3217.

Which is approximately 0.32, which matches option D) ~0.32.

Wait, but wait. Did I do all the calculations right? Let me double-check.

Another approach: perhaps the brightness variation is the difference between the maximum and minimum.

Wait, I think I considered the maximum to be when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, and the minimum when the spotted is.

But perhaps the average brightness is somewhere in between, but the amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation. No, the problem says the amplitude of the signal.

Wait, but the problem says "periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation." So, the amplitude is the maximum dip. So, the dip is about 10.355% of the maximum brightness.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_un = 2 π R² σ (6000)^4.

When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_sp = 1.6 π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

F_sp is the flux in that case.

So, the dip is F_un - F_sp = ΔF.

The fractional dip is ΔF / F_un.

Which we found to be 10.355% approximately.

So, the planet's effect needs to cause the same dip, which is (R_p/R_s)^2 * F_total = ΔF_planet.

But wait, when the planet transits, the dip is (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * F_total. Because F_total is the total flux, so the dip is (R_p^2 / R_s^2)*F_total.

So, the dip amplitude is (R_p/R_s)^2 * F_total.

We want this to be equal to the dip caused by the spots, which is ΔF = F_un - F_sp.

Wait, but in the case of the spots, F_un is not the total flux of the star, because F_un is the flux when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, the total flux of the star without any spots would be F_total = 4π Rstar² σ (6000)^4.

But when the star has spots, the average flux over a rotation period would be lower, but for the purposes of this problem, we are considering the maximum and minimum fluxes during the rotation.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me clarify.

In the spot scenario, the maximum flux is F_un = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

Minimum flux is F_sp = 1.6π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

The amplitude (dip) is F_un - F_sp = 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

The dip is this value, which is the decrease in flux when spots are visible.

In the planet case, the dip is (R_p/R_s)^2 * F_total.

Where F_total is 4π Rstar² σ (6000)^
