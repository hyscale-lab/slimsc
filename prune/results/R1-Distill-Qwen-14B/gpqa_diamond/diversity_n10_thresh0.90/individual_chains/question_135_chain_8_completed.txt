Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the decay of a boson. Let me read through the question again and try to understand what's being asked.

The problem gives a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ fψ̄ f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think this describes how the boson X interacts with fermions. So the X boson is coupling to these fermions, and the term (v + X(y)) suggests that v is the vacuum expectation value, maybe like in the Higgs mechanism?

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So I need to figure out which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into, considering their masses.

Wait, kinematically allowed means that the mass of the boson needs to be at least twice the mass of the fermions it's decaying into. Because each fermion would have to have energy at least equal to their rest mass, right? So if X is 6 GeV, the decay products' combined mass can't exceed 6 GeV. So each fermion pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Looking at the options, each option lists possible decay channels. Let me think about the masses of the known fermions:

- Electron (e) and positron: negligible mass, about 0.0005 GeV each. So 2m_e is almost nothing. So X can decay into e+ e-.

- Muon (μ) and antimuon: mass about 0.105 GeV each. 2m_mu is about 0.21 GeV, which is way less than 6 GeV. So that's allowed.

- Tau (τ) and antitau: mass about 1.777 GeV each. 2m_tau is about 3.554 GeV. 3.554 is less than 6, so tau pair is allowed.

- Up (u) and anti-up: mass is like 2-5 MeV, so way below 6 GeV. Same with down (d), strange (s), and charm (c) quarks. Wait, but wait: the quark masses are a bit more tricky. Because in reality, when you produce quark-antiquark pairs, you need to consider the pair's mass, but since quarks are confined, perhaps in the decay, X could annihilate into quark pairs, but the mass is considered as the rest mass of the quarks. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that X can decay into any fermion pair where the sum of the masses is less than X's mass.

Wait, but wait. For charged leptons, their masses are known. For quarks, their masses are a bit more ambiguous, but for the sake of this problem, perhaps we can take their current masses. Let's list some typical masses:

Electron: ~0.000511 GeV
Muon: ~0.105 GeV
Tau: ~1.777 GeV
Up quark: ~2.2 MeV (so 0.0022 GeV)
Down quark: ~4.7 MeV
Strange: ~95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
Charm: ~1.28 GeV
Bottom: ~4.1-4.7 GeV (depending on source)
Top: ~173 GeV

So, the decays X can be into fermion-antifermion pairs where the sum of their masses is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let's go through the options and check which decay channels are possible.

Option A: X→b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

But wait, the bottom quark mass is around 4.5 GeV. So 2 * 4.5 is 9 GeV, which is way above X's mass of 6 GeV. So decays into b bbar are not allowed. So option A includes b, which can't happen. So option A is not correct.

Option B: X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Check the masses: c quark is about 1.28 GeV. 2 * 1.28 is 2.56 GeV, which is under 6 GeV. So c cbar is allowed.

Tau is 3.55 GeV, which is allowed. Mu is 0.21 GeV, allowed. e is negligible.

But wait, the s quark is 0.095 GeV, so 2 * 0.095 is 0.19, which is fine. u and d are negligible. So all the particles in option B's decay channels are allowed, except maybe any that I'm missing.

Wait, what about charm? The mass is 1.28 GeV, so 2.56 <6. So yes, allowed.

But option B also includes c cbar, which is allowed. So that's a possible decay.

Option C: same as B but also includes t tbar and tau+ tau-. Wait, top quark is way too heavy. 2m_t is about 346 GeV, way above 6 GeV. So including t tbar is impossible. So option C is incorrect because it includes top quarks.

Option D: X→b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

But as before, the bottom quark is 4.5 GeV, so 9 GeV needed. X is 6 GeV, so decay into b bbar is not allowed. So option D is incorrect because it includes b.

So the only option where all decay channels are allowed is option B. Let me double-check the options.

Option B includes c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Each of these fermion pairs has a combined mass less than 6 GeV.

c cbar: 2.56 GeV.

s sbar: 0.19 GeV.

u ubar: negligible.

d dbar: negligible.

tau+ tau-: 3.55 GeV.

mu+ mu-: 0.21 GeV.

e+ e-: negligible.

All of these are allowed. So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but looking back at the options, in option B, the decay into c cbar is included. I should confirm: the X has enough mass to decay into c and cbar. Which it does (2 * 1.28 GeV is 2.56 GeV <6 GeV). So yes, allowed.

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. The decays must satisfy the condition that the total mass of the decay products does not exceed the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), but the bottom quark (\( b \)) has a mass of approximately 4.5 GeV. Thus, \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} \), which exceeds the mass of \( X \). Therefore, \( b\bar{b} \) is not allowed, and this option is incorrect.

2. **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c} \), \( s\bar{s} \), \( u\bar{u} \), \( d\bar{d} \), \( \tau^+\tau^- \), \( \mu^+\mu^- \), and \( e^+\,e^- \).  
   - \( c\bar{c} \): \( m_c \approx 1.28 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_c = 2.56 \, \text{GeV} \), which is allowed.  
   - \( s\bar{s} \): \( m_s \approx 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_s = 0.19 \, \text{GeV} \), which is allowed.  
   - \( u\bar{u} \) and \( d\bar{d} \): Both have negligible masses, so their decays are allowed.  
   - \( \tau^+\tau^- \): \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_\tau = 3.554 \, \text{GeV} \), which is allowed.  
   - \( \mu^+\mu^- \): \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_\mu = 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \), which is allowed.  
   - \( e^+\,e^- \): The electron mass is negligible, so this decay is allowed.  
   All decay channels in this option are kinematically allowed.

3. **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), but the top quark (\( t \)) has a mass of approximately 173 GeV. Thus, \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} \), which far exceeds the mass of \( X \). Therefore, \( t\bar{t} \) is not allowed, and this option is incorrect.

4. **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), but as explained in Option A, \( b\bar{b} \) is not allowed because \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} \), which exceeds the mass of \( X \). Therefore, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The only option where all decay channels are kinematically allowed is **Option B**.

Answer: B
