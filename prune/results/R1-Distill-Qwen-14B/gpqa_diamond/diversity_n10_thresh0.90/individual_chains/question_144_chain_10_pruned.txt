Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. They give the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. The options are in terms of meters, so I guess I need to compute some distance.

Wait, I remember that particles like mesons decay, and the mean lifetime is related to their width. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle! The uncertainty in energy relates to the uncertainty in time, which is the lifetime. And then once I have the lifetime, I can find the decay length by considering the speed and lifetime.

So the formula I think is Γ = ħ / τ, where Γ is the decay width, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and τ is the mean lifetime. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, particles are moving when they decay, so the mean decay distance would be the product of the velocity (v) and the lifetime (τ). So mean distance L = v * τ.

But how do I find the velocity? The particle is produced with energy E_X which is higher than its rest mass, so it's moving relativistically. I think I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. 

The energy E is related to the momentum p and mass m by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². I can solve for p. Let's compute that.

Wait, E_X is given as 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV. So in units where c=1 (like in particle physics), E = sqrt( p² + m² ), so p = sqrt( E² - m² ). Plugging in the numbers: E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV.

So p = sqrt(8² - 1.2²) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56). Let me compute that: 62.56's square root is about 7.91 GeV/c. So p ≈ 7.91 GeV/c.

Then, the velocity v can be found using the relation between momentum and velocity. The relativistic expression for momentum is p = gamma * m * v, but I think I can find v using p = (gamma * m) * v. Alternatively, since beta = v/c = p c / E. Oh, right, beta is p c / E.

So beta = (p c) / E. Wait, but here E is in GeV, and p is GeV/c. Let me think: p c has units of GeV. E is GeV. So beta = (p c) / (E) → (7.91 GeV/c * c ) / (8 GeV) ) → 7.91 / 8 ≈ 0.98875. So beta is about 0.98875. That's v/c ≈ 0.9888, so v ≈ 0.9888c.

But wait, I should be precise with units. Let's compute it more accurately. p = sqrt(8^2 -1.2^2) = sqrt(64 -1.44) = sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV/c.

So beta = (p c) / E → (7.91 GeV/c * c) / (8 GeV) → simplifies to 7.91 /8 = 0.98875. So v = 0.98875 c.

Now, I need to compute the mean decay distance. So L = v * τ. But τ is ħ / Γ. 

Wait, Γ is given as 320 MeV. I should convert that to GeV to match units. 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / (Γ). But ħ in units where ħc is about 197.33 MeV fm (femtometers). Wait, perhaps it's better to compute τ in seconds.

Let me recall the constants. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

Wait, let me confirm: ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm / c²? Or perhaps I should just use the value in appropriate units for calculation.

Wait, another approach: since Γ is given in GeV, and ħ in GeV·s, then τ = ħ / Γ.

So ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that: 6.582 divided by 0.32 is about 20.56875? Wait no, 0.32 is the denominator. 6.582 / 0.32 → 20.56875? Wait, 0.32 * 20 = 6.4, so 0.32 * 20.5 is 6.56. So 6.582 is about 20.56875 * 0.32 = 6.582. So yes, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 20.56875e-25 → 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So τ ≈ 2.057e-24 seconds.

Now, the mean decay distance L is v * τ. So v is approximately 0.9888c, and c is about 3e8 m/s.

So L ≈ 0.9888 * 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 0.9888 * 3e8 ≈ 2.9664e8 m/s.

Then, multiply by 2.057e-24 s:

2.9664e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s = (2.9664 * 2.057) x 10^(8-24) m.

Compute 2.9664 * 2.057: Let's approximate.

2 * 2.057 = 4.114. 0.9664 *2.057 ≈ approx 0.9664*2=1.9328, 0.9664 *0.057≈0.055. So total ≈ 1.9
