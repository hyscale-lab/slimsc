Okay, so I have this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that in relativity, things get a bit tricky because you can't just add velocities like you normally would. Oh right, there's that velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, so when they say 'relative speed,' do they mean the speed of one as seen from the other? I think so. So I need to calculate how fast one is moving relative to the other.

I recall the formula for adding velocities in special relativity. The formula is: 

v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²))

Wait, no wait. Because both are moving in the same direction. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, from A's frame, B is moving at v = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5*0.6)c²/c²) ).

Wait, let me plug in the numbers correctly. Let me make sure I have the formula right. Oh right, the formula is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)), but since v1 is the speed of the frame, the observer is moving at v1 relative to the other. Wait, maybe I should pick one astronaut as the reference frame and compute the other's speed.

Let me think. Let's say astronaut A is the one moving at 0.6c, and I want to find B's speed relative to A. So in the lab frame, B's speed is 0.5c. So according to A, what's B's speed?

The formula is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v2 v1)/(c²)). Wait, no, I think I got it reversed. Because sometimes the formula is (u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)) ), where u is the velocity in lab frame, and v is the velocity of the moving frame. So in this case, the moving frame is A, which is moving at v=0.6c relative to the lab. So from A's perspective, what's B's speed?

Wait, no. Wait, from the lab frame, B is moving at 0.5c. So u is 0.5c, and the frame is moving at v=0.6c. So u' = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Calculating numerator: (0.5 - 0.6)c = (-0.1)c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² ) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So u' = (-0.1 c) / 0.7 ≈ -0.142857 c. So the speed is about 0.142857 c, but since speed is magnitude, it's 0.143c. Wait, but the options have either 0.1c or 0.14c. So 0.14c would be close, rounding off. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. So that would either be option C or D.

Wait, let's double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the velocity of A as seen from B. Because relative speed would be the same in magnitude, regardless of direction, so either way, the speed would be 0.14c in magnitude.

So the relative speed is about 0.14c, so options C and D have that. Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Hmm, the total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut.

Each astronaut's energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I need to compute gamma for each and sum their energies.

First astronaut's mass is 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma for astronaut 1: 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut's mass is 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma for astronaut 2: 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2 ) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E = 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says E=5mc².

So the total energy would be approximately 5.96 mc². So the correct option would be C, with v_rel ≈0.14c and E≈5.96 mc².

Wait a second, but wait. The problem says "the total energy of the system." Wait, in relativity, the total energy isn't just the
