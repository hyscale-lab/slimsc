Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Michael additions. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to figure it out step by step.

First, I remember that the Michael reaction is a 1,4-addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile, usually an enolate, attacks the beta position, leading to a conjugate addition.

The question has three parts: reactions A, B, and C. I need to find the reactants and major products for each and match them with the options given. Let's tackle each part one by one.

Starting with reaction (A): dimethyl malonate reacts with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). So NaOEt is a base, and in ethanol, it likely deprotonates the alpha position of dimethyl malonate to form an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. When deprotonated, the enolate would attack the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but wait, more accurately, it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the substituents on the double bond would be a p-tolyl group and a methyl ester. So the structure is CH2-C(O)OCH3 with the p-tolyl group on the other side of the double bond. Wait, no, wait. E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the p-tolyl group attached to the central carbon? No, wait, the structure is CH2=CH-(p-tolyl)COOCH3? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think.

Actually, the correct structure for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CHC(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the substituent is on the third carbon. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbering. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OOCCH3? Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to think of it as the double bond being between C2 and C3, with the p-tolyl group on C3, and the ester on C3 as well. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 with the p-tolyl attached to C3. Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-CO-OCH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the correct structure is CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Wait, but that would be 3-(p-tolyl)acrylic acid methyl ester. So the double bond is between C1 and C2: CH2=CH, then C3 has the p-tolyl and the ester. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)(COOCH3). But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=C(CO2Me)-C(p-tolyl)H. Hmm, perhaps that's the structure.

Anyway, when the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate), the attack happens at the beta carbon (the more substituted one, perhaps). So the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) would have a negative charge on the central carbon, attacking the beta carbon of the acrylate. So
