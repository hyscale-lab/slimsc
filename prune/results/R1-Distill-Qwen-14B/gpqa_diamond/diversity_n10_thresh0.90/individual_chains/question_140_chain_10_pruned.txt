Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is talking about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K, which is around 3 degrees Celsius, right? So B is probably a solid at room temperature but melts just a bit above that.

Next, the product of a keto acid reacting with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Also, X and its analogs are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Hmm, thinking about common reagents... Maybe something like a strong base or a strong oxidizing agent?

Let me try to break it down into parts.

First, the reaction between X and Y. Violent reaction, so maybe something reactive like a metal reacting with an acid, releasing hydrogen gas. Wait, but the gas W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. What's a gas that fits that? Let's think: hydrogen gas is H2, but each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. That doesn't fit. Maybe helium? No, He is a noble gas, doesn't react much. Wait, what about CO2? No, that's a gas but it's a molecule. Wait, another thought: NH3? No, that's not a gas formed in such reactions. Wait, maybe H2O? No, but wait, if the gas is H2, then each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, but the molecule would have 2H, so 2 protons and 0 neutrons. That doesn't equal. Alternatively, maybe CH4? No, that's a gas too but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the gas's molecule has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. Let's think of elements where the number of neutrons is equal to the number of protons. For example, nitrogen has 7 protons and 7 neutrons in its isotope N-14. But as a gas, maybe it's N2? No, because N2 has 2 atoms each with 7 protons and 7 neutrons, so the molecule would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So each molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. Wait, that would make the total for the molecule equal. So the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Wait, wait, the problem says the gas's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So for each molecule, protons = neutrons.

Let me think of possible gases. Hydrogen? H2 has 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No. Helium? He is He, 2 protons, 2 neutrons (if He-4) but each He atom has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So He molecule would have 2*2=4 protons and 2*2=4 neutrons. So that's equal. But wait, is He a gas produced in this reaction? Maybe in some cases, but usually, when metals react with
