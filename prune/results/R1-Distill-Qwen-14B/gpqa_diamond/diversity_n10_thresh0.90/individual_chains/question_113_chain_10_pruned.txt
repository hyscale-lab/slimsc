Okay, so I've got this question about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's see. The question gives me FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spec data, and I need to pick the correct formula from four options: A is C6H12O2, B is C6H10O, C is C6H10O2, and D is C6H12O.

Starting with the FTIR data. The peaks are at 3000 (broad), 1700, and 1650. The broad peak at 3000 is probably O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, the broadness suggests it's an O-H from an alcohol rather than a carboxylic acid, which also has a broad peak but maybe around a similar region. Alternatively, an -OH group in a ketone? No, ketones don't have O-H. So, maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Then the strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, carboxylic acid, or maybe an amide. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, maybe an aromatic ring or conjugated carbonyl. Wait, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl. Like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl group. That would cause the carbonyl to have a lower wavenumber. So perhaps the compound has both a carbonyl and another group, like an aromatic ring or something else conjugated.

Looking at the NMR data: there are peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl refers to CH2 groups in alkenes, so that means the compound has double bonds. So the structure must have some alkene groups.

Mass Spec: fragment peak at m/z 45. What fragments give 45? Let me think. 45 is the mass of (CH3)2O, which is 15 (CH3) *2 + 16 (O) = 46? Wait, no, wait. Wait, (CH3)2O is (15*2) + 16 = 46. Oh, so maybe that's not it. Alternatively, the fragment could be an ethyl group attached to something else. Wait, another possibility: the cleavage of an ester group. For example, in an ester, maybe the loss of the R-O- group. Alternatively, 45 could be a CH3CO (acetyl) group, but that's 43. Wait, no, maybe the mass is 45. Let me think about the possible fragments.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formulas given are all C6H... O... Let's list them:

A) C6H12O2: degrees of unsaturation. For C6H12O2. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree: could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a ring plus a carbonyl, etc.

B) C6H10O: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. Two degrees: maybe a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

C) C6H10O2: (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees of unsaturation.

D) C6H12O: (2*6 +2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. One degree.

So the IR has a carbonyl. Let's see. So the carbonyl groups could contribute to the degrees of unsaturation. For example, a ketone (one double bond) or an ester (which has a carbonyl, so one double bond). Then, another degree of unsaturation could be a ring or another double bond.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, meaning there's a double bond. So that's another double bond. So if the carbonyl is a carbonyl group (like an ester: R-O-CO-O-R), but wait, no, that's for an ester. Wait, the ester group would have a carbonyl and an ether-like linkage. Or a ketone, which is a carbonyl.

Wait, let's think about the IR. 1700 is a strong peak, which is a carbonyl. 1650 might be an aromatic ring's C=C stretching, or maybe conjugation with another group. So if the compound has an aromatic ring, that would account for another double bond. But wait, looking at the options, the molecular formulas are C6H... So for example, benzene is C6H6, which has 3 degrees of unsaturation (3 rings or double bonds). But our options have varying H counts. Let's see.

Wait, if the compound has a carbonyl (so 1), and a double bond (another), that's 2 degrees. Which would fit options B and C, which have 2 degrees of unsaturation. Options A and D have 1. So perhaps the compound has a carbonyl and a double bond, sum to 2, so B and C are possible.

Wait, but the initial FTIR also showed a broad peak at 3000. That suggests an O-H group. So, the compound has an O-H. So that's an -OH group. So, the possible functional groups are -OH, carbonyl (like ester, ketone, etc.), and a double bond (since NMR shows vinyl Hs).

So, the formula must have O and possibly another O. Let's look at the options:

A is C6H12O2: two oxygen atoms. So maybe it's an ester (RCOOR') or a ketone with an alcohol group, but that would require more O's. Wait, but the formula is C6H12O2. So oxygen count is 2.

Wait, so if it's a ketone and an alcohol, that's two O's. But the FTIR shows a broad O-H, which is an alcohol. So that would fit. But then the carbonyl would be from the ketone (so FTIR at 1700). But then where does the 1650 come in? That's a lower wavenumber for a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe it's an ester. Or perhaps the 1650 is from conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is an aromatic ring. So if the compound has a benzene ring, that would have a C=C absorption around 1600. But the 1650 is a bit higher, so maybe it's an unsaturated carbonyl. Like an enone (conjugated C=O and C=C). So the carbonyl is at 1700, and the conjugated C=C is at 1650.

So in this case, the structure would have a conjugated enone (so two double bonds, one in the C=O and another conjugated to it). Plus an -OH group.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which are protons on a double bond. So that suggests a CH2=CH group, not necessarily conjugated. Or maybe it's a substituted double bond adjacent to the carbonyl.

Now, the mass spec fragment m/z=45. Let's think about what could cause that. 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O? Wait, (CH3)2O is 15*2 +16=46. Oh, so not 45. Or maybe CH3CO-? That would be 43 (12+1*3 +12 +16 +1*1? Wait, CH3CO is 43. So maybe 45 is something else. Wait, 45 is also the molecular weight of CH2(OH)COOH? No, that's more than 45. Alternatively, maybe it's the tropylium ion (C7H7+) but no, that's 91. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is an ethyl group attached to something. Or maybe the loss of a larger group leaving behind a smaller fragment. For example, if the molecule is an ester, maybe the ester group breaks off, leaving behind a fragment. Wait, for example, if the molecule is something like CH2CH2COO-R, and the ester breaks into R-O-CO-CH2CH2- ..., but that might not result in 45.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the options. Let's think about possible structures.

Option C is C6H10O2. So that's six carbons, 10 hydrogens, two oxygens. Degrees of unsaturation is 2, as calculated earlier.

Possible structures: maybe a cyclic ester (lactone), but then we'd have a carbonyl and a ring. But that would account for two degrees. Or a diethyl ester, but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe an ester with a double bond.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a di-substituted ester with a double bond. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2-... but that would require more carbons.

Wait, but the mass spectrum shows a fragment at 45. Let's think about the possible structures and what would break off to give 45.

Let me think about the molecular formula. If the molecular ion is at m/z equal to the molecular weight. Let's compute the molecular weights of the options:

A) C6H12O2: (6*12)=72 + (12*1)=12 + (2*16)=32. Total: 72+12+32=116.

B) C6H10O: 72 +10 +16= 98.

C) C6H10O2: 72+10+32=114.

D) C6H12O: 72+12+16=100.

So the fragments would be much lower. The fragment at 45 would be a part of the molecule. So perhaps it's a common ion like CH3CO+ (43), but 45 is 2 more. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH2)2O which is 44 (12*2 + 2*2 +16= 24 +4 +16=44). Close but not 45. Wait, wait, (CH3)2CO: 58. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a ketone. Like breaking off a methyl group attached to a carbonyl. For example, if a molecule has a (CH3)CO group, which would have a fragment of 45? Let's calculate: (CH3)CO+ would be 12 + (3*1) + 12 +16= 43. No, that's 43. Hmm.

Wait, another thought. The mass of 45 could correspond to the fragment CH2CH2O, but that's 46. Alternatively, maybe it's a (CH2)2O+ ion: (12*2 +2*2 +16) = 24+4+16=44. Still not 45.

Wait, maybe it's a different structure. If the molecule is an ester with a (CH2)2 group attached. For example, ethyl something. The ethyl group is 46. But the fragment is 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a (CH2)3O group: 12*3 + 3*2 +16 = 36 +6 +16=58. No, that's too big.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from the loss of a larger group. For example, if the molecule is a six-carbon ester, and it loses a larger fragment, leaving a smaller one. Let's think: if the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C), like methyl cyclohex-2-enoate or something. The structure might be something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2-O-? Wait, no, perhaps a cyclic ester. Alternatively, maybe it's an ortho ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the 1H NMR shows vinyl protons. So the compound has a CH2=CH- group. So in
