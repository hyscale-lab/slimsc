Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the problem says we have a bunch of identical systems, each with a particle that's behaving according to a certain wave function. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. 

Wait, the wave function is a complex function because of the 'i' term. But when they measure the position of the particles, none are found outside x=1 and x=3. So the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. That makes me think about the probability distribution, right? Because in quantum mechanics, the probability of finding a particle at a certain position is related to the square of the absolute value of the wave function.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. To find the probability, I need to calculate the modulus squared of this wave function. The modulus squared is |ψ(x)|², which is ψ*(x) * ψ(x). 

Let me compute that. The complex conjugate of ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5i. So multiplying these together:

ψ*(x) * ψ(x) = [ (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5i ] * [ (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i ]

This looks like (a + b)(a - b) where a is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and b is 0.5i. So it becomes a² - (0.5i)². Wait, no, because (a + ib)(a - ib) = a² + b². Oh right, because (i squared is -1), so the second term becomes -i²*(0.5)^2*(1)^2, which is -(-1)*0.25. So the modulus squared is (a²/(1 + x)) + (0.5)^2.

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1 + x) + 0.25. 

Now, the probability of finding the particle in a region is the integral of |ψ|² over that region. But the problem states that when measurements are made, all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. That implies that the wave function must be zero outside this interval. Because otherwise, there would be some probability of finding the particle outside.

Wait, but actually, the problem says that when measuring, none were found outside. So the wave function must be zero outside of x=1 to x=3. So for x <1 and x>3, ψ(x) =0. But in the given ψ(x), it's (a / sqrt(1 +x)) -0.5i. So that suggests that this function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. But wait, the function as given is (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Hmm, that's a complex function, and for x>3, the denominator sqrt(1+x) is real, so the function isn't zero automatically. So maybe the function is only defined (non-zero
