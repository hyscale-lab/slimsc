Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out which compound E is formed in the given reaction sequence. Let's start by breaking down each step carefully.

The problem statement gives a series of reactions leading from compound A to E, and also provides some hints. Let me jot down each step and see what I can deduce.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to give compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints given are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of compound A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while compound E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are:
A) 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one
B) 2,3,4-trimethylcyclopentan-1-one
C) 4-methylcycloheptan-1-one
D) 2,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclobutan-1-one

Hmm. Let's tackle each part step by step.

Starting with hint a), which involves a reaction of compound A with a phosphorous ylide. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is the ylid part. So, the structure of that product must be a cyclopentane ring with substituents.

Let me draw that product structure mentally. 1,2-dimethylcyclopentane ring, and at position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be a CH2-C(CH3)= group? Or more accurately, the substituent is a (propan-2-ylidene) group, which is CH2-C(CH3)- where it's attached via the central carbon?

Wait, the structure would be cyclopentane with methyl groups on carbons 1 and 2, and on carbon 4, a substituent of a propan-2-ylidene group. But wait, ylides are typically structures like =CH- attached to P. Wait, no, when the ylide reacts, it's an addition. So, probably, the ylide is acting as a carbanion, attacking an electrophilic position.

Wait, maybe I should think about what this product tells us about compound A. When compound A reacts with a phosphorous ylide, it forms this cyclopentane derivative. What's the starting material for that reaction?

Phosphorous ylides are typically used in the Wittig reaction. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting an aldehyde or ketone with a ylide. So, compound A is likely an aldehyde or ketone. Because when it reacts with the ylide, it forms an alkene.

Wait, but the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane ring has substituents. Let me think, the substituent at position 4 is propan-2-ylidene, which is a CH2-C(CH3)= group. So that's a methylene group attached to a cyclopentane, but part of an alkene.

Wait, no. The propan-2-ylidene group is =CH-C(CH3)2? Or maybe it's the structure where the substituent is a CH2 connected to a CH(CH3) group. Hmm, perhaps I should draw this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the Wittig reaction adds a double bond. So, if A is a ket
