Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details right.

The question is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The conductor's radius is R, and the cavity has a radius r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So imagine like a bigger sphere (the conductor) with a smaller spherical hole somewhere off-center.

Now, they've placed a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are larger than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are four different expressions for E, all involving 1/(4 pi epsilon_0) times q divided by some squared distance.

Hmm. I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields. Since the conductor is uncharged, but there's a charge inside the cavity, how does that affect the field outside?

Wait, I think about the concept of electrostatic shielding. In a conductor, charges reside on the surface, right? But wait, the conductor is neutral. So when you have a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge opposite to the inside charge, but since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge equal to the inside charge. Wait, no, let me think again. If the conductor is neutral, then any induced charge on the inner surface (say, -q) must be balanced by a +q on the outer surface, keeping the total charge of the conductor zero. So the conductor's net charge is zero, so when you place a charge inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) gets an induced -q, and the outer surface has a +q. But wait, no, that's only if the conductor is initially neutral. Wait, the problem says the conductor is uncharged, so yes, that's the case.

Wait, but the conductor is a spherical shell, so the outer surface's charge would distribute uniformly because it's a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium. So the electric field outside the conductor would be the same as if all the charge on the outer surface was concentrated at the center. So the field outside (at point P) would be due to the outer surface charge, which is +q.

Wait, but wait a second. The point P is outside the conductor, so the field there is due to the charges on the outer surface of the conductor. But the outer surface has a charge of +q, because the conductor was initially neutral, and the inner surface has -q due to the +q inside the cavity. So yes, the outer surface has +q.

Now, since the outer surface is a conductor, the charge +q will reside on the outer surface and distribute uniformly. So the electric field outside the conductor (point P) would be the same as that produced by a point charge +q at the center of the conductor. Because for a spherical shell, the electric field outside is as if all the charge is concentrated at the center.

But wait, wait, that's only if the outer surface is a perfect sphere, right? But in this case, the cavity is off-center. So in reality, the outer surface isn't a perfect sphere. Hmm, but wait, in reality, the conductor is a sphere, R, but the cavity is shifted by s. Would that affect the distribution of the outer charge?

Wait no, because the conductor is a conductor, so the charges on the outer surface will adjust to cancel any internal fields. But wait, the charge inside the cavity is inside the conductor, so the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge -q, but the outer surface's charge is +q. Since the outer surface is a sphere, the charge distribution would be uniform if the conductor is a perfect sphere. Wait, but the conductor's shape is a sphere, so regardless of the cavity's position, the outer surface is still a sphere, so the charge would distribute uniformly. So the field outside the conductor would be as if the charge q is at the center.

Wait, but wait. The center of the conductor is at a different position than the center of the cavity. So perhaps the charge on the outer surface isn't uniformly distributed? Hmm, no, because the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface is a sphere regardless of the cavity's position. Wait, but the cavity is inside the conductor, so the conductor material is in a spherical shape, but the cavity is a smaller sphere not at the center. But the conductor's outer surface is still a sphere of radius R, so the charges on the outer surface would be uniformly distributed because the conductor is a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The conductor is a neutral, spherical shell. Inside, there's a cavity with a charge +q. The inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) will have an induced charge of -q. The conductor's total charge is zero, so the outer surface must have +q. Because the outer surface is a sphere, the charge distribution is uniform. So the electric field outside is due to the +q at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the point P is located at a distance L from the center of the conductor. So the electric field at P would be E = (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) * (q) / L². Because the field outside a conducting shell with charge Q is the same as a point charge at the center.

Looking at the options, option B is E = (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) * q / L². That would seem correct.

But wait, let me think again. Is point P's position relative to the cavity's center affecting the field? Because in the setup, the cavity's center is at a distance s from the conductor's center, and point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center. And l and L are both larger than R.

Wait, but in the conductor's case, the outer surface's charge is +q, and it's uniformly distributed. So the electric field outside would be as if the charge were at the center of the conductor, regardless of where the actual charge inside the cavity is placed. Because the conductor's outer surface charge's distribution is uniform and centered at the conductor's center.

So the position of the +q inside the cavity doesn't affect the external field. The external field only depends on the outer surface's charge, which is +q at the center.

So the electric field at point P would be E = (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) * (q) / L², which is option B.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem gives some other variables like l, s, theta. So why are those present? Because the options have them in the denominator. But I thought that the external field doesn't depend on the internal arrangement once the conductor's outer surface is considered.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the conductor's outer charge distribution. Let me think again.

The conductor is a spherical shell of radius R. The cavity is a sphere of radius r, centered at a point s away from the conductor's center. So the cavity is off-center. Then, when we place +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) will have an induced charge of -q, but the outer surface must have +q because the conductor is neutral.

Wait, but the outer surface is a sphere of radius R, so the outer charge is distributed uniformly on that sphere. So the electric field outside the conductor would be as if all the charge +q is at the center of the conductor, regardless of the position of the cavity's charge.

Therefore, the electric field at point P would be E = (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) * (q) / L², which is option B.

Wait, but why is option D present? Option D is (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) * q / l². That would be the case if the charge were at the center of the cavity, but since the field outside depends only on the outer surface's charge, which is located at the conductor's center, the distance L is the right variable.

So the correct answer must be option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ inside it. The cavity is not centered at the conductor's center but is offset by a distance $s$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

Key points to consider:

1. **Conductor Properties**: Since the conductor is neutral, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) will have an induced charge of $-q$ due to the $+q$ inside the cavity. To maintain charge neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor will have a charge of $+q$.

2. **Outer Surface Charge Distribution**: The outer surface of the conductor is a sphere of radius $R$, and the charge $+q$ on it will distribute uniformly because the conductor is in electrostatic equilibrium. This means the electric field outside the conductor will behave as if all the charge $+q$ is concentrated at the center of the conductor.

3. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: The electric field at a point outside a spherical shell of charge is given by $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \dfrac{q}{r^2}$, where $r$ is the distance from the center of the shell to the point. In this case, the field outside the conductor depends only on the charge $+q$ on the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor to point $P$.

4. **Irrelevance of Internal Geometry**: The position of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity, the offset $s$, and the angle $\theta$ do not affect the electric field outside the conductor. The field outside is determined solely by the charge on the outer surface and the distance $L$.

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$ in the denominator, which is incorrect because the electric field outside the conductor does not depend on the internal geometry or the angle $\theta$.
   - **Option B**: Correct, as it matches the formula for the electric field outside a spherical shell, $E = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \dfrac{q}{L^2}$.
   - **Option C**: Involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$ in the denominator, which is incorrect for the same reason as Option A.
   - **Option D**: Involves $l^2$ in the denominator, which would be correct if the charge were at the center of the cavity, but this is not the case for the electric field outside the conductor.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as the electric field at point $P$ is determined by the charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor to $P$.

Answer: B
