Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read the question again carefully.

Alright, so the problem is about a star whose surface is partially covered by dark spots. When the star doesn't have spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. They're looking at the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—so, without spots divided by with spots.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the number of atoms in different energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels, say level 2 and level 1, is given by the Boltzmann factor: (n2/n1) = exp(- (E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this question, the ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So, when the star is spotted, the ratio is lower. That suggests that the denominator (n2 or n1) is changing? Or wait, the ratio is (n_level1 / n_level2), perhaps? Or maybe the other way around. Let me think: the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher. So the ratio with spots is lower.

Wait, the ratio is n1/n2. Because if the ratio (n1/n2) decreases, that could mean that n2 is increasing, or n1 is decreasing. But in any case, the ratio depends on temperature.

So, the key here is to find how the temperature affects the ratio. But wait, the star's effective temperature is changing when it has spots. So the overall Teff is 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered. But the spots themselves are cooler, right? Because they are dark, they absorb less light, hence appear cooler. But when the spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the photosphere's effective temperature is lower because the spots contribute to a lower overall emission.

Wait, but in the photosphere (the star's surface), the effective temperature is the overall average. So when the spots are present, the average T is 5500 K. But the spots themselves are at a lower temperature than the rest of the photosphere. Hmm, but in the problem, the question is about the ratio in the stellar photosphere. So when the spots are present, the photosphere's effective temp is 5500 K. So I think for the purpose of this problem, the relevant temperature is the effective temperature when spots are present.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. So if the star's photosphere's effective temperature is lower, that would affect the ratio n1/n2. So I think we can model this by considering the ratio when the star is unspotted (T=6000 K) and when it's spotted (T=5500 K). So the ratio is n1/n2 when T is 6000 K, and then again when T is 5500 K.

Wait, but wait. The effective temperature is the overall temperature based on the total luminosity. However, the actual photosphere's temperature might be a mix of the unspotted and spotted regions. But in this problem, the question says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So I think we can treat the photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present. So the ratio is computed at 5500 K and 6000 K.

Wait, the problem states that when the surface is 40% covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So, perhaps the effective temperature is a weighted average. But how does that affect the photosphere's temperature? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question says that in the photosphere, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So I think I can model the ratios using the two different temperatures: 6000 K and 5500 K.

So, the ratio is n1/n2 = exp( (E2 - E1) / (k T) )? Or wait, the Boltzmann equation is (n2/n1) = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So if E2 > E1, then n2/n1 is exp( -deltaE/(kT) ). So, higher T would lead to higher n2/n1 ratio, since the exponent becomes less negative (because deltaE/(kT) is smaller). Wait, no—if T increases, the denominator kT is larger. So deltaE/(kT) gets smaller. So exp(-x) where x is small is closer to 1. So, if T is higher, n2/n1 would be larger (because the exponent is less negative). So, the ratio n1/n2 would be lower when T is higher.

Wait, let me double-check. Suppose E2 > E1. So delta E = E2 - E1 is positive. Then, (n2/n1) = exp( - delta E/(k T) ). So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so (n2/n1) increases. So n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) would decrease.

So, when T is higher, the ratio n1/n2 is lower.

In the problem, when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K) compared to 6000 K when it doesn't. So when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 increases or decreases?

Wait, because when the star has spots, T is lower. So let's think about that. The ratio n1/n2 = (n1)/(n2) = exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ), because (n2/n1) = exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), so (n1/n2) = exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ).

Wait, no, wait: (n2/n1) = exp( [ - (E2 - E1) ] / (k T) ) = exp( -(delta E)/(k T) ). So (n1/n2) = 1/(n2/n1) = exp( (delta E)/(k T) ).

So, higher T would make (delta E)/(k T) smaller. So the exponent is smaller, so n1/n2 is higher when T is higher.

So, when the star has no spots, T is higher (6000 K), so n1/n2 is higher. When the star has spots, T is 5500 K, so n1/n2 is lower. But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So that matches. So without spots, the ratio is higher.

So, the question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So, Factor = (n1/n2)_6000K / (n1/n2)_5500K.

Which is [ exp(delta E/(k * 6000)) ] / [ exp(delta E/(k * 5500)) ].

Simplify that: exp( delta E/(k) [ 1/(6000) - 1/(5500) ] ). So, that's exp( delta E/(k) [ (5500 - 6000)/(6000 * 5500) ) ) ].

Simplify the denominator: the denominator is 6000 *5500 = 33,000,000.

Wait, 6000 * 5500 = (6e3)*(5.5e3) = 33e6 = 3.3e7.

The numerator is 5500 -6000 = -500. So 1/6000 -1/5500 = (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) )= (-500)/(33e6) = -500/(33e6) = -5/(33e3) = approximately -1.515e-5.

So, the exponent is (delta E/(k)) * (-1.515e-5).

But wait, delta E is the energy difference between the two levels, which corresponds to a transition wavelength of 1448 Å.

Hmm, so the transition corresponds to a photon with wavelength 1448 Angstroms. So the energy of that photon is E = hc/lambda.

So, delta E = hc / lambda.

h is Planck's constant, c speed of light.

But let's compute delta E. Let me get the numbers right.

lambda = 1448 A = 1448e-10 meters.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

So E = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (1448e-10) 

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18.

1.9878 / 1.448 ≈ 1.373.

So E ≈ 1.373e-18 J per photon.

But wait, 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So E in eV is (1.373e-18 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 8.57 eV.

So delta E is approximately 8.57 eV per
