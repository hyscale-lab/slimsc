Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I'll take it slow.

So the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small cavity. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center. The cavity has radius r, which is smaller than R. Then, someone places a small positive charge +q inside this cavity.

The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, which makes sense because P is outside. The angle between l and s is theta.

I remember that for conductors, charges reside on the surface. But since the conductor was initially uncharged, I think the charges inside the cavity would induce some redistribution on the inner and outer surfaces. Wait, no, because the conductor was neutral, the charges induced by the cavity's charge might balance it out somehow.

Wait, I think when a charge is inside a conducting shell, the inner surface of the shell will have an induced charge opposite to the enclosed charge. But since the conductor is neutral, wouldn't the outer surface have a charge equal to the enclosed charge? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no: The conductor is initially neutral. When you put a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) will have an induced charge of -q. But because the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance it out. So the outer surface has +q, and the inner has -q.

But wait, the conductor is spherical. So the arrangement is a spherical shell with inner radius r_cavity and outer radius R. The point P is outside, so it's beyond R.

Now, the electric field outside a charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. That's the shell theorem, right? So for a point outside, the field depends only on the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface you choose.

In this case, the outer surface has a charge of +q. So when I consider a Gaussian surface that encloses the conductor, the total charge inside is +q. Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/L².

Wait, but why? Because the induced charges inside the conductor don't affect the external field. The conductor's own charges are on the outer surface, and for any external point, the field behaves as if the charge is at the center.

But wait, the point P's distance from the conductor's center is L, and from the cavity's center is l. Hmm, that might complicate things. Oh, but the E field outside a conductor depends on the total charge on the conductor, regardless of where the charge is placed inside, right?

Wait, no, because the charge inside the cavity is located at a different point, which might affect the distribution of the induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces. But the net charge on the outer surface is +q, so the external field would be as if all the charge is at the center.

Wait, but the placement of the charge inside the cavity affects the inner induced charges. But the overall outer charge is +q, so it should still produce an E field at P as if the +q is at the conductor's center. Because the conductor's shape is spherical, that's important.

But wait, the point P's position is given relative to the cavity's center. Oh, but the conductor's center is s away from the cavity's center. So the distance from P to the conductor's center is L, but to the cavity's center is l. How does that tie in?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

The conductor is neutral, so when +q is placed in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) gets -q, and the outer surface must have +q to keep the conductor neutral. So the outer surface has +q. 

Now, the electric field outside the conductor is just due to the +q on the outer surface. The position of the charge inside the cavity doesn't matter because the induced charges on the inner and outer shells rearrange such that the net charge outside is +q.

But wait, the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform. Therefore, any point outside would experience a field as if the charge is at the center of the sphere.

Wait, but the conductor's center is a distance s away from the cavity's center. So the charge in the cavity is not at the conductor's center. But the outer surface's charge is spread uniformly, so when calculating the field outside, it's as if all the charge is at the conductor's center.

Wait, no. Because the conductor is a sphere, the induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces would adjust. The inner surface would have -q, and the outer +q. But the outer surface's charge would arrange uniformly because the conductor is a sphere. So regardless of where the cavity is located relative to the conductor's center, the outer charge's distribution is uniform. Therefore, the field outside is as if the charge is at the conductor's center.

So for point P, located at L from the conductor's center, the field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/L². Looking at the options, option B matches this.

But wait, the options also have other terms. Let me check each option:

A) 1/(4πε₀) * q/(l - s cosθ)^2
B) 1/(4πε₀) * q/L²
C) 1/(4πε₀) * q/(l + s cosθ)^2
D) 1/(4πε₀) * q/l²

Since the field at P depends only on the total charge outside, which is +q, and point P is at distance L from the conductor's center, the correct expression is option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small cavity inside. The cavity's center is separated by a distance $s$ from the conductor's center, and the cavity has a radius $r < R$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The goal is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the conductor's center and a distance $l$ from the cavity's center. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall). Since the conductor is initially neutral, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$ to maintain charge neutrality. The electric field outside a spherical conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface, regardless of the distribution of the charge on the conductor's surfaces. For a point outside the conductor, the field behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the conductor's center.

At point $P$, which is outside the conductor, the electric field is determined solely by the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is $+q$. The distance from $P$ to the conductor's center is $L$, so the magnitude of the electric field at $P$ is given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

This matches option **B**. The other options are incorrect because they involve terms like $l$, $s$, and $\theta$, which do not affect the external electric field due to the shielding effect of the conductor and the uniform distribution of charge on the outer surface.

Answer: B
