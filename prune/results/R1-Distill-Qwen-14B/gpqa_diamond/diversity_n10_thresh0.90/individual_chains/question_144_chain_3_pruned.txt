Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it. 

The question says that X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance, given production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, with different distances in meters.

I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like distance = c * τ * β, where c is the speed of light, τ is the mean lifetime, and β is the velocity relative to the speed of light.

Wait, but how do I get τ? I think the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ. Oh yes, the uncertainty principle comes into play here. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, units might be tricky here. Oh, right, Γ is the decay width, which is related to the lifetime by τ = ħ / Γ. But I need to make sure the units are consistent. 

So first, I need to compute τ. Let's get the constants straight. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, because when dealing with particle physics, they often use units where ħc is in GeV·fm or something like that. But I'll just use the standard value for now.

Let me write down the values:

E_X = 8 GeV
m_X = 1.2 GeV
Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV

Wait, so Γ is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ. Let's calculate that. 

Plugging in the numbers: τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

But wait, is it ħ divided by Γ or Γ divided by ħ? Because Γ has units of energy, and τ has units of time. Hmm. Oh yes, because Γ = ħ / τ → τ = ħ / Γ. So that calculation seems right.

Next, the velocity β. How do I find β? I think relativistic equations are needed here. So the total energy E of the particle is given, and the mass is m. The energy is E = γ m c². But in natural units (where c=1), E = γ m. So γ = E / m.

E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

Then, β can be found from γ. Because γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). So solving for β:

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) → sqrt(1 - β²) = 1/γ → 1 - β² = 1/γ² → β² = 1 - 1/γ² → β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²).

Calculating that:

γ² = (8/1.2)^2 = (20/3)^2 ≈ 44.4444.

So 1/γ² = 1/44.4444 ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

Taking square root: sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So β ≈ 0.9887.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. Let me compute γ again:

8 / 1.2 = 6.666..., yes. Squaring that: 6.666666...^2 is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.444...

So yes, 1/γ² is 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is approximately 0.9887. So β ≈ 0.9887.

Alternatively, perhaps I should be more precise with the calculation. Let's compute 0.9775^0.5 more accurately.

Let me think: 0.9887^2 = (approx) 0.9775, yeah. So that's correct.

Now, so beta is about 0.9887. 

Now, the mean decay distance L is c * τ * β.

But wait, c is the speed of light, which is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So putting it all together:

L = c * τ * β.

Compute each part:

τ is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

c is 3e8 m/s.

β is approximately 0.9887.

So L = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s * 0.9887.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, multiply 3e8 by 2.056875e-24:

3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3 * 2.056875 * 1e8 *1e-24.

3 * 2.056875 is about 6.170625. The exponents: 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.

So 6.170625e-16 m.

Then multiply this by 0.9887:

6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ approximately 6.107e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, the numbers are around 4e-15, 5e-15, and similar. Hmm, my calculation is coming to about 6e-16 m, which is 0.6e-15 m. But the options don't have this. Wait, perhaps I messed up some units.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, I used τ = ħ / Γ. But perhaps the formula is τ = ħ / (Γ/2), because in some cases, the width is Γ = 2 ħ / τ. Let me think. Oh, because the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. Wait, no, I think the correct relation is Γ = ħ / τ. Oh, but sometimes people use Γ as the total decay rate, which is Γ = ħ / τ. So the calculation I did is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should double-check the units for ħ. Let me make sure.

Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So that's correct.

So τ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s.

Compute 6.582 / 0.32: 0.32 is 32e-2. 6.582 / 0.32 = 6.582 * (1/0.32) ≈ 6.582 * 3.125 ≈ 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s. Which matches what I had before.

Hmm. So the calculation for τ is correct. 

Wait, but maybe I forgot to account for the velocity correctly. Another approach: the decay length formula is L = (c * τ) * β γ, where γ is the Lorentz factor. Wait, no, I think it's L = (c * τ) * β, since τ is the proper time? Or maybe it's (γ β c τ).

Wait, perhaps I should think about it more carefully. The mean lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime. The proper lifetime τ is the mean lifetime in the rest frame of the particle. The lab frame lifetime is γ τ. So the decay length L is the velocity times the lifetime in lab frame.

So L = β c (γ τ).

Because velocity is β c, and lifetime is γ τ. So L = β c γ τ.

Wait, but earlier I had L = c τ β. So that's different. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, let me clarify:

The mean proper lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ. Then, in the lab frame, the lifetime is γ τ. So the time experienced in the lab is longer.

The particle's speed is β c. So the distance it travels before decaying is L = (β c) * (γ τ) = β γ c τ.

So L = β γ c τ.

So in my earlier calculation, I think I forgot the gamma factor. So I had L = c τ β, but I should have multiplied by gamma as well.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The mean lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime. The proper lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ. So the lab frame lifetime is gamma times tau: t = gamma tau.

The distance the particle travels is then velocity times time: L = beta c * t = beta c gamma tau.

So L = beta gamma c tau.

But wait, tau is the proper lifetime, so yes, that's correct.

So I should have included the gamma factor.

So let me recalculate with this new formula.

So, L = beta gamma c tau.

We have beta as approximately 0.9887, gamma as 6.6667, c is 3e8 m/s, and tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So compute:

beta * gamma = 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ approximately 6.600.

So L = 6.600 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, let's compute step by step.

Compute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3 * 2.056875 * 1e8 * 1e-24 = 6.170625e-16.

Then multiply by 6.600: 6.170625e-16 * 6.6 ≈ 4.081e-15 m.

Hmm, okay, that's about 4.08e-15 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, option C is 5.0223e-15 m. So 4.08e-15 is close to option B.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately. Let's compute beta gamma.

Beta is 0.9887, gamma is 6.666666... (since 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666...).

So beta * gamma = 0.9887 * 6.66666667.

Let me calculate 0.9887 * 6.66666667.

0.9887 * 6 = 5.9322
0.9887 * 0.66666667 ≈ 0.6591
Total is about 5.9322 + 0.6591 = 6.5913.

So beta gamma ≈ 6.5913.

So L = beta gamma * c tau.

c tau is 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.

So L = 6.5913 * 6.170625e-16.

Compute 6.5913 * 6.170625.

6 * 6.170625 = 37.02375

0.5913 * 6.170625 ≈ approximately 3.652.

So sum is about 37.02375 + 3.652 = approx 40.675e-16 m, which is 4.0675e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So that's very close.

So I think the correct answer is option B.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me recompute beta gamma.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))).

Gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666666...

So 1/(gamma^2) = 1/(44.444444) ≈ 0.0225.

Then 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

Beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So beta gamma = 0.9887 * 6.6666667 ≈ 6.5913. So that's correct.

Then, c tau is 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by 6.5913: 6.5913 * 6.170625e-16 ≈ 4.066e-15 m.

So the answer is about 4.066e-15 m, which matches option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the decay length:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta \) is the velocity of the particle in units of the speed of light (\( c \)),
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau \)
The proper mean lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by the uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given:
- \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \),
- \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \),

we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m}
\]

where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Thus:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
\]

The velocity \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma^2 = \left(\frac{8}{1.2}\right)^2 = 44.4444 \), we find:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.4444}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]
