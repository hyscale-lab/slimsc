Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh, and also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But wait, mass might not directly affect luminosity here unless it's related to temperature somehow. Hmm.

They used spectroscopy to find the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest, and those are the same. Oh right, the wavelength at which a star emits most strongly is given by Wien's Law. Wien's Law says lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if their lambda_max is the same, their temperatures must be the same too. Oh, that's an important point. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait. Wait, if both stars have the same effective temperature, then their luminosities depend on their radii. Luminosity for a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT^4. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

Since T is the same for both, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 would be (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4). But since T1 = T2, the T terms cancel out, leaving (R1/R2)^2. And R1 is 1.5 times R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 should be 2.25 times L2.

But wait, the options have A as ~2.25. But I need to make sure I'm not missing anything. Because sometimes, other factors come into play. Oh, the problem also mentions the radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But how does that affect the observed luminosity?

Wait, luminosity is an intrinsic property, right? The observed flux might be affected by velocity due to Doppler shift. But the question says they computed the luminosities assuming they radiate as black bodies. So maybe the velocities affect the observed wavelength but not the actual luminosity calculation. Since the problem states that the stars' wavelengths at maximum are the same, that probably already accounts for any Doppler shifts. Because if one star is moving towards or away, the observed wavelength would shift, but here the maximum emission wavelengths are the same. So the conclusion is that their temperatures are the same.

So then the luminosity depends only on radius, as per Stefan-Boltzmann. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the correct answer should be option A, which is ~2.25.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem says, "the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor of." So yes, 2.25 times. So I think the answer is A.

But looking at the options, options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23. So option A is exactly 2.25, which matches our calculation. So I'm confident the answer is A.


The problem involves determining the luminosity ratio of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and the same mass factor. The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are identical, indicating that their temperatures are the same (as per Wien's Law). 

The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: 

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

Since the temperatures of both stars are equal, the luminosity ratio depends only on the square of their radii:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2
\]

Given that \( R_1 = 1.5 \, R_2 \), the ratio becomes:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

The radial velocities of the stars (0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2) do not affect the intrinsic luminosity calculation, as luminosity is an intrinsic property. The observed wavelengths at maximum brightness already account for any Doppler shifts, confirming that the stars have the same effective temperature.

Thus, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25. The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
