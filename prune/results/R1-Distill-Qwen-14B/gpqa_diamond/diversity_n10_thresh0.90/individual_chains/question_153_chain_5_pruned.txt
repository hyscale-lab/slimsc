Okay, so I've got this question about the Michael addition reaction, and I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let's see if I can work through it.

First, let me read the question carefully. It says that in the case of a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon, leading to a resonance-stabilized intermediate, that's the Michael reaction. Then, there are three different reactions given, and I need to figure out the products A, B, and C based on the options provided.

The first part of the question is about the reactants and products of three different Michael addition reactions. Let me break them down one by one.

Reaction (A): dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH → A.

I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking a β,γ-unsaturated carbonyl compound. So, the nucleophile in this case would be the enolate of dimethyl malonate. Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a strong nucleophile when deprotonated.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is the acceptor here. Its structure is such that the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, with the p-tolyl group on carbon 3. So, the structure is CH2=CH- with the substituents. Wait, no, wait. Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure: CH2=C(C6H4-para-MeO)COOCH3, but wait, no, wait, the position is 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me think, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, so if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure would be CH2-CH-(p-tolyl)COOCH3? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me get the structure right.

Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the third carbon. Wait, the acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-; the third carbon from the ester is the alpha carbon (the one adjacent to the carbonyl). So, wait, maybe the structure is CH2=C(C6H4-Me)COOCH3? No, wait, perhaps that's not right. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-C(C6H4-Me)-OCH3. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that the acceptor has the double bond between carbons 2 and 3, with a substituent (p-tolyl) on carbon 3.

When the enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the β position of the acceptor (the methyl (E) acrylate), the nucleophile (the enolate) will attack the less substituted end of the double bond because of the geometry. Wait, wait, but in the Michael reaction, the nucleophile attacks the β carbon, which is part of the conjugated system. So, the enolate (which is a strong base) will deprotonate to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, which then attacks the β position of the acceptor.

So, the attack would occur at the β position, which in this case would be the CH2 next to the double bond. So, the enolate would add to the acrylate's double bond, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond.

So, let's think about the structure. The acceptor is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is CH2=C(C6H4-Me)COOCH3. The enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the β position, which is the CH2 in CH2=C.

Wait, no, wait. The acceptor's structure is CH2=C
