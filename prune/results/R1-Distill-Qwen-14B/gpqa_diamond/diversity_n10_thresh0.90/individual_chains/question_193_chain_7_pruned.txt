Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the question states that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the formula is number of stars, N, is proportional to 1/plx^5, or mathematically, N ∝ 1/plx^5.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that distance (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds). So, plx = 1/d, where d is distance. Or wait, no, actually, it's d = 1/plx. Because parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So, if a star is farther away, its parallax is smaller.

So, plx is inversely proportional to d. So plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx.

The problem is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance. So, we need to express N in terms of d, not plx, and then see how N changes as d increases.

Given that N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and since plx is 1/d, substituting that in would give N proportional to (d)^5, because 1/( (1/d) )^5 is d^5. Let me make sure I do the substitution correctly.

Wait, plx = 1/d, so 1/plx is d. So, 1/plx^5 is (d)^5. So N ∝ d^5. Hmm, but wait, because the number of stars is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, which is (d)^5.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me double-check. If plx is inversely proportional to d, then plx = k / d, where k is some constant. So, if I substitute into N, N is proportional to 1/( (k/d) )^5 = (d/k)^5. But since k is a constant, when we take proportionality, the constant can be ignored. So N is proportional to d^5.

So, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance
