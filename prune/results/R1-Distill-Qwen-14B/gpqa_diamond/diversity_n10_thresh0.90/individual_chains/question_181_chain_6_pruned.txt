Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me think this through.

So, the question is asking about the ratio of neutrino fluxes in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The setup is that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago, but all other reactions are still going as usual. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh, right, that's about the time it takes for light (and neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So any changes would take that time to reach us.

Wait, so what's the pp-III branch? I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun. The pp-I branch produces deuterium, and then there are other steps. Oh right, the pp-II branch involves higher energy processes, but the pp-III might produce something like boron-8 or other isotopes. Or wait, isn't pp-III about producing helium-4 from boron-8? Or maybe I'm mixing up the details.

Wait, the pp chain starts with two protons (hydrogen nuclei) fusing to form deuterium, then another proton adds to become tritium, which then decays into helium-3 and a positron. Then, the two helium-3 nuclei can either combine to form helium-4 (pp-I branch), or one can react with a helium-3 and a boron-8 (pp-II?), or maybe another step. Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch is when a helium-3 captures two protons to form boron-8, which then decays into helium-4 and emits two positrons and two neutrinos. Oh, right, that process emits high-energy neutrinos because of the beta decay.

So, the pp-III branch is a side reaction in the proton-proton chain. If it stops, then those high-energy neutrinos won't be produced anymore. But wait, the question says that all other reactions remain as they were. So other neutrino sources, like the main pp-I and pp-II reactions, are still happening. Wait, no, because the pp-III is a specific branch. So, if pp-III stops, then the production of those particular neutrinos stops, but others continue.

Now, solar neutrinos come from various processes. The dominant ones are from the pp chain, specifically the reactions that produce helium-4. One of the main neutrino sources is the decay of boron-8, which is part of the pp-III branch. The boron-8 decays into helium-4, emitting a positron and a neutrino (or antineutrino? Wait, I think it's a neutrino because the decay is beta-plus decay). So, the neutrinos from this process have higher energies compared to the ones from other processes.

Wait, the neutrinos from the main pp chain (like in the pp-I branch) come from the decay of tritium into helium-3. That process emits a positron and a neutrino as well. But the neutrinos from the boron-8 decay are higher energy because the mass difference is bigger. So, the boron-8 decay neutrinos are around higher energies, maybe in the range of hundreds of keV to a few MeV.

So the question is about the flux in two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). If the pp-III branch stops, which neutrinos are affected?

If the pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos, stopping it would mean those high-energy neutrinos (like in band 2) would drop in flux. But wait, the main pp chain's neutrinos are lower in energy. So, for instance, the main neutrino flux comes from the decay in the pp-I and pp-II branches, which have lower energies. But the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos.

Wait, what's the typical energy distribution of solar neutrinos? I remember that the majority of solar neutrinos have energies around 100 keV to a few MeV. The boron-8 neutrinos have higher energies, like 1-2 MeV on average. So, in the bands given (700-800 and 800-900 keV), these are in the range of the boron-8 neutrinos.

So if the pp-III branch stops, the production of those higher-energy neutrinos (above maybe 700 keV) would stop. But wait, actually, the boron-8 decay produces neutrinos around 1.4 MeV, which is about 1400 keV. So 800-900 keV is below that. Hmm, but wait, the neutrinos from other processes might have lower energies.

Wait, another source of solar neutrinos is the CNO cycle, but I think that's more in higher mass stars than the Sun. The Sun's energy is mainly from the proton-proton chain. So, the main neutrinos are from the pp chain.

The main neutrinos from the Sun are from the decay of tritium (in the pp-I branch), which gives lower energy neutrinos (like around 100s of keV?), and from the boron-8 decay (pp-III), which gives higher energy.

So if the pp-III branch stops, the high-energy neutrinos (like those above 800 keV) would stop. So, in the flux bands of 700-800 and 800-900 keV, the higher band (800-900) would have a much lower flux because those neutrinos come mainly from the pp-III branch, which has now stopped.

But wait, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago. So, the neutrinos are produced in the Sun's core, and it takes about 8.5 minutes to reach us. So, the neutrinos emitted before the pp-III stopped are still reaching Earth, but any emitted after that aren't. So, the effect would be that the flux of neutrinos from the pp-III process would drop suddenly, and the neutrinos from other processes would remain unaffected.

Wait, but the neutrinos are produced and travel at nearly the speed of light, so if the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago, then the last neutrinos from that process would have been emitted 8.5 minutes ago. So, the neutrinos we detect now are from before the stoppage, but the production has stopped. So, the flux from pp-III neutrinos would decrease to zero, but the other neutrinos (from pp-I and pp-II) would continue.

So, the neutrinos from the pp-III process are the high-energy ones. So, without them, the flux in the 800-900 keV band would drop. But what about the lower band, 700-800 keV?

Wait, but do the pp-I processes produce neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range? I thought the main pp-I neutrinos are around 100-300 keV. Wait, maybe I'm getting the energies mixed up.

Let me think. The tritium decay (
