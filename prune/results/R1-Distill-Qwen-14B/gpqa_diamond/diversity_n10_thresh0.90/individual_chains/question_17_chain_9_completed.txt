Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like calcium pretty tightly. The question gives me the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex and the formation constant, K. Let me try to break this down.

The problem states that the solution has 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. And the K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. I'm supposed to find the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²+], in this solution. 

Wait, I think EDTA forms a complex with Ca²+. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- or something similar. The formation constant K is given, so maybe I can use that to find [Ca²+].

I remember the formula for the formation constant Kf is Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Oh wait, but in this case, since the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, that's the concentration of the complex. So [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M.

But wait, when EDTA is in solution, not all of it is in the form of Ca-EDTA. Some of it might be free EDTA^4-. Hmm, but wait, the problem says that the pH is ideal. Oh right, EDTA's speciation depends on pH. At a certain pH, most of it is in the Y^4- form, which is the form that can bind Ca²+. So I can probably assume that the concentration of EDTA^4- in solution is equal to the concentration of free EDTA, [EDTA^4-] = [Y^4-].

Wait, but when the complex is formed, the EDTA is no longer free. So the total EDTA in solution is the sum of free EDTA and the EDTA bound to Ca²+. So [EDTA_total] = [Y^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-]. But wait, the problem gives the concentration of the complex as 0.02 M. Does that mean that the total EDTA is 0.02 M as well? Because each CaEDTA complex has one EDTA molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps in this problem, the solution is prepared with 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, so that's the only form present. But that can't be right because if the complex is formed, there's free EDTA and free Ca²+ in solution too, but in very small amounts because K is so large.

Wait, K is 5e10, which is a very large number, meaning the reaction strongly favors the formation of the complex. So the concentrations of free Ca²+ and free EDTA should be very low.

So let's set up the equation. Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

We know [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. Let me denote [Ca²+] as x. Then, [EDTA^4-] would be y. But wait, the total EDTA in solution is the sum of free EDTA and the complex. So [EDTA_total] = y + 0.02 M. But if K is so large, the amount of free EDTA y will be very small compared to 0.02, so maybe we can approximate y ≈ 0. But wait, in reality, [EDTA^4-] would be y, and [Ca²+] would be x. So the equation becomes 5e10 = 0.02/(x * y).

But without another equation, this seems tricky. Wait, but maybe the problem assumes that the concentration of free EDTA is negligible compared to the complex. Because K is so large, the complex is almost entirely formed. So [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the free EDTA, which is the same as the free Ca²+ concentration because the reaction is 1:1. No, wait, that's not correct because the stoichiometry is 1:1, but the concentrations of both [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] would be small. So perhaps I can say that [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-] = x, and then the equation becomes Kf = (0.02)/(x^2) = 5e10.

So solving for x:

x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10)
x^2 = 2e-13 / (5e10) ? Wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, 0.02 divided by 5e10 is 0.02 /5e10 = 4e-13. Then x^2 = 4e-13. So x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Let me calculate that. Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-12 is (1e-6)^2. So 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13, so sqrt(4e-13) is 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is approx 3.16e-7, so 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7. So x would be approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7. That matches. So the concentration of calcium ions is about 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, but why can I assume that [EDTA^4-] equals [Ca^2+]? Because from the reaction, each mole of Ca²+ that reacts with EDTA^4- produces a mole of the complex. So if the initial concentration is 0.02 M complex, and some x amount dissociates, then [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and the complex is 0.02 -x. But since K is so large, x would be so small compared to 0.02 that 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So the approximation holds, and [Ca²+] is sqrt(0.02/(5e10)).

Calculating that again: 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. Square root of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5 = approx 6.3e-7 M.

Yep, that's option C. So the answer should be C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant is expressed as:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, we denote \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02\). Since \(K_f\) is very large, the concentrations of free \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) and \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}]\) are very small, and we can approximate \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\). Substituting into the equation:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7}\) M. Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \(6.3 \times 10^{-7}\) M**
