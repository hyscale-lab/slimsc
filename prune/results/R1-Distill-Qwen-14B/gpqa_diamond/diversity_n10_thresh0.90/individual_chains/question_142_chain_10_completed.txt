Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubit space. The density matrix provided is rho equals 1/2 times (|0><0| + |1><1|). The options are A to D, each giving a different vector r.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on density matrices, but I remember that they describe the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. Since this is a density matrix, I think it's either a pure state or a mixed state. The expression given looks familiar. Let me try to write it out.

So rho is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, |0><0| is a projector, same with |1><1|. Adding them together and multiplying by 1/2. Oh wait, that's the same as the maximally mixed state for a qubit, right? Because I remember that for a qubit, the density matrix of the completely mixed state is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. So this rho represents a completely mixed state.

But the question is about its geometrical position. I'm a bit confused about what that means. Oh right, maybe it's referring to the Bloch vector representation. Because for qubits, any state can be represented as a vector on the Bloch sphere. For pure states, the Bloch vector has length 1, pointing in the direction corresponding to the state. But mixed states have a Bloch vector with length less than 1.

Wait, I think that for a mixed state, especially the completely mixed state, the Bloch vector is at the origin. So the vector r would be (0,0,0). Because the maximum mixed state has zero coherence and no direction, so it's the center of the Bloch sphere.

Let me think again. The general form of a qubit density matrix is rho = (I + r · σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector. For a pure state |ψ>, where |ψ> = cos(theta/2)|0> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)|1>, the Bloch vector r would be (sin(theta) cos(phi), sin(theta) sin(phi), cos(theta)), giving a vector of length 1.

In the case of the maximally mixed state, which is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, the density matrix simplifies to (I)/2, because |0><0| + |1><1| is the identity matrix in 2x2. So rho = I/2. Plugging into the general form: I/2 = (I + r · σ)/2. Subtracting I/2 from both sides, I get 0 = r · σ. So each component of r must be zero. Hence, r is (0,0,0).

So the geometrical position is the origin in the Bloch sphere. Looking back at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which must be the correct answer.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, any qubit state can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} \) is the Bloch vector and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) are the Pauli matrices. For the maximally mixed state, \( \rho = \frac{I}{2} \), which implies \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0 \). This means the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) has no components, so \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \). Therefore, the geometrical position of this density matrix in the qubit space is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Among the given options:
- **A)** \( r = (1,1,0) \): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the maximally mixed state.
- **B)** \( r = (0,0,1) \): Incorrect, as this represents a pure state along the \( z \)-axis.
- **C)** \( r = (0,0,0) \): Correct, as this represents the maximally mixed state at the origin.
- **D)** \( r = (1,1,1) \): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to any valid density matrix.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as the maximally mixed state has a Bloch vector at the origin.

Answer: C
