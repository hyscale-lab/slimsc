Okay, I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on crystallography, but let me think through this step by step.

So, the crystal is rhombohedral, which means all the edges are equal, and all the angles are the same. Oh right, in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters a, b, and c are all equal. So here, they've given the interatomic distance as 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance in a crystal usually refers to the lattice parameter a, right? Because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is just 'a'. So I'll take a = 10 Angstrom.

The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Wait, wait, but in a rhombohedral crystal, the angles are all equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. Right, so all angles are the same, which fits the given situation.

I need to find the interplanar distance d for the (111) plane. The formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by the Bragg's law formula, but more accurately, the formula for d is d = a/(sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... something about the angles?)). Oh wait, more precisely, for a general crystal system, the interplanar distance is calculated using the formula:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk \cos \gamma + kl \cos \beta + lh \cos \alpha) } }

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system can be a bit tricky because of the angles. Alternatively, I remember that for a rhombohedral system, since all the lattice parameters are equal and all angles are equal, there's a simplified formula.

Wait, rhombohedral is a special case of a hexagonal system? No, wait, no, the hexagonal system has a different structure. Rhombohedral is part of the cubic system when angles are 90 degrees, but when the angles are not 90, it's a separate system. So the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral crystal can be derived from the general formula for the interplanar distance in any triclinic system, I think.

The general formula for d_{hkl} is:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2/a²) + (k^2/b²) + (l^2/c^2) - 2(hk \cos \beta/(a b)) - 2(kl \cos \alpha/(b c)) - 2(lh \cos \gamma/(a c)) ) } }

But in rhombohedral, a = b = c = a0 (let's say a0 is 10 Angstrom), and alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees.

So substituting a = b = c = a0 and all angles equal to 30 degrees, the formula simplifies.

Wait, let me compute the denominator part.

The denominator inside the square root becomes:

h²/a² +
