Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down.

The problem starts by talking about Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Then, it reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. A precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with Substance X, the product has 2 atoms of oxygen. Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X. The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Let me think about what each part means.

First, let's focus on the reaction. Substance X reacts with liquid Y, which is probably something common like water or maybe an acid. The reaction releases gas W. The gas has the same number of neutrons and protons, meaning the molecule is either H2 (since each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, but that's same number for each), or maybe something else like CO2? Wait, no, CO2 has 12 + 16*2 =44 g/mol. Wait, the number of protons and neutrons in the molecule. Wait, gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So each molecule has, for example, 2 protons and 2 neutrons (like H2O? No, H2O has 2 H (each 1p, so 2p) and O has 8p, 8n. So total p: 10, n:8. Not same. Alternatively, maybe CO where each molecule has 2p (C:6p, O:8p) – no, that's not right. Wait, maybe the gas is something like CH4? No, protons would be 6 (C) +4 (H) =10, neutrons would be 6 (C has 6n in its common isotope) + 0 (H) =6. Not same. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the gas is NH3? No, that's a liquid sometimes, but let me think. NH3 molecule: N has 7p and 7n (if considering N-14). So each molecule has 14p and 14n. But wait, each molecule's neutrons and protons? Wait, the molecule as a whole has same number of protons and neutrons. So perhaps each molecule has same total. So maybe H2O: total protons 2+8=10, total neutrons 8. Not same. Or maybe CH4: 6+4=10 p, 6n. Not same. Or perhaps CO2: 6+16=22 p, 6+16=22 n. Oh, wait, that could be it. Wait, CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons (each O is 16, so 8p and 8n each, but wait, CO2 is C (6p, 6n) + 2 O (8p, 8n each). So total p: 6 + 2*8=22. Neutrons: 6 + 2*8=22. So yeah, same number of protons and neutrons. So gas W is CO2? Or perhaps another possibility.

Wait, another option could be N2. Each N atom has 7p and 7n. So molecule has 14p and 14n. So same. But what reaction would produce N2? Maybe decomposition of something.

Alternatively, water (H2O) has 2 H (each 1p, 0n) and O (8p, 8n). So total p=10, n=8. Not same. So CO2 seems a better fit for W.

So if W is CO2, what reaction produces CO2? Maybe when a carbonate reacts with an acid. Wait, but X reacts with Y, which is a liquid. Maybe Y is water, and X is a carbonate. But wait, the reaction is violent. Alternatively, Y could be another liquid like an acid.

Wait, but another possibility: Let's think about the precipitate G. Heating it gives B, which has a melting point near 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What's a substance that has a melting point around that? Maybe water ice? No, it's 273 K. Oh, close. So 277 is a bit higher, but perhaps another substance. Alternatively, maybe something like B is NaOH, but I don't think so. Wait, let's think. If G is a precipitate, maybe it's a carbonate or sulfide. But when heated, it decomposes.

Wait, perhaps B is a metal, since melting points are usually higher. Or perhaps B is something else. Let me think about possible reactions.

If X is sodium, for example. Sodium reacts with water to produce H2 gas. But earlier we thought W could be CO2, but if W is H2, then protons and neutrons would be 2 and 0 for each molecule. No, that doesn't fit (same number of protons and neutrons per molecule). So H2 can't be W.

Wait, maybe W is NH3. Then each molecule has 14p (N has 7, H has 1 each, so 7 +3=10 p? No, wait, that's not right. Each molecule of NH3 has one N (7p) and three H (each 1p), so total p is 10. Neutrons: N has 7n, H has 0, so total n=7. Not same. So no, that doesn't fit.

So back to CO2. If W is CO2, then the reaction produces CO2, so perhaps X is a carbonate. Let's say X is sodium carbonate. Then Y would be an acid, reacting to produce CO2, water, and a salt. But wait, the reaction is violent. Alternatively, X could be a carbonate reacting with an acid (like H2SO4) to produce CO2.

Wait, but let me think about the precipitate G. If X is a carbonate and Y is an acid, perhaps the reaction produces a metal sulfate or something which is a precipitate. Alternatively, perhaps Y is not an acid, but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is water, and X is a carbonate, reacting to produce CO2, water, and the metal hydroxide. But that might not precipitate. Alternatively, if X is a sulfide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution of a salt, and X is a metal that displaces another metal. But that might not produce CO2.

Wait, what if X is a metal like sodium reacting with water to produce H2, but that doesn't fit the gas's description. So maybe another approach.

Another angle: the product of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. Wait, a keto acid is an acid with a ketone group, like acetoacetic acid or something. When it reacts with X, the product has 2 O atoms. Wait, maybe X is a base? Or perhaps it's a reducing agent.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydration or something. Or perhaps it's an acid-base reaction. Hmm, but I'm not sure yet.

Another point: the substance X incorporates a heavier isotope. So, perhaps X is something like Cl-35 or another isotope-containing compound. For example, chlorine has two main isotopes: Cl-35 and Cl-37. If X is a compound with Cl-35, but actually, the heavier isotope is Cl-37. Wait, but the problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So, maybe X is NaCl, but with a heavier isotope of Cl, like Cl-37. Or perhaps X is something else.

Wait, another thought: the mention of B having a melting point near 277 K. Let me think about which substances melt around that temperature. 277 K is about 4°C. Water freezes at 273 K (0°C), so 277 is a bit higher. Maybe B is a different form of water, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps B is sodium chloride, but NaCl has a much higher melting point.

Wait, perhaps B is something else. Let me think: melting points of common substances:

- Ice: 273 K
- Dry ice (solid CO2): around 195 K
- Mercury: 234 K
- Toluene: 286 K
- Ethanol: 150 K
- Water: 273 K
- Maybe B is something like a hydrate? Or a different compound.

Wait, 277 K is approximately 4°C, so perhaps B is a hydrate that melts at that temperature. Alternatively, perhaps B is a salt with a low melting point.

Alternatively, perhaps B is ammonium chloride, which has a melting point around 337 K, which is higher. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, perhaps B is something like Bismuth, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think about the elements in X. The problem says to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes. So, perhaps X has two elements, the lightest and heaviest of which are, for example, H and Cl. Or something similar.

Wait, another approach: the product of a keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Let me think. Keto acids have a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). When they react with something, perhaps a base or a reducing agent, they might lose or gain oxygen.

Wait, maybe X is a strong base like NaOH. If a keto acid reacts with NaOH, perhaps it would undergo a condensation reaction, like the formation of an enolate. But that's more about structure than the product's oxygen count.

Alternatively, if X is a metal, like sodium, and the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid. Reacting them might produce a salt. Let's see, acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH) reacting with Na would produce CH3COCH2COO^- Na^+ and H2 gas. But the product would have more oxygen? Or maybe the product has fewer oxygen atoms. Wait, the product has 2 atoms of oxygen? Hmm, maybe I'm not on the right track.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is decarboxylation. For example, a keto acid losing CO2. But that would reduce the number of oxygen atoms. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product has two oxygen atoms, meaning perhaps each molecule has two. So maybe the product is something like H2O2? No, because that would involve a different reaction. Or perhaps it's something else.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an ether or something with two oxygen atoms. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: the elements in X. If X includes the lightest and heaviest elements, say H (light) and Cl (heavier), their atomic masses would be 1 (H) and around 35.5 (Cl). But the problem says to sum the lightest and heaviest in X, considering all isotopes. Wait, but if X has multiple isotopes, like Cl-35 and Cl-37, then for each instance, they should be summed. But the question says to sum the masses of all the lighter and heavier isotopes. Wait, perhaps the lightest and heaviest elements in X are H and Cl. So their atomic masses are approx 1 and 35.5, so sum would be 36.5, but the options don't have that. So maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps the elements are Na and Cl. Sodium (23) and Cl (35.5). Sum is about 58.5, which isn't an option either. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the reaction produces a precipitate G when X reacts with Y. When G is heated, it releases B, which is a solid with a melting point near 277 K. Maybe G is a carbonate, which when heated decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. For example, heating Na2CO3 gives Na2O and CO2. But Na2O has a melting point higher than that, I think. Alternatively, perhaps B is something like sodium oxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the initial reaction. X reacts with Y violently to release W. If W is CO2, perhaps X is a carbonate, Y is an acid. The reaction would be:

X (metal carbonate) + Y (acid) → metal salt + CO2 + H2O.

But then, the precipitate G would be the metal salt. If Y is an acid, perhaps it's a strong acid like H2SO4, which would form a sulfate precipitate if X is a carbonate. For example, CaCO3 + H2SO4 → CaSO4 (which is a precipitate?) + CO2 + H2O. But I'm not sure if calcium sulfate is a precipitate; it's sparingly soluble, but maybe in some conditions.

Alternatively, if X is a sulfide, and Y is an acid, the reaction would produce H2S gas. But earlier we thought W has same number of protons and neutrons, so H2S has 2 H (p=1 each, so 2), and S (p=16, n=16). So each molecule of H2S has 18 p and 16 n. Not same. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe W is something else. Let me think again about the gas properties. Same number of protons and neutrons in the molecule.

Wait, another possibility: Ozone (O3). Each O has 8p and 8n. So O3 has 24p and 24n. So same. So W is O3? But Ozone is not commonly produced in such reactions. Alternatively, maybe it's another molecule.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like CH4. Wait, CH4: 6p (C) +4p (H) =10p; C has 6n, H has 0, so total n=6. Not same. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is D2 (deuterium), but that's just H2 with heavier isotope. But same number of p and n? Each D has 1p and 1n, so D2 has 2p and 2n. Yes, same. But I'm not sure how that would fit into the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the gas is NH3. Let me check: N has 7p and 7n. Each H has 1p and 0n. So total p=7+3=10, n=7. Not same. So that's not it.

Hmm. Maybe I'm stuck on this part. Let me try to think about other parts of the problem.

The product of a keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Wait, a keto acid has a structure like R-C(=O)-COOH. When it reacts with a base, perhaps it loses a water molecule or something. But I'm not seeing it.

Another thought: maybe X is a metal like sodium. Sodium reacts violently with water (Y) to produce hydrogen gas (H2). But earlier, H2 doesn't fit the W description (same p and n in molecule). So if W is H2, each molecule has 2p and 0n. So that doesn't fit. So maybe X isn't sodium.

Wait, perhaps X is a heavier metal, like magnesium. Mg reacts with water (Y) to produce H2 gas. Again, same problem with W.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the precipitate G. If G is a carbonate, when heated, it decomposes into CO2 and the metal oxide. So, G could be Na2CO3, heating gives Na2O and CO2. But Na2O's melting point is around 1130°C, so higher than 277 K. Doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: G is a hydroxide. For example, if X is a metal that reacts with water to form a hydroxide and H2. But I'm not sure how that ties into the gas W.

Wait, perhaps Y is not water. Maybe Y is another liquid like ethanol or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the melting point of B is near 277 K (4°C). What's a solid that melts around that temperature? Maybe something like paraffin wax, but that's not a pure substance. Alternatively, maybe it's a salt that's a hydrate. For example, sodium acetate has a melting point higher than that. Alternatively, maybe it's a different compound.

Wait, perhaps B is not a pure element but a compound, maybe a hydrate. For example, sodium nitrate has a melting point around 327°C. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe B is something like a metal that's liquid around that temperature. Mercury's melting point is around -39°C, which is 234 K. That's lower than 277. So not matching. Gallium melts around 29°C (302 K), which is a bit higher than 277. So that's close. Hmm.

If B is gallium, then G when heated releases something. Wait, not sure. But if B is gallium, what would G be? Gallium is a metal, maybe G is a compound that upon heating gives gallium and something else.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different element. Let me think of elements with melting points around 4°C. I don't recall any. Maybe it's not an element but a compound.

Wait, maybe B is ammonium chloride. It's melting point is around 337 K (64°C). Not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is a different form of water, like ice. But ice's melting point is 273 K, which is close to 277 K. 4 degrees above. Maybe B is ice, so G upon heating gives ice. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps B is something else. Let me think of the reaction again. If X reacts with Y to produce W, a precipitate G, which upon heating gives B. So, perhaps G is a carbonate, which upon heating produces B as CO2 and the metal oxide. But the metal oxide's melting point is high, so maybe B isn't that. Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide, which upon heating decomposes into metal oxide and water.

Wait, if X is a metal carbonate, Y is an acid, producing CO2, and the precipitate is a metal sulfate. Then heating the sulfate might not release anything. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a salt, and X is a metal that displaces it, forming a precipitate. For example, if X is zinc and Y is a lead nitrate solution. Then the precipitate would be lead hydroxide or something. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe X is a metal that reacts with Y (water) to produce a hydroxide and H2. But then, the gas W is H2, which doesn't fit the description of same p and n.

Wait, going back to the gas W. Let me think of another possible molecule. Maybe O2? O2 has 16p and 16n (each O has 8p, 8n). So each O2 molecule has 16p and 16n. So same. So W could be O2. But under what reaction conditions would O2 be produced? Maybe electrolysis, but that's not likely in a violent reaction with liquid Y.

Wait, another possibility: the gas could be N2. Each N atom has 7p and 7n, so N2 has 14p and 14n. Same. So W is N2. How would that happen? Maybe a decomposition reaction releasing nitrogen gas.

Hmm, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think about what X could be.

The problem says that X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and especially its analog. So, perhaps X is something like NaOH, KOH, or another strong base used in organic reactions. Or maybe it's something like NaH or another hydride.

Wait, NaH is a strong base used in organic synthesis. It reacts violently with water to produce H2 gas. So if X is NaH, reacting with Y (water) would produce H2 gas. But earlier, H2 doesn't fit the gas description. So that can't be it.

Wait, but if X is NaH, which is Na and H- (hydride), then the elements in X are Na (23) and H (1). So their cumulative atomic masses: 23 + 1 =24. But the options don't have 24. Closest is option B)25, but that's not exact.

Wait, but the problem says to sum all the lighter and heavier isotopes. So, if X has multiple isotopes, sum all their masses. Wait, but for the elements present, like Na and H, each has isotopes. So, for H, the common isotope is H-1 (mass 1), but there's also H-2 (mass 2) and H-3 (mass 3). For Na, the main isotope is Na-23 (mass 23), but there are heavier isotopes like Na-24, Na-25.

Wait, but the problem states that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So, perhaps X is something like Cl-37 in a compound, such as NaCl with Cl-37.

Wait, but if X is NaCl, then the elements are Na and Cl. Na has isotopes (like 23, 24, 25), but the heavier ones are rare. Cl has 35 and 37 as main isotopes. So, if X is NaCl with Cl-37, then the elements in X are Na and Cl. The lightest element is H? No, Na is the lightest in X. Wait, no, in X, which is NaCl, the elements are Na and Cl. So the lightest element is Na (atomic number 11), and the heaviest is Cl (17). Their atomic masses are approximately 23 and 35.5. Sum is about 58.5, but that's not an option.

Hmm. Another angle: the product of a keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Suppose the keto acid is reacting with X (maybe a base) to form something like an enolate or a salt. Wait, but the product has 2 O atoms. Maybe the product is a ketone, which has one O. Or perhaps a diethyl ether, but that's two O's in the molecule. Not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is an ester. An ester has two O's. But I'm not sure how that fits into the reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a hemiacetal or something. But I'm not confident about that.

Wait, perhaps the product is a molecule like acetone (which has one O). No, that's not 2 O's.

Wait,
