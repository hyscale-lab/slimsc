Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm, let me think. I remember from my classes that when light travels through a medium, its speed changes. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium is c divided by the refractive index n. So normally, in glass, it's c/n, but wait, c is the speed of light in a vacuum, so if the glass is moving, does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, the question says the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer. Oh, right, so the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction.

I remember something about Galilean transformations when dealing with velocities in different frames. Because the glass is moving, the observer in the lab frame would see the light's speed differently than someone in the glass's frame.

In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n. But since the glass is moving at velocity v, we need to add that velocity to the light's velocity as observed in the lab. But wait, how does that work when velocities are involved? Oh right, the Galilean addition of velocities says that the lab frame would see the light's velocity as the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity relative to the glass.

Wait, no, wait a second. Let me clarify. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at v_light = c/n. So from the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass (since the glass is moving towards the lab observer), we use the velocity addition formula. Oh wait, in Galilean relativity, if an object is moving at u in the glass frame, then in the lab frame it's u + v. But I think that's only when the object's speed is much less than c, since we're using Galilean here and not Lorentz transformations.

Wait, but wait, in reality, the speed of light shouldn't depend on the motion of the source or the observer. That's Einstein's postulate, right? So according to special relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, regardless of the source's motion. But wait, this problem is about light in a medium, specifically glass, so maybe that's different.

Hmm, the problem says the glass is moving. So the light is propagating through the moving glass. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n. But when the glass is moving, what does the lab observer measure as the speed of light?

Wait, the question is asking for the speed of the light relative to the observer. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the Galilean addition. So if the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving at v_light = c/n in the glass's frame, then in the lab frame, the light's velocity would be v_light + v.

But wait, that can't be right because if the glass is moving at a significant fraction of c, Galilean addition would break down, but perhaps the problem expects us to use Galilean. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses the refractive index approach regardless of motion.

Wait, but let's think again. The speed of light in a medium (like glass) is v = c / n. That's a property of the medium. But the medium itself is moving. So does the motion of the medium affect the speed of light as measured in the lab frame?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about frames. Suppose in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed v1 = c/n. Now, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. So the lab frame would see the light moving at v1 + v? But that would be (c/n) + v, but that can't exceed c, which might not be an issue here because v is presumably much smaller than c.

Wait, but no, because in reality, if the medium is moving, the speed of light in the medium as seen from the lab frame might not just be the sum. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the motion of the glass and using the Doppler effect or something else. Or maybe it's about the index of refraction. Let me think of the
