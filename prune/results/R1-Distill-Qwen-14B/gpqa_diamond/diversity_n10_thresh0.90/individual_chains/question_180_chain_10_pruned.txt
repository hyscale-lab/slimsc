Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has 2 times that. Their masses are negligible, which probably means I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like thatâ€”just the potential energy part.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given.

Hmm, okay. So since the system is isolated, the energy will be purely electrostatic potential energy. Right, because there's no other form of energy involved since the masses are negligible and they're constrained in place.

Wait, the charges are all the same? So 13 identical charges. But 12 are at 2 meters from point P, and the 13th is at P. So the 13th is fixed there, and the others are all at the same distance from it.

I remember that the electrostatic potential energy (U) between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. But when there are multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. Because each charge interacts with every other charge.

Wait, but in this case, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So each of the 12 charges at 2m away will have an interaction with this central charge. So for each of those 12, the potential energy due to their interaction with the central charge is (2e)*(2e) / (2m), multiplied by Coulomb's constant. But wait, actually, each pair's potential energy is counted once, so for each of the 12 charges, they interact with the 13th, so 12 interactions.

But wait, wait a second. The potential energy is calculated per pair, but how many pairs are there? Let me think. Suppose we have n charges. The total potential energy is the sum of (1/2) * n(n-1) terms because each pair is counted twice if you do it naively. Wait no, wait. No, wait. When you have multiple charges, the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. So for n charges, the number of unique pairs is n choose 2, which is n(n-1)/2.

But in this case, the 13th charge is fixed, so the 12 charges are each interacting with it. So the total potential energy is the sum of the energies between the central charge and each of the 12, plus the potential energies between each pair of the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, wait a minute. Oh no, wait. Because the 12 charges are identical and at the same distance from P. So if I have 12 charges arranged symmetrically, each at 2 meters from P, and each is 2e. So each of these 12 would interact with each other as well. So the total potential energy would have two parts: the energy due to each of the 12 charges interacting with the central charge (13th), and the energy due to each pair among the 12 charges interacting with each other.

So I need to calculate both parts and sum them.

Let me break it down.

First, part A: the energy from the central charge and each of the 12 charges.

Each of the 12 charges is at a distance r = 2 m from P. The central charge is 2e, each of the 12 is 2e.

So for each of the 12, the potential energy is U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2). Wait, no. Wait, the formula is U = k*(q1*q2)/r. Since each pair contributes, and since each of the 12 is at 2 m, each contributes
