Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR and reaction mechanisms can be tricky for me. But let's take it step by step.

The question gives me a compound with molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and then a series of reactions are done. I need to figure out the final product from the options given.

First, let me look at the NMR data. The protons are split into several signals, which can help identify the structure.

The NMR peaks are:
- 9.72 ppm: a triplet (t, 1H). That's a pretty high chemical shift. Aldehydic protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe an aldehyde group here. But wait, sometimes aromatic protons can be around 7-9, but 9.7 is more like aldehyde. So maybe there's an aldehyde group in the molecule.
- 6.98 ppm: doublet (d, 2H). Aromatic protons, perhaps in a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in a para-substituted ring, the two protons are equivalent and each is a doublet coupling with each other.
- 6.51 ppm: another doublet (d, 2H). Hmm, another aromatic ring, maybe ortho to something else or maybe it's part of a coupling with another aromatic ring. Or perhaps it's a meta substituent. Wait, but if it's a doublet, maybe it's neighboring to another substituent. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a di-substituted benzene, but I'm not sure yet.
- 6.27 ppm: broad singlet (bs, 2H). Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an -OH proton, but wait, it's a singlet. But two protons, so maybe something else. Alternatively, an aromatic ring with two equivalent protons that are not split? Or perhaps it's a di-substituted ring where the two protons are equivalent and don't couple much? Or maybe it's an alkenyl group. Wait, if they're in a conjugated system, maybe. Or perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene where the two protons are equivalent.
- 3.66 ppm: doublet (d, 2H). This seems like a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, maybe an oxygen. Like an OCH2 group? Or maybe a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, such as in an ether or ester. Or perhaps it's a methylene group attached to something else, like a carbonyl.

Wait, let me think about the molecular formula: C8H9NO. So 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, and 1 oxygen. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X is 0 here, so (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees: could be a ring and some double bonds. Benzene rings have three degrees each, but if there's one benzene ring, that's three, then the rest could be a double bond and another ring or something else.

Looking at the NMR, the peaks at 6.98 and 6.51 suggest there are two aromatic rings. Let's see: benzene has six protons, but in the NMR, we have 2H each for two of the signals. Wait, no: each of the 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets for 2H each. So that's four aromatic protons accounted for, but the formula has 8 carbons. Hmm, maybe each of these is part of a benzene ring. So, perhaps two benzene rings, each with substituents.

Wait, but 8 carbons and two benzene rings would account for 12 carbons, which is more than 8. So that can't be right. Oh wait, each benzene is 6 carbons, so two benzene rings would be 12, but the formula is C8H9NO. So maybe there's one benzene ring and another part.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with substituents that include another ring or a chain.

Alternatively, maybe the compound has a benzene ring and another group attached, like a side chain with a double bond and an aldehyde.

Let me try to sketch this out. So the NMR shows an aldehyde proton at 9.72. So aldehyde group present.

The 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H: maybe an OCH2 group. For example, OCH2CH2... but wait, that would need more hydrogens. Alternatively, perhaps a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like an ethyl group attached to oxygen, but I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, the 3.66 ppm could be a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl group. So maybe R-O-CH2-C=O or something like that. But the molecular formula includes an O and an N, so maybe a substituent with N is present.

Wait, but in the molecular formula C8H9NO, the N is present. So maybe the structure has an amine or an amide group, but in the NMR, I don't see any peaks that would suggest an NH proton. So perhaps the N is part of a ring, like a pyrrole ring, but that might complicate things.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the N is in an amide or some other group, but I don't see any obvious peaks for NH. Hmm.

Let me try to think about the signals again. The 9.72 ppm is a triplet with 1H, so it's an aldehyde with two adjacent protons. Wait, aldehydes are RCHO, and the H is at the end. So if it's a triplet, perhaps it's coupled with two adjacent H's. So maybe it's RCH2CHO, where the CH2 is adjacent to the aldehyde. But wait, that would make the aldehyde proton split into a triplet due to coupling with two protons (like CH2 next to CHO). So the H on the CHO is a triplet (t) because it's next to a CH2 group. That would make sense.

So, the structure could be something like CH2CHO attached to some aromatic rings.

But there are also other signals. The 6.98 and 6.51 peaks are for aromatic protons. So maybe the molecule has two benzene rings attached to the same chain.

Wait, if there are two benzene rings, each with substituents, perhaps the structure is a diaryl compound. But wait, the formula is C8H9NO. Let me count: two benzene rings would be 12 carbons, but we have only 8. So that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps only one benzene ring is present.

Alternatively, the molecule has a benzene ring with substituents that include another functional group and another aromatic ring, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is a benzaldehyde derivative with a side chain that includes another substituent. Let's think: benzaldehyde has the formula C7H6O. If we have a side chain, perhaps we can add more carbons.

Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. Let me subtract benzal
