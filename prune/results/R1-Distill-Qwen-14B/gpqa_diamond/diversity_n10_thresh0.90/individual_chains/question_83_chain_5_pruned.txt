Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I need to figure out what happens when we dilute the acetic acid and then titrate it. Let me break it down.

First, dilution. We have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Wait, no, wait, 20 plus 20 is 40, right? So the new concentration after dilution can be calculated using M1V1 = M2V2.

So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2. Plugging in, M2 = (0.05 *20) /40 = (1) /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, no, wait again. Wait, when you dilute a solution by adding equal volumes, the concentration halves. So yeah, 0.05 M becomes 0.025 M after adding same volume. So that's correct.

So now, we're titrating this 0.025 M acetic acid with 0.1 M NaOH. So the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O.

Wait, the next part is about 25% titration. What does 25% mean here? I think it refers to the percentage of the acetic acid that has been neutralized by the NaOH. So, at 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH.

Alternatively, sometimes it refers to the volume of NaOH added being 25% of the equivalence point volume. Hmm. I think I should calculate the equivalence point first to find out how much NaOH is needed, then find the 25% point.

Let me calculate the equivalence point volume. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

So, moles of acetic acid in solution after dilution: concentration is 0.025 M, volume is 40 cm³ (wait, no, wait. Wait, the total solution after dilution is 40 cm³, right? Because we added 20 cm³ of water to the 20 cm³ of acetic acid. So 40 cm³ is 0.04 liters.

Moles of acetic acid = M * V = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the moles needed for equivalence are 0.001. So volume of NaOH = moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH added.

25% titration would be 25% of this volume, so 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So that's the volume of NaOH used at 25% point.

So, at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added. Let's find the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

Since the reaction is 1:1, this will neutralize 0.00025 moles of acetic acid. So remaining moles of acetic acid = initial moles (0.001) minus 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And the moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed will be 0.00025.

Now, the total volume of the solution at this point is original solution + added NaOH. So original solution was 40 cm³, and we added 2.5 cm³, so total volume is 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

So using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. Let's see, log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5) = 0.2672 + (-5) = -4.7328. So pKa is 4.7328.

So pH = 4.7328 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647 )

Calculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

log(0.3333) is approximately -0.4771.

So pH = 4.7328 - 0.4771 ≈ 4.2557, which rounds to approximately 4.26.

So that's the pH at 25% titration. Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52; option D says 4.57 and 6.92; option B has 3.17 and 6.73. So 4.26 is in option A.

Wait, but I should also check the calculations for the equivalence point. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.

So, the moles of acetate ion at equivalence point are 0.001 moles, and the volume is 40 cm³ (original solution) plus 10 cm³ (NaOH added) = 50 cm³ or 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate is
