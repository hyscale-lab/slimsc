Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So, the first thing I should do is figure out the new concentration after dilution. Oh right, M1V1 = M2V2. So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³ because we added another 20. So M2 = (M1V1)/V2 = (0.05 * 20)/40. Let me calculate that: 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Hmm, wait, 25% titration. That means we've added a quarter of the NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point, right? So maybe I should first calculate the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence.

The equivalence point comes when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L), concentration 0.025 M. Moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, the moles of NaOH needed are also 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume V = moles / conc = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So at equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

So for 25% titration, that's a quarter of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. Let me think about what's happening in the solution during the titration.

Acetic acid is a weak acid, NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate them, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ (0.0025 L) of 0.1 M NaOH. Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 moles. That's a quarter of the 0.001 moles needed for equivalence. So the stoichiometry is that each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid into acetate.

So in the solution, the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001. After adding 0.00025 moles of NaOH, 0.00025 moles of acetic acid will have been neutralized, forming 0.00025 moles of acetate (CH3COO^-).

So the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And the acetate formed is 0.00025 moles.

But wait, because when you mix the two solutions, the total volume increases. Let me calculate the total volume at 25% titration. The initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³. Adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH solution gives a total volume of 42.5 cm³. So 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:
[Acetic acid] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = let's calculate that. 0.00075 ÷ 0.0425 is approximately 0.017647 M.

[Acetate] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = approx 0.005882 M.

Now, this is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). The pKa is given by the Ka of acetic acid. Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) = let's compute that. Log(1.85e-5) is approx 4.73 (since 1e-5 is pKa 5, and 1.85 is a bit less so the pKa is about 4.74? Wait, wait. Let me compute it more accurately.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = log(1 / 1.85e-5) → wait no, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa = -log(1.85e-5) = ?

Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733? Wait, no: wait, log(1.85) is 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) = 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So using Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = 4.733 + log( [acetate]/[acetic acid] ) → [acetate] is 0.005882, [HA] is 0.017647.

So ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333 (since 5.882/17.647 is about 0.333). Log(0.333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, which is approximately 4.26. Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 for the first part. Option D has 4.57. So first part is around 4.26.

Wait, but wait, I should check my calculations for any mistakes.

Wait, let me double-check the moles. Initial moles of acetic acid: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. NaOH added at 25% is 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol. That's correct.

Total volume after adding NaOH: 40 + 2.5 =42.5 cm³ → 0.0425 L. So the concentrations are 0.00075 / 0.0425 and 0.00025 / 0.0425.

Wait, 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M. 0.00025 /0.0425 is 0.005882 M.

So the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.333. Log(0.333) is -0.477. So pH = 4.733 -0.477 = 4.256. So around 4.26. So option A has 4.26 as the first pH value.

Now, the second part is the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

So the concentration of acetate ions at equivalence is the moles of acetate divided by the total solution volume.

Moles of acetate: 0.001 mol (since all acetic acid is converted). The total volume is 40 cm³ (solution) +10 cm³ (NaOH) =50 cm³ →0.05 L.

So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, wait, 1e-14 /1.85e-5 is (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9. 1/1.85 is approx 0.5405, so 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

We can model the hydrolysis as:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced. So:

5.405e-10 = (x^2) / (0.02 - x)

Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So equation simplifies to x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → x² = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] is about 1.04e-5 M. pH is 14 - pOH.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04) is about 0.017, so log(1.04e-5) is -4.983. So pOH ≈4.983. So pH=14-4.983=9.017.

Wait, but wait, none of the options for the equivalence point are around 9. Hmm, the options are:

Option A) 4.26; 8.52

Option B) 3.17; 6.73

Option C)4.73;7.00

Option D)4.57;6.92

Hmm, none of these have a pH around 9. Wait, did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001. Which is correct.

At equivalence, all of that becomes acetate (0.001 mol), and the total volume is 40 +10=50 cm³=0.05 L. So [acetate] is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Kb is Kw/Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approx 5.405e-10. Correct.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis equation:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

At equilibrium:

[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02

[CH3COOH] = x

[OH^-] =x

So Kb = x²/(0.02) → x² = Kb *0.02 → 5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11)= ~1.04e-5.

So [OH^-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=14-4.98=9.02.

But none of the options have such a high pH. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, wait—what's the equivalence point pH in a titration of a weak acid with a strong base? It should be greater than 7, right? So if the options don't have it, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I confused the equivalence point with the half-equivalence point. No, equivalence is when all acid is neutralized.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb. Let me
