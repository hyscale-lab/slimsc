Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let's see. The question says stars are uniformly distributed, which probably means that on average, they're spread out evenly in all directions. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different power dependencies on 1/plx.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to the distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/distance. So higher parallax means closer stars, and lower parallax means more distant stars.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So, if I pick a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars would be in that range?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means the number density (number per unit volume) is constant. Let me think in terms of 3D space. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number per unit volume is the same everywhere.

So, imagine a spherical shell at a certain distance. The volume of a thin shell would be the surface area times the thickness. The surface area is 4πr², where r is the distance. The thickness would be dr, an infinitesimal change in distance.

But we're dealing with parallax, not distance. Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. The thickness in terms of plx would be dplx. Let's relate dr and dplx.

Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Taking derivative: dr = -dplx/(plx²). The negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, distance decreases, but the magnitude is what we're interested in here. So dr = dplx/(plx²).

Now, the volume element for a thin shell is 4πr² dr. Let's substitute r with 1/plx and dr with dplx/(plx²).

Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx/(plx²)) ) = 4π dplx / plx^4.

Wait, wait. Because r is 1/plx, so r squared is 1/(plx)^2. And dr is dplx/(plx²). So when I multiply them, it's 1/(plx^2) * 1/(plx^2) dplx, which is dplx/(plx^4). Multiply by 4π, so 4π dplx/(plx^4).

But the number of stars in that shell is the number density (n) multiplied by the volume. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, n is a constant. So number of stars N = n * (4π dplx / plx^4).

But wait, the problem is asking for the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dplx). So for each small dplx, the number is N = (4π n) / plx^4 * dplx. So the number per unit dplx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Parallax is 1/d, so as d increases, plx
