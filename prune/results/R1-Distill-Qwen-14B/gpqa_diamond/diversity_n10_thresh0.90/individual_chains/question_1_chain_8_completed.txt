Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question talks about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. The task is to find out what their energy difference should be so that we can clearly distinguish between the two energy levels.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically, the energy-time uncertainty relation. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately equal to Planck's constant over 2π. Or wait, sometimes it's written as ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but I think for this purpose, it's the order of magnitude that matters.

So the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. But wait, the energy-time uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. So if I have a certain uncertainty in time, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional. But in this case, the lifetimes of the states are given. So the lifetimes would relate to the uncertainty in time, right? Because the lifetime is the time during which the system is in that state, and the uncertainty in energy would be the minimum resolution needed to distinguish the two states.

Wait, so the problem is about being able to clearly distinguish two energy levels. That means the energy difference between them must be greater than the uncertainty in energy. Otherwise, the two states might appear the same due to the uncertainty.

So each state has its own lifetime. Which one do I use? The lifetimes are 1e-9 seconds and 1e-8 seconds. Hmm, the state with the shorter lifetime (E1) would have a larger energy uncertainty because ΔE is inversely proportional to Δt. So for E1, Δt is 1e-9 s, so ΔE1 would be about ħ/(1e-9). For E2, Δt is 1e-8 s, so ΔE2 is about ħ/(1e-8). But wait, since E2 has a longer lifetime, its energy uncertainty is smaller. So to clearly distinguish E1 and E2, the actual energy difference must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe the maximum uncertainty, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Each state's energy is uncertain within a range. For E1, the uncertainty is ΔE1, and for E2, it's ΔE2. To clearly distinguish E1 and E2, their energy difference must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than that sum, the two might overlap, making it impossible to tell them apart.

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the energy difference must be larger than the individual uncertainties. Because each state's energy is uncertain, but the separation between them needs to be bigger than the individual spreads. Hmm. Let me think about it. Suppose ΔE1 and ΔE2 are the uncertainties for E1 and E2. Then, the energy difference ΔE (E2 - E1) must be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2) to be resolvable. Because if the separation is larger than the sum of the uncertainties, the two states won't overlap. But I'm not exactly certain if it's the sum or just one of them. Maybe I should proceed with the calculation to see.

But wait, let me recall the formula. The lifetime τ is related to the energy uncertainty by ΔE ≈ ħ / τ. So for each state, the energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So for E1, τ1 is 1e-9 s, so ΔE1 is ħ / (1e-9). Similarly, for E2, τ2 is 1e-8 s, so ΔE2 is ħ/(1e-8). That would make ΔE2 ten times smaller than ΔE1.

Wait, Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s. Let me compute the values.

Calculating ΔE1: ħ / τ1 = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.05e-25 J. Hmm, wait that can't be right because the options are in eV, and 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 J. So converting 1.05e-25 J to eV: (1.05e-25 J) / (1.6e-19 J/eV) ≈ 6.56e-7 eV. So about 6.5e-7 eV. Similarly, ΔE2 is (1.05e-34)/(1e-8) = 1.05e-26 J. Converting that: 1.05e-26 /1.6e-19 ≈ 6.56e-8 eV.

So the energy uncertainties are approximately 6.5e-7 eV and 6.5e-8 eV for E1 and E2, respectively.

Wait, but the energy difference between E2 and E1 is the absolute value of E2 - E1. Let's call it ΔE_total = |E2 - E1|. For these two states to be clearly distinguishable, ΔE_total should be greater than the sum of the energy uncertainties from each state? Or perhaps just greater than the maximum uncertainty?

Wait, I think it's about the resolving power of the measurement. If the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty in energy, the two states can't be distinguished. So the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in the energy of each state. But which uncertainty? Or perhaps the combined uncertainty?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The uncertainty in the energy ΔE of each state is such that the energy can be anywhere within ±ΔE/2 of the measured value. So for E1, the actual energy lies in [E1 - ΔE1/2, E1 + ΔE1/2], and for E2, [E2 - ΔE2/2, E2 + ΔE2/2]. To have these two intervals not overlap, the separation between E1 and E2 must be at least the sum of their uncertainties. So, E2 - E1 ≥ (ΔE1 + ΔE2)/2. But wait, perhaps more accurately, the separation must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the separation is less than the sum, the intervals could overlap.

Wait, no. Let me think in terms of intervals. Two intervals [a, b] and [c, d] do not overlap if b < c or d < a. So, for E1 and E2's energy intervals not to overlap, their separation must be more than the sum of the uncertainties. That is, |E2 - E1| > (ΔE1 + ΔE2)/2 + (ΔE2 + ΔE1)/2? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the condition for distinguishability is that the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy of each state. But which one? Because each state has its own uncertainty.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is that the uncertainty in the energy difference must be less than the actual energy difference. So the uncertainty in the energy difference ΔE_diff would be the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Because when you measure the difference E2 - E1, the uncertainty would be ΔE_diff = sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ) approximately, assuming they're independent, but perhaps in the worst case, it's ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Alternatively, if we model the two energy levels as having their own uncertainties, the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. So, |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but let me get back to the calculation. I have ΔE1 ≈ 6.5e-7 eV and ΔE2 ≈ 6.5e-8 eV. So their sum is approximately 7.15e-7 eV. So any energy difference greater than about 7e-7 eV would allow us to distinguish E1 and E2.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001 e-6 eV → 1e-9 eV is way smaller than 7e-7 eV, so we can't distinguish.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV. That's much bigger than 7e-7 eV. So if the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e4 times larger than the required 7e-7 eV, that's easily distinguishable.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.01e-6 eV. That's 0.01e-6 = 1e-8 eV. Wait, 1e-8 is 0.00000001 eV. Hmmm, 1e-8 is 1e-8, which is 0.00000001 eV. Wait, wait, no: 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4. The sum of the uncertainties is about 7e-7 eV, which is 0.0000007 eV. So any energy difference larger than that would work.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e4 times larger than 7e-7 eV. So that's well above the threshold. So option C would work.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute the exact numbers.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) ? Or just ħ/τ? Oh wait, in the uncertainty principle, the product is ≥ ħ/2. So the uncertainty in energy ΔE is about ħ/(2τ). Or sometimes, the formula is approximated as ΔE * τ ≈ ħ. It depends on the exact statement. Because some sources say that the uncertainty is ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ), others might write it as ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. Wait, perhaps I should get the exact expression.

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. So the minimum uncertainty in energy is ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt). But in the case where the lifetime τ is the uncertainty in time, we can take Δt ≈ τ, so ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ).

Wait, I need to correct my earlier calculations. I used ħ/τ, but maybe it's ħ/(2τ). Let's recalculate.

So for E1: τ1 = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = 1.05e-34 / (2e-9) = 5.25e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 5.25e-26 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = ~3.28e-7 eV.

Similarly, for E2: τ2 = 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = 1.05e-34 / (2 * 1e-8) = 1.05e-34 / 2e-8 = 5.25e-27 J. Convert to eV: 5.25e-27 / 1.6e-19 = ~3.28e-8 eV.

So the total uncertainty when considering both states would be ΔE1 + ΔE2 = 3.28e-7 + 3.28e-8 = approximately 3.6e-7 eV.

Wait, but to resolve two states, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties. So the energy difference ΔE must be greater than 3.6e-7 eV. Looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e4 times larger than 3.6e-7 eV. So that's way above.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is smaller than 3.6e-7 eV. So that wouldn't work.

So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e4 e-7, so yes, it's way larger.

So the answer should be C.


To distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), their energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the combined energy uncertainty of the two states. The energy uncertainty for each state is determined by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

Here, \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). For each state, the energy uncertainty is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate energy uncertainties
- For \( E_1 \), the lifetime is \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t_1} = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 5.25 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
  \]
  Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 = \frac{5.25 \times 10^{-26}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.28 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
  \]

- For \( E_2 \), the lifetime is \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t_2} = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 5.25 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
  \]
  Converting to electron volts:
  \[
  \Delta E_2 = \frac{5.25 \times 10^{-27}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.28 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
  \]

### Step 2: Total energy uncertainty
To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2
\]
\[
\Delta E > 3.28 \times 10^{-7} + 3.28 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.61 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 3.61 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the states cannot be distinguished.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is also much smaller than \( 3.61 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the states cannot be distinguished.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is \( 10^3 \) times larger than \( 3.61 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the states can be clearly distinguished.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 3.61 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the states cannot be distinguished.

### Final Answer:
The energy difference must be at least \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to clearly distinguish the two energy levels.
