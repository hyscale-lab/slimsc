Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me read the question again.

The question says that two quantum states have energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find out which energy difference would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A) 10^-9 eV, B) 10^-11 eV, C) 10^-4 eV, D) 10^-8 eV.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

In this case, the lifetimes given are the uncertainty in time (Δt) for each state. Wait, but wait—each state has its own lifetime. Oh, but wait, when we're talking about the energy difference between the two states, perhaps we should consider the uncertainty in the energy of each state to determine if they can be distinguished.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference (E2 - E1) between the two states. To distinguish them, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state, I suppose. Because if the energy difference is too small, the uncertainty from the lifetimes might make it hard to tell them apart.

So, let me think. For each state, the uncertainty in energy would be ħ divided by the lifetime. So for E1 with τ1=1e-9 sec, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1, and similarly for ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So the energy difference should be significantly larger than the uncertainties in each state so that they can be resolved.

Wait, but perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state and then ensure that the energy difference is larger than the sum or something. Or maybe the maximum uncertainty in the energy measurement would be the sum of the individual uncertainties, or perhaps the larger of the two.

Wait, let me think. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So, the uncertainty in energy for a state is roughly ħ divided by the lifetime of that state.

So for E1, with τ1=1e-9 s, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2 τ1), and similarly for E2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2 τ2).

But since τ2 is longer than τ1 (1e-8 s vs 1e-9 s), ΔE2 will be smaller than ΔE1. Because a longer lifetime means a lower uncertainty in energy. So ΔE1 is ħ/(2 * 1e-9) and ΔE2 is ħ/(2 * 1e-8). Which means ΔE1 is about 10 times larger than ΔE2.

Wait, but the energy difference between E2 and E1 is (E2 - E1). To distinguish them, this difference should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties in each state's energy. Or is it the maximum of the two uncertainties?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should think in terms of how the energy difference relates to the uncertainties. Let's compute the uncertainties.

First, I know that ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since the options are in eV, maybe I should convert ħ into eV·s.

1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So ħ in eV·s is (1.0545718e-34 J·s) * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) ≈ (1.05457e-34 / 1.602e-19) eV·s ≈ approx 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

Now, the uncertainty in energy for E1 is ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1. So τ1 is 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 ≈ (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.582e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-8 s) = 6.582e-8 eV.

So, ΔE1 is about 6.582e-7 eV and ΔE2 is 6.582e-8 eV. So the larger uncertainty is ΔE1.

But wait, what's important here is the energy difference between the two states, E2 - E1. To be able to distinguish them, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties? Or perhaps just greater than the maximum uncertainty.

Wait, but in reality, when you have two states, the uncertainty in each measurement would contribute to the overall uncertainty in the energy difference. Or maybe not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in the energy measurement for each state. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy resolution required is such that the energy difference is much larger than the uncertainty in energy. Because if the energy difference is of the same order as the uncertainty, you might not be able to resolve them.

So, let's think: the minimum energy difference that can be detected is on the order of the uncertainty in energy. So, the energy difference should be larger than that uncertainty.

But which uncertainty? Because each state has its own uncertainty. Wait, but the energy difference is a single value. So, perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the maximum uncertainty between the two states. Because if the energy difference is less than both uncertainties, you might not be able to tell them apart.

Wait, no. Because for E2 and E1, each has their own uncertainties. So, the energy difference (E2 - E1) must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties in each state. Wait, that might not be right. Because if E2 is measured with uncertainty ΔE2, and E1 is measured with ΔE1, then the difference would have an uncertainty of sqrt(ΔE1² + ΔE2²) due to error propagation. Hmm, that's probably more accurate.

Wait, when you subtract two measured quantities, the uncertainty in the difference is the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual uncertainties.

So, the uncertainty in (E2 - E1) is sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ).

So, let's compute that. From earlier, ΔE1 is about 6.582e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 6.582e-8 eV.

So, (ΔE1)^2 = (6.582e-7)^2 ≈ 4.33e-13 eV².

(ΔE2)^2 = (6.582e-8)^2 ≈ 4.33e-15 eV².

Adding them together gives approximately 4.37e-13 eV².

Taking the square root gives sqrt(4.37e-13) ≈ 6.61e-6.5 eV? Wait, wait, sqrt(4.37e-13) is about 6.61e-7 eV. Because sqrt(1e-12) is 1e-6.

Wait, 4.37e-13 is 4.37e-13 = 4.37 x 1e-13. The square root would be sqrt(4.37) * 1e-6.5. Wait, no, wait: 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, so sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7.

Wait, let's compute it numerically.

ΔE1 is 6.582e-7 eV. ΔE2 is 6.582e-8 eV.

Compute ΔE1^2: (6.582e-7)^2 = approx (6.582)^2 * 1e-14 = 43.3 * 1e-14 = 4.33e-13.

ΔE2^2 = (6.582e-8)^2= approx (6.582)^2 * 1e-16 = 43.3e-16 = 4.33e-15.

So sum is 4.33e-13 + 4.33e-15 = approx 4.33e-13 (since 4.33e-15 is much smaller).

So sqrt(4.33e-13) is sqrt(4.33) * 1e-6.5, which is approximately 2.08 * 3.16e-7 = approximately 6.58e-7 eV.

Wait, but that's because 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7.

Wait, 1e-7 is 1e-7, so 3.16e-7 is about 3.16 x 1e-7.

So sqrt(4.33e-13) is sqrt(4.33) * 3.16e-7. sqrt(4.33) is about 2.08.

2.08 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.

So the uncertainty in the energy difference (E2 - E1) is approximately 6.58e-7 eV.

Therefore, the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than this value to be resolved.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001 e-7 eV → much smaller than 6.58e-7. No.

Option B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller, so no.

Option C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → that's way bigger than 6.58e-7. So yes, it's larger.

Option D) 1e-8 eV → 0.001e-7 eV → which is about 1e-8, which is smaller than 6.58e-7. So no.

So the only option larger than the uncertainty is C) 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation. Because the uncertainty in the energy difference is about 6.58e-7 eV, so any energy difference larger than that would be resolvable.

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. 0.0001 is 1e-4, which is 100 times larger than 6.58e-7 (since 6.58e-7 is 0.000000658).

So yes, option C is way bigger than the uncertainty, so it can be resolved.

The other options are all smaller than the uncertainty. So, the correct answer should be option C.


To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) that can be clearly resolved, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) and the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) is on the order of \( \hbar/2 \), where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant. For a quantum state with lifetime \( \tau \), the uncertainty in energy is approximately \( \Delta E \approx \hbar / \tau \).

Given the lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), the uncertainties in energy for the two states are:

\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2}.
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

The uncertainty in the energy difference \( E_2 - E_1 \) is determined by error propagation. When subtracting two measured quantities, the uncertainty in the difference is:

\[
\Delta (E_2 - E_1) = \sqrt{(\Delta E_1)^2 + (\Delta E_2)^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta (E_2 - E_1) = \sqrt{(6.582 \times 10^{-7})^2 + (6.582 \times 10^{-8})^2}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\Delta (E_2 - E_1) \approx \sqrt{(4.33 \times 10^{-13}) + (4.33 \times 10^{-15})} \approx \sqrt{4.33 \times 10^{-13}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( E_2 - E_1 \) must be significantly larger than \( \Delta (E_2 - E_1) \). Evaluating the options:

- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it cannot be resolved.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is also much smaller than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it cannot be resolved.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is much larger than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it can be resolved.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it cannot be resolved.

Thus, the energy difference must be at least \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to be clearly resolved.
