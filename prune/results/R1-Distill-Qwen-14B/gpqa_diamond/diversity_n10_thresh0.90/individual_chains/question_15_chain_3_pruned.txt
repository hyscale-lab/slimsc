Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited observing time. 

Both planets share the same minimum masses, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1's period is P1, and P2 is three times that. Their orbits are circular, so that simplifies things a bit.

The host stars have different masses. The star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but their radii are equal. Interesting, so even though their masses are different, the radii are the same. That might affect the transit probability.

Wait, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. The formula for the transit probability is something like (R_planet + R_star) / a, but maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a) * (R_planet / R_star), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, I think the transit probability (p) can be approximated as (R_star / a) * (R_planet / R_star), but that might not be accurate. Wait no, I think the main factors are the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. The probability of a transit is roughly (R_star + R_planet) / a. But since the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, R_planet is negligible, so p â‰ˆ (R_star) / a. But wait, that can't be right because I think it's more about the alignment. Oh, wait, no, the probability also depends on the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight. 

Wait, no, the geometric probability is given by the formula p = (R_star + R_planet) / a, but again, since the planet is much smaller, it's approximately (R_star) / a. But wait, that's not quite right because
