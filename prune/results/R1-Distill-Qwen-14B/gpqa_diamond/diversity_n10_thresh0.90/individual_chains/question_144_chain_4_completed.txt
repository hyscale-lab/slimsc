Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each a different distance in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance (also called the decay length) is related to the particle's lifetime. The formula I think is something like distance = velocity × lifetime. Right, because the particle is moving, so the distance it travels before decaying is how fast it's moving multiplied by how long it lives.

But wait, the mean lifetime is related to the particle's width. The width Γ is the uncertainty in energy, which is inversely related to the lifetime τ. The uncertainty principle says Γ × τ ≈ ħ. So τ is roughly ħ/(Γ). But wait, I think the exact relation uses the natural line width formula. Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is τ = ħ/(Γ), but wait, no, that's for the natural line width when the width is the total decay width. Or is it Γ = ħ/τ? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. That sounds right because the larger the width (more uncertainty in energy), the shorter the lifetime. So higher Γ means shorter τ, which makes sense.

But wait, in particle physics, the width is often given in energy units, so when converting to time, we need to use the reduced Planck constant. So τ = ħ_bar / Γ. Since ħ_bar is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s.

Wait, let me get the units straight. Γ is given in MeV. So I need to convert that to GeV for consistency. Oh right, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So Γ_X = 0.32 GeV. Then, τ = ħ_bar / Γ_X. Plugging in the numbers: ħ_bar is 6.582e-25 GeV·s, so τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s. Let me calculate that: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because if the lifetime is that short, the decay length would be really small. But wait, the particle is moving at relativistic speeds, so the lifetime as measured in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. Oh wait, no, because the mean lifetime is already in the rest frame. Hmm, no, wait. The lifetime I compute using τ = ħ_bar/(Γ) is the proper lifetime, the lifetime in the rest frame. So to get the lab frame lifetime, I need to consider the Lorentz gamma factor.

Ah, right, because the particle is moving at a high speed, so from the lab frame, the lifetime is longer. The gamma factor γ is E/(m c²), but wait, E is the total energy. Because gamma is E/(m c²) when E is the total energy. But wait, E is given as 8 GeV, and m_X is 1.2 GeV. So gamma would be E/(m c²) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Wait, but wait, actually, gamma is equal to the total energy divided by the rest mass energy. So yes, gamma = E / m_X. Because E is the total energy, and m_X c² is the rest energy. So gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... So around 6.6667.

So the lab frame lifetime is γ * τ. So the lifetime in the lab frame is τ_lab = γ * τ_rest = γ * (ħ_bar / Γ).

So now, let me compute τ_lab:

τ_lab = (8 / 1.2) * (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

First, compute gamma: 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667... So approximately 6.6667.

Then, τ_rest = (6.582e-25) / (0.32) s. Let's compute that: 6.582e-25 / 0.32. Hmm, 6.582 divided by 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Then τ_lab = gamma * τ_rest = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ ?

Calculating 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24. Let's see: 6 * 2.056875 is about 12.34125, and 0.6667 * 2.056875 is around 1.37125. Add them together: 12.34125 + 1.37125 = 13.7125e-24 s. So approximately 1.37125e-23 seconds. Wait, no, wait: 6.6667 is 20/3, so 20/3 * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875) /3 e-24.

20 * 2.056875 is 41.1375; 41.1375 / 3 is approximately 13.7125. So 13.7125e-24 s, which is 1.37125e-23 s.

Wait, no, wait, 6.6667 is approx 20/3. So 20/3 * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875) / 3 = 41.1375 /3 = 13.7125e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 seconds? Wait, no, 13.7125e-24 is 1.37125e-23. Right.

Now, the velocity of the particle. Since it's a relativistic meson, its velocity is close to the speed of light. For high energies, we can approximate v ≈ c. But maybe more accurately, v = c * sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) )? Or perhaps since E is much larger than m, v ≈ c.

But let's compute it more accurately. The velocity of a particle is given by v = c * sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV (assuming c=1 units, but when in natural units, c=1, so E² = p² c² + m² c^4. So E² = (pc)^2 + m² c^4. Wait, but in natural units, c=1, so E² = p² + m².

So v = (p c)/E. But p = sqrt(E² - m² c^4)/c, but in natural units, p = sqrt(E² - m²) / c.

Wait, perhaps I should compute beta, which is v/c.

Beta is given by beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)). Wait, I think E is the total energy, so beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E² c^4))? Wait, no, in natural units where c=1, E² = p² + m². So beta = p/E = sqrt( E² - m² ) / E.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E^2)).

So m is 1.2 GeV, E is 8 GeV. So m/E = 1.2 /8 = 0.15. So (m/E)^2 is 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887, so v ≈ 0.9887c.

So v is roughly 0.9887 * c, where c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So now, the decay length L is v * τ_lab.

τ_lab is 1.37125e-23 seconds. So L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

Let me compute this:

3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s = 3e8 * 1.37125e-23 = (3 * 1.37125) e (8 -23) = 4.11375e-15 m. Then multiplied by 0.9887, which is about 0.9887 *4.11375e-15 ≈ 4.065e-15 m.

Wait, let me compute 4.11375 * 0.9887.

4.11375 * 0.9887. Let's see:

4 * 0.9887 = 3.9548.

0.11375 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.1123.

So total is 3.9548 + 0.1123 = 4.0671, approximately. So 4.0671e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Wait, so that's about 4.067e-15 m, which is close to option B. Option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a second, let me double-check the calculation steps, because sometimes it's easy to get mixed up with units or exponents.

So, calculating L:

v ≈ 0.9887c = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s.

But wait, let me compute v more accurately. Let's compute beta more precisely.

E = 8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

beta = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2) = sqrt(1 -0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775).

What's the exact value of sqrt(0.9775)? Let's calculate it.

0.9775 is between 0.98²=0.9604 and 0.988²= (0.98+0.008)^2 = 0.98² + 2*0.98*0.008 + 0.008² = 0.9604 + 0.01568 + 0.000064= 0.976144. Wait, wait, 0.988² is 0.976144. But 0.9775 is higher than that. So let me find a value between 0.988 and 0.989.

Let me compute 0.9885^2: (0.988 +0.0005)^2 = 0.988^2 + 2 * 0.988 *0.0005 + (0.0005)^2 = 0.976144 + 0.000988 + 0.00000025 = 0.97713225. Hmm, that's 0.97713225. Our target is 0.9775. So 0.9885^2 is 0.97713225. The difference is 0.9775 - 0.97713225 = 0.00036775.

How much more than 0.9885 do we need to add to get 0.9775?

Let me let x = 0.9885 + delta. So x² ≈ 0.9885² + 2*0.9885 * delta.

We have x² = 0.9775, so 0.97713225 + 2 * 0.9885 * delta ≈ 0.9775.

Subtracting: 2*0.9885 * delta ≈ 0.00036775.

So delta ≈ 0.00036775/(2*0.9885) ≈ 0.00036775/(1.977) ≈ approx 0.000186.

So delta ≈ 0.000186. So x ≈ 0.9885 + 0.000186 = 0.988686.

So beta ≈ 0.988686, which is approximately 0.9887, as I had before. So v ≈ 0.9887c. So that's accurate enough.

So, L = v * τ_lab.

v is approx 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s.

Wait, 3e8 m/s is 3 * 10^8 m/s. So 0.9887 * 3e8 = approx 2.9661e8 m/s.

Wait, 3e8 *0.9887 is 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, τ_lab was calculated as 1.37125e-23 seconds. So L = 2.966e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

Multiply 2.966e8 by 1.37125e-23:

First, 2.966 * 1.37125 ≈ Let's compute that.

2 *1.37125=2.7425
0.966 *1.37125: 0.9 *1.37125=1.234125; 0.066 *1.37125≈0.0905. So total is approx 1.234125 +0.0905 =1.3246. So overall, 2.7425 +1.3246=4.0671.

Then the exponents: 1e8 *1e-23 = 1e-15.

So, 4.0671e-15 meters. Which matches option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in calculating tau_lab.

Let me recheck that.

tau_rest = hbar / Gamma.

hbar is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So tau_rest = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.

6.582 divided by 0.32: let's compute that accurately.

0.32 * 20 = 6.4, which is a bit less than 6.582. 20 * 0.32 =6.4. 6.582-6.4=0.182.

0.182 /0.32 = 0.56875. So 20.56875.

So 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s.

Then tau_lab is gamma * tau_rest.

Gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666667.

So 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Calculating 6.6666667 * 2.056875.

6 *2.056875=12.34125.

0.6666667 *2.056875 = approx 1.37125.

So total is 12.34125 +1.37125 =13.7125.

So, 13.7125e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.

Then v is 0.9887c= 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 2.9661e8 m/s.

Multiply by tau_lab: 2.9661e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

2.9661e8 * 1.37125e-23 = (2.9661 *1.37125) * 1e-15.

2.9661 *1.37125: Let's compute more accurately.

2 *1.37125 =2.7425.

0.9661 *1.37125:

0.9 *1.37125=1.234125.

0.0661 *1.37125: 0.0661 *1=0.0661, 0.0661 *0.37125=approx 0.02453.

So 0.0661 *1.37125 = 0.0661 +0.02453 =0.09063.

So 0.9661 *1.37125 = 1.234125 +0.09063=1.324755.

So total 2.7425 +1.324755=4.067255.

So 4.067255e-15 meters.

Which is approximately 4.067e-15 m, which matches option B of 4.0655e-15 m. The slight discrepancy is due to approximation in beta calculation.

So the correct answer is B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for decay length:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}}
\]

where \( v \) is the velocity of the particle and \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \) is the lifetime in the lab frame. The steps to calculate these quantities are as follows:

### 1. **Calculate the proper lifetime (\( \tau_{\text{rest}} \))**
The proper lifetime is related to the decay width (\( \Gamma_X \)) by:

\[
\tau_{\text{rest}} = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X}
\]

Given \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma_X = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \), we find:

\[
\tau_{\text{rest}} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### 2. **Relativistic time dilation**
The lab frame lifetime (\( \tau_{\text{lab}} \)) is related to the proper lifetime by the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \)):

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau_{\text{rest}}
\]

The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X}
\]

where \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Thus:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma \) and \( \tau_{\text{rest}} \):

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
\]

### 3. **Calculate the velocity (\( v \))**
The velocity of the particle is approximated using the relativistic relation:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m_X^2}{E_X^2}}
\]

Substituting \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1.2}{8}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

Thus, the velocity is:

\[
v = \beta \cdot c = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.9661 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

### 4. **Calculate the decay length (\( L \))**
Finally, the decay length is:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}}
\]

Substituting \( v = 2.9661 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( \tau_{\text{lab}} = 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 2.9661 \times 10^8 \cdot 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} = 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### 5. **Compare with options**
The calculated decay length (\( 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)) is closest to option **B** (\( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)).

**Answer: B**
