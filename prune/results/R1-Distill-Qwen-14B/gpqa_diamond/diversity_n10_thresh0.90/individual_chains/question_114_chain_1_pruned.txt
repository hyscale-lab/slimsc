Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might make some mistakes, but I'll do my best to figure it out.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to select the correct reagents A and B from the options provided.

First reaction: butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each pairing A and B with different reagents.

Hmm, okay, let's tackle the first reaction. Butan-2-one is also known as methylacetone. The reaction with NaCN... wait, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide under certain conditions, they undergo nucleophilic addition. But wait, under what conditions? I think in the presence of an acid catalyst, maybe?

Wait, but what's the product? 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So structure is (CH3)2C=O.

When NaCN is added, butan-2-one would react. The mechanism probably involves the cyanide ion attacking the carbonyl carbon. But wait, for this to happen, the carbonyl needs to be activated. So maybe an acid catalyst is used. Or perhaps another way.

Wait, I think that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide in the presence of H+ (like H3O+), it undergoes acid-catalyzed addition. The mechanism would be: the carbonyl oxygen gets protonated, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. Then the CN- (from NaCN) attacks the carbonyl C, leading to a tetrahedral intermediate. Then the oxygen would have a negative charge, which would get protonated again, and eventually water is eliminated, giving the cyanohydrin.

So the product would be a cyanohydrin, which is what the first reaction gives. So the reagent A must be an acid, like H3O+.

Looking at the options, for A, options A and B have H3O+, while C and D have NaHSO3. So that's a clue. NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and SO3^2- but I'm not sure if it's used here. Maybe for something else.

So for A, perhaps H3O+ is the correct reagent. So options A and B might be candidates.

Now, moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The reagent is B, which is H2O. Wait, no, wait. The reaction is with B, which is H2O. But the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted to a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

So how does a nitrile become a carboxylic acid? I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under various conditions. One common way is hydrolysis with strong acid and heat. For example, using H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) as a catalyst, maybe with some water and heat. Another possibility is using a base, but that might give a different product.

Wait, another thought: Hydrolysis of nitriles typically can be done under acidic or basic conditions. Acidic hydrolysis (like with H2SO4 and heat) tends to produce carboxylic acids. Basic hydrolysis (like with NaOH) might produce carboxylate salts, which can then be acidified to get the acid.

But in this case, the re
