Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this neutrino flux problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about the Sun's neutrino production. Normally, the Sun produces a lot of neutrinos through various reactions, and the main ones are from the proton-proton (pp) chains. I remember that the pp chain has different branches, like pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Oh wait, the question specifically mentions the pp-III branch stopping, so I need to focus on that.

So, the scenario is that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago (which is roughly the time it takes for sunlight to reach Earth). All other reactions are as usual. I need to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A) 10, B) 0.01, C)1, D)0.1.

Hmm, I think the pp-III branch is responsible for producing a specific type of neutrino. Oh right, the pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos, like the ones in the higher energy bands. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

The pp chains are the main source of solar neutrinos. The pp-I and pp-II branches produce lower-energy neutrinos, while the pp-III branch contributes more to the higher-energy neutrinos. Oh wait, no, maybe I have that reversed. Or perhaps it's the other way around. I remember that the dominant neutrino production in the pp chains is from the pp-I branch, which produces lower-energy neutrinos. The pp-III branch is a minor contributor but produces higher-energy ones.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, then the flux of higher-energy neutrinos from that source would drop. But since the question is about the flux ratio between two bands, I need to see how each band is affected.

Band 1 is 700-800 keV, and Band 2 is 800-900 keV. If the pp-III branch is the main contributor to higher energies, then stopping it would reduce the flux in higher bands more than lower ones.

Wait, but neutrinos come from different reactions. The main source is the pp-I and pp-II branches, which produce lower-energy neutrinos. The pp-III branch produces a smaller but higher-energy neutrino flux. So when pp-III stops, the higher energy bands (like Band 2) would be affected more.

So, before the pp-III stopped, both bands had their usual fluxes. Now, after stopping, the flux in Band 2 (800-900) would drop significantly because it's more dependent on pp-III. Band 1, being lower, might have less dependence. So, the flux in Band 1 would be about the same as before, and Band 2 would decrease.

Wait, but neutrinos from the pp-III branch are in higher energy ranges. So, if pp-III stops, then the high-energy neutrinos (like Band 2) would have lower flux, while lower energy (Band 1) might not be as affected. So the ratio (flux1/flux2) would be higher than before, because flux2 is lower.

But how much exactly? Let me think about the typical contributions. The pp-III branch contributes a smaller number of neutrinos but at higher energies. So, for the bands in question, maybe Band 2 is where pp-III's neutrinos fall.

If pp-III was a major source for Band 2, then without it, the flux there would drop. Let's suppose that without pp-III, the neutrino flux in Band 2 drops to zero or almost zero, but Band 1 remains relatively unchanged.

Wait, that's probably an extreme case. But neutrinos from other sources, like the CNO cycle, might contribute to higher energies as well. Wait, the CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos than the pp chain, if I remember correctly. Oh, but CNO (
