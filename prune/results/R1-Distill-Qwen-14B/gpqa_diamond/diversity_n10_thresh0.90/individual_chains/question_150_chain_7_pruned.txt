Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a start. The NMR data is given, and a series of reactions are performed. I need to determine the final product from the options provided.

First, let me parse the NMR data because that should give me structural information.

The 1H NMR peaks are:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

So, let's break these down.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a high chemical shift, which usually suggests an aldehyde proton. But wait, sometimes it could be an acidic proton like an aromatic OH, but in the presence of D2O it would disappear or change. Also, since it's a triplet, maybe coupling with two adjacent protons? Or perhaps it's part of a conjugated system.

Looking at the aromatic region: 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets each integrating for 2H. So perhaps two sets of aromatic protons, each as a doublet, suggesting a para-substituted benzene ring each. Like two phenyl groups attached in a para fashion.

The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad often suggests exchange or something like an enol proton. Alternatively, maybe it's an allylic position or part of a conjugated system. Or perhaps these are protons adjacent to an electronegative group, but I'm not sure.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That's around where CH2 groups attached to something electronegative (like oxygen) would appear. Maybe a methylene group next to an oxygen, like -O-CH2-CH2- or something similar. But considering the triplet at 9.72, perhaps it's part of a conjugated system, like a carbonyl.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X is 0 here. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So five degrees: that could be a ring (1) + double bonds (4) or other combinations. Hmm.

Looking at the options, the products are all butenals or something with phenyl groups. So maybe the starting material is a di-substituted benzene with some substituents.

Wait, the starting compound must have two aromatic rings because the options have bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) groups. So perhaps the NMR is of a compound with two phenyl rings attached to a buten aldehyde or similar.

Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

The triplet at 9.72 ppm is probably the aldehyde proton. But wait, in some cases, an aldehyde proton is a singlet. But maybe it's coupled with adjacent protons. For example, in a conjugated system. Like R-CH2-CHO. Or maybe it's an alpha proton. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aldehyde adjacent to a double bond, making the aldehyde proton split into a triplet. Hmm.

Then the aromatic signals: 6.98 and 6.51 as doublets. Each integrates to 2H, so maybe each is a pair of protons on a para-substituted benzene ring. So perhaps two phenyl groups are attached to the main chain.

The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with water, but
