Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the setup is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of that hemisphere is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, but the spots are cooler, maybe 5000K since the temperature difference is 1000K. Wait, wait—the question says the spots have a temperature difference of 1000K. Oh, right, so the spots are 1000K cooler than the star's effective temperature. So if the star is 6000K, the spots are 5000K.

The problem says that because of these spots, when the star rotates, the brightness variations observed photometrically could mimic an exoplanet transit. So the goal is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same light curve amplitude as these spots do. But the twist is, if the star wasn't covered by spots, what planet radius would cause the same signal.

Hmm. So I need to figure out the change in brightness caused by the spots, and then find the planet radius that would cause the same change.

Wait, but wait. Let me first think about how the spots affect the light curve. Since the star is rotating, as the spotted hemisphere comes into view, the brightness drops a bit. When the spot is on the far side, brightness returns to normal. So the dip caused by the spots would look like a transit, but it's actually due to the spots.

So the key is to compute the relative change in brightness (the amplitude of the dip) caused by the spots, and then set that equal to what a planet would cause when it transits.

But wait, the planet transit causes a dip because the planet blocks some of the star's light as it passes in front. The depth of the dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.

So for the planet, the dip ΔF_planet is (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because area scales with the square of radius.

For the spots, the dip is a bit more complex. Each spot has a lower temperature, so when they're facing us, they contribute less to the total flux. So the flux from the star without spots is F0 = 4πRstar² * sigma * Teff^4. But with spots, the flux is F0 - (number of spots * area per spot * sigma * Tspot^4) + the rest of the star's surface. Wait, perhaps another approach: the flux when the spots are visible is F = F0 * (1 - f), where f is the fraction of the star's surface covered by cooler spots, and considering their lower temperature.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The total flux from the star when part of it is cooler spots is F = F0 * (1 - f) + F_spot * f, where F_spot is the flux per unit area from the spots. Because F_spot is lower than F0.

So F_spot = sigma * T_spot^4, and F0 is sigma * Teff^4.

So the total flux when spots are visible is F = F0 * [ (1 - f) + (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) * f ]

Then, the change in flux, ΔF = F0 * [ (1 - f) + (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) * f ] - F0

Which simplifies to ΔF = F0 * [ (1 - f) + (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) * f - 1 ]

= F0 * [ -f + f (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) ]

= F0 * f [ (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) - 1 ]

So the dip in flux is ΔF = F0 * f * ( (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) - 1 )

Wait, but since the spots are cooler, T_spot < Teff. So (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) is less than 1, so (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) -1 is negative. So the dip is a decrease in flux, which makes sense.

So the fractional change in flux is (ΔF / F0) = f * ( (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) - 1 )

Wait, but wait, the problem is that when the star isn't covered by spots, the dip would be due to a planet. So the dip from the planet is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

But the dip from the spots is (ΔF_spot / F0) = f * [ (T_spot^
