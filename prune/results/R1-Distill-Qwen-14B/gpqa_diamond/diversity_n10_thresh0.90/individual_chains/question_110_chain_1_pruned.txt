Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Let's start by understanding the problem. 

First, I remember that both observatories have different magnitude limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 mag. Wait, so they can observe stars up to a certain apparent magnitude. Wait, higher magnitudes are fainter, so brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So, ESPRESSO can see up to 17 mag, which is fainter than what HIRES can see, which is up to 16 mag. So, a star that's brighter than 17 mag can be seen by both, but HIRES can't see stars fainter than 16, but ESPRESSO can go a bit fainter.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The question says, for ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. That means apparent V mag less than or equal to 17, because lower magnitude is brighter. So, the apparent magnitude needs to be <=17 for ESPRESSO. For HIRES, stars brighter than 16 mag, so apparent V <=16. So, a star must have apparent V magnitude <=16 to be seen by both. Because if it's <=16, then it's within both limits. Because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so it can see anything up to 17. But HIRES can't see beyond 16. So, only stars with apparent V mag <=16 can be seen by both.

Wait, but wait, no. The star's apparent magnitude must be bright enough for both instruments. So, the star must be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO? Wait, no. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" by ESPRESSO. Brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So, if a star's apparent V is brighter than 17, meaning V <17, it's observable. Similarly, for HIRES, stars brighter than 16, meaning V<16.

So, for a star to be observable by both, its V mag must be
