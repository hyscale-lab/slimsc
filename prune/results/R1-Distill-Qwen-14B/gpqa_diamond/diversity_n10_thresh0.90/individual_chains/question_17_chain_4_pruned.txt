Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Wait, right, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The Ca-EDTA complex is a stable one because of the large K value. So the K here is the formation constant, which tells us how much the complex forms.

So, the complex is CaY²-, where Y is the EDTA^4- ion. The reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaY²-. The K for this reaction is given as 5e10, which is a very large number, meaning the complex is highly favored.

The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. I need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in the solution. Since EDTA is in excess and the solution is at ideal pH, I can probably assume that the EDTA is present in sufficient quantity, but wait, the problem states it's a stoichiometric solution. Oh wait, "stoichiometric" means that the molar amounts of Ca²+ and EDTA are in a 1:1 ratio. So, if the concentration of CaY²- is 0.02 M, that implies that all the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex. But wait, no, because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, each Ca²+ requires one EDTA^4- ion.

Wait, let me think again. If the solution is 0.02 M CaY²-, and this is the only species present, then the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But in solution, some of this complex might dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. The K is given, so I can use that to find the [Ca²+].

The formation constant K is given by K = [CaY²-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ). So, the K is 5e10.

But wait, in the solution, the total EDTA comes from two sources: the free EDTA^4- and that which is bound in the CaY²- complex. But since the pH is ideal, I'm assuming that the other forms of EDTA (like HEDTA species) are negligible, so the majority is in the form of EDTA^4-.

But wait, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. So the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are exactly in a 1:1 ratio. Wait, no. Wait, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So that means that initially, before any dissociation, each mole of complex gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-. But stoichiometric here probably means that the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA were in a 1:1 ratio. So, perhaps in this case, the total concentration of CaY²- is 0.02 M, and the solution doesn't have excess EDTA or Ca²+ because they were added in the same molar amounts. So, any dissociation would affect both [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-].

So, let me model this. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate from the complex. Then, the concentration of Ca²+ would be x, and the concentration of EDTA^4- would be x as well. Because for every x amount of CaY²- that dissociates, you get x Ca²+ and x EDTA^4-.

But wait, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So the total concentration of CaY²- plus the dissociated species should sum up to 0.02 M. Wait, no. The total concentration of the complex plus the dissociated species would be 0.02 M. Because the initial solution is 0.02 M CaY²-.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the complex dissociation. Let me set up the variables:

Let’s denote:
- [CaY²-] = 0.02 M (initially, but considering dissociation, it would be 0.02 - x)
Wait, no, because when x moles of CaY²- dissociate, each gives one mole of Ca²+ and one of EDTA^4-. So the complex concentration would decrease by x, so [CaY²-] = 0.02 - x.

But wait, considering that the amount of dissociation x is probably very small compared to 0.02 M, because K is so large (5e10), which suggests that the complex is very stable and doesn't dissociate much. So x would be very small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So we can approximate [CaY²-] ≈ 0.02 M.

So, the K expression is:

K = [CaY²-]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

We can say [CaY²-] ≈ 0.02.

What about [EDTA^4-]? Well, the total EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex. The EDTA in solution is the free EDTA^4- plus that which is bound in the complex. But the problem is, the solution is sto
