Okay, so I have this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to move at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. Let me recall, lithium has an atomic number of 3, so its nucleus is Li-6, I think. Because Li typically has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, making it Li-6. So the mass number A is 6. That means the nucleus is ^6Li.

So I need to find the energy of the RHIC that gives this nucleus a speed of 0.96c. I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, relativistic effects are significant, so I should use the relativistic energy equations.

The energy of a relativistic particle is given by the total energy formula: E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So first, I need to compute gamma for v=0.96c.

Let me calculate gamma first. v is 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Taking the square root of 0.0784, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, wait, wait, I think 0.28 is 28/100, so 1/(28/100) is 100/28, which is approximately 3.57142857.

So gamma is about 3.5714. Now, the mass of the nucleus is needed. The nucleus is ^6Li, so I need to find its rest mass. I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be approximated using the mass of its constituent protons and neutrons. Each proton has a mass of about 938 MeV/c², as does each neutron.

Wait, but wait, the exact mass of ^6Li is slightly less than 6 times the mass of a proton because of binding energy. Or perhaps I should use the atomic mass. Let me think. For a nucleus, the mass is approximately the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons minus the mass defect due to binding energy. But since we're dealing with an approximate problem here, maybe we can just use the mass of a proton and neutron multiplied by their respective numbers. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look up the exact atomic mass of ^6Li, but since I can't do that right now, I'll make an approximation.

Wait, but wait another thing. The mass of a proton is about 1.007276 GeV/c², and a neutron is about 1.008665 GeV/c². So for ^6Li, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total mass would be 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665) GeV/c².

Let me compute that. 3 * 1.007276 is 3.021828 GeV/c², and 3 * 1.008665 is 3.025995 GeV/c². Adding those together gives 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 GeV/c².

Wait, but wait, that's the sum of the individual masses. The actual mass of the nucleus (^6Li) will be a bit less because of the mass defect (binding energy). But maybe the problem expects us to ignore that, or perhaps use the mass of the nucleus as 6 times the mass of a proton, since Li-6 has 6 nucleons. Alternatively, maybe I should use the exact atomic mass, but without exact data, I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me think again. The problem gives the nucleus as X with 3 neutrons, which is Li (so 3 protons), making it Li-6. The exact mass might be better calculated using the atomic mass. Let me recall that the atomic mass of ^6Li is approximately 6.015122811 u (atomic mass units). To convert that into GeV/c², I can use the conversion factor: 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c², which is 0.9315 GeV/c².

So 6.015122811 u * 0.9315 GeV/u = ?

Let me compute that: 6 * 0.9315 is 5.589 GeV, 0.015122811 * 0.9315 ≈ 0.01405 GeV. So total is approximately 5.589 + 0.01405 ≈ 5.603 GeV/c². Wait, but wait, wait a minute. That can't be right because that would give the mass as 5.6 GeV/c². But earlier, when I added the protons and neutrons, I had about 6 GeV/c². So there's a discrepancy here. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation.

Wait another thing: Let me verify the exact calculation. 6.015122811 u * 0.9315 GeV/u.

So 6 * 0.9315 = 5.589 GeV.

0.015122811 * 0.9315 = 0.014051 GeV.

So the total is 5.589 + 0.014051 ≈ 5.60305 GeV/c². So the mass of the ^6Li nucleus is about 5.603 GeV/c².

Wait, but I thought that the sum of protons and neutrons is around 6 GeV/c². So the actual mass is a bit less, about 5.6 GeV, which makes sense due to the mass defect.

So using that, m = 5.603 GeV/c².

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the mass of the proton, which is about 938 MeV, so 0.938 GeV, and the neutron is around 939 MeV, or 0.939 GeV.

So for ^6Li, 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the sum is 3*(0.938+0.939) GeV? Wait no, that would be 3*(proton mass + neutron mass?), which isn't correct. Each proton adds 0.938, each neutron adds 0.939. So 3*(0.938 + 0.939) = 3*(1.877) = 5.631 GeV/c². Wait, but that's just the sum, not considering binding energy. Hmm.

But the actual mass of ^6Li is less than that. So perhaps using the exact value from the atomic mass is better. Let me try again.

Atomic mass of ^6Li is 6.015122811 u. 1 u is 931.494065 MeV/c², which is approximately 0.931494 GeV/c².

So 6.015122811 u * 0.931494 GeV/u = ?

Calculating: 6 * 0.931494 = 5.588964 GeV.

0.015122811 * 0.931494 ≈ Let's compute this:

0.015122811 * 0.931494.

Hmm, 0.015 * 0.931494 is approximately 0.01397241.

So total is approximately 5.588964 + 0.01397241 ≈ 5.602936 GeV/c². So m ≈ 5.6029 GeV/c².

So the rest mass of the nucleus is about 5.6029 GeV/c².

Now, the total energy E is gamma * m c². So we've got gamma as 3.5714, m c² is 5.6029 GeV.

So E = 3.5714 * 5.6029 GeV.

Let me calculate that:

3.5714 * 5.6029.

Hmm. Let's break it down.

3 * 5.6029 is 16.8087.

0.5714 * 5.6029.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 3
