Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and NMR spectra. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethyl sulfide to get product 3. We need to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR.

First, I'll try to figure out each step. Let's start with the first reaction.

1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalides) react with KOH, they undergo elimination to form alkenes via an E2 mechanism. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a diegeminal dihalide, right? No, wait, 1,3 positions are on the adamantane structure. Oh, wait, no—adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the positions are on adjacent carbons but not directly next to each other. Wait, 1,3-dibromo would be on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure? Hmm, I might be getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but for vicinal dihalides.

Wait, no, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When heated with KOH, it's likely an elimination reaction. Vicinal dihalides eliminate to form alkenes. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so, the two bromines are on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane. Wait, but in adamantane, each carbon is connected to three others, so maybe the structure allows for a bridge or something.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination. Wait, KOH with a dihalide—could it be a dehydrohalogenation? But if the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, that would make it a vicinal dihalide, which can eliminate to form an alkene. But if the two bromines are on 1 and 3 positions, perhaps they're on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. So, eliminating both would form a double bond.

So, reacting 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH would produce an alkene. The product would be 1,3-diene or something similar. Wait, but wait, the product is a light yellow solid. I recall that when alkenes are formed, sometimes they are dienes, but 1,3-diene would have two double bonds? Or maybe it's a mono-alkene.

Wait, the product is called product 1. The 1H NMR of product 1 has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). Also, IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl group, maybe an ester or ketone. Hmm, but wait, the first step involved KOH and elimination, which usually forms an alkene without a carbonyl. So that's confusing.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is not elimination but something else. KOH is a strong base but can also act as a nucleophile. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a dihalide. Substitution would maybe lead to a diol if it's an SN2, but that would require each Br to be replaced by OH, but that would be in a diol. But the IR doesn't show broad peaks that would be expected for OH groups, and the NMR doesn't show any broad singlets. So perhaps that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction is elimination leading to a cyclopropane ring. I remember that when 1,2-dihalides are treated with KOH, sometimes cyclopropanes can form via a double elimination. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the bromines on adjacent carbons in a way that allows for such an elimination.

Wait, no, adamantane is a diamondoid structure with each carbon connected to three others. So, 1 and 3 positions might not be adjacent but rather on the same bridge. Hmm, perhaps elimination would form a bridgehead double bond. Wait, but bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed due to Bredt's rule. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Let me think about IR again. The IR peak at 1720 cm-1 indicates a carbonyl group. So product 1 has a carbonyl. But how does that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Wait, maybe it's a substitution reaction but in a way that forms a ketone. Oh! Wait, perhaps it's a Hoffman elimination or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation with a base. Wait, but elimination usually gives alkenes, which don't have carbonyls.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Wait, maybe the base deprotonates something, and then an intramolecular attack occurs, forming a carbonyl group. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the dihalide reacts with KOH to form a diepoxide. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic displacement where each bromide is replaced by an oxygen group.

Wait, perhaps it's a neighboring group participation. But I'm not too sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that after elimination, a ketone forms. Wait, but how? Let's think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

Adamantane has a structure where each carbon is connected to three others, forming a diamond-like lattice. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromines on adjacent bridgeheads. Wait, perhaps upon heating with KOH, the two bromides undergo elimination, and a bridgehead double bond forms. But again, bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed, so that's a problem.

Wait, alternative approach: Maybe the KOH isn't just a base but also an oxidizing agent. But I don't think KOH is an oxidizing agent under these conditions.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by hydration. But then product 1's IR shows a carbonyl, which would suggest a ketone or an ester. But if the first step is elimination to form an alkene, then maybe a second step is happening here, but the question says that product 1 is formed.

Wait a minute, the initial reaction is with excess KOH. Maybe after elimination, there's some kind of acid work-up, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a ketone. Wait, but I'm not sure how that would happen. Another possibility: the elimination leads to the formation of a diradical, which then could form a carbonyl group. But I'm not very familiar with that mechanism.

Hmm, perhaps I should look at the NMR data of product 1. The peaks are at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H, which could be an -OCH2- group, such as in a ketone maybe? Or perhaps an ether. But the IR has a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, but in a ketone, the carbonyl is adjacent to two CH2 groups. So maybe the structure is something like a cyclohexanone derivative. Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide, but epoxides have different NMR signals.

Wait, another thought: If product 1 is a ketone, maybe the reaction is a pinacol-like rearrangement, but that usually involves vicinal diols.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial structure, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon elimination, forms a bridgehead carbonyl. But bridgehead carbonyls are allowed, right? Because Bredt's rule mainly disallows bridgehead double bonds, especially in bicyclic systems with less than 8 members in each bridge. But for ketones, it's allowed as long as the structure is stable.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone, but the NMR doesn't show that.

Wait, maybe the product is an adamantyl group with a ketone. So, considering the NMR: 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group attached to an oxygen, maybe an OCH2CH2 group. But 4.79 is a bit high for an OCH2. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl adjacent to a CH2 group.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about the IR peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl, maybe a ketone or an ester. Esters typically show up around 1740-1710 cm-1. So 1720 would be an ester or maybe a ketone. But how does that happen from the initial reaction?

Wait a minute, maybe the first reaction is a double elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, in some cases, when two adjacent dihalides are present, elimination can form a carbonyl group. For example, in the formation of ketones from vicinal dihalides using a strong base. Oh wait, I think that's called the Corey-Fuchs reaction or something similar, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, where two adjacent X (Br) groups are eliminated with two H's to form a carbonyl. For example, if you have CH2BrCH2Br and treat it with a strong base, you can eliminate both Brs and two Hs to form CO, but that's more for geminal dihalides. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a geminal dihalide.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck here. Let me think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has a structure where each carbon is part of a diamond lattice, so the 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent carbons in the structure. So, maybe they are vicinal dihalides, which upon elimination with a strong base like KOH, would form a trans-alkene.

But if the product 1 has a carbonyl group, then perhaps the elimination leads to a carbonyl. Oh! Wait a second, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism? Or, perhaps, the alkene is then oxidized. But the first step doesn't mention an oxidizing agent, just KOH and heat.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination that forms a carbonyl. So, for example, in a vicinal dihalide, two E2 eliminations could form a carbonyl group. Let me think about that.

Wait, the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane—if the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, perhaps the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the elimination of HBr, forming a double bond. But to form a carbonyl, maybe two HBr's are eliminated, and perhaps another process occurs.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the initial reaction is a double elimination to form a ketone. For instance, if the structure is such that elimination of two HBr molecules leads to a carbonyl group. So, two HBr eliminations would leave behind a carbonyl.

But wait, for that to happen, the starting material would need to be a geminal dihalide, which 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps after elimination, the alkene undergoes a dihydroxylation, but that's not likely under KOH conditions.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is a singlet, which usually implies that the two hydrogens are equivalent and not split by neighboring hydrogens. 4.79 is in the range of an
