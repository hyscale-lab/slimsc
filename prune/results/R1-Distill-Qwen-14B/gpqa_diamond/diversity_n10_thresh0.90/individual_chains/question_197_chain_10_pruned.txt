Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem statement says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. We need to find out what the final product is, given the IR and NMR data of Compound X and four options.

First, let's break down the reaction. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen reduction is a reaction that reduces ketones to alkanes. It involves the reaction of a ketone with H2O (from HI) and red phosphorus, which acts as a catalyst. So, if Compound X has a ketone group, the product will have a CH2 group where the carbonyl was.

Looking at the IR data: The IR shows strong peaks. The first big region is 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or maybe C-H stretches, but that's a broad region. However, looking closer, the 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, specifically a ketone or maybe an ester or aldehyde. But wait, the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So, this suggests that the compound has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group, probably a ketone on the aromatic ring, like a substituted acetophenone.

Now, looking at the NMR data to support this.

The 1H NMR spectrum has several signals:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is often indicative of an -OH proton, but wait, in a ketone, there wouldn't be an -OH. Oh, but wait, if it's a carbonyl group, perhaps it's an aldehyde proton. Aldehyde protons typically appear around 9-10 ppm as sharp singlets. But this is a broad signal, which might be an -OH from a phenol or something else. Hmm, maybe it's an acidic proton like in a carboxylic acid? Wait, but if the compound has a ketone, then a carboxylic acid would have a carbonyl at higher ppm, but maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps it's a vinylic proton, but I'm not sure. Wait, 10.5 is a bit high; maybe it's an aldehyde. Or maybe it's a carboxylic acid, but then the IR would show a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3000, which the first peak does. So, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid. But wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which can be either a ketone (around 1700-1750) or an ester or carboxylic acid (carboxylic acids have lower carbonyl frequencies, around 1700 but usually broader due to hydrogen bonding). Wait, no, wait. The 1720 cm-1 is a sharp peak, which is more indicative of a ketone. Because carboxylic acids have lower frequencies, like around 1700, but their peaks are often broad because of intermolecular hydrogen bonding. So, the 1720 is more likely a ketone. Therefore, the 10.5 ppm peak might not be an -OH, but perhaps a vinylic proton or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton, but I thought aldehydes are around 9-10. Maybe it's a phenolic -OH, but that would be broad and maybe appear around 5-6 ppm, but this is higher. Hmm, maybe it's an acidic proton from another group.

Wait, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is not an -OH. Let me think again. Another possibility is that it's a vinylic proton, but in the aromatic region, those are usually between 6.5-8.5 ppm. So 10.5 is outside that. Maybe an aldehyde? Let me think about the structure.

The other signals are:
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)
-7.2 ppm (d, 2H): So these look like two doublets, each integrating to 2H. This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, each H is equivalent, and they couple with each other, giving a doublet. So the aromatic ring is para-substituted, with two substituents. Wait, or maybe it's a meta substitution? No, because in meta, the coupling would be more complex, perhaps a triplet or something else. So para substituents: so it's likely a substituent on the benzene ring, possibly at the para position, maybe a carbonyl group.

Looking at the splitting: Each of the aromatic protons is a doublet, which suggests that each is coupling with one other proton. So for a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, perhaps each substituent is in the para position relative to each other, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a single substituent, but with two sets of equivalent protons. Wait, maybe the substituent is a group that causes the aromatic protons to split into doublets. For example, if the substituent is a carbonyl group, then the ring could have substituents in such a way that the two H's adjacent to each substituent are each a doublet.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzophenone derivative. Let's think: if the benzene ring has two substituents, each being a carbonyl group, but that's unlikely because the IR only shows one strong carbonyl. Alternatively, another possibility is a ketone attached to a benzene ring. So, like acetophenone but with substituents.

Wait, looking at the NMR: the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). These signals suggest a chain of some sort attached to the ring.

Let's parse the NMR signals step by step.

The aromatic signals are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, each doublets, 2H each. So, the benzene ring has four H's, which are split into two doublets. So, likely, the ring has two substituents in the para positions, each substituent adjacent to two H's. For example, if the substituents are in the para positions, then each substituent would have two H's adjacent on the ring, each set of H's being equivalent. Each set would be a doublet. So, that fits with a structure like 4-(something)acetophenone or similar.

Wait, but the IR shows a 1720 cm-1 peak, which is a carbonyl. So, perhaps the compound is a ketone attached to the benzene ring, like acetophenone derivatives.

Wait, the 10.5 ppm peak is a singlet, broad. If the structure is, say, a benzaldehyde, the aldehyde proton would be around 9.8-10 ppm as a singlet. But if it's a ketone, why is there a peak at 10.5? Maybe it's not an aldehyde. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid, but then the carbonyl in IR would be lower, and the O-H would be broad in IR, which we see here. So, the IR shows 3400-2500, which could be O-H. Wait, but the 1720 was a strong peak, which is more of a ketone.

Alternatively, could it be a conjugated carbonyl? Maybe a benzophenone with some substituents. Let me think.

So, the 10.5 ppm peak: if it's a ketone, why is there such a high ppm? Wait, no, ketones don't have protons attached to the carbonyl. So, that can't be. So, the 10.5 must be another proton. Maybe it's an acidic proton, like in a phenol. But then, the IR would have a broad O-H stretch around 3000-3500, which the first peak is. So, the 10.5 ppm could be a phenolic -OH, but that's usually around 5-7 ppm, unless it's a strongly activating group. Wait, maybe it's an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with some substituents. But in that case, the aromatic protons would be more deshielded. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted benzaldehyde, but the IR would then show a carbonyl around 1720, which fits.

Wait, but the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a singlet and broad. That could be an aldehyde proton. But in that case, the aromatic protons would be influenced by the aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinylic proton, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 is a COOH proton, but that's usually more in the 10-12 range, but that would mean the IR would have a broad peak around 2500-3000, which it does. But the 1720 in IR is a strong peak, which would fit a carboxylic acid, but carboxylic acids typically have lower carbonyl frequencies, around 1700. Wait, but sometimes they can be higher. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or an acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a substituted phenylpropanoic acid. Let me think. If it's a benzoic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, and the -OH would be around 10.5. So that fits. The IR would have the O-H stretch at 3400-2500, which is broad. But the 1720 would indicate a higher frequency, which is more like an ester or a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the NMR splitting. The aromatic protons are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So, the ring has two substituents in such a way that each substituent is meta to each other, but that would lead to more complex splitting. Alternatively, para substituents.

Wait, for example, if the substituent is in the para position, then each substituent leads to two H's being adjacent, each of which is a doublet. Like, if the substituent is a carbonyl group, then the ring would have two substituents opposite each other. Wait, no, if the substituent is at the para position, then the substituent is just one, but if it's a di-substituted ring with substituents in the para positions, that would mean two substituents opposite each other. But the IR only shows one carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a ketone group. For example, in acetophenone, the ring has a methyl ketone attached. So, the structure would be benzene with a COCH2R group attached at the para position. Wait, but the NMR doesn't show a methyl group as a singlet. Oh, wait, no. The NMR shows a 1.4 ppm d (doublet) integrating to 3H, which suggests a CH2CH(CH3)2 structure or something similar. Let me think about that.

The other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let's try to figure out what this chain looks like.

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) indicates a CH2CH2CH3 group. The triplet suggests that the CH2 is next to a CH2 group. Wait, in a triplet, the neighboring group has two protons. So, the 0.9 ppm is a terminal CH3, so the neighboring group is a CH2 attached to it. So, perhaps a CH2CH2CH3 part.

Looking at the 1.4 ppm doublet (3H): a doublet for 3H suggests that it's a methyl group attached to a CH group, which in turn is attached to another group. So, maybe a CH(CH3) group.

The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) suggests two protons, perhaps in a CH2 group adjacent to a branching point.

The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) is a single proton, perhaps in a CH group adjacent to a branching point.

Putting this together, the chain could be something like CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-something. Wait, perhaps it's a butyl group.

Wait, let me try to draw it.

Looking at the NMR:

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): this is a terminal CH3 group, likely part of a longer chain. The triplet indicates it's adjacent to a CH2 group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to a CH group. So, like CH(CH3)-something.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): perhaps a CH2 group attached to a branching point.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a CH group, perhaps connected to another CH2.

Wait, maybe the chain is something like:

The CH3 is at the end (0.9 ppm, triplet). Then a CH2 (maybe 1.7 ppm, m), then a CH group (2.9 ppm, m), then a branching point leading to a CH(CH3) group (1.4 ppm, d). So, perhaps it's a pentyl group, but let me think about the connectivity.

Alternatively, the structure could be a propyl group attached to a branching point, such as a CH(CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a (sec-butyl) group. Let me think: sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-, but wait, the NMR doesn't seem to match that. Let me think.

Wait, let's consider the groups:

The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a CH2CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH(CH3) group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is a CH2, and the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH.

So, the chain might be:

CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-something, but how does it connect?

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-CO-attached to the benzene ring. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent like CH2CH(CH2CH3)CO- attached to the ring.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a carbonyl-adjacent CH group. If the compound is an aryl ketone, perhaps the structure is (4-substituted phenyl)propan-2-one. So, the propan-2-one would have a ketone group on the central carbon.

Wait, so in this case, the structure would be something like:

Ph-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH2CH3) something?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the Compound X is 4-(3-methylbutyl)acetophenone. Let me see. So the structure would be:

Ph-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something? Hmm, but I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and a substituent that's a sec-butyl group.

Wait, the substituent chain in the NMR has 3H at 1.4 ppm as a doublet (so a CH3 attached to a CH), 2H at 1.7 (possibly a CH2 attached to a branching point), and 1H at 2.9 (a CH attached to the carbonyl). So, the chain would be:

Ph-C(O)-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-something? Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-C(O)-CH(CH2CH2CH3). But then the NMR would have to match.

Wait, let me think of the substituent as a propyl group attached to a carbonyl. So, for example, acetophenone would have a methyl group attached to the carbonyl. If it's a propan-2-one, then the substituent would be a larger group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the carbonyl, and the rest of the chain is an ethyl group.

Wait, looking at the NMR again, the substituent chain may look like this:

The 0.9 ppm triplet suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group. So, the chain is connected to a CH2 that's next to a CH.

Wait, perhaps it's a 3-pentyl group. Let me think: the chain is CH2CH2CH(CH3)CH2-, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 3-methylbutyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-C(O)-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-something, but I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, another approach: the IR and NMR together suggest a ketone. So, the structure is a para-substituted acetophenone derivative. So, the aromatic ring has a carbonyl group and another substituent. The substituent is a chain that comes off the carbonyl.

The NMR of the non-aromatic region: 2.9 ppm (1H, m), 1.7 (2H, m), 1.4 (3H, d), 0.9 (3H, t). 

Putting that chain together, it's likely a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the carbonyl. Because:

- The 0.9 triplet is a terminal CH3, so it's part of a CH2CH2CH3 group. So, the CH2 is adjacent to this CH3.

- The 1.4 doublet is a CH3 attached to a CH group.

- The 1.7 multiplet is a CH2 group.

- The 2.9 multiplet is a CH group attached to the carbonyl.

So, the structure of the chain is probably: 

Ph-C(O)-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-something? Wait, but that would give a branching point. Alternatively, perhaps it's Ph-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something else.

Wait, wait. Let me think of the chain as:

Ph-C(O)-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-.

But how does that fit with the NMR signals?

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (1H) is probably the CH group attached to the carbonyl. Then, the CH is connected to a CH2 group (1.7 ppm, 2H) which is connected to a CH(CH3) group (1.4 ppm, 3H, d), and that CH is connected to a CH2CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm, t). Wait, that would make the chain as:

Ph-C(O)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2) ?

Wait, perhaps the chain is Ph-C(O)-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-. But that seems a bit off.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (1H) is a CH group. So, that would be connected to the carbonyl (Ph-C(O)-CH-). Then, the CH is connected to a CH2 group (1.7 ppm, m, 2H), which in turn is connected to a CH(CH3) group (1.4 ppm, d, 3H), and the CH(CH3) is connected to a CH2CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm, t, 3H). So, the chain is:

Ph-C(O)-CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH2CH3?

Wait, that would make the chain longer, perhaps a pentyl group. Wait, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the chain is Ph-C(O)-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-, making the structure (4-(3-methylbutyl)phenyl)ketone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: considering the reaction. The compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI, which is the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen reduces ketones to methylene groups (CH2). So, if the starting material is a ketone, the product would be an alkane.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That's a carboxylic acid.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with an isobutyl group.

Option C:4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Another carboxylic acid.

Option D:1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Another toluene derivative.

Wait, but the reaction is Clemmensen, which reduces ketones to CH2. So the product would be an alkane, not a carboxylic acid. So, the options A and C can be eliminated because they're acids. So, the product is either B or D.

Wait, but looking at the options, B and D are both substituted toluenes. So, which one is the product?

Now, the structure of the starting material must have a ketone group attached to the benzene ring, and the substituent is a chain that, upon Clemmensen reduction, would become an alkyl group.

So, let's say the starting material is 4-(something)acetophenone. After reduction, the ketone (Ph-CO-CH2-) becomes Ph-CH2-.

But wait, in this case, the substituent on the benzene
