Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and moving glass. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but let's think this through.

The question says a light beam is moving through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. The options are given, and the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1.

Wait, wait. So the glass is moving. The light is within the glass, so its speed in the glass should normally be c/n, but since the glass is moving, does that affect the observed speed?

I remember that according to Einstein's theory of relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame is always c. Oh, but wait, the glass is moving. So from the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass, what's the speed of the light?

Wait, but in the glass's frame, the light's speed is c/n. Now, if the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, how do I find the speed in the lab frame?

Hmm, I think I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just add their velocities classically. Oh, but wait, the problem doesn't specify if v is a significant fraction of c. But regardless, the formula should apply.

So the velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²). Wait, but in this case, the light's speed in the glass frame is u = c/n. Wait no, wait. Wait, in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed u = c/n. So from the lab frame, which is moving at speed v relative to the glass, what is the observed speed of light?

Wait, no, wait. The lab frame is seeing the glass moving at velocity v. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer (since the glass is moving toward the observer, so the light is coming towards the observer as well). So the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

So in the lab frame, the speed of the light would be... let me think. The glass is moving at velocity v, and in its rest frame, the light is moving at u = c/n. So using the velocity addition formula, u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²)

Wait, but is that correct? Because the lab frame is the one where the glass is moving at v. So in the glass frame, the light has velocity u = c/n. So to find the velocity in the lab frame, we have to transform from the glass frame (S') to the lab frame (S), where S' is moving at velocity v relative to S.

So the transformation is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/c² )

Wait, no, the formula is when you have a frame S' moving at speed v relative to S. If an object has velocity u' in S', then in S it's u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/(c²) )

In this case, in S' (glass frame), the light's speed is u' = c/n.

Wait
