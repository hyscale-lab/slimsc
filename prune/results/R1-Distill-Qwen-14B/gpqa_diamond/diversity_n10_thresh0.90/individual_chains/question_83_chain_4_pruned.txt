Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I need to calculate both pH values and match them.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, so when we titrate it with NaOH (a strong base), the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. The equivalence point should be when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Let me break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of acetic acid before dilution.
The volume is 20.00 cm³, which is 0.02000 L. Molarity (M) is moles per liter, so moles = M × V.
Moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 M × 0.02000 L = 0.001 moles.

Step 2: After dilution with 20 cm³ water (0.02000 L), the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04000 L). So the new concentration is moles / volume.
Concentration = 0.001 moles / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M. So diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. 20 mL + 20 mL = 40 mL, yes. 0.02 L plus 0.02 L is 0.04 L. Moles are same, 0.001, so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Next, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid are 0.001. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is also 0.001.

What volume of 0.1 M NaOH is needed? Volume = moles / Molarity. So 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence point volume would be 2.5 mL of NaOH added.

Wait, no, wait. Because the 25% titration refers to the fraction of the acid that's been neutralized. So if the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized, then 25% titration means 25% of the required NaOH has been added, which is 2.5 mL.

Wait, but wait another thing. Maybe I should approach this step by step.

First, let's find the pH at 25% titration.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So how much NaOH is added?

Moles of NaOH added at 25% is 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 moles.

The initial moles of acetic acid in the solution after dilution is 0.001 moles. After adding 0.00025 moles of NaOH, which reacts with acetic acid:

Reaction: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

So, moles of CH3COOH remaining = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

Moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed = 0.00025 moles.

But wait, the total volume of the solution when 2.5 mL of NaOH is added? Hmm, the original solution after dilution is 40 mL. Adding 2.5 mL NaOH makes the total volume 42.5 mL.

But maybe I can assume that the volume change is negligible, or perhaps it's better to include it. Let me think. For precise calculation, I should consider the total volume.

So initial volume is 40 mL. Adding 2.5 mL NaOH makes 42.5 mL total.

So, concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ ?

And [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ ?

But wait, Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be useful here. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait, pKa is -log(Ka).

Let me compute that. Ka = 1.85e-5 → log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Wait, so pKa is about 4.73.

At 25% titration, the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025 / 0.00075) = 1/3.

So pH = pKa + log(1/3) → log(1/3) is about -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253. So approximately 4.25.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let's calculate that more precisely.

1.85e-5 is 0.0000185.

Log(1.85) is approximately 0.2672. So log(1.85e-5) is 0.2672 -5 = -4.7328. So pKa = 4.7328, which is about 4.73.

So for the 25% point, the pH is approximately 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253.

Wait, but wait, another approach: the actual concentrations of HA and A^- would be (moles)/(total volume). But the ratio is 1/3 in any case, so the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation should still hold regardless of the exact volume, because the volume cancels in the ratio.

So correct, ratio is 1/3, so pH is 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253. So around 4.25.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check. Option A says 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me verify.

Wait, another thing: when I add NaOH to the acetic acid solution, the moles of acid and conjugate base are in a certain ratio. Let me think about the initial setup.

Wait, another approach: at 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid is neutralized. So, the remaining acetic acid is 75% of original, and the conjugate base is 25% of original.

But wait, the original moles after dilution are 0.001 moles. So, 0.25 of that is 0.00025 moles of A^- (acetate), and 0.75 is 0.00075 moles of HA (acetic acid).

So, the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log(1/3) → 4.73 + (-0.477) = 4.253.

So the pH is approximately 4.25, which matches option A's first value of 4.26. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation using concentrations would give a slightly different result. Let me compute it without the Henderson equation.

After adding 2.5 mL NaOH, total volume is 42.5 mL.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol.

Concentration of acetic acid: 0.00075 / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M.

Concentration of acetate: 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Ka = 1.85e-5 = [H+][A^-]/[HA].

So, [H+] = (Ka * [HA]) / [A^-].

Plugging in the numbers:

[H+] = (1.85e-5 * 0.017647) / 0.005882.

Compute numerator: 1.85e-5 * 0.017647 ≈ 3.265e-7.

Then, 3.265e-7 / 0.005882 ≈ 5.54e-5.

So [H+] ≈ 5.54e-5 → pH = -log(5.54e-5).

Log(5.54) is about 0.743, so log(5.54e-5) is 0.743 -5 = -4.257 → pH is 4.257, about 4.26.

So that's correct. So the pH at 25% is 4.26. Which matches option A's first value. So the first part is 4.26.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized, forming its conjugate base, acetate ion. So the solution will be a solution of sodium acetate in water, which is a basic solution because acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid.

The concentration of acetate will be the moles of acetate divided by the total volume.

Moles of acetate: at equivalence, all 0.001 moles of acetic acid are converted to acetate. Then, when we add 10 mL NaOH (as calculated earlier), the total volume becomes 40 mL + 10 mL = 50 mL (0.05 L).

So, concentration of acetate: 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate ion (A^-) hydrolyzes in water:

A^- + H2O ↔ HA + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, let's compute it accurately: 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 → 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10.

Now, the hydrolysis reaction of acetate will produce OH^- ions, making the solution basic.

The initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression for Kb.

Let me denote x as the concentration of OH^- produced.

At equilibrium:

[A^-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since Kb is very small, x will be tiny compared to 0.02).

[HA] = x.

[OH^-] = x.

So Kb = (x^2) / (0.02) = 5.405e-10.

Solving for x:

x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → x^2 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04) is about 0.017, so log(1.04e-5) is (0.017) -5 = -4.983 → pOH ≈ 4.983.

pH = 14 - pOH → 14 - 4.983 ≈ 9.017.

Wait, but none of the options have a pH around 9 at equivalence. Let me check the options again.

Option A: 4.26; 8.52.

Option D: 4.57; 6.92.

Wait, that's a problem. My calculation gives pH around 9.02, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the total volume wasn't considered correctly. Let me recheck.

At equivalence point, after adding 10 mL NaOH to the 40 mL diluted solution, total volume is 50 mL.

Concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me compute it again.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-14 / 1e-5 → (0.5405) * 1e-9 → 5.405e-10. Correct.

So, Kb = (x^2) / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04) is approx 0.017, so log(1.04e-5) is -4.983 → pOH ≈4.983 → pH ≈ 14 -4.983 =9.017. So about 9.02.

But none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution at equivalence is considered as a buffer, but I'm confident it's just the acetate ion.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is not just acetate but also from the NaOH. But no, NaOH is a strong base, so it's completely dissociated, but at equivalence, all the OH- from NaOH would have been neutralized by the acetic acid. So, no excess OH- from NaOH, just the acetate hydrolysis.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using Kb.

Wait, let me try using the H-H equation for the equivalence point. Wait, no, because at equivalence, all the acid is converted to its conjugate base, so there's only A^- and HA is zero. So the H-H equation isn't applicable here. I have to compute it via the Kb.

Wait, but perhaps I can re-calculate the Kb and the x.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me compute it again.

Ka = 1.85e-5.

So Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) * 1e-9.

1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405. So Kb ≈ 5.405e-10.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10.

So, for the acetate ion:

The reaction is A^- + H2O ↔ HA + OH^-

At initial, [A^-] = 0.02 M.

Change: -x → [A^-] = 0.02 - x, [HA] =x, [OH^-]=x.

So Kb = x²/(0.02 - x) ≈ x²/0.02.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 → 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) → around 4.983 → pH = 9.017.

Wait, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the initial volume wasn't 40 mL. Let me double-check.

Original acetic acid: 20 mL of 0.05 M → 0.001 mol.

Diluted with 20 mL H2O → 40 mL total volume.

So, when titrating, the NaOH is added to 40 mL of solution. So when 25% is titrated, 2.5 mL of NaOH is added, making 42.5 mL.

But wait, perhaps the equivalence point is when 10 mL NaOH is added, making 50 mL total solution.

So, the concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Wait, but the pH I calculated was around 9.02, which isn't matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in another aspect.

Let me check the options again.

Option A) 4.26; 8.52 → 25% is 4.26, equivalence is 8.52.

Option D) 4.57; 6.92 → 25% is 4.57, equivalence is 6.92.

Hmm, none match my calculation.

Wait a minute. Wait, perhaps the equivalence point with acetic acid isn't as high as 9. Maybe I messed up the Kb.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the pH at equivalence point using the formula for a salt of a weak acid.

The pH can be found by:

pH = pKa + pKw/2 → No, that's for a weak acid and its conjugate base in equal concentrations. Wait, no, that's for when the solution is a buffer with equal concentrations, but in this case, it's a solution of the conjugate base.

Wait, perhaps another approach: perhaps the pH at equivalence is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions.

Another way: The concentration is 0.02 M, Kb is 5.405e-10. So, [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C) → sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) → sqrt(1.081e-11) → 1.04e-5, which is same as before. So pH is 9.017.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in my initial setup.

Wait, perhaps I didn't account for the dilution correctly.

Wait, let me re-calculate the moles:

Initial acetic acid: 20 mL * 0.05 M = 0.001 mol.

Diluting with 20 mL: total 40 mL. So 0.001 mol in 0.04 L → 0.025 M.

When titrated, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH = 0.001 mol.

Volume of NaOH needed: n = M × V → 0.001 = 0.1 × V → V=0.01 L=10 mL.

So, total volume at equivalence is 40 +10 =50 mL. So, acetate concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Kb. Let me compute Kb again.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the solution is considering that when the solution is concentrated, the assumption x << C isn't valid. So, perhaps I need to solve the quadratic equation.

So, Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10 → x² =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x).

Assuming x is very small compared to 0.02, x²
