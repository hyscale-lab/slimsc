Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral crystal's (111) plane. Hmm, rhombohedral crystals, right? I remember they have all sides equal and all angles equal, but I'm not exactly sure about the specifics.

So, the given parameters are the interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms, and the angles alpha, beta, gamma are each 30 degrees. Wait, interatomic distance—oh wait, in a crystal structure, the interatomic distance is the distance between atoms in the lattice. But in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which is like a cube that's been deformed. So the lattice constants a, b, c are all the same, but the angles between them are equal, which in this case is 30 degrees each.

The interplanar distance, d, for a given plane (hkl) in a crystal is calculated using the formula derived from the structure factors. I think the formula is d = a/(sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl)cosα)), but wait, wait, no. I remember the general formula for interplanar spacing in a cubic system, but rhombohedral is a bit different. Oh wait, I think the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ), where theta is the angle between the lattice vectors. Or maybe I'm mixing up the angles.

Wait, no, the Miller indices are h, k, l, and the formula for interplanar spacing is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + 2(hk + hl + kl)/(a²) * cos(theta), where theta is the angle between the lattice vectors. Because in a cubic system, theta is 90 degrees, so cos(theta) is zero, and the formula simplifies to 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/a², so d = a / sqrt(h²+k²+l²). But in a non-cubic system, like rhombohedral, the angles are not 90 degrees, so we have to include the cosine terms.

But wait, wait, I think the exact formula is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + 2(hk + hl + kl)/(a²) * cos(theta), where theta is the angle between the edges of the unit cell. So in this case, theta is 30 degrees for each angle. So the formula becomes 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + 2(hk + hl + kl)/(a²) * cos(30°).

But wait, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Hmm, but wait, the interatomic distance in a crystal is the distance between nearest neighboring atoms. In the case of a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance would be 'a' because each atom is at the corner of the cube, and the nearest neighbor is along the edge. But in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance might not be the same as 'a'. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no. In a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a. So for a rhombohedral structure, which is a cubic structure with all edges equal and angles equal, the interatomic distance 'd_0' (let's call it that) is the distance between nearest neighbors. But in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is the same as the edge length 'a' multiplied by sqrt(2) if it's a face-centered cubic (but wait, rhombohedral is not necessarily FCC; it can be a simple cubic structure with certain angles). Hmm, maybe I should think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps the lattice parameter
