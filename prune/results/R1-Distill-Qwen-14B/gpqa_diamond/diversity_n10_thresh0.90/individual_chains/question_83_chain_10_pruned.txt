Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let's see. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid and NaOH is a strong base. So when you titrate them, the reaction should form acetate ions and water.

The problem says we diluted 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Wait, first, what's the initial concentration after dilution? Oh right, initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. Then adding 20 cm³ water, so total volume is 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / (40 cm³) = 0.025 M acetic acid.

Okay, so the diluted solution is 0.025 M CH3COOH. Then we start titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate that.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) is 0.001 moles. So moles NaOH needed for equivalence: 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But wait, the question is about 25% titration and equivalence point. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

At 25% titration: 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Moles NaOH added: 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 moles. Since acetic acid is 0.001 moles, the moles reacted are 0.00025, so remaining acetic acid is 0.00075 moles. And moles of acetate formed is 0.00025.

But wait, the total volume now is initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, so 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L. So concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). The pKa is -log(1.85e-5) ≈ 4.735.

So pH = 4.735 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647) = 4.735 + log(0.333). Log(1/3) is about -0.477. So 4.735 -0.477 ≈ 4.258, which is approximately 4.26. Hmm, looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. So 4.2
