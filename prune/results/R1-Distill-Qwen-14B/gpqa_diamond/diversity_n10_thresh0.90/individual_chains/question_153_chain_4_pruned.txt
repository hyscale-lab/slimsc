Okay, so I've got this Michael addition problem to work through. Honestly, I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

The question is about three different Michael addition reactions, and I need to figure out the products. Then, I have to match them with the given options A, B, and C in the choices. Let's take it one reaction at a time.

Starting with the first reaction: dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound.

So, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diester. The enolate form is usually the nucleophile. Dimethyl malonate, when deprotonated, forms an enolate at the central carbon, which can attack the beta position of another carbonyl compound.

The other compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure would be something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2-C(O)OCH3 where the substituent is at the beta position. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, so the substituent is at the 3-position, which is the alpha to the carbonyl. Wait, no. Let me clarify: The structure is methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. But here, it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the acrylate part is CH2=CH-, and the substituent is at the 3rd carbon. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OEt? No, wait, I think it's more like CH2=CH- with the p-tolyl group at the beta position. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOEt. No, wait, the acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt, but the substituent is on the middle carbon. So it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOEt? No, wait, the numbering is different. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be: the acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt, but the substituent is on the middle carbon (position 3), so it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOEt. No, wait, I'm getting confused. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So the substituent is on the middle carbon, making it CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOEt, but in that case, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2,
