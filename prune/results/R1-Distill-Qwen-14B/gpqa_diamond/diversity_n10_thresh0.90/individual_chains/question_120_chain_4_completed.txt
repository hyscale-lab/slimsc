Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So a larger parallax means a closer star, and a smaller parallax means the star is farther away.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform distribution—so the same number of stars per unit volume? Or maybe per some other measure? Wait, no, in space, if stars are uniformly distributed, their number density is constant in 3D space. So the number depends on the volume.

But how does this relate to parallax? Let's see. Parallax plx is 1/d, where d is distance. So as d increases, plx decreases.

Now, the number of stars per unit parallax range. So, if I consider a range of plx values, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Think about the distance corresponding to these parallax ranges. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So a small change in plx, dplx, corresponds to a change in distance. Let me calculate that.

dplx is the change in parallax, so plx becomes plx + dplx. The corresponding distances would be d = 1/plx and d_next = 1/(plx + dplx). The difference in distance is d_next - d = (1/(plx + dplx)) - (1/plx). Hmm, maybe it's easier to find the range in distance for a small dplx.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the differential. Let me consider a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd. The volume of this shell is 4π d² dd. The number of stars in this shell would be the number density multiplied by the volume. Since number density is n (constant), stars in shell = n * 4π d² dd.

But I need to express this in terms of parallax. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Because plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Differentiating both sides, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Oh wait, but I think when plx increases, d decreases, so the signs might flip, but for the purposes of magnitude, maybe I can ignore the negative.

So substituting d and dd in terms of plx:

Number of stars in shell = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx? Wait, wait. Let me correct this.

Wait, d is 1/plx. So d squared is 1/plx². And dd is (1/plx²) dplx? Wait, let's see:

d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So the absolute value is (1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting back into the number of stars:

Number = n * 4π (d²) * dd = n 4π ( (1/plx)^2 ) * (1/plx²) dplx )

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute each part:

d² = (1/plx)^2 = 1/plx².

dd = (1/plx²) dplx (since dplx is positive, but I think the negative just indicates direction, so for the magnitude, we can take it as positive).

So putting it together:

Number of stars = n * 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. d is the distance. The shell's volume is 4π d² dd.

So substituting d = 1/plx, we get:

Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2 dplx) ?

Wait, because dd is (1/plx²) dplx. So the volume element is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx² dplx) ) ?

Wait, that would be 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait, that seems a bit off. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is n * 4π d² dd.

Yes, that's correct.

So, d = 1/plx → dd = - d^2 / plx^2 dplx → because if plx increases by dplx, then d decreases by (d^2 / plx^2) dplx.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's express everything in terms of plx.

We have plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx.

Then, the range in plx from plx to plx + dplx corresponds to a range in d from d to d - (d^2 / plx^2) dplx.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of differentials.

We have number of stars in a range of plx is proportional to the volume in that range divided by number density.

But wait, number density is n, a constant.

So, the number of stars per unit plx is (Volume per unit plx) * n.

So, I need to express the volume corresponding to a small change in plx, dplx.

So, for a given plx, the distance is d = 1/plx. The volume between d and d + dd is 4π d² dd.

But since plx is changing, let's find how dd relates to dplx.

From plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx.

Differentiating both sides: dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So, dd = -(1/plx²) dplx → dplx = -plx² dd.

But when plx increases, d decreases, so dplx is positive if we're moving to larger plx (closer stars). But the exact sign might not matter here as we're considering small increments.

So, substituting dd into volume:

Volume = 4π d² |dd| = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, because |dd| is (1/plx²) dplx.

So Volume = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Thus, the number of stars in that Volume (since n is constant) is N = n * Volume = 4π n (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars per unit plx is N/dplx = 4π n / plx^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So, for a unit change in plx (dplx = 1), the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the function would be ~ 1/plx^4. Looking at the options:

A) ~ 1/plx^4

B) ~ 1/plx^2

C) ~ 1/plx^1

D) ~ 1/plx^3

So the correct answer should be A) ~ 1/plx^4.

Wait a second, but wait—did I make a mistake in the substitution? Let me double-check.

Because when I express the volume in terms of parallax, I have:

Volume = 4π (d^2) * dd.

But plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx.

dd is the change in d, which is (d_next - d) = (1/(plx + dplx)) - (1/plx).

But for small dplx, we can approximate this as:

dd ≈ derivative of d with respect to plx * dplx.

Since d = 1/plx, dd/dplx = -1/plx².

So, dd ≈ (-1/plx²) dplx.

But since dplx is a positive change (if plx increases), dd is negative, so the volume is the absolute value. So the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx.

Which is 4π d^2 |dd| = 4π (1/plx²)(1/plx²) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars is N = n * Volume = 4π n (1/plx^4) dplx.

So per unit plx (dplx=1), N = 4π n / plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit plx range is inversely proportional to plx^4.

So the answer should be option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is related to distance as \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. A larger parallax corresponds to a closer star, while a smaller parallax corresponds to a more distant star. Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density of stars is constant, and the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume itself.

Consider a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \). The volume of this shell is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). The number of stars in this shell is proportional to the volume, so:

\[
\text{Number of stars} \propto 4\pi d^2 dd.
\]

Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we have \( d^2 = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \) (where \( d\text{plx} \) is the change in parallax). The volume element becomes:

\[
\text{Volume} \propto 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

Analyzing the options:
- **A) ~ \( 1/\text{plx}^4 \):** Matches the derived result.
- **B) ~ \( 1/\text{plx}^2 \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger.
- **C) ~ \( 1/\text{plx}^1 \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger.
- **D) ~ \( 1/\text{plx}^3 \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger.

The correct answer is **A**, as the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( 1/\text{plx}^4 \).

Answer: A
