Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model. So the SM has certain symmetries, and SMEFT must preserve those unless there's a specific reason not to.

Let me break down each symmetry:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: This is definitely a big one. The SM is Lorentz invariant, so SMEFT must respect this too. Operators in SMEFT are constructed as Lorentz-invariant operators. So yes, they must obey Lorentz symmetry.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like momentum conservation). Since the SM respects Poincare, I think SMEFT must as well. Wait, but the question is about operators, not the Lagrangian as a whole. Are individual operators required to respect Poincare? Or is that more about the Lagrangian's overall symmetry? I think the Lagrangian must be Poincare invariant, but each operator has to be Lorentz invariant. Because Poincare includes translations, which are about the action being the same everywhere, so yes, I think all operators must respect Poincare symmetry as well. Because if they didn't, the Lagrangian might not be invariant under translations.

Wait, but I remember that in SMEFT, the operators are classified based on their Lorentz structure. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must. Poincare, which includes translations, I think operators must be translation invariant, but since operators are terms in the Lagrangian density, which is a scalar, they are automatically translation invariant because the Lagrangian is a function of spacetime. So maybe each operator doesn't have to worry about it—because the entire theory is Poincare invariant. Hmm, but the question is whether all operators must respect it. So perhaps each operator must be Poincare symmetric? Or is Poincare symmetry more about the entire theory rather than individual operators?

Wait, another approach: The SM is a Poincare-invariant theory. So all terms in the effective theory must preserve this. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry as well. So both Lorentz and Poincare are required.

3. CP symmetry: The SM doesn't have a global CP symmetry. Wait, actually, the SM has CP symmetry in its basic structure, but it's not necessarily respected in nature. For example, CP violation exists in the CKM matrix. So in the effective theory, do operators need to respect CP? Or can they violate it?

I think SMEFT allows for operators that violate specific symmetries like CP, depending on the new physics. So it's not required that all operators respect CP. In fact, some operators are CP-odd. So the answer can't include option 3 as a must.

4. CPT symmetry: CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, especially in theories that are Lorentz invariant. Because all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry, and since CPT is a combination of C, P, and T, which arises from Lorentz symmetry, CPT must also be respected. Wait, but wait: CPT is a symmetry that is required by the axioms of quantum field theory for theories that are Lorentz invariant and have unitary. So if the theory respects Lorentz symmetry (which it does), then CPT must be a symmetry of the full theory. But do individual operators have to respect CPT symmetry?

Wait, but operators can violate individual symmetries like C, P, or T, but when you combine them with their CPT conjugates, the total must respect CPT. So for example, an operator that is C-even but P-odd would require its CPT conjugate to also be present. So the full Lagrangian must be CPT-invariant, but individual operators don't necessarily have to be CPT-symmetric. But the question is whether all operators must respect CPT. I think that's not necessarily true. Instead, the sum of operators must form a CPT-invariant Lagrangian.

Wait, but wait. The SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so all its operators must be consistent with the underlying theory's symmetries. The Standard Model is CPT symmetric, so the effective theory must also respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, the operators must be arranged such that the entire Lagrangian is CPT symmetric. So each operator might not have to individually respect CPT, but overall, the combination must. But the question is whether each operator must respect CPT symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps all operators in the SMEFT must be CPT-symmetric because otherwise, they would break a fundamental symmetry of the theory. No, I don't think that's correct because, for example, the Weinberg operator (which is dimension six) is CPT-symmetric? Or not necessarily. Wait, the Weinberg operator is (s W^2 + ... ), which is a scalar, so it's CPT even. Hmm, maybe all operators in SMEFT are automatically CPT symmetric because they're built from SM fields, which are CPT symmetric. Because each SM field has its CPT conjugate.

Wait, another angle. Since SMEFT is built from operators that are products of SM fields, and each SM field is part of a CPT-conjugate pair, any operator built from SM fields must have a CPT conjugate counterpart. Therefore, the operators must come in CPT-related sets. So the Lagrangian must include all such terms to preserve CPT. But do individual operators have to respect CPT? Or can they be any, but the Lagrangian must include their CPT conjugates?

I think the operators themselves can violate CPT, but the full Lagrangian must be CPT invariant. However, the question is phrased as which symmetries must be respected by all operators. If an operator violates CPT, but the Lagrangian as a whole doesn't, does that mean the operator itself doesn't have to respect CPT? Or is it that all operators must respect CPT because the underlying theory (SM) does.

Wait, but in the SMEFT, you can have operators that are C-odd, P-odd, or T-odd. For example, operators like (ε^{μνρσ} F_{μν} F_{ρσ}) which is a P-odd operator. But to have a CPT invariant theory, you would need to include the CPT conjugate of such an operator. So the individual operator doesn't have to be CPT symmetric, but the Lagrangian as a whole must be.

So the question is about all operators respecting these symmetries. So, must each operator individually respect CPT, or is it enough that the sum of operators is CPT symmetric.

I think the correct answer is that the operators don't have to individually respect CPT, but the Lagrangian must. So the operators can, for example, violate CP, but their CPT conjugates must also be included. So the requirement is not on each operator, but on the full theory.

Wait, but the question specifies "must be respected by all operators in SMEFT". So if some operators can violate CPT, then the answer would be that CPT isn't a must for each operator. Alternatively, perhaps all operators must respect CPT because the underlying theory (SM) is CPT symmetric, and the SMEFT is an effective theory of it, so the operators must preserve all the symmetries of the SM, including CPT.

Wait, but the SM itself doesn't require all operators to be CPT symmetric, but the theory as a whole is CPT symmetric. So individual terms (like the Higgs potential) can have terms that are not CPT symmetric, but the whole Lagrangian must be. So perhaps in SMEFT, each operator does not have to be CPT symmetric, but the sum must be.

But the question is about what each operator must respect. So if the operators can come in pairs that together make the overall Lagrangian CPT symmetric, then individual operators don't have to respect CPT. Therefore, the operators do not have to individually respect CPT symmetry. So the answer would not include CPT as a required symmetry for each operator.

Wait, but the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. If an operator violates CPT, but the Lagrangian has its CPT conjugate, then the operator itself doesn't need to respect CPT. So the correct statement is that the operators do not have to respect CPT symmetry individually, but the sum must.

So in the question, which symmetries are required for each operator? So the options are 1,2,4. Or 1,2. Let me see.

Wait, let's go back to the options. The question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So, which symmetries must each operator individually respect.

- Lorentz: yes, because all operators must be Lorentz scalars.
- Poincare: because the theory is Poincare invariant, each operator must respect translation invariance, but since the Lagrangian is a density, each term is a scalar, so all operators are automatically translation invariant. Wait, no, because a term like ∂μ ∂ν φ would be a Lorentz tensor but when you integrate it into the action, it's okay. But wait, no, all terms in the Lagrangian must be scalars, so each operator must be a Lorentz scalar. So Lorentz symmetry is a must for each operator.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations. But each operator is a part of the Lagrangian, which is a scalar, hence translation invariant. So operators don't need to individually care about translations because the Lagrangian as a whole is a scalar. So the requirement for Poincare symmetry—whether each operator must respect it—is more about Lorentz symmetry because translation is handled by the overall structure.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. So, do the operators have to respect Poincare symmetry? I think that the operators are part of the Lagrangian, which must be a scalar, so each operator must be a scalar under Lorentz and translation. But translation symmetry is automatically handled because the Lagrangian is a function of spacetime, so each term doesn't need to worry about it because they're part of the density. So for each operator, the main requirement is Lorentz symmetry.

So Lorentz is a must for each operator. So option 1 is correct.

Poincare: Do the operators need to respect Poincare? Since Poincare includes translations, and the Lagrangian is a scalar, each operator is automatically translation invariant. So perhaps Poincare symmetry isn't a separate constraint beyond Lorentz. Or are they considered together?

In that case, the SMEFT is built with operators that are Lorentz scalars, which automatically are Poincare invariant because the Lagrangian is a scalar. So each operator must respect Lorentz and thus Poincare.

Wait, but no, because Poincare includes both Lorentz and translation. So each operator must be a scalar (so Lorentz invariant) and translation invariant. But translation invariance is about the Lagrangian being the same everywhere, which is handled by the fact that the Lagrangian is a scalar density. So the operator doesn't have to worry about translation invariance because that's a global condition on the theory, not on each term.

Wait, but the operators are constructed from fields and derivatives. So each operator must be a scalar under Lorentz transformations, but they are automatically translation invariant because they are part of the Lagrangian, which is a function of spacetime. So each operator is a scalar, but translation symmetry is a global symmetry, and the operator's form doesn't depend on position, so perhaps that's already satisfied.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe it's better to think that Poincare symmetry is a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz and translation. Since the theory must respect Poincare, which requires that the Lagrangian is a scalar. So operators must be Lorentz scalars, which are automatically Poincare invariant. So each operator must respect Poincare symmetry as a condition.

Wait, but I'm not sure if operators must respect Poincare individually. Because, for example, a term like ∂μ ∂ν φ would transform under Lorentz as a tensor, but when you integrate it into the action, it contributes terms that are scalars. Wait, no, the operator itself is a tensor, so such a term wouldn't be allowed because the operators in SMEFT are constructed as Lorentz scalars. So all operators are Lorentz scalars, which are automatically Poincare-invariant when part of the Lagrangian. So perhaps both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are required for each operator.

Wait, but I think that when you have an operator like (∂μ ϕ)(∂ν ϕ), it's not a scalar under Lorentz unless you contract the indices. So for an operator to be a Lorentz scalar, it must be a scalar under the Lorentz group. So all operators must be Lorentz scalars, which implies they must be built from Lorentz scalars and/or properly contracted tensors. Therefore, each operator must respect Lorentz symmetry. Since the Lagrangian must respect Lorentz symmetry, and each operator is a part of it, each operator must be a Lorentz scalar.

As for Poincare symmetry, since the Lagrangian must be a scalar density, each operator is part of that scalar density, so each operator must be a scalar under translations as well. But since the operators are built from fields and derivatives, which transform covariantly under Lorentz, but not necessarily under translations. Wait, no, because translation symmetry is about shifting the coordinates. Each term in the Lagrangian must not change under spacetime translations, meaning that the Lagrangian is invariant, but the operator itself doesn't need to change. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is that the SMEFT is constructed to respect all the symmetries of the Standard Model, which includes Lorentz and Poincare, but not necessarily CP or CPT. Wait, but the Standard Model is CPT symmetric, so SMEFT must also preserve that. So all operators must be such that the full Lagrangian is CPT invariant. But whether each operator individually must respect CPT symmetry is not necessarily the case.

So, going back to the question, which symmetries must be respected by all operators.

- Lorentz: yes, each operator must be a Lorentz scalar.
- Poincare: I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps each operator must be a Poincare scalar. Or since the Lagrangian is a scalar, maybe Poincare is automatically satisfied once Lorentz is. But I'm not certain if Poincare is a separate symmetry that operators must respect.

Wait, for the full theory (the Lagrangian), Poincare symmetry is required. But for each operator, they must combine in such a way that the entire Lagrangian is Poincare-invariant. But each operator individually might not have to be Poincare-invariant. Hmm, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's better to look for known facts.

I recall that in SMEFT, the operators are required to be Lorentz-invariant, but not necessarily Poincare-invariant. Wait, no, because the Lagrangian is a scalar, which is Poincare-invariant. So each operator must be a scalar, which would imply they are Poincare-invariant as well. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps all operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare. Because the theory is built such that the entire Lagrangian is Poincare-invariant, so each operator must be a scalar.

But I'm not confident. Let me think about the options. The options are A) 1,2; B)3,4; C)1,2,4; D)1,3,4.

If the correct symmetries are Lorentz and CPT, then the options would be 1 and 4. But CPT is a combination, and each operator doesn't have to respect it individually.

Wait, no. Because the theory must be CPT-invariant. So the sum of the operators must be CPT-invariant. So individual operators might not be, but their sum must be. So in that case, the operators don't have to individually respect CPT symmetry.

Wait, but another angle: The SM is CPT-invariant, so the SMEFT as an effective theory must also be CPT-invariant. So any operator in SMEFT must be such that when combined with others, the total Lagrangian is CPT-invariant. But individual operators can violate CPT as long as their CPT conjugates are also included. Therefore, individual operators do not have to respect CPT symmetry, but the sum must.

So for the question, which asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators, the correct answer cannot include CPT symmetry because operators can violate it as long as others are present.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "must be respected by all operators in SMEFT." So if an operator can violate CPT, then it's not a must for each operator to respect it. Therefore, CPT is not a required symmetry for each operator.

So among the four options, which symmetries must each operator respect.

1. Lorentz: yes, each operator must be a Lorentz scalar.

2. Poincare: Not sure. If the operator must be a scalar, then each operator also respects Poincare.

Wait, but Poincare includes translations. Since the Lagrangian is a scalar, each operator is automatically translation invariant. So maybe Poincare symmetry doesn't impose any additional constraints beyond Lorentz on the operators. Or perhaps each operator must be a scalar under Poincare. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to look for which symmetries are automatically respected by all operators in the SMEFT. Since the SMEFT is built as an effective theory of the SM, which respects Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. But each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, so 1 is correct.

Poincare symmetry: Since the Lagrangian is a scalar, each operator is part of that scalar, so each operator doesn't have to worry about translation symmetry because they're built into the scalar. So perhaps each operator doesn't need to explicitly respect Poincare symmetry beyond being a Lorentz scalar. Therefore, perhaps Poincare isn't a required symmetry for each operator.

Wait, no. Because Poincare includes Lorentz and translation. So if the operator isn't a Lorentz scalar, then the theory would break Lorentz symmetry. But each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, which automatically makes them Poincare scalars because the Lagrangian is a scalar. So perhaps Poincare symmetry is also a must for each operator.

Alternatively, maybe Poincare symmetry isn't a separate condition because it's implied by the structure of the Lagrangian. So in that case, each operator must respect Lorentz symmetry, but Poincare is automatically handled.

But I think the accepted view is that the operators must be Lorentz scalars, but Poincare is a higher symmetry that includes Lorentz and translations. So perhaps each operator must respect Lorentz and Poincare.

But now I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The correct answer is probably that all operators must respect Lorentz and CPT symmetries. Or perhaps Lorentz and Poincare.

Wait, but why would they have to respect CPT? Since individual operators can break CPT as long as their CPT conjugates are present. So the operators don't have to individually respect CPT.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps all the operators in SMEFT must respect CPT, as the SM is CPT invariant, and the effective theory must be as well. But as I thought earlier, the individual operators don't have to, just the sum. So the answer would not include CPT as a must for each operator.

So, to recap:

Symmetries that all operators must respect individually: Lorentz (1) and perhaps Poincare (2), but not CPT (4) or CP (3).

Wait, but the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So which ones must each operator individually respect.

If each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, so 1 is correct.

If each operator must also be a Poincare scalar, then 2 is correct. However, if the requirement of being a scalar (Lagrangian) automatically handles Poincare, then maybe each operator doesn't need to worry about Poincare beyond being a Lorentz scalar.

I'm getting stuck between options A and C.

Wait, another approach. Let's look for what's standard in SMEFT:

In SMEFT, the operators are classified by their Lorentz structure. So they are all Lorentz scalars. So 1 is correct.

Poincare symmetry: Since the Lagrangian is a scalar, each operator is part of it, which is a scalar. Thus, each operator must be a scalar under Poincare. But I'm not sure if that's the same as each operator respecting Poincare symmetry. Alternatively, since the Lagrangian is a scalar, each operator doesn't need to individually respect Poincare, because it's about the overall structure. So perhaps Poincare isn't a must for each operator.

So this would mean only Lorentz symmetry (1) is a must for each operator, making the correct answer 1, which would be option A if 2 is not included.

Wait, but the options don't have a choice with only 1.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2

B) 3,4

C) 1,2,4

D)1,3,4

Wait, the only option that includes 1 is A, C, D. So if Lorentz is correct, and Poincare isn't, then the correct answer would have only 1. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm wrong, and each operator must respect both Lorentz and Poincare.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding what Poincare symmetry entails for the operators. Let me think again: Poincare symmetry includes translation invariance, which is handled at the level of the Lagrangian, not the individual operators. So each operator doesn't need to worry about translation invariance because the Lagrangian is a scalar. Therefore, each operator only needs to respect Lorentz symmetry.

Wait, but the fact that the Lagrangian is a scalar implies that all the operators are scalars, which includes both Lorentz and translation invariance. So each operator must be a scalar under Lorentz and translation, hence respecting Poincare symmetry.

So, each operator must respect both Lorentz and Poincare. So 1 and 2 are correct.

Then, what about 4, CPT symmetry?

As I thought earlier, the operators don't have to individually respect CPT, but the sum must. So 4 is not a must for each operator.

So, of the options, the correct ones are 1 and 2, which is option A.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another angle: the SMEFT is an effective theory that must respect the same symmetries as the SM. The SM is Lorentz, Poincare, CPT invariant, but not necessarily CP invariant. So the SMEFT must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT symmetries.

But wait, the question is about the operators. So each operator must be a scalar (Lorentz), and the sum must be Poincare and CPT invariant. So each operator must respect Lorentz, but not necessarily Poincare or CPT individually.

Hmm, I'm getting more confused. Maybe better to look for authoritative sources.

Wait, I remember that in SMEFT, the operators are required to be Lorentz scalars, meaning they transform as scalars under the Lorentz group. So 1 is correct.

As for Poincare symmetry, the entire Lagrangian must be a scalar, but individual terms don't have to be Poincare scalars beyond being Lorentz scalars. Wait, no, because if the Lagrangian is a scalar, each term must be a scalar. So each operator must be a scalar under Poincare as well.

Wait, but Poincare includes translations, which are separate from Lorentz. So, being a scalar in the Lagrangian implies that the operator is a scalar under both Lorentz and translations. So each operator must be a Poincare scalar, hence 2 is correct.

So 1 and 2 are both required.

Now, what about CPT symmetry. The full theory must be CPT invariant, but individual operators can violate CPT as long as their CPT-conjugate operators are present. So each operator doesn't have to be CPT-symmetric individually. So 4 is not a must for each operator.

Therefore, the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2) symmetries, which would be option A.


In the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), operators must respect the symmetries of the underlying Standard Model (SM). The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT operators are constructed as Lorentz scalars. This is a fundamental requirement because the SM and SMEFT are Lorentz-invariant. Therefore, all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translation invariance. Since the Lagrangian in SMEFT is a scalar density, it is automatically translation-invariant. However, each operator must still respect Lorentz symmetry, which is a subset of Poincaré symmetry. Thus, all operators must respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not strictly respect CP symmetry, as CP violation is observed in nature (e.g., in the CKM matrix). SMEFT allows operators that violate CP symmetry, as long as they are consistent with the underlying physics. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM is CPT-invariant, and SMEFT as an effective theory must also respect CPT symmetry. However, individual operators in SMEFT do not need to be CPT-symmetric. Instead, the full Lagrangian must be CPT-invariant, which can be achieved by including operators in appropriate CPT-conjugate pairs. Thus, individual operators do not need to respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that all operators in SMEFT must respect individually are **Lorentz symmetry (1)** and **Poincaré symmetry (2)**. CP symmetry (3) and CPT symmetry (4) are not required for all operators individually.

**Correct Answer**: A) 1,2

Answer: A
