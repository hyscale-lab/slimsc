Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants, also called formation constants, indicate how stable a complex is. The higher the constant, the more stable the complex.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, blue dithiocyanato... I think Co(SCN)_2 is the blue one. Oh, right, the question mentions dithiocyanato, so that's two SCN- ligands. So the species we're interested in is Co(SCN)_2^2+.

The possible complexes are Co(SCN)_1^+, Co(SCN)_2^2+, Co(SCN)_3^3-, and Co(SCN)_4^4-. Each has a different stability constant β. The β values tell us how much each complex forms.

Stability constants follow the formation equation. For example, the first complex Co(SCN)^+ would form with β1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]). Similarly, β2 would be for the second complex, etc.

But wait, the way stability constants work, each β is for the stepwise formation. So the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_n would be the product of the β's up to that n. Or wait, no—each β represents the stability of the complex with n ligands. Or perhaps it's the overall formation constant for each step. Let me think.

Ah, right. For each successive addition of a ligand, the stability constant increases. So for a complex like Co(SCN)_n, the overall stability constant is the product of β1 through βn. So for n=1, β1 is 9. For n=2, β1*β2=9*40=360. For n=3, 9*40*63, and for n=4, 9*40*63*16. Wait, but the given β4 is 16. Hmm, that's important.

So the idea is to find the fraction of Co that exists in each complex form, and then find the percentage for the dithiocyanato (n=2) complex.

The approach would be to calculate the fraction of each possible complex relative to all possible complexes. The species present are Co^2+, CoSCN^+, Co(SCN)_2^2+, Co(SCN)_3^3-, Co(SCN)_4^4-.

But wait, is that all? Or could there be a Co(SCN)_n^m+ where m is the charge? Hmm. For Co^2+ with n SCN- (each -1), the charge of the complex would be 2 - n. So if n=0, it's Co^2+; n=1, CoSCN+; n=2, Co(SCN)_2^2+; n=3, Co(SCN)_3^-; n=4, Co(SCN)_4^2-.

Wait, wait. SCN- is -1 each. Co^2+ has charge +2. So:

n=0: Co^2+ → charge +2
n=1: CoSCN+ → +2 + (-1) = +1
n=2: Co(SCN)_2^2+ → +2 -2 = 0? Wait, no:

Wait, no. The formula for the complex would be [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}+. Because each SCN- contributes a -1 charge. So for n=1, [CoSCN]+ has charge +2 -1 = +1. For n=2, [Co(SCN)_2]^0. Oh, because 2+ -2(1-) = 0. So neutral. Hmm, but Co(SCN)_2 is neutral? Or maybe I'm mixing up the charges. Anyway, for the purposes of the calculation, the charge of the species affects the concentration terms in the expression.

Wait, maybe it's easier to model using the formation constants for each complex step.

So the overall idea is to write the expressions for each complex's concentration and then find the ratio of [Co(SCN)_2^2+] to the sum of all [Co species].

The key is to consider the distribution of Co between all possible complexes, including the free ion.

But the problem is that the formation of each complex depends on the concentration of Co^2+ and SCN-.

But since SCN- is in excess (0.1 M), maybe the solution is approximated by assuming that the concentration of free SCN- is approximately 0.1 M. Because when forming complexes, the amount taken up by Co is much less than the total SCN- available. So [SCN-] ≈ 0.1 M throughout.

So, I can model the problem by treating [SCN-] as a constant, 0.1 M, and model the formation of each complex step by step.

Let me define the variables:

Let’s denote:

[C0] = [Co^2+] = c(Co) initially, but as complexes form, this will decrease.

But wait, the total Co concentration is 1e-2 M, which is 0.01 M. So the sum of all Co species is 0.01 M.

So, the sum of [Co^2+], [CoSCN+], [Co(SCN)_2^2+], [Co(SCN)_3^-], [Co(SCN)_4^2-] equals 0.01 M.

But each complex is formed by successive addition of SCN- to Co^2+.

The formation of each complex can be treated as a stepwise process. So the concentration of each complex can be written in terms of the previous one.

Let me think in terms of the formation steps:

1. Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ CoSCN^+; β1 = 9.
2. CoSCN^+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_2^2+; β2 =40.
3. Co(SCN)_2^2+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_3^-; β3=63.
4. Co(SCN)_3^- + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_4^2-; β4=16.

Wait, but each step has its own β, which is the stepwise formation constant.

So, the total concentration of each species can be found using these stepwise β's.

The overall approach is to model each complex's concentration in terms of the previous one.

Let me denote:

Let’s let x be the concentration of Co(SCN)_2^2+. Then, the concentration of Co(SCN)_3^- would be (β3 / β2) * x, and the concentration of Co(SCN)_4^2- would be (β4 / β3) * (β3 x) )= (β4 / (β2)) x ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express each species in terms of the free Co^2+ concentration.

Because, starting from Co^2+:

[CoSCN+] = β1 [Co^2+][SCN-]

[Co(SCN)_2^2+] = β2 [CoSCN+][SCN-] = β2 * β1 [Co^2+][SCN-]^2

Similarly,

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = β3 [Co(SCN)_2^2+][SCN-] = β3 * β2 * β1 [Co^2+][SCN-]^3

[Co(SCN)_4^2-] = β4 [Co(SCN)_3^-][SCN-] = β4 * β3 * β2 * β1 [Co^2+][SCN-]^4

So, each successive complex is the product of the β's up to that point multiplied by [Co^2+][SCN-]^n, where n is the number of ligands.

Wait, but that's considering each step. Alternatively, the overall formation constant for the nth complex is the product of β1 to βn.

So, for n = 1: β1 =9
n=2: β1*β2=9*40=360
n=3: 9*40*63=2520
n=4:9*40*63*16= 40320?

Wait, calculating that: 9 *40=360; 360 *63= 22680; 22680 *16=362880. Hmm, but that seems like a very large β.

Wait, no. Wait, each β is a stepwise constant. So the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_n is the product of β1*β2*...*βn.

So for n=1, the overall K1=β1=9.

For n=2, K2=β1*β2=360.

For n=3, K3=9*40*63=2520*9? Wait, 9*40=360, 360*63=22680.

Similarly, K4=9*40*63*16= 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680 *16=362880.

So, K4 is much larger than K1, K2, K3.

Wait, but that might not be correct because β4 is 16, which is lower than β3. Hmm, so the fourth complex is less stable than the third. Interesting.

But in any case, the idea is that each complex's concentration is related to the free Co^2+ concentration.

So, the concentrations of each species can be expressed as:

[Co^2+] = [Co^2+]

[CoSCN+] = β1 [Co^2+][SCN-] = 9 * [Co^2+] * 0.1

[Co(SCN)_2^2+] = β1 β2 [Co^2+][SCN-]^2 = 9*40 [Co^2+](0.1)^2 = 360 [Co^2+](0.01)

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = β1 β2 β3 [Co^2+][SCN-]^3 = 9*40*63 [Co^2+](0.1)^3 = 22680 [Co^2+](0.001)

[Co(SCN)_4^2-] = β1 β2 β3 β4 [Co^2+][SCN-]^4 = 9*40*63*16 [Co^2+](0.1)^4 = 362880 [Co^2+](0.0001)

Now, the total concentration of Co is the sum of all these species:

Total Co = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)_2^2+] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-] = 0.01 M

Let me write this equation:

[Co^2+] + 9*0.1 [Co^2+] + 360*(0.1)^2 [Co^2+] + 22680*(0.1)^3 [Co^2+] + 362880*(0.1)^4 [Co^2+] = 0.01

Factor out [Co^2+]:

[Co^2+] * [1 + 0.9 + 0.36 + 2.268 + 36.288] = 0.01

Let me compute the terms inside the brackets:

1. 1 (from [Co^2+])
2. 0.9 (from [CoSCN+])
3. 0.36 (from [Co(SCN)_2^2+])
4. 2.268 (from [Co(SCN)_3^-])
5. 36.288 (from [Co(SCN)_4^2-])

Adding them up: 1 + 0.9 = 1.9; 1.9+0.36=2.26; 2.26+2.268=4.528; 4.528 +36.288=40.816.

So, [Co^2+] * 40.816 = 0.01 → [Co^2+] = 0.01 /40.816 ≈ 0.000245 mol/L.

Wait, that's approximately 2.45e-4 M.

Now, I need to find the concentration of Co(SCN)_2^2+, which is [Co(SCN)_2^2+] = 360 * [Co^2+] * (0.1)^2.

Let's compute that:

360 * 2.45e-4 * 0.01 = 360 * 2.45e-6 → 360 * 2.45 is let's see, 360*2=720, 360*0.45=162 → 882. So 882e-6 → 8.82e-4 M.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

[Co^2+] is 0.000245 M.

So [Co(SCN)_2^2+] = 360 * 0.000245 * (0.1)^2.

(0.1)^2=0.01.

So 360 * 0.000245 = 0.0882, multiplied by 0.01 gives 0.000882 M.

Wait, 360 * 2.45e-4 = 360 * 0.000
