Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stumped, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a substance X that incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. A precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. The melting point of B under normal conditions is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with substance X, the product has two oxygen atoms. Additionally, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

The question asks me to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in substance X. The options are A to D, with the answers being numbers like 25, 29, etc.

Hmm. Let me break this down. First, I need to figure out what substance X is. The fact that it reacts with a liquid Y violently suggests maybe a strong acid or base. The reaction releases a gas W, which has equal neutrons and protons. Wait, if a molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons, that's interesting. Let's think about possible gases.

Hydrogen has one proton and one neutron (if considering deuterium), but that's a gas, but I'm not sure. Or maybe another gas. Wait, what about carbon monoxide? No, that's CO. Let me think differently. Wait, maybe the gas is something like NH3 (ammonia). No, because NH3 has 1 nitrogen and 3 hydrogens. Protons: 14+1*3=17, neutrons? Nitrogen-14 has 7 neutrons. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe CO2? CO2 has 2 oxygen atoms. Each oxygen has 8 protons, but it's a double bond. Wait, but the molecule as a whole, like the number of protons and neutrons in the molecule? Let me think.

Wait, the question says the gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for each molecule, the total protons equals the total neutrons. So, for example, H2O has 2 H (1 proton each) and O (8). So total protons: 2, total neutrons: 8? No, that's 2 vs 8, not equal. So maybe something like CH4? That's 6 protons (C has 6, H each 1, so 6 +4=10 protons?), but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, each molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. So for example, if W is H2O, the total protons would be 2 (from H2) plus 8 (O) = 10? Neutrons would be O has 8, so 8 neutrons. 10 vs 8, not equal. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's CO. C has 6 protons, O has 8. So CO has 6+8=14 protons, and for neutrons, C has 6 (if it's C-12) and O has 8 (O-16), so total neutrons would be 6+8=14. Wait, that's 14 each. So CO would be a possibility. But wait, CO is a gas, but does it form when reacting X with Y?

Alternatively, maybe the gas is CO2. Let me see: CO2 has C (6) + 2 O (8 each). So total protons: 6 + 2*8 =22. Neutrons: for C-12, 6; each O-16 has 8, so 2*8=16. Total neutrons:6+16=22. Oh, that works. So CO2 would fit, as the number of protons equals the number of neutrons in each molecule.

Wait, but why would X reacting with Y produce CO2? Let me think about the reaction. If X is a metal, maybe reacting with an acid. For example, if Y is an acid like HCl, and X is a carbonate. Wait, but carbonate reacting with an acid would produce CO2. Wait, but if X is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, then reacting with HCl would produce CO2 gas. But wait, the problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope. So maybe X is something like CaCO3 or another carbonate.

Wait, but the precipitate G forms. When carbonate reacts with acid, you get a salt, water, and CO2. So G could be a salt, like if Y is HCl, X is a carbonate, then G would be, say, CaCl2, which is soluble. Hmm, that doesn't form a precipitate. Wait, maybe Y isn't an acid. Wait, perhaps Y is water, but no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a base, so X is an acid. But acid reacting with base would produce water and maybe some salt, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is between a metal and an acid. For example, if X is a metal and Y is an acid, like HCl. The reaction would produce hydrogen gas. But the hydrogen molecule (H2) has 1 proton each, so each molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons (if H is protium). So that doesn't match the condition of equal protons and neutrons in the molecule. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the gas W is something else. Let's think about another possibility. Maybe the gas is CH4. Each molecule has 1 carbon (6 protons) and 4 hydrogens (1 each), so protons: 6+4=10. Neutrons: carbon has 6 (if C-12) and hydrogen has 0, so 6. That's 10 vs 6, not equal. Doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the gas is C2H2. Each molecule has 2 C (6 each) and 2 H (1 each). So protons: 2*6 + 2*1 =14. Neutrons: each C has 6, so 2*6=12; each H has 0, so total 12. 14 vs 12, nope.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is something with the same number of protons and neutrons in the whole molecule. Let me think of other molecules. Maybe NO? Let's see: N has 7 protons, O has 8. So total protons:15. Neutrons: N has 7 (if N-14), O has 8 (O-16). So 7+8=15. So 15 protons, 15 neutrons. That matches. So NO could be the gas. But does that make sense in the reaction?

Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else. Let me think again about the reaction. When a carbonate reacts with an acid, you get CO2. But then, if X is a carbonate, then Y is an acid. But the precipitate G could be a metal hydroxide if Y is a base. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting off track.

Wait, let's think about X's properties. X incorporates a heavier isotope. So perhaps it's an element that has an isotope heavier than the standard. For example, chlorine has isotopes Cl-35 and Cl-37. Maybe X is Cl-based.

Wait, the product of a keto acid reacting with X has two oxygen atoms. A keto acid is an acid with a ketone group. For example, acetoacetic acid or something similar. Reacting with X could add something, maybe halogenation. Wait, but perhaps X is a halogen. Let's say it's Cl. If a keto acid reacts with Cl, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. For example, in the presence of Cl, maybe the keto acid becomes an acid chloride. But the product would have Cl added. The product has two oxygen atoms. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a halogen, like Cl2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe X is
