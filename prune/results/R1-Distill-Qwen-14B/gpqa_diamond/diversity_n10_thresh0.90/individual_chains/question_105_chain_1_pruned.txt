Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about how a star with spots can mimic the light curve of a planet. Interesting.

Alright, the star has a radius equal to the Sun, so R_star is like R_sun. The star has dark spots covering one hemisphere, and the filling factor is 20%. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots, right? So 20% of that hemisphere is covered. And each spot is cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000K. The star's Teff is 6000K, so the spots are at 5000K.

Photometric observations show brightness variations because the spots rotate into and out of view. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, as the star rotates, the spots come into the observed hemisphere and then leave, causing dips in brightness. But the question is comparing this to an exoplanet transit.

Wait, the question says, what radius of a hypothetical exoplanet would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as this spotted star? So, if the star wasn't spotted, what planet's transit would cause the same dip.

I remember that the change in brightness during a transit is given by the formula (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet's radius and Rstar is the star's radius. So the dip is proportional to the square of the ratio.

But in this case, the star's brightness variation isn't due to a transit but to the spots. So I need to calculate the equivalent depth caused by the spots and set that equal to the transit depth.

Hmm. Let me think about the star's brightness variation. The spots are cooler, so when they're on the visible side, the star appears slightly dimmer.

Each spot's contribution to the overall brightness depends on its area and temperature. The total flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the spotted regions and the unspotted regions.

Wait, the star's total flux without spots would be F = 4πR_star^2 * σ * Teff^4.

But with spots, a fraction of the surface is cooler. The filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. Wait, the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2π R_star^2) because a hemisphere is 2π steradians, right? Wait, the surface area of a sphere is 4πR². A hemisphere is 2πR². So filling factor 0.2 on the hemisphere would be 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². But wait, the total surface area of the star is 4πR², so spots cover 0.4πR² / 4πR² = 10% of the total surface.

Wait, but perhaps more accurately, the problem states that the hemisphere has a filling factor of 20%, so each spot's area is 20% of the hemisphere's area. So each spot covers 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². Wait, but that might not be correct. Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the visible area (the hemisphere) covered. So when the star rotates, the same hemisphere is presented, so the spots are 20% of that hemisphere.

But the star's hemisphere is 2πR² in area. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Each spot has a temperature of Teff - 1000K, which is 5000 K.

So the total flux from the star when spots are facing us is:

F_total = (Area without spots) * σ * T_eff^4 + (Area of spots) * σ * T_spot^4.

The area without spots is (2π R²) - (0.2 * 2π R²) ) = 2π R² (1 - 0.2) = 1.6 π R².

So, F_total = (1.6 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.2 * 2π R²) * σ (5000)^4.

Wait, wait, no. The area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R²? Wait, the hemisphere is 2π R². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So the spots area is 0.4 π R².

So the flux when spots are visible is:

F = (2π R² - 0.4 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² * σ (5000)^4.

Simplify that:

F = [ (1.6 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 ] + [ (0.4 π R²) * σ (5000)^4 ]

The normal flux without any spots (assuming no spots) would be F_0 = 4 π R² * σ (6000)^4. Wait no, wait. Wait, no, the star's entire surface is at 6000K when there are no spots. But in this case, the spots are cooler, but the rest is at 6000K. So without spots, the flux would be F_0 = (4 π R²) σ (6000)^4.

Wait, but when the star is observed, only the hemisphere facing us is visible. So the normal flux (without any spots) from the star when it's not rotating would be F_0 = 2 π R² σ (6000)^4. Because we see a hemisphere.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.

In reality, a star's light comes from all sides, but when we're looking at it, we see a hemisphere. So for a star of radius R, the surface area we see is 2 π R². So the total flux without spots would be F_0 = 2 π R² σ T_eff^4.

But when the star has spots, the flux is F = (2 π R² - A_spots) σ T_eff^4 + A_spots σ T_spot^4.

Where A_spots is the area of the spots on the hemisphere. So the change in flux is ΔF = F - F_0.

So ΔF = [ (2 π R² - A) σ T_eff^4 + A σ T_spot^4 ] - [ 2 π R² σ T_eff^4 ]

Simplify:

ΔF = - A σ T_eff^4 + A σ T_spot^4

= A σ (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4 )

So the fractional change in flux is (ΔF)/F_0.

F_0 is 2 π R² σ T_eff^4.

So (ΔF)/F_0 = [ A σ (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4) ] / [ 2 π R² σ T_eff^4 ]

The σ and R² terms cancel out.

So (ΔF/F_0) = [ A (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4) ] / [ 2 π R² T_eff^4 ]

But A is the area of the spots on the hemisphere. The filling factor is 20%, so A = 0.2 * (2 π R²) = 0.4 π R².

Wait, because A is the area of the spots on the visible hemisphere. So yes, A = 0.2 * (2 π R²) = 0.4 π R².

So substituting back:

(ΔF/F_0) = [ (0.4 π R²) (5000^4 - 6000^4) ] / [ 2 π R² (6000^4) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ 0.4 π R² (5e3^4 -6e3^4) ] / [ 2 π R² (6e3^4) ]

The π R² terms cancel.

0.4 / 2 = 0.2

So (ΔF/F_0) = 0.2 * (5e3^4 -6e3^4) / (6e3^4)

Wait, but wait, 5000 is less than 6000, so 5e3^4 is less, so (5e3^4 -6e3^4) is negative. So this ΔF is negative, meaning the flux is lower.

But we’re interested in the amplitude, so the magnitude of the dip. So take the absolute value.

So the fractional dip is (ΔF/F_0) = 0.2 * (6e3^4 -5e3^4) / (6e3^4 )

Compute 6e3^4 and 5e3^4.

6e3^4 = (6 * 1e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

5e3^4 = 5^4 *1e12 = 625 *1e12 = 6.25e14.

So (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) = 1.296e15 - 6.25e14 = 6.71e14.

So (6e3^4 -5e3^4 ) / (6e3^4 ) = 6.71e14 / 1.296e15 ≈ 0.518.

So now, 0.2 * 0.518 = 0.1036.

So the fractional dip is approximately 10.36%.

Wait, but wait, that's when the spots are in front. So the maximum dip is about 10.36%.

But the question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation. So the dip is about 10% of the star's flux.

Now, comparing this to an exoplanet transit. The dip in brightness when a planet transits is (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is π Rp², and the star's area is π Rstar². So the fractional dip is (Rp^2)/(Rstar^2).

So we set (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1036.

Taking square root, Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1036) ≈ 0.322.

Wait, that's approximately 0.32. But wait, let me do the exact calculation.

0.1036 is 0.1036.

√0.1036 ≈ 0.322.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

Wait, but wait, I thought the planet's radius over star's radius squared is 0.1036, so Rp/Rstar is sqrt(0.1036) ≈ 0.322, which is about 0.32, so option D.

But wait, I think I made a mistake. Because when we have the dip from the planet transit, it's (Rp/Rstar)^2, and that dip is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

So yes, solving (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1036 gives Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.1036) ≈ 0.322.

So the answer would be option D) ~0.32.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation. Let me recalculate the fractional dip.

Wait, the fractional dip is (ΔF/F_0) = [A (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4)] / [ 2 π R² T_eff^4 ]

But wait, wait, I think I messed up a sign earlier. Because when the spots are in front, the flux is lower, so ΔF is negative. So the dip is (F_0 - F) / F_0 = (A (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 )) / (2 π R² T_eff^4 )

Which is positive.

So the fractional dip is [ A (T_eff^4 -
