Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, parallax is a measure of how far away a star is from us. Right, the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So a parallax of 1 parsec means the star is 1 parsec away, right? And for a star at distance d, the parallax plx is 1/d in parsecs. So plx is inversely proportional to distance.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed—oh, I think that means the number density of stars is constant in space. So the number of stars in a given volume doesn't depend on where you look, only on the size of the volume.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, we're looking for how N, the number of stars, changes with plx. Let's denote dN as the number of stars in a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx. We want to find how dN depends on plx.

Since parallax is 1/d, higher plx means closer stars. So, a small range in plx corresponds to a range in distance. Let's think about the relationship between distance and parallax. If plx is small, say approaching zero, that means the star is very far away.

Wait, but stars don't go on forever. Let's imagine a spherical shell at a distance d, with thickness dd. The volume of this shell would be 4πd² dd, right? Because the surface area of a sphere is 4πr², and multiplied by the thickness gives the volume.

But wait, the number of stars in that shell depends on the volume. Since the distribution is uniform, the number of stars in the shell is proportional to the volume. So, N_shell = n * 4πd² dd, where n is the number density of stars (stars per unit volume).

But we need to express this in terms of parallax. Because plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let's substitute that into the equation. So, N_shell = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd). Hmm, but dd is the change in distance, and we need to relate that to dplx (the change in parallax). Let's find dd in terms of dplx.

Since plx = 1/d, taking the derivative: dplx = -1/d² dd. Solving for dd: dd = -d² dplx. But since plx is positive and decreasing as d increases, the negative sign indicates that as d increases, plx decreases. But for our purposes, the magnitude is what matters. So, |dd| = (d^2) * dplx. Substituting d = 1/plx, so |dd| = (1/plx)^2 dplx.

Now, substitute this back into N_shell. So,

N_shell = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( (1/plx)^2 dplx ) )

Wait, wait, let me double-check. I think I might have messed up the substitution. Let me go again.

We have N_shell = n * 4π d² * dd. But since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So d² becomes (1/plx)^2. And dd is (d^2) dplx, but since d = 1/plx, d^2 is (1/plx)^2. So dd = (1/plx)^2 * dplx.

So plugging back in:

N_shell = n * 4π * (1/plx)^2 * ( (1/plx)^2 * dplx )

Wait, that can't be right. That would make N_shell proportional to (1/plx^4) * dplx. But that seems a bit off. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d, which has thickness dd, and then express that in terms of plx.

Since the number of stars is proportional to volume, which is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars per unit volume is n, so N = n * 4π d² dd.

But we need to find the number of stars per unit range of plx. So, for a small change dplx, what is dN?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of differential number. So, dN = n * 4π d² (dd), but I need to express this in terms of dplx.

Since plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Then, dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases (since d decreases), the distance is getting smaller. But since we're dealing with magnitudes, perhaps we can take the absolute value.

So, substituting d = 1/plx and dd = (1/plx²) dplx into dN:

dN = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx )

So, dN = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, that would mean the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. But that doesn't make sense because the number of stars should increase as plx decreases (since more stars are farther away). So, if plx is small, more stars would be in that range. So, the number per unit plx should be higher for smaller plx, which would be 1/plx^4. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, but let's think about the overall distribution. The number of stars at a given distance is proportional to the surface area at that distance, which is proportional to d². So at larger distances, each shell (for a given d) has more stars. But since parallax is inversely proportional to d, a small change in plx (from, say, 0.01 to 0.02) would correspond to a much larger range in d (from 100 to 50 parsecs). So the volume element in plx space would account for this.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the differential number of stars per unit plx. Let's define dN as the number of stars per unit plx. So,

dN = (number of stars per volume) * (volume per unit plx)

The volume per unit plx would be the volume between plx and plx + dplx. Hmm, perhaps it's better to express it as a solid angle multiplied by the distance squared.

Wait, when you're considering a thin shell in distance, the volume is 4πd² dd. But we need to express this in terms of plx.

Alternatively, let's use integration. The total number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is the integral over that range, considering how many stars are at each distance.

The number of stars at a distance between d and d + dd is n * 4π d² dd.

But since plx = 1/d, we can change variables from d to plx. So, d = 1/plx, and dd = -d² dplx. So, dd =
