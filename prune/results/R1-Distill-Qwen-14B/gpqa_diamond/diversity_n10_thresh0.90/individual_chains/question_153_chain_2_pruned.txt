Okay, so I've got a multiple-choice question about organic chemistry reactions, specifically the Michael addition. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think this through.

The question gives three different reactions and asks about their products. Let's take each one step by step.

Starting with the first reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). So, the conditions are probably basic because NaOEt is a strong base. 

Wait, the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. So, dimethyl malonate is the enolate here, acting as the nucleophile. The acrylate is the Michael acceptor because it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

So, the structure of dimethyl malonate is (CH3CO)2CH- (but actually, it's CH2(CO2Me)2, right? So it's a diethyl ester of malonic acid). When it forms the enolate, the base deprotonates the alpha position, which is adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Then this enolate attacks the beta position of the acrylate.

The acrylate here is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3, but wait, the E configuration means the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. So it's probably CH2-CH-C(p-tolyl)=O? No, wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with the substituents in E configuration. Actually, I think the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but the E configuration might not change the outcome much here because the substituents are same on the double bond.

When the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the beta carbon (the one adjacent to the carbonyl), it would add across the double bond. So the enolate (which has a negative charge on the central carbon) would attack the less substituted end. Wait, no, in Michael addition, the donor (enolate) attacks the acceptor's beta position.

Wait, the structure of the acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but the substituents are in E form. So the attack would happen on the CH2 group. Hmm, but maybe I should draw it.

The enolate from dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2^âˆ’, but wait, no, when malonate forms an enolate, it's actually a conjugate base: the central carbon is deprotonated, so the structure is CH2^- (but with two CO2Me groups attached). So when this attacks the acrylate, the acrylate's double bond is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3? No, more accurately, the structure would be CH2=CH-C(=O)OCH2CH3? No, wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH3, but with the substituents (CH3 from the tolyl) on the opposite side.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The acrylate is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. The structure is CH2=CH-C(OR)=CO, but wait, no. Let me figure it out. The general structure for an acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. But if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, then the substituent is
