Okay, so I have this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit. Hmm, I remember that the transit method detects planets when they pass in front of their star, blocking some light. The probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet compared to the star and the orientation of the orbit.

The question says both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star. The stars have the same radius but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, which is slightly evolved.

Wait, how does the mass of the star affect the transit probability? Oh right, the star's mass influences the size of the star's orbit for the planet. But wait, the radius of the star is same for both. Hmm, so the star's mass affects other factors like the orbital radius of the planet.

Transit probability is given by the formula P_transit = (R_planet + R_star) / (a planet * sin i), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Wait, I think the probability for a planet to transit is (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, but actually, considering the Keplerian orbit, the probability is (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by something else. Or is it 2R*/a? No, wait, I think the formula is P = (R* + R_p) / a_p. But wait, actually, considering the orbital plane, the probability depends on the chance that the orbit's inclination is just right. But the formula for the probability is P = (R* + R_p) / (a_p), but I think that's an approximation. Alternatively, the correct formula for the probability is (R_*/a_p) * (1/(1 - e²)^0.5), but since both orbits are circular, e is zero, so it's simply (R_* + R_p)/a_p, but I'm not sure. Wait, another approach: the probability is the ratio of the size of the star to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because the planet must pass in front of the star, which is a small area compared to the possible area where the planet could be in the plane of the sky. So, the probability is approximately (R_*/a_p), but considering the planet
