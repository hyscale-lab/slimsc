Okay, so I need to find the energy of the RHIC when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Let's see, the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li usually has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. Oh wait, but sometimes isotopes are written as Li-6 or Li-7. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Now, the question is about relativistic energy. The formula I remember for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity. Since the speed is 0.96c, I'll need to calculate gamma for that speed.

Gamma equals 1 divided by the square root of (1 - v²/c²). Let me plug in v as 0.96c. So v squared is (0.96)^2 c². 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me do that more accurately. 0.0784's square root: 0.28 exactly because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

Now, the mass m is the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Since it's a nucleus, the mass is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons. Each proton is about 1.007276 GeV/c², and each neutron is about 1.008665 GeV/c². Wait, actually, I think the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV, which is 0.938 GeV, and similar for the neutron. But wait, I'm not exactly sure if I should use the exact rest masses or the atomic mass in terms of u (atomic mass units).

Alternatively, I might remember that the mass of a proton is approximately 938 MeV/c², and same for neutron, but maybe a bit more precise. Let me check: proton mass is about 938.272 MeV, neutron is about 939.565 MeV. Oh, but since the nucleus is made of 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass would be 3*(proton mass) + 3*(neutron mass).

Wait, but wait. Actually, the mass of the nucleus is not exactly 3p +3n because of binding energy. But for the purpose of calculating the rest mass here, maybe we can approximate it as the sum of individual nucleon masses, considering that the binding energy is negligible compared to the total mass? Or perhaps the question expects me to use the mass number as A=6, so m = A * m_nucleon, where m_nucleon is about 1 GeV/c².

Wait, but for a more accurate calculation, perhaps the exact mass of Li-6 should be considered. I think the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.013 atomic mass units (u). But 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.013 u * 931.5 MeV/c² per u equals approximately (6.013 * 931.5) MeV. Let me calculate that.

6 * 931.5 is 5589 MeV, 0.013 *931.5 is about 12.1095. So total is 5589 +12.1095 = 5601.1095 MeV, which is 5.6011 GeV. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact mass of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to calculate using the mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron), but the nucleus is Li-6, so 6 nucleons.

Wait, but the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV, neutron about 940 MeV. So 3 protons and 3 neutrons would be 3*(938 +940) MeV. Let's compute that: 3*(1878) = 5634 MeV, which is 5.634 GeV. Hmm, but Li-6's actual mass is less than that because of binding energy. Wait no, binding energy is the energy that holds the nucleus together, so the rest mass is less than the sum of individual nucleons.

Wait, because in nuclear binding, the mass of the nucleus is the sum of the nucleons minus the binding energy divided by c². So the actual mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of individual nucleon masses. But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps I can use the sum of individual masses as an approximation, unless the question provides the exact mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to use the concept that the rest mass energy is given by m = A * m_p, where A is the mass number. But in that case, perhaps they approximate m_p as 1 GeV/c².

Wait, let me think again. The problem states that X is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li has atomic number 3, so 3 protons. 3 neutrons makes it Li-6, because 3 +3 =6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

The mass of Li-6 is approximately 6 nucleons, each about 1 GeV/c². So m =6 GeV/c²? Wait, but that's approximately 6 GeV/c², but in reality, because of binding energy, the rest mass is less. But in the absence of specific data, I think the problem expects me to use the sum of the protons and neutrons' rest masses.

Wait, but in reality, the mass of Li-6 is about 6.013 u. Each u is about 931.5 MeV/c², so 6.013 * 931.5 = ?

Calculating that: 6 *931.5 =5589 MeV, 0.013 *931.5=12.1095. So total is 5601.1095 MeV, which is 5.6011 GeV.

So m =5.6011 GeV/c².

Wait, but perhaps the question expects me to use m = A * m_p, where m_p is 1 GeV/c², so 6 GeV/c². That would make the energy calculation easier, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass of a single nucleon (say, m_p or m_n) multiplied by the number of nucleons. Let me think, but I think the correct approach is to use the actual rest mass of the nucleus, which is approximately 6 * 938 MeV (but adjusted for binding energy). But since the problem doesn't give the exact mass, maybe I should proceed with m =6 * m_p, where m_p is 938 MeV/c².

Wait, but 6 *938 MeV is 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. If I use that as m, then E = gamma * m c². Since gamma is 3.5714, and m c^2 is 5.628 GeV.

So E = 3.5714 *5.628 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 * 5.628.

Well, 3 *5.628 is 16.884.

0.5714 *5.628 is approximately 0.5714 *5 =2.857 plus 0.5714 *0.628=approx 0.358. So total about 3.215.

So 16.884 +3.215=20.099 GeV. That's about 20.1 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV and option D is 21.419 GeV. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me try using the exact value for Li-6's mass.

As I calculated earlier, the mass is approximately 5.6011 GeV/c².

So E = gamma * m c^2 =3.5714 *5.6011 GeV.

3.5714 *5.6011. Let me compute that more accurately.

3 *5.6011=16.8033.

0.5714 *5.6011:

0.5 *5.6011=2.80055.

0.0714 *5.6011: 0.0714 is approximately 1/14.

5.6011 /14 is approximately 0.40008.

So 0.5714 *5.6011=2.8
