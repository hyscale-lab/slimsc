Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a certain concentration of a Ca-EDTA complex. The given data is that the solution has 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.

Wait, wait. I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. So when it's in solution, the Ca-EDTA complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. But since it's a complex, the formation constant would determine how much it dissociates.

The formation constant Kf is given as 5e10. Formation constants are pretty large, which suggests that the complex is very stable, meaning it doesn't dissociate much. So, the concentration of free Ca²+ ions would be low.

The problem is asking for [Ca²+] in the solution. The Ca-EDTA complex is given as 0.02 M. Let me think about the dissociation equation. The complex would dissociate as:

CaY²- ⇌ Ca²+ + Y^4-

Where Y is the EDTA part. The formation constant Kf is [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]) = 5e10.

But wait, in solution, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Assuming that the dissociation is minimal (since Kf is large), the concentrations of Ca²+ and Y^4- would be approximately equal because the stoichiometry is 1:1.

So, let me set up the equation. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions. Then, [Y^4-] would also be x (assuming that all the EDTA is either tied up in the complex or free as Y^4-).

So, according to the formation constant:

Kf = [CaY²-]/( [Ca²+][Y^4-] )  
5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x)  
5e10 = 0.02 / x²  
Rearranging: x² = 0.02 / 5e10  
x² = 2e-3 / 5e10  
Wait, wait, 0.02 is 2e-2, right? So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is 4e-13.

Wait, no: 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5)e-12, which is 0.4e-12, or 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13. Taking the square root, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is the same as 1e-6.5 = 3.16e-7? Because sqrt(1e-12) is 1e-6, sqrt(1e-13) is sqrt(1e-12 * 1e-1) )= 1e-6 * sqrt(0.1) ≈ 3.16e-7.

So x = 2 * 3.16e-7 = approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M, which matches this calculation.

Let me double-check the steps. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. The dissociation is minimal because Kf is large. So [Ca²+] = [Y^4-] = x, and Kf = 0.02/(x^2) =5e10. Solving for x gives x^2=0.02/(5e10)=4e-13, so x=2e-6.5? Wait, 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7, so that's correct.

I think option C is the right answer.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we start by considering the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant is given as \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Let \( x \) represent the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions. Since the dissociation is minimal (due to the large \( K_f \)), the concentration of \(\text{Y}^{4-}\) ions will also be \( x \).

The formation constant expression is:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which matches option C.

Answer: C
