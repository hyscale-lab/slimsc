Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out what's going on. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details right.

The question says that we have ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the positions, all the particles were found between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function must be zero outside this region. 

Wait, no, the wave function isn't given as zero outside. The measurement shows that none were found outside, which suggests that the probability of finding a particle outside is zero. So maybe the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3. But the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere?

Wait, no. Because the wave function provided is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. If this is the case, we might need to normalize it. Wait, but normalization involves the integral of the absolute square of the wave function being 1. So, perhaps the given wave function is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. Because when they measured, particles were only found between those points. So the wave function must be zero outside that interval. But the given equation is only for a part of space where the particle can exist. Maybe that part is between 1 and 3?

So, the wave function is given as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5i for x between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. But wait, the problem statement says that when measuring, none were found outside 1 and 3. So the wave function must be zero outside, but the given ψ(x) is in a part where the particle exists, which is between 1 and 3. So the entire wave function is ψ(x) = [a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i] for 1 ≤x ≤3, and zero otherwise.

Wait, but that can't be right because a wave function with an imaginary component would have a real probability density. Because the probability density is ψ*ψ, which is the product of the wave function and its complex conjugate. So, for ψ = a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i, the conjugate is a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i. So ψ times ψ* would be [a/sqrt(1+x)]² + (0.5)^2, because the imaginary parts would multiply to (0.5i)(-0.5i)=0.25, right? Because i times -i is 1. So, the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, maybe the wave function is written as a combination, but perhaps the real and imaginary parts are such that the wave function is a sum of a real function and an imaginary function. But for normalization, we just need to integrate the modulus squared over all x, which in this case is from 1 to 3.

So, the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

Let's compute |ψ(x)|². ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5i. So, ψ*(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) + 0.5i. Multiplying them:

ψψ* = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5i)(-0.5i) = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.25)(i*(-i)) )= (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25*(1) because i*(-i)=1.

So, |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Now, the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx must equal 1.

So, the integral becomes two parts: a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 plus 0.25 ∫1 dx from 1 to 3.

Let me compute each integral.

First integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln|1+x|. So evaluating from 1 to3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

Second integral: ∫1 dx from 1 to3 is 2 (since 3-1=2).

So putting it together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.25 * 2 = 1.

Which is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Thus, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute this value. Let's see, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So, 0.5 divided by 0.6931 is about 0.7213.

So, a² ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is very close. But wait, perhaps I should check my calculations again.

Wait a second, let me re-calculate the integral. Oh wait, no,
