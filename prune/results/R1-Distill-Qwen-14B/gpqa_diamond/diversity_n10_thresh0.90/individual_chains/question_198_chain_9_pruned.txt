Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I've learned a bit about this before, but I need to think carefully.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think are the ones with two SCN- ligands, so Co(SCN)_2^2+. Wait, but I'm not sure if blue refers to a particular complex. Oh, right, sometimes Co with multiple SCN can form different colors. But the question specifically mentions dithiocyanato, so that's two SCN per Co.

Stability constants. Right, stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the beta, the more the complex will form. So the higher the beta, the more the complex is favored.

So the species present are various complexes of Co with different numbers of SCN- ligands. The possible complexes are Co(SCN)_n^(2−n), where n is 0,1,2,3,4? Wait, but the beta values are given up to β4=16, so four ligands. So the complexes are:

- Co²+ (n=0)
- CoSCN+ (n=1, charge +1)
- Co(SCN)_2^0 (n=2)
- Co(SCN)_3^- (n=3)
- Co(SCN)_4^2− (n=4)

Wait, wait. Let me think about the charges. Each SCN is -1, right? So for Co²+ with n SCN:

Charge would be 2+ + n*(-1) = 2 - n. So the overall charge is 2 - n.

So for n=0, Co²+ is neutral.

n=1: CoSCN^+ (charge +1)
n=2: Co(SCN)_2^0 (neutral)
n=3: Co(SCN)_3^- (charge -1)
n=4: Co(SCN)_4^2− (charge -2)

Now, the stability constants are given as β1,β2,β3,β4. What do those beta values correspond to? I think β_n is for the complex with n ligands.

So β1 is the formation constant for CoSCN+ from Co²+ and SCN^-.

Wait, the general formation constant Kf for a complex is [ML^n]/([M][L]^n). So for the first complex, CoSCN+ would form from Co²+ and SCN^-:

Co²+ + SCN^- ↔ CoSCN^+ 

So β1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co²+][SCN^-]) = 9.

Similarly, β2 is the formation constant for the second complex, which is Co(SCN)_2^0:

CoSCN+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_2^0 

So β2 would be [Co(SCN)_2^0] / ([CoSCN+][SCN^-]) ) = 40.

Wait, but sometimes stability constants are given for each step, and sometimes overall. I think in this problem, each β_n is the stepwise constant for adding the nth ligand. So β1 is the first ligand, β2 is the second, etc.

So the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_n is the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, no, that's not right. Each β is the step from the (n-1)th complex to the nth. So the overall K for Co(SCN)_n is β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

But wait, I might be getting that wrong. Let me think: Each β is the formation of the next complex from the previous one. So for CoSCN+ (n=1), K
