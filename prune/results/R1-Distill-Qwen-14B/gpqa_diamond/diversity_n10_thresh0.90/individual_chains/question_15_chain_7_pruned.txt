Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet is more likely to transit so the researchers should observe that one first. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, both planets are Earth-like and detected via the RV method. So their minimum masses are known, and their orbital periods. Oh, but Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3.

Wait, transit probability depends on the size of the planet compared to the star and their orbital distances. But I think it's more about whether the orbital plane is edge-on enough for us to see the transit. The probability is higher when the planet's orbit is more likely to be aligned with our line of sight.

The formula for the probability of a transit is something like (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis, but since the planet is much smaller, it's roughly R_star / a. But wait, no, that's not exactly right. I think the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a) because a larger a (farther away) would make the transit less likely—because the alignment needs to be precise.

But wait, another factor is the orbital distance. Because the period depends on the star's mass and the semi-major axis. Using Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. Since the planets have the same mass (they're Earth-like), and the stars have different masses, I can compare their semi-major axes.

Wait, the host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. Let me denote M1 = 2*M2. Given that both stars have the same radius, but they have different masses. Wait, if the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but same radius, maybe M2 is a bit lower main sequence star, but same size. Hmm, but for Kepler's law, the semi-major axis depends on the cube root of (P² * M_star) divided by something.

Wait, maybe I should write the formula. Kepler's third law is P² = (4π² a³)/(G(M + m)), but since m (planet mass) is negligible compared to M (star mass), this simplifies to P² = (4π² a³)/(G M). So a³ = G M P²/(4π²). So a is proportional to (M * P²)^(1/3).

So for Planet_1: M1 = 2*M2, P1 = P2/3. Let me calculate a1 and a2.

a1 = [ (G * 2 M2) * (P1)² ]^(1/3) / (4π²)^(1/3)

But P1 = P2/3, so P1² = P2² /9.

So a1 = [ (2 M2 * (P2² /9) ) / (4π²) ) ]^(1/3) * G is a constant, so let's factor that out.

Similarly, a2 = [ (G * M2) * P2² ]^(1/3) / (4π²)^(1/3)

So a1/a2 = [ (2 M2 * (P2²/9)) / ( M2 * P2² ) ) ]^(1/3)

Wait, let me compute the ratio:

a1³ / a2³ = [ (2 M2 * (P2²/9)) ] / [ (M2 * P2²) ) ]

Simplify numerator: 2 M2 * P2² /9.

Denominator: M2 * P2².

So ratio is (2/9) / 1 = 2/9. So a1³ = (2/9) a2³ → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

What's (2/9)^(1/3)? Let's calculate. 2/9 is about 0.222. Cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.6 (since 0.6^3=0.216). So a1 is about 0.6 times a2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2 is to theirs.

Now, transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a). Since both stars have the same radius (as per the question), the probability is inversely proportional to a.

So transit probability P_t is proportional to (R/a), which is same as 1/a, since R is same for both.

So since a1 is 0.6 a2, P_t1 = (1/a1) = (1/(0.6 a2)) = (1/a2) * (1/0.6) ≈ 1.666 times (1/a2).

So P_t1 / P_t2 = (1/a1) / (1/a2) = a2 / a1. Since a1 is 0.
