Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the unknown compound is based on the spectroscopic data provided. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

The question says that an unknown compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The data from each technique is given, and I need to match these observations to one of the four possible formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

Let me break down each piece of data.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR around that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Alternatively, it could be an amine, but I don't think that's the case here because the other peaks don't suggest amines. But wait, looking further, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 peak is a classic carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe a conjugated group, like an aromatic ring. But wait, 1650 is a bit lower than a typical carbonyl. Hmm. Could it be a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone or maybe an ester or amide? Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring's C=C stretching.

Wait, another thought: the 1700 is more likely a carbonyl, maybe a ketone or ester. The 1650 could be an aromatic C=C, but then the aromatic rings would have more peaks in the IR. Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like a ketone with conjugation or maybe an acid derivative.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has an alkene group. So maybe the structure has a double bond, like in an ester or a ketone with an alkene nearby?

Looking at the mass spectrum: the fragment peak at m/z 45. Let's think about what that could be. 45 is an odd mass, so it's likely a fragment with an oxygen. For example, the tropylium ion (C7H7+) is about 91, but that's not relevant here. Wait, 45 could correspond to something like (CH2)2O, but wait, (CH2)2O is 44 (since O is 16, 2 CH2 is 24). Alternatively, maybe a fragment like (CH3)CO+ which would be 58? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a smaller molecule. Wait, 45 is a possible m/z for (CH3)2COH, but that's 45? Let me calculate: 2*(12+2*1) = 28 for the two CH3 groups, plus the COH which is 12+16+1=29? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 45 is the sum of (CH3)2CO+: (2*12 + 6*1) + 12 + 16 (since CO is 12+16=28). Wait, (CH3)2CO+ would be (2*(15) [CH3]) + 28 (CO) = 30 +28=58? Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's a CH2O fragment, which is formaldehyde. The m/z for formaldehyde (H2CO) would be 30. No, that's not 45. Another possibility: maybe a ketene fragment? Or perhaps the fragment is a smaller group like OCH2CH2O... no, that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's a fragment with a carbonyl group. Let me think about possible fragments. 45 could be CH2(CO) something? Or maybe the fragment is a methyl ester group. Wait, another approach: the molecular weight of the compound may help here. If I can find the molecular formula, I can compute the molecular weight and see what the possible fragments are.

Looking at the options, the possible molecular formulas are:

A) C6H12O2: molecular weight = (6*12) + (12*1) + (2*16) = 72 +12 +32 = 116.

B) C6H10O: (6*12)+(10*1)+(16) =72+10+16=98.

C) C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32=114.

D) C6H12O:72+12+16=100.

So the molecular weights are 116, 98, 114, 100.

The fragment at m/z 45 suggests that a part of the molecule has a mass of 45. Let's think, what could have a mass of 45?

Looking at the options:

If the molecular formula is C6H12O2 (option A), which is 116. A fragment of 45 would imply that the rest is 71. Alternatively, maybe it's a common fragment. 45 could be (CH3)CO+ (which would be 58?), but that's not matching. Wait, 45 is also the molecular weight of a ketone fragment. Let me think in terms of molecular formula.

The molecular formula for a fragment of 45 would be something like C3H6O, because (3*12) + (6*1) +16=36+6+16=58. Hmm, that's not 45. Alternatively, perhaps C2H4O2? (24 +4 +32=60). No, that's higher. Wait, 45 as a molecular weight must be a smaller group. Let's see: 45 = 12a + b + 16c, where a, b, c are integers >=0.

Let me compute possible combinations:

If a=3: 36. Then 9 left. 9 could be 9 H (but H is 1 per, so 9 H would be 9). But that's 36 +9=45. So C3H9O? No, that's 3*12=36, 9 H is 9, O is 16: total 36+9+16=61. Wait, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is (CH2)2O: which is (2*15) +16=30 +16=46. Close, but not 45. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3)OCH2- something. Or perhaps a carbonyl group like O=C-O-R, but I'm not sure.

Wait another approach: common fragments. For example, the tropylium ion is at m/z 91. But that's not helpful here. Another common fragment is the CH2=CH group. Let's think about the mass. The CH2 group is 14, but I'm not sure.

Wait, if the fragment is at 45, perhaps it's a fragment with formula C3H7O, but wait, let me compute that: 3*12=36, 7 H=7, O=16. 36+7+16=59. No. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is something else. Let's think about the molecular formulas possible for 45. There's HCHO (formaldehyde) which is 30, but that's not 45. What about a ketone fragment, like (CH3)CO+? Let's compute that. (CH3)CO+ would be (12+3*1) + (12 +16) = 15 +28=43. Close, but not 45. Alternatively, (CH2)2CO+: (24) +28=52. No.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is an ester group. For example, CH3COO- would be 60 (but that's 60, not 45). Hmm.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a benzene ring with something, but that's probably too heavy. Or perhaps a methyl ester group.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a methyl group attached to an oxygen. Wait, CH3O would be 31 (12+16+1=29? No. Wait, CH3O is 12 +16 +1=29, but m/z 45 is higher. Maybe CH2(O)CH2? That's 44 (24 +16=40, plus 4 H is 4, so 44. Hmm, but 45 is one more, perhaps a double bond?

Wait, perhaps the fragment is an acetyl group (CH3CO+) which is 43 (12*2 +1*3 +16=24 +3 +16=43). Close to 45 but not exactly.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible molecular formula and see what a fragment would look like.

If the formula is C6H10O2 (option C), the molecular weight is 114. So a fragment of 45 would leave a remainder of 69. But 45 is a reasonable size fragment.

Now, looking at the FTIR: broad peak at 3000 suggests O-H. So the compound likely has an -OH group. The strong peak at 1700 is a carbonyl. So possible functional groups: ester, ketone, aldehyde, carboxylic acid.

Wait, but carboxylic acid would have a broad peak (like O-H in -COOH), and the carbonyl would be around 1700. So that's a possibility. But also, an ester has a carbonyl around 1700-1750, and an O-H stretch if it's a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if it's an ester, the O-H would be from an alcohol or something else, but if the compound is an ester, the O-H would come from another group, like a hydroxyl. So maybe the compound is a diol ester? Or perhaps a carboxylic acid with an ester.

Wait, but let's think: the broad peak at 3000 could be O-H from an alcohol or carboxylic acid. The 1700 is a carbonyl, so if it's a carboxylic acid, there would be another peak from the O-H in the carboxylic acid, but perhaps in the case of a carboxylic acid, the O-H peak is very broad and maybe the one at 3000 is that. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So the compound has a double bond. So perhaps it's an ester with a double bond, like a substituted acrylic acid ester.

Wait, another point: the NMR shows several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. So probably an alkene is present. Maybe something like a di-ester or a cyclic ester? Or perhaps a di-substituted alkene.

Putting it all together: the compound has an O-H group (broad peak ~3000 cm-1), a carbonyl (1700 cm-1), and an alkene (peaks in NMR for vinyl H). The mass spec has a fragment at 45.

Now, let's think about the possible options.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight 116. Possible functional groups: ester, perhaps with an alcohol group and an ester. If it's an ester, the formula would be like R-O-CO-R'. The O-H could be from an alcohol group. Alternatively, it could be a cyclic ester (lactone) and another group.

Option B: C6H10O. Formula would be something like C6H10O. That's less oxygen, so maybe an ether and an alkene. But with a carbonyl in IR, this seems less likely. Because 1700 suggests a carbonyl, which would require more O.

Wait, but wait. Another thing: the 1700 and 1650 peaks could be conjugated. Maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents. But if it's an aromatic ring, we might expect other IR peaks, like around 1450-1600 for C=C stretches. But the broad peak is at 3000, so perhaps it's a carbonyl group adjacent to an aromatic ring, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, the 1650 peak could be an aromatic ring. But then, the presence of vinyl H in the NMR suggests a double bond, which could be in an aromatic ring. But aromatic rings usually have more substituents, so that's a bit conflicting.

Wait, let's think about the options again:

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14 -12)/2 = 1. So one degree of unsaturation. That could be a ring or a double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl H, so at least one double bond. So if one degree, that's either one double bond or one ring. But how?

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclohexene ring with an ester group. For example, a cyclic ester (like a lactone) with an additional substituent. But I'm not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: which could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a triple bond, or an aromatic ring (like benzene, which counts as 3 degrees, but wait, 3 is more than 2). Hmm, but benzene is 4 degrees (three double bonds plus a ring). Wait, no, each ring or double bond is a degree. So benzene is three double bonds and one ring? Or is benzene considered as three degrees (three double bonds) and the ring is another? Wait, no, each ring or double bond counts as one. So benzene has three double bonds, which is three degrees, but the ring itself is another? No, wait, a benzene ring is a ring plus three double bonds, but each double bond is a degree. So the benzene ring contributes four degrees (one ring, three double bonds). But for benzene, it's a six-membered ring with three double bonds. So the degrees of unsaturation is 4: one ring and three double bonds. But option C has only two degrees. So the structure can't be benzene. Hmm.

So for option C, with two degrees, perhaps one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds.

Similarly, option B: C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation: (14 -10)/2=2. So same as C, but with less O.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees of unsaturation: (14-12)/2=1. So one degree, which could be a ring or a double bond.

But the presence of vinyl H (double bond) suggests at least one double bond. So let's check each formula.

But wait, the mass spec has m/z=45. Let's think about possible fragments again. If I can find what fragment has a molecular weight of 45, that might help.

Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CO, which would be 58. Hmm, not matching. Or maybe it's something else. Another thought: the fragment could be a methyl ester group. Wait, a methyl ester would be O-CO-OCH3. But that's probably too heavy.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an acetylium ion, which is CH3CO+. The molecular weight of that is 43. Close to 45, but not quite. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula for the unknown is one of the four options. Let's look at each option and see which could have a fragment of 45.

Option A: C6H12O2. What could split into a fragment of 45? Let's see, maybe a methyl group and something else. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the molecule is an ester, like RCOOR'. If R' is CH2CH2O, but that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the ester group is part of a larger structure.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is an acetyl group (43) but with an extra 2, like perhaps CH3COO-. Wait, CH3COO- is 60 (12*2 + 1*3 + 16 + 16=24+3+16+16=59? No, perhaps not. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is such that a fragment like CH2(CO)O- would have a mass of 45. Let's calculate the formula for a fragment with m/z 45. The possible formula could be C3H6O (since 3*12=36 + 6=36+6=42 + 16=58, no). Alternatively, C2H4O2: 24 +4 +32=60. No.

Wait, another approach: maybe the fragment is an aldehyde group. The aldehyde ion (CHO) would have a molecular weight of 29. Not 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketene ion, which is a fragment with a carbonyl and an adjacent double bond. But I'm not too familiar with that.

Wait, perhaps looking for the molecular formula that matches a fragment of 45. 45 is a prime number, which doesn't help much. Let's think, 45=12+12+12+9. Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, 45=12*3 + 9. So maybe C3H9O. Wait, 3*12=36, 9 H=9, O=16. 36+9+16=61. No, that's too big.

Wait, another thought: maybe the fragment is a methoxy group attached to something. Wait, the methoxy group is OCH3, which is 31. Not 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH2 group attached to a carbonyl, like CH2CO. The molecular weight of CH2CO would be 12*2 + 1*4 +16=24+4+16=44. Close to 45, but not exactly. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a propionyl group (CH2CH2CO). But that's getting more complicated.

Wait, maybe I should look for the possible molecular formulas of the options and see which can lose a fragment of 45. For instance, the molecular weight is 116 (option A). So 116 -45=71. What's a possible fragment with 71? Hmm, maybe a cyclopentyl group or something else.

Alternatively, for option C, molecular weight 114. 114-45=69. 69 could be something like C5H11O or similar.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the fragment is the result of losing a certain group. For example, in an ester, losing the R-O- group as a leaving group, leaving behind the acyl part.

Wait, suppose the compound is an ester, RCOOR'. The fragmentation could break off the R' group as RO- and leave the RCOO+ group. The mass of RCOO+ would be (R's molecular weight) + 16 (for O) +12 (for C). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment at m/z 45 is from the loss of a methyl group. Wait, but a methyl group is 15. So 45-15=30. Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps a more structured approach: each option's possible structure and whether the data fits.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures: ester (RCOOR'), or a cyclic ester (lactone). Suppose it's a cyclic ester with a substituent. The FTIR shows broad O-H (maybe from an alcohol or acid), a carbonyl at 1700 (ester or acid), and an alkene (vinyl H in NMR). So perhaps a cyclic ester with a double bond.

Wait, but a cyclic ester (lactone) would have the carbonyl. The O-H could be part of a hydroxyl group elsewhere. Alternatively, if it's a di-ester, but I'm not sure.

Option B: C6H10O. Only one O, so maybe an ether or an alcohol. But the IR has 1700, which is a carbonyl. So this seems less likely because with one O, you can't have both a carbonyl and an O-H. Wait, unless it's an aldehyde, but aldehydes don't have an O-H. Hmm, but the IR has a broad peak around 3000, which suggests O-H. So this option might not fit because it would require the O to be in two places, which isn't possible.

Option C: C6H10O2. Two O's. Possible structures: ester, ketone, and an O-H group. For example, an ester with a hydroxyl group. Or a ketone with an O-H. Or a diol with a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a cyclic ester with an adjacent double bond and an O-H group. Or maybe a diester with a double bond.

But let's think about the IR. If there's a carbonyl (1700) and a conjugated double bond, perhaps the 1650 is the C=C stretch. So maybe the structure has both a carbonyl and a conjugated double bond, such as an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester.

In that case, the structure would be something like CH2=CHCOOR, which would have a conjugated system. The IR would show the carbonyl at around 1700 and the C=C at around 1650. Also, if there's an O-H group, perhaps from an alcohol, then the broad peak at 3000 would fit.

The NMR would show vinyl H's as doublets or triplets depending on the substitution. For an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, the vinyl H's would be deshielded and appear downfield.

Now, the mass spec fragment at 45. If the structure is an ester with a conjugated double bond and an O-H group, perhaps the fragment is the acylium ion, which would be the RCO+ group. Let's think about the formula for that. Suppose the compound is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH. Wait, that's a possibility. Let's compute the molecular formula. CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH would be C6H10O3. But that's not one of the options. So perhaps a different structure.

Wait, another structure: maybe a substituted maleic acid ester. Or perhaps a substituted acrylic ester.

Alternatively, let's think about the molecular formula of option C: C6H10O2. So two O's. Let's imagine it's a diester. Or perhaps a keto-ester.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula for the fragment at 45 (m/z=45) must correspond to a part of the molecule. Let's see for each option:

Option A: C6H12O2. Let's imagine the molecule is an ester with a double bond. So, maybe something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. But the molecular formula would be C9H14O2, which is larger than our options.

Wait, perhaps a smaller structure. For example, methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, which has the formula C4H6O2. That's smaller than the options given, which are all C6.

Hmm, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a substituent. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester group and a double bond elsewhere. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an ester with a hydroxyl group and a double bond. For example, something like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2OH. Wait, that would be C6H12O3, which isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the mass spec part. Let me think again about the IR and NMR data.

The FTIR has a broad O-H, a carbonyl at 1700, and another peak at 1650. The NMR has vinyl H's, which suggests a double bond. So the structure likely has a carbonyl group, a double bond, and an O-H.

So possible structures could be:

- An alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with a hydroxyl group.
- A carboxylic acid with a double bond and an O-H (but wait, a carboxylic acid would have two O in the COOH group, which would require the formula to have at least two O's).

Wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the formula must have at least two O's (like option A or C). Let's consider that.

If the compound is a substituted acrylic acid, like CH2=CHCOOH. The formula would be C3H4O2. But that's much smaller than the options (which are C6). So perhaps it's a larger molecule, like a di-substituted acrylic acid ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond and an O-H group.

Wait, another thought: the carbonyl could be part of a ketone. But if it's a ketone, then the structure would be R-CO-R', and the O-H could be from an alcohol group. But then, the FTIR would show the C=O around 1700 and O-H around 3000. But the presence of a double bond would come from elsewhere.

Putting this together, the structure might be something like CH2=CH-CO-O-R, but with the right number of carbons and O's.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diol with a carbonyl group and a double bond. For example, a dihydroxy ketone with a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Now, considering the NMR has vinyl H's, the compound must have a double bond. So, perhaps it's an ester with a conjugated double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. The IR would show the C=O at 1700 and the C=C at around 1650 (which is lower than isolated C=C, so perhaps conjugated).

So the structure could be CH2=CHCOO-R. Let's see, for the molecular formula to be C6H10O2 (option C), R would be CH2CH2-OH or something. Wait, let's compute:

If the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH, that would be C6H10O3. But that's not an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OCH3. Wait, that's more O's than allowed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a di-substituted ester. Let's think: if the formula is C6H10O2, possible structure could be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2. No, that doesn't make sense. Another approach: the formula C6H10O2 implies 6 carbons, 10 H, and 2 O. So perhaps it's something like methyl vinyl ketone, but that would be C4H6O, which doesn't match.

Wait, another idea: the compound could be a diester, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester with a double bond. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester group and a double bond. But I'm not certain.

Let me think about the mass spec again. The fragment at 45 could be the result of losing certain groups. For example, losing a methyl group (15) from a larger fragment. But 45 is higher than that.

Wait, another approach: the molecular weight of the compound is either 116 (A), 98 (B), 114 (C), or 100 (D). The fragment is 45. So perhaps the parent ion loses a group of MW 45. For instance, in an ester, the ester group could split off as a fragment.

Suppose the compound is an ester, RCOOR'. If R' is CH2CH2O-something, but I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the acylium ion (RCO+), which would have a mass of (R's mass + 16 + 12). Wait, no, the acylium ion is RCO+, so its mass is (RCO)+. For example, if R is CH2CH2, then RCO+ would be (24 + 12 +16) = 52, which is higher than 45.

Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be a methyl group attached to something. For instance, if the molecule loses a (CH3) group (15), the remaining would be 45 +15 =60. Wait, but that doesn't help much.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is part of the molecule that includes the double bond. For example, CH2=CHCO+ would be 58 (12*3 + 1*4 +16=36+4+16=56? Wait, CH2=CHCO is C3H4O, which is (3*12)+(4*1)+16=36+4+16=56. Hmm, close to 56, but the fragment is at 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a smaller portion. For example, the ester group could break off as O-CO-O, but that's probably not. Alternatively, the ester might lose the R-O group, leaving the acyl part.

Wait, another thought: the fragment at 45 could correspond to a CH2CH2O group. Let's compute: (12*2)+(2*1)+16=24+2+16=42. No, that's 42. Not 45. Alternatively, a CH2CH2 group is 28. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is an allyl group. Allyl group is CH2CHCH2-, which has a mass of 42 (12*3 +1*6=36+6=42). Still not 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a propyl group with an oxygen. CH2CH2O-? That would be 12*2 +16 + 1*2 =24+16+2=42. Still not 45.

Another approach: perhaps the fragment is a ketene ion, which has the formula O=C=O but that's not correct. Or maybe it's a different type of fragment.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a methoxy group attached to a CH2 group. OCH2CH3 would be 31 +15=46. No, that's 46, not 45. But 45 is close.

Wait, 45 is 3*12 + 9*1 + 3*16? No, that's 36+9+48=93, which is way off. Hmm.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should focus on other clues. The FTIR shows a broad O-H, which suggests either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But the presence of a carbonyl suggests it's more likely an ester or a ketone with an O-H group.

Given that, perhaps the compound is an ester with an O-H group and a double bond.

Now, considering the molecular formula options:

Option C: C6H10O2. The degrees of unsaturation are 2. So two rings, or one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds.

If the structure has one ring and one double bond, that fits. For example, a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond.

Wait, a lactone has the structure O=C-O in a ring. If there's a double bond elsewhere, that would account for two degrees.

So, perhaps the structure is a six-membered ring lactone with a double bond. But I'm not sure about the exact structure.

Alternatively, the compound could be a substituted cyclopentane with ester and double bond groups.

But I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to go back to the data.

The key points:

- FTIR: O-H (broad), C=O (~1700), C=C (~1650, conjugated)
- NMR: vinyl H
- Mass: fragment 45

The O-H in IR suggests either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. The presence of C=O suggests ester, ketone, or acid.

If it's a carboxylic acid, the formula would have two O's (COOH). So in that case, the possible formulas are options A (C6H12O2) or C (C6H10O2).

If it's an ester, the formula would have two O's as well (RCOOR'). So again, options A or C.

Now, the degrees of unsaturation:

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: 1. So either a ring or a double bond.

But the NMR shows vinyl H's, so it must have a double bond. So for option A, the structure must have a double bond (1 degree) and perhaps a ring, but that would require 2 degrees. Hmm, but option A only allows one degree. Wait, wait, degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H -X + N)/2. For option A, it's (14 -12)/2=1. So one degree. Which can be a double bond or a ring.

But the presence of a double bond (from vinyl H) uses that one degree. So no ring. So the structure would be a chain with a double bond and an ester group, and an O-H group.

Wait, but the presence of a double bond and an ester group (each contributing a degree) would require two degrees, but option A only allows one. So that's a problem. So option A doesn't fit because it would require two degrees: one for the double bond and another for the ester (carbonyl).

Wait, unless the ester is part of a ring. Hmm, but that's getting complicated.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (14-10)/2=2. Two degrees. So either two double bonds, a double bond and a ring, or two rings.

So for option C, the structure could have a double bond (1 degree) and a ring (another degree), which would fit the data. So perhaps a cyclic ester with a double bond.

So, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester (like a lactone) with a double bond. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester linkage and a double bond.

In that case, the FTIR would show the ester's carbonyl (around 1700), the conjugated double bond (1650), and the O-H (from an alcohol group, but wait, a lactone doesn't have an O-H. Oh wait, maybe the compound is a diester with a hydroxyl group elsewhere. Or perhaps it's an ester with a hydroxyl substituent and a double bond.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again about the mass spectrum.

If the molecular formula is option C: C6H10O2, the molecular weight is 114. A fragment of 45 would leave 114-45=69. What could have a mass of 69? Maybe a cyclopentyl group (C5H8, which is 68 +1=69 if there's something else. Wait, cyclopentyl is C5H9, which is 69 +1? No, wait, cyclopentane is C5H10. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is C3H7O2. Let's compute: 3*12=36, 7 H=7, O2=32. Total 36+7+32=75. No, that's not 45.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the fragment is a ketone group. For example, the fragment could be a carbonyl group attached to a methyl and ethyl group. Wait, but I'm not making progress here.

Perhaps I should consider that the fragment at 45 is the result of losing a larger group. For example, if the compound is an ester, losing the RCOO- group would leave the R' group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is an allyl group. Allyl is C3H5, which has a mass of 43. Close to 45. But not quite.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is an acylium ion. Let's compute the formula for a fragment of 45. 45=12a +1b +16c.

Let me try a=2, b=5, c=2. 24 +5 +32=61. No.

a=3, b=3, c=1 →36+3+16=55. No.

a=1, b=23, c=2 →12 +23 +32=67. No.

Hmm, this is tough. Maybe the fragment is a ketone, like (CH3)CO+. That's 43. But the fragment is 45, so maybe it's (CH3)COH+ which would be 45? Let's see: CH3COH is 46 (12*2 + 1*4 +16 +1=24+4+16+1=45). Oh! That adds up. So the fragment would be CH3COH+, which is 45.

So the fragment is CH3COH+. What does that imply about the structure? It suggests that the molecule has a CH3COH group. Wait, but that's an acetate group attached to a hydrogen? Or perhaps it's a ketone with a hydroxyl group nearby.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a ketone alcohol group. Like, if the molecule has a CH3CO-OH group, but that's not possible because that would be a hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, but if the molecule has a CH3CO-O-R group, then losing R-O- would leave CH3COO+, which is 60. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a diol ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCO-O-R, and upon fragmentation, the R group is lost, leaving CH2=CHCOO+ which is 74 (12*3 +4*1 +16*2=36+4+32=72. Hmm, not 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with a substituent that can fragment. For example, cyclohexene with an ester group. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: the presence of a broad O-H in IR and a carbonyl suggests either a carboxylic acid or an alcohol with an ester. If it's a carboxylic acid, the formula must have at least two O's, which options A and C have.

But the NMR shows vinyl H's, which suggests a double bond. So, putting it all together, the structure is likely an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid or ester.

Wait, but wait. If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad, the C=O around 1700, and the C=C around 1650. The NMR would show the vinyl H's. So the formula would have to be C6H10O2 (option C), because a carboxylic acid would have the formula RCOOH, which is CnH2nO2.

So for n=3, RCOOH is C3H6O2, but our options are larger. So perhaps it's a larger molecule, like a substituted acrylic acid.

Wait, but option C is C6H10O2. So the structure could be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH, but that would be C6H10O3, which is not an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted ester. For example, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2. No, that doesn't make sense as a formula.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. That would be C5H8O2, which is not an option either.

Hmm, maybe the structure is more like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2OCH3. No, that's too many O's.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try to go through each option and see which fits all the data.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation 1. Must have a double bond (since vinyl H's are present). So the structure would be a chain with a double bond and an ester group. But then, the O's would be from the ester (two O's). But where is the O-H? Unless there's an alcohol group as well, which would require three O's. Wait, no, because option A has only two O's. So if the structure is an ester and an alcohol, that would require three O's, which isn't possible here. So option A doesn't fit because it can't have both an ester and an O-H group.

Option B: C6H10O. Only one O. Can't have both an O-H and a carbonyl, so this is unlikely.

Option C: C6H10O2. Two O's. Could be an ester and an O-H. So, for example, a structure like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH. Wait, but that formula would have three O's (COO and OH). Oh, wait, no. Let me compute:

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH: each O in COO is two O's, and the OH is another O. So total three O's. But option C has two O's. So that's not possible. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond and an O-H. But a lactone is an ester, which uses two O's. So the O-H would require a third O, which isn't possible in option C. Wait, no, the lactone is R-O-CO-O-R', but that's not correct. Actually, a lactone is a cyclic ester, which would have two O's. So if the structure is a lactone with a double bond and an O-H group, that would require three O's, which isn't possible for option C.

Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees of unsaturation 1. So either a ring or a double bond. The NMR shows a double bond, so the structure would have a double bond. But where is the O-H? Only one O, so it must be an alcohol. But the IR shows a carbonyl, which requires an O. So this doesn't fit because one O can't be both a carbonyl and an O-H. So option D is unlikely.

So, the only plausible options are A and C.

Wait, option C is C6H10O2. Let me think of a structure that fits. Maybe a di-substituted ester with a double bond and an O-H. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OCH3. No, that's too many O's.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an ester with a hydroxyl group and a double bond elsewhere. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: the compound could be a beta-keto ester, which has the structure RCOCOR'. Beta-keto esters have two carbonyl groups. But the IR only shows one strong peak at 1700, so maybe not.

Alternatively, the compound could be a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester linkage and a double bond. In that case, the O's would be two (from ester), which fits option C. The double bond would account for one degree of unsaturation, and the ring for the other, totaling two degrees.

The FTIR would show the ester's carbonyl (~1700) and the C=C (~1650, conjugated). The O-H would come from where? Wait, in a lactone, there's no O-H. So that's a problem. Unless there's another hydroxyl group in the structure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a diol ester with a double bond. For example, a molecule with two hydroxyl groups and an ester group, along with a double bond. But that would require more O's than allowed.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should make a decision based on the data I have.

The key points:

- O-H present (broad peak)
- C=O present (1700)
- C=C present (1650, maybe conjugated)
- Vinyl H's in NMR
- Fragment at 45 in MS

From the options, only C6H10O2 (option C) has two O's, which would allow for an ester and an O-H group. The degrees of unsaturation (two) fit a ring and a double bond or two double bonds.

The mass fragment of 45 suggests a small fragment, possibly CH3COH+ (45). So if the structure has a CH3COH group, that would fit.

So putting it all together, the formula is C6H10O2 (option C).


The problem involves identifying the molecular formula of an unknown compound based on FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry data. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **FTIR Data**:
   - A **broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of an O-H group (likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid).
   - A **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** indicates a carbonyl group (C=O), likely from an ester or carboxylic acid.
   - A **peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** suggests a conjugated C=C bond, likely from an alkene.

2. **¹H NMR Data**:
   - Peaks corresponding to **vinyl hydrogens** confirm the presence of a double bond in the structure.

3. **Mass Spectrometry Data**:
   - A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** suggests a small fragment, possibly CH₃COH⁺ (acetamide ion), which has a mass of 45.

4. **Molecular Formula Options**:
   - **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**: Molecular weight = 116, degrees of unsaturation = 1. This formula allows for either a ring or a double bond. However, the presence of vinyl hydrogens (indicating a double bond) and the need for an O-H group make this option less likely, as it would require two degrees of unsaturation (one for the double bond and one for the ester carbonyl).
   - **B) C₆H₁₀O**: Molecular weight = 98, degrees of unsaturation = 2. This formula has only one oxygen, which is insufficient to account for both the O-H and carbonyl groups. Thus, this option is unlikely.
   - **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**: Molecular weight = 114, degrees of unsaturation = 2. This formula allows for two degrees of unsaturation, such as a double bond and a ring. It also has two oxygens, which can account for both the O-H and carbonyl groups. This option fits the data well.
   - **D) C₆H₁₂O**: Molecular weight = 100, degrees of unsaturation = 1. Similar to option A, this formula allows for only one degree of unsaturation, which is insufficient to account for both the double bond and the carbonyl group.

### Conclusion:
The compound must have two oxygens to satisfy the presence of both the O-H and carbonyl groups, as well as two degrees of unsaturation to account for the double bond and either another double bond or a ring. Among the options, **C₆H₁₀O₂** (option C) best fits the spectroscopic data, including the fragment peak at m/z = 45, which corresponds to CH₃COH⁺.
