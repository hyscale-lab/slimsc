Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. Let's see what the reactions are.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's an addition reaction. Oh wait, that's the nucleophilic addition. But wait, ketones typically undergo nucleophilic addition when they have an alpha position that's accessible, right?

So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, which is a source of CN- ions, the cyanide ion would attack the carbonyl carbon. But wait, where? In a ketone, the carbonyl is in the middle. So the addition would happen, and then maybe some kind of proton shift happens. But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure out.

The product structure: it's a nitrile (CN) attached to a carbon that has two methyl groups and a hydroxyl group. So the structure is (CH(CH3)2)OH-C≡N. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. When NaCN adds, the cyanide adds to the carbonyl, making a cyanohydrin. The general product of a ketone with HCN (or CN-) is a cyanohydrin, which has an alcohol and a nitrile group on adjacent carbons.

So the product from butan-2-one and NaCN would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butan-2-one is four carbons, so the product would have four carbons as well. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That would be:

CH2-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but butanenitrile would be four carbons with a nitrile. Alternatively, maybe the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Let me see: butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, but wait: (CH3)2C(OH)CN would have four carbons in the chain, right? So it's correct.

So the first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. But wait, I thought that the formation of a cyanohydrin usually requires an acid catalyst. Because the addition of HCN (which is a source of CN-) is often done under acidic conditions. So in this case, NaCN is in the presence of something. Oh wait, the reagent A is added. So if the reaction is in aqueous solution, maybe it's done with an acid.

So for the first reaction, reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+ (which is H+ from HCl, or another acid). Because in the formation of cyanohydrin, the carbonyl oxygen is protonated to activate it for nucleophilic attack.

So the first part, A is H3O+ or another acid. Looking at the options, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3 in options A and C.

Wait, what's NaHSO3? That's sodium bisulfite. Oh, that's used in the reduction of certain groups, like in the hydroxyboration or in some other reactions. Or maybe in the addition with carbonyl groups, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, bisulfite can act as a mild reducing agent, but that's in the context of something else.

Wait, the first step is an acid-catalyzed addition of CN- to a ketone. So the reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+ (which is option A or B).

So moving to the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B in the presence of H2O to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid.

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. What are the conditions for that? Well, typically, nitriles are hydrolyzed with strong acids, like HCl, in the presence of water, and heat. Or sometimes with other reagents, like H2SO4 and H2O, but I think for the conversion to a carboxylic acid, the conditions are acidic hydrolysis.

Wait, but another possibility is using a base. Oh wait, no, for nitrile to carboxylic acid, two main methods: acidic conditions (like H2SO4 and H2O, heat) or using a strong base like NaOH and then acidifying. But in the presence of H2O, the reagent B is likely something that provides an acidic environment.

Looking at the product, it's a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile (CN) is converted into COOH. So the reaction is nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.

The conditions for this are either a strong acid (like HCl) with heat and water, or perhaps a base followed by acid work-up. But in the reaction, the reagent B is used with H2O. So if it's H2O and B, then B must be an acid, like HCl, or maybe another acid.

Wait, for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid, you typically need a strong acid and heat. For example, using concentrated HCl with water and heating. So B would be HCl.

Looking at the options, let's see. The options for B are HCl (option A) or CH3COOH (option B and D). CH3COOH is acetic acid, a weak acid. While HCl is a strong acid.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. Another way to hydrolyze nitriles is using a base, like sodium hydroxide, and then acidifying. But in that case, the reagent would be a base, but the problem says the reagent is B and H2O. So if B is HCl, that's an acid.

So putting it together, the second reaction uses HCl (B = HCl) as reagent.

Wait, but let me make sure. Alternative way: another method is using a silver salt, like AgNO3 in aq. HNO3, but that's for making amides or something else. No, the standard hydrolysis to carboxylic acid is acid or base conditions with water.

So if the reagent is B, and it's used with H2O, then B should be HCl. Because in the options, option A has B=HCl, and option C has B=HCl. So looking back at the first part, for the first reaction, reagent A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, what's the role of reagent A in the first reaction? The first reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. As I thought before, for the addition of CN- to a ketone, acid catalysis is needed. So A is an acid. So options A and B have A as H3O+, options C and D have A as NaHSO3.

Wait, does NaHSO3 act as an acid? NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. It can act as a source of H+ in solution, but it's a weaker acid than H3O+ (which is from HCl, H2SO4, etc.), so it can provide H+ ions. So in the first reaction, if A is NaHSO3, the solution would be acidic because of the H+ from the bisulfite.

But is that sufficient for the addition reaction? I think that in the formation of the cyanohydrin, the reaction is typically done with an acid catalyst like HCl or H2SO4. So if the reagent A is H3O+, that's a stronger acid, which would be more effective.

So for the first reaction, A should be H3O+. Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+.

Now, the second reaction's reagent B is HCl (as per earlier reasoning), which is option A (B=HCl) or option C (B=HCl). But option A's B is HCl. So let's see:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.

But from the first reaction, we think A should be H3O+.

So in that case, looking at the options, the first part is A=H3O+ (so options A or B). The second part is B=HCl (so options A or C).

So the only option that satisfies both is option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but let me double-check. Option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Is there any other possibility? Let me think about the second reaction again. Alternatively, perhaps for the second reaction, when you have a nitrile and you add H2O with B, maybe it's not acid hydrolysis but another condition.

Wait, another thought: maybe B is a base. But the product is a carboxylic acid. If you have a base, the nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylate, and then you add H+ to get the acid. But in that case, the reagents would be a base and then acid. But in this question, the reagent B is used with H2O, and the product is the acid. So perhaps the reaction is done under acidic conditions.

So then B is HCl, which is a strong acid. Therefore, the correct option is A.

Wait, but another possibility: Maybe the first reaction uses NaHSO3. Does NaHSO3 act as an acid for the cyanohydrin formation? I think so because NaHSO3 is a source of H+.

So if A is NaHSO3, the solution would be acidic. Then, reaction one would proceed as the cyanide ion would attack the carbonyl, and the H+ from NaHSO3 would protonate the oxygen.

But would H3O+ be a better acid? Maybe, but NaHSO3 is a weaker acid. But perhaps it's sufficient.

Wait, but I'm not sure if NaHSO3 is commonly used as the acid catalyst in such reactions. I think the more common catalysts are HCl or H2SO4. So perhaps reagent A is H3O+.

So, putting it together, the first reaction requires acid (H3O+), and the second requires HCl. So the correct option is A.


The problem involves determining the correct reagents for two reactions:

1. **Reaction 1**: Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone, forming a cyanohydrin. For this reaction to proceed, an acid catalyst is required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for this purpose.

2. **Reaction 2**: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B in the presence of H₂O to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Such hydrolysis typically requires strong acidic conditions, such as those provided by HCl, to facilitate the reaction.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  This satisfies both reactions. H₃O⁺ is suitable for the acid-catalyzed formation of the cyanohydrin in Reaction 1, and HCl provides the strong acidic conditions needed for the nitrile hydrolysis in Reaction 2.

- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  While H₃O⁺ is suitable for Reaction 1, CH₃COOH (a weak acid) is not strong enough to effectively hydrolyze the nitrile group in Reaction 2.

- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  NaHSO₃ (sodium bisulfite) can act as a mild acid, but it is less commonly used for the formation of cyanohydrins compared to stronger acids like H₃O⁺. While HCl is suitable for Reaction 2, this option is less ideal for Reaction 1.

- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  Similar to Option C, NaHSO₃ is not the best choice for Reaction 1, and CH₃COOH is insufficient for Reaction 2.

### Conclusion:
The most suitable reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, as provided in **Option A**.
