Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem states that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, first, I need to normalize this state because the question says it's proportional, not normalized.

Wait, right. The normalization factor is found by taking the inner product of the state with itself and then taking the square root. So, the state is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are orthonormal, so their inner product is zero. So the norm squared is just the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

So the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). Let me compute their magnitudes squared.

The coefficient for |up> is (1+i). The magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because |a + ib|^2 is a² + b².

The coefficient for |down> is (2 - i). The magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the total norm squared is 2 +5=7. So the norm is sqrt(7). Therefore, the normalized state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7). 

Next part: the operator whose matrix representation has elements A_ij where A_i j = hbar/2 if i !=j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out.

The operator has diagonal elements zero (since when i=j, A_ij=0) and off-diagonal elements hbar/2. So the matrix is:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0     ]

Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix. But wait, the operator is in the same basis as |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of S_z. So this operator must be a spin operator in the x or y direction, perhaps? Wait, S_x and S_y have similar structures but with different signs. Let me think: S_x is (ħ/2)[[0,1],[1,0]], S_y is (ħ/2)[[0,-i],[i,0]]. Hmm, but the given matrix is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, which is S_x multiplied by 2/ħ. Wait, no: the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so S_x is (ħ/2) * X. So the given matrix is (ħ/2) times the X matrix, so it's actually S_x itself!

Wait, wait. The given matrix A has A_ij = ħ/2 when i != j. So for 2x2, that would be:

[[0, ħ/2],
 [ħ/2, 0]]

Which is exactly the same as S_x, right? Because S_x is (ħ/2)(σ_x), where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix. So yep, this operator A is the spin-x operator S_x.

Wait, but am I sure? Let me think again. The Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So S_x = (ħ/2) σ_x. So yes, our operator A is indeed S_x. So the operator we're dealing with is the spin in the x-direction.

So the question is: when we measure the operator A (which is S_x), what are the probabilities of getting each eigenvalue, and what is the average value.

Wait, no, wait. The eigenstates of S_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. So to find the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue (like +ħ/2 or -ħ/2), we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of S_x and then find the square of the coefficients.

Alternatively, since S_x is represented by the given matrix, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So the probabilities are the square of the projection of |alpha> onto each eigenstate.

Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value directly using the given state and the operator, but the question also asks for the probabilities of each eigenstate. So let's proceed step by step.

First, let me note that the eigenstates of S_x are |+x> = (|up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2), multiplied by some phase factors? Wait, S_x is (ħ/2)[|up><down| + |down><up|]. So the eigenstates would actually be symmetric and antisymmetric combinations.

Wait, the general approach for finding eigenstates of S_x is as follows.

S_x |ψ> = (ħ/2) ( |down><up| + |up><down| ) |ψ> 

We can find the eigenstates by solving (S_x - λ I) |ψ> = 0.

The eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, as mentioned.

The eigenvectors, for +ħ/2:

Let me denote |+x> = a |up> + b |down>
Then, S_x |+x> = (ħ/2) ( |down> + |up> ) = (ħ/2) (a |down><up| + b |up><down| ) ? Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the matrix equation.

The matrix of S_x is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

So for eigenvalue +ħ/2, we have (S_x - (ħ/2) I ) |v> = 0.

So the matrix becomes:

[ -ħ/2,   ħ/2 ]
[  ħ/2, -ħ/2 ]

Which gives the equations:

(-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1,1), which translates to |+x> = (|up> + |down>) / sqrt(2). Wait, but let's check the normalization: the length squared is |1|^2 + |1|^2 =2, so we divide by sqrt(2). So |+x> = (|up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2).

Similarly, for eigenvalue -ħ/2, the eigenvector is (1, -1), so |-x> = (|up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait: when I did (S_x - (ħ/2) I), the matrix entries are (0 - ħ/2, ħ/2) and (ħ/2, 0 - ħ/2), which gives [ [ -ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, -ħ/2 ] ]

The equations are:

(-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → -v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = v1.

Similarly, the second equation is the same: v2 = v1. So the eigenvectors are multiples of (1,1), which is |+x>, normalized. 

So, to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>, and then the square of the coefficients will be the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and |-x> to get the respective amplitudes.

Wait, that's probably a good approach.

So, let me write |alpha> as ( (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ) / sqrt(7).

And |+x> is (|up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2).

Similarly, |-x> is (|up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2).

So the amplitude for |+x> is < +x | alpha >.

Compute < +x | alpha > = [1/sqrt(2)] [<up| + <down|] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) )

So this equals [1/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) ) ] * [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2-i) <down|up> + (1+i) <up|down> + (2-i) <down|down> ]

Since <up|up>=1, <down|down>=1, and <up|down>=0, <down|up>=0.

So it simplifies to [1/(sqrt(14)) ) ] * [ (1+i) *1 + (2-i)*0 + (1+i)*0 + (2-i)*1 ]

So that's [1/(sqrt(14)) ) ] * (1+i + 2 -i )

Simplify numerator: (1 + 2) + (i - i) = 3 + 0 =3.

So < +x | alpha > = 3 / sqrt(14 )

The probability is the square of the magnitude: |3/sqrt(14)|^2 =9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, compute < -x | alpha >.

| -x> is (|up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2).

So < -x | alpha > is [1/sqrt(2) ] [ <up| - <down| ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

So same expansion:

[1/(sqrt(14)) ] [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2-i) <down|up> - (1+i) <up|down> - (2 -i) <down|down> ]

Again, cross terms vanish.

So compute:

(1+i)(1) + (2 -i)(0) - (1+i)(0) - (2-i)(1) 

Which is (1+i) - (2 -i) = [1 -2] + [i +i ] = (-1) + 2i.

So the amplitude is [ (-1 + 2i ) ] / sqrt(14 )

The probability is | (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14) |^2.

Compute denominator: 14.

Numerator: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5.

So probability is 5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, but wait: 9/14 is about 0.6428, and 5/14 is about 0.3571. Those add up to 14/14 =1. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait, that's the probability for +x and -x. But the question is asking for probabilities of measuring each eigenstate of the operator, which is S_x. So the two possible outcomes are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, with probabilities 9/14 and 5/14, respectively.

Wait, but looking at the options, the first number in each option is 0.64, which is approximately 9/14 (since 9 ÷14 is ≈0.6428). The second number is 5/14 ≈0.357, which rounds to 0.36. So the first part of the answer would be probabilities 9/14 ≈0.64 and 5/14 ≈0.36.

Now, what about the average value of the operator? The expectation value <A> is the expectation value of S_x, which is <alpha| S_x |alpha>.

Alternatively, since S_x is the operator, we can compute <S_x> = sum (prob_i * eigenvalue_i), which is (9/14)(+ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2).

Compute this: [9/14 * ħ/2 ] - [5/14 * ħ/2 ] = [ (9-5)/14 ] * ħ/2 = (4/14) * ħ/2 = (2/7) * ħ/2 = ħ/7.

Wait, that's interesting. So the average value is ħ/7.

Let me check that another way. Compute <alpha| S_x |alpha>.

S_x is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So |alpha> is ( (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ) / sqrt(7).

The bra is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ].

So matrix representation: S_x = [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]

Compute <alpha| Sx |alpha> = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ] * Sx * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7); (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]

Wait, wait, let me do this step by step.

First, compute Sx * |alpha>:

Sx |alpha> = (ħ/2) [ [0 1; 1 0] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7); (2-i)/sqrt(7) ] ]

So the product of the matrix and the vector is:

[ (0*(1+i) + 1*(2 - i)) / sqrt(7),
  (1*(1+i) + 0*(2 - i)) / sqrt(7) ]

So that's [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ].

Multiply by (ħ/2):

So Sx |alpha> = (ħ/2) [ (2 -i)|down> + (1 +i)|up> ] / sqrt(7).

Then, compute the inner product with <alpha|:

<alpha| Sx |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1 -i), (2 +i) ] * (ħ/2) [ (2 -i)|down> + (1 +i)|up> ] / sqrt(7)

Wait, wait, perhaps it's easier to compute using vectors.

Let me denote u = ( (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2−i)/sqrt(7) )^T.

Then, S_x is the 2x2 matrix [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]

So S_x * u = (ħ/2) * [ (0*(1+i) + 1*(2−i)) / sqrt(7), (1*(1+i) + 0*(2−i) ) / sqrt(7) ]

Which gives (ħ/2) [ (2−i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ].

Now, the inner product u^† (S_x u):

u^† is [ (1−i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ]

So the product is:

(1−i)/sqrt(7) * (2−i)/sqrt(7) * ħ/2 + (2+i)/sqrt(7) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) * ħ/2.

Factor out (ħ/(2*7)) [ (1−i)(2−i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ]

Compute each term:

(1−i)(2−i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)(-i)
= 2 −i −2i + i²
= 2 −3i −1 (since i² = -1)
= 1 −3i

(2+i)(1+i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i
= 2 +2i +i +i²
= 2 +3i −1
= 1 +3i

Adding these together: (1−3i) + (1+3i )= 2.

So the expectation value is (ħ/(2*7)) * 2 = ħ/(7)

So yes, same result as before. The average value is ħ/7.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and ħ/7. That looks to match.

Option B: 0.54, 0.46, 3ħ/sqrt(7). Not matching.

Option C: 0.28, 0.72, ħ/sqrt(7). No, our probabilities are higher and lower.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29, etc. No.

Wait, but wait, the probabilities I found were 9/14 and 5/14. 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is 0.36. So option A has the correct probabilities and average.

So the correct answer should be option A: 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7.


To solve the problem, we start with the given state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The first step is to normalize this state. The norm squared is calculated as the sum of the magnitudes squared of the coefficients:

- For (1+i), the magnitude squared is \( |1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2 \).
- For (2-i), the magnitude squared is \( |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5 \).

Thus, the total norm squared is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \), and the norm is \( \sqrt{7} \). The normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Next, the operator \( A \) is given with matrix elements \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. This corresponds to the spin-x operator \( S_x \), whose eigenstates are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \), with eigenvalues \( +\frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we compute the inner products \( \langle +x|\alpha\rangle \) and \( \langle -x|\alpha\rangle \):

1. For \( \langle +x|\alpha\rangle \):
   \[
   \langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (1+i) \langle \uparrow|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i) \langle \downarrow|\uparrow\rangle + (1+i) \langle \uparrow|\downarrow\rangle + (2-i) \langle \downarrow|\downarrow\rangle \right].
   \]
   Using orthonormality (\( \langle \uparrow|\uparrow\rangle = \langle \downarrow|\downarrow\rangle = 1 \), \( \langle \uparrow|\downarrow\rangle = \langle \downarrow|\uparrow\rangle = 0 \)), this simplifies to:
   \[
   \langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ (1+i) + (2-i) \right] = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
   \]
   The probability is \( \left| \langle +x|\alpha\rangle \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64 \).

2. For \( \langle -x|\alpha\rangle \):
   \[
   \langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (1+i) \langle \uparrow|\uparrow\rangle - (2-i) \langle \downarrow|\uparrow\rangle - (1+i) \langle \uparrow|\downarrow\rangle + (2-i) \langle \downarrow|\downarrow\rangle \right].
   \]
   Simplifying using orthonormality:
   \[
   \langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ (1+i) - (2-i) \right] = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
   \]
   The probability is \( \left| \langle -x|\alpha\rangle \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36 \).

Finally, the average value of the operator \( A \) (or \( S_x \)) is computed as:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha| A |\alpha\rangle = \frac{9}{14} \left(+\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) + \frac{5}{14} \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Comparing with the options:
- Option A matches the probabilities \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
