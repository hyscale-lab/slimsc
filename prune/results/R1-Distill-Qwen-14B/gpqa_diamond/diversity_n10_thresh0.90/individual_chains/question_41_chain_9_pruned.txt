Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me read it again.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the lab? The speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

The options are A to D. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Alright, so I remember from my studies that when a medium is moving, the speed of light within it can change from the perspective of an observer. But wait, isn't the speed of light in a medium v = c/n? Oh right, that's the standard formula. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the medium, I think.

But here, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So how does that affect the speed of the light as observed in the lab? Hmm. I think this is a problem involving special relativity because we're dealing with velocities of objects relative to each other, and light is involved.

Wait, but how does the motion of the medium affect the speed of light within it? I recall that in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, but that's in a vacuum. What about in a medium?

Oh wait, this is a tricky point. Because in a medium, the speed of light is c/n in the medium's rest frame. But when the medium is moving, how does that affect the speed measured in the lab frame?

Wait, maybe I should think about this step by step. Let's denote the speed of light in the glass as u in the medium's rest frame, which is u = c/n. But when the medium is moving with velocity v relative to the lab, what's the observed speed of the light beam?

Wait, but the problem says the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going in that same direction.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the frame transformations. Maybe I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The velocity addition formula in special relativity is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/cÂ²), where u is the velocity of the object in the medium's frame, and v is the velocity of the medium
