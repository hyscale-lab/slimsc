Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to break it down. Hmm. The question involves finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. Let's see.

The state of the electron is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, since it's proportional, I need to normalize it first. Right, because the probabilities must sum to 1.

So first, I'll calculate the normalization factor. The state is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are orthonormal. So the norm squared is |1+i|² + |2 - i|².

Calculating each magnitude squared:

|1+i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +1= 2.

|2 -i|² = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

Adding them: 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> all divided by sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the operator whose matrix representation is A with elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, 0 otherwise. Wait, so for a 2x2 matrix, that would mean the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix looks like:
[ 0   (hbar/2) ]
[ (hbar/2)  0 ]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, no. Wait, A is a 2x2 matrix. Let me think. The indices i and j run from 1 to 2.

So A_11 is 0, A_12 is hbar/2. A_21 is hbar/2, A_22 is 0. So the matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

Wait, but wait, what's the operator doing? Oh right, since the operator is given in the basis of |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of S_z. So the operator probably is some spin component operator, maybe S_x or something else.

Wait, but the operator's matrix is such that it's off-diagonal in the z-basis. So this could be related to S_x, which has such a matrix. But let me not get confused. The operator's eigenstates are the ones we're measuring, so I need to find the eigenstates of this operator A.

Alternatively, maybe the eigenstates of A are the same as those of S_x, since S_x has the same matrix form. But let me think again. The question says, "the operator whose matrix representation is given by the elements Aij..." So A is a 2x2 matrix with zero diagonals and hbar/2 off-diagonal. So the matrix is: 

[[0, hbar/2],
 [hbar/2, 0]]

Wait, but another way to write that is (hbar/2)(|up><down| + |down><up|). Which is the same as (hbar/2)(|+><-| + |-><+| ), which is the same as S_x for spin-1/2 particles. Because S_x is (ħ/2)(|up><down| + |down><up|).

So operator A is S_x. Or wait, the operator could be something else, but in any case, the eigenstates will have certain probabilities.

Wait, but the question isn't about measuring in the z-basis. It's about measuring in the eigenstates of A. So first, I need to find the eigenstates of operator A.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenstates of the matrix A, so that when we express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates, the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes.

So, let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.

The matrix A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. Let me set ħ = hbar for simplicity.

So the matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

To find eigenvalues, compute the characteristic equation: det(A - λI) =0.

So determinant is ( -λ)( -λ ) - (ħ/2)^2 = λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0.

So λ² = ħ²/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

Ah, so the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

Now, the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

For λ= ħ/2:

(A - (ħ/2)I) v =0.

Matrix becomes [[-ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -ħ/2]].

The equations are:

(-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → -v1 +v2=0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvector can be any scalar multiple of (1,1). So normalized, that would be (1/sqrt(2))(1,1) → (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, for λ= -ħ/2:

Matrix becomes [[ ħ/2, ħ/2], [ ħ/2, ħ/2 ].

Equations: (ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → v1 +v2=0 → v2= -v1.

So the eigenvector is (1, -1), normalized as (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So the eigenstates of A are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So when we measure the operator A, the possible outcomes are ± ħ/2, and the probabilities depend on how |alpha> is expressed in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

So now, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

Wait, |alpha> is ( (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ) / sqrt(7).

Let me compute the coefficients of |+x> and |−x> in |alpha>.

Express |alpha> = a |+x> + b |−x>.

We can write:

|alpha> = a [ (|up> + |down> )/sqrt(2) ] + b [ (|up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2) ]

Combine terms:

= [a + b]/sqrt(2) |up> + [a - b]/sqrt(2) |down>.

Set this equal to (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So, equating coefficients:

[ a + b ] / sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
[ a - b ] / sqrt(2) = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

So we have two equations:

1. a + b = (1+i)/sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)
2. a - b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)

Let me compute the right-hand sides.

sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = sqrt(2/7). Let me keep it as is for now.

So,

Equation 1: a + b = (1+i) * sqrt(2/7)
Equation 2: a - b = (2 -i) * sqrt(2/7)

Now, adding equations 1 and 2:

2a = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7) → (3) * sqrt(2/7)
So a = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) = 3 sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)) )

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

2b = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7) → ( (1-2) + (i + i) ) → (-1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2/7)
So b = (-1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2/7) / 2 → [ (-1 + 2i ) ] * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) )

Wait, that's a bit messy. Let me compute a and b numerically.

But perhaps we can compute |a|^2 and |b|^2, since those are the probabilities.

|a|^2 is (3)^2 * (2)/(14) ) = 9 * 2 /14 → 18/14 = 9/7? Wait, no.

Wait, a is (3) * sqrt(2 / 7) / 2.

So a = 3/(2) * sqrt(2/7) → sqrt(2/7) is sqrt(2)/sqrt(7), so a = 3 sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)).

The magnitude squared |a|^2 is [9 * 2 ] / (4 * 7 ) → 18/(28) → 9/14.

Similarly, |b|^2 is [ ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) ] * (2/7) ) /4 ?

Wait, let me compute it properly.

b = [ (-1 + 2i ) ] * sqrt(2/(7*4)) ) → because sqrt(2/7) is divided by 2, so sqrt(2/7)/2 is sqrt(2/(7*4)).

Alternatively, let me compute |b|^2 directly from the expression.

b = [ (-1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2/7) ] / 2.

So |b|^2 = [ ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) * (2/7) ] /4.

Because | (a + ib) |^2 = a² + b².

So [ (1 +4 ) * (2/7) ] /4 = (5 * 2/7 ) /4 = (10/7 ) /4 = 10/(7*4) )=10/28 =5/14.

Wait, let's compute that again.

Wait, |b|^2 = [ (-1 + 2i) ] multiplied by sqrt(2/7) divided by 2.

So |b|^2 = [ ( (-1 + 2i) ) sqrt(2/7) / 2 ] * [ ( (-1 - 2i) ) sqrt(2/7) / 2 ].

Multiply the terms:

= [ ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) ) * (2/7) ) ] / (4 )

Because (sqrt(2/7))^2 is 2/7, and 1/2 *1/2 is 1/4.

So numerator: (1 +4 ) =5. So 5 * (2/7) ) = 10/7.

Then divided by 4: (10/7)/4 = 10/(28) =5/14.

So |a|^2=9/14 and |b|^2=5/14? Wait, wait, wait. Because 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1, which makes sense.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, |a|^2 is 9/14, |b|^2 is5/14. So the probabilities of measuring +ħ/2 is 9/14 and -ħ/2 is 5/14.

Wait, but looking at the options: the probabilities given are 0.64, 0.36, which would be 16/25 and 9/25. 9/14 is about 0.6428... which is approximately 0.64. 5/14 is about 0.357, which is close to 0.36. So perhaps that's option A, but let me check the options.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. So that matches the probabilities I have.

But wait, the average value is the expectation value of A. Let me calculate that.

The expectation value <A> is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities.

So <A> = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = [ (9/14 -5/14) ] (ħ/2) )= (4/14)(ħ/2 ) = (2/7)(ħ/2 )= ħ/(7).

So the average is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 (9/14 ≈ 0.6428) and 0.357 (5/14 ≈ 0.357), which rounds to 0.36 as in option A. And the average is hbar/7.

Wait, but option A says the average is hbar/7. So that matches.

But wait, let's check the other options. Option D has average 2hbar/sqrt(7), which is approximately 2*1.732/2.645 ≈ (3.464)/2.645≈ 1.31, which is much larger than hbar/7≈0.142 hbar.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the expectation value.

Because the operator A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]], and the expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

But perhaps it's easier to compute it directly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute <A> using the original state |alpha> without changing the basis.

Because earlier, I found that |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> all over sqrt(7).

So let me compute <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Expressed as a vector, |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Multiplying A by |alpha>: A |alpha> = [ (0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (ħ/2)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ), ( (ħ/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ].

So A|alpha> = [ ( (ħ/2)(2 -i) ) / sqrt(7), ( (ħ/2)(1+i) ) / sqrt(7) ]

Then <A> is the conjugate of |alpha> multiplied by A|alpha>.

Wait, so <alpha| is [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

So the inner product is:

[ (1 - i)/sqrt(7)  (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ ( (ħ/2)(2 -i) ) / sqrt(7), ( (ħ/2)(1+i) ) / sqrt(7) ]

= (1 - i)(2 -i) (ħ/2) /7 + (2 +i)(1 +i) (ħ/2) /7.

Let me compute each term.

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i) = 2(1) + (1)(-i) -2i (i) + (-i)(-i)

Wait, let me multiply it properly.

(1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) -i*2 + (-i)(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i²
= 2 -3i + (-1) [since i²=-1]
= (2-1) -3i
= 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i
= 2 + 2i +i +i²
= 2 +3i -1
= (2-1) +3i
= 1 +3i.

So putting it together:

[ (1 -3i) + (1+3i) ] * (ħ/2) /7
= [2 ] * (ħ/2) /7
= (2 * ħ/2 ) /7
= ħ /7.

Which matches what I found earlier.

So the average value is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.357.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, and average ħ/7. So that fits.

Wait, but another option, option D, has probabilities 0.61 and 0.29. That's about 0.61, which is around 8.5/14, but 61/100 is 61%, which is 8.54/14, which I don't think is our calculation.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 64.29%. So that's 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places.

So the correct option is A: 0.64, 0.36 and ħ/7.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option D says average 2ħ/√7. Which is about 2*1.732/2.6458≈3.464/2.6458≈1.309. But our average is ħ/7≈0.1428 ħ.

So option A is the only one matching. So the answer should be option A.


The problem involves an electron in a quantum state described by \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The normalization factor is determined by calculating the norm of the state:
\[
\| |\alpha\rangle \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), and the corresponding eigenstates are:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle \right), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

### Step 3: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)
Expanding \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the \( |+x\rangle, |-x\rangle \) basis:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = a|+x\rangle + b|-x\rangle,
\]
where:
\[
a = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad b = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
The coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) are normalized such that:
\[
|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate probabilities
The probabilities of measuring \( +\frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \) are given by \( |a|^2 \) and \( |b|^2 \), respectively:
\[
|a|^2 = \left| \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{2}{2} = 1, \quad |b|^2 = \left| \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{2}.
\]
Normalizing, the probabilities are:
\[
P(+\frac{\hbar}{2}) = \frac{|a|^2}{|a|^2 + |b|^2} = \frac{9}{14}, \quad P(-\frac{\hbar}{2}) = \frac{|b|^2}{|a|^2 + |b|^2} = \frac{5}{14}.
\]
Approximating, these probabilities are \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively.

### Step 5: Calculate the average value of \( A \)
The expectation value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]
Using the matrix representation of \( A \) and the normalized state \( |\alpha\rangle \), the calculation yields:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Step 6: Match with options
The probabilities \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), along with the average value \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \), match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
