Alright, let's see. I've got this astronomy question here. Hmm, okay, so the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance based on their parallax. I remember that parallax is related to distance, but the exact formula... wait, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/distance in parsecs. So distance r is inversely proportional to plx. So r = 1/(plx), right?

The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Wait, but I need to find how N changes with distance r. Since r is proportional to 1/plx, I can express plx in terms of r. Like, plx = 1/r. So substituting that into the expression for N.

Let me write this down. N is proportional to 1/( (1/r) )^5. Because plx is 1/r. So 1/( (1/r)^5 ) would be r^5. So N ∝ r^5. Hmm, but wait, I'm not sure if I did that right. Let me double-check.

So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and plx = 1/r. So plugging that in, 1/( (1/r)^5 ) equals r^5. So yes, N is proportional to r^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance per unit range.

Now, looking at the options, option B is ~r^5. So that should be the correct answer. But wait, maybe I should think about why it's not another option. Let's see, what's the reasoning behind the question? It's about the number density of stars as you go further away. But in reality, the number of stars you can see decreases with distance, but the question's setup is different here because the number is varying with 1/plx^5, which is a higher dependence than usual.

Wait, in reality, the number of stars per unit volume decreases with distance, but that's probably because stars are spread out. But in this problem, the setup is that N varies as 1/plx^5, so I shouldn't get confused with real-world expectations. The question is more about manipulating the exponents.

So, given that, if N = k * (1/plx)^5, and since plx = 1/r, that becomes N = k * r^5. So the number of stars increases with r^5. So the correct option is B.


The question involves determining how the number of stars in a specific region of the sky changes with distance, given that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), such that \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \) into the given relationship, we find:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5.
\]

Thus, the number of stars in the region increases with the fifth power of the distance. Among the provided options, the correct answer is \( \sim r^5 \), which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
