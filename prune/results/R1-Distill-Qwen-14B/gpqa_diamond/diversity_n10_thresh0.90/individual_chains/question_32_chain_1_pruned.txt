Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and calculating the energy of a nucleus moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

First, the question says the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Li is lithium, right? So the standard lithium has 3 protons. Adding 3 neutrons makes it Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

Wait, but in particle physics, when they talk about colliders, they often consider the ions as heavy nuclei, maybe even fully stripped, meaning they have all their electrons removed, so they're just the bare nucleus with charge Ze, where Z is the atomic number. For Li-6, Z is 3, so the charge would be 3e.

But wait, maybe I don't need that for calculating the energy. Let me think about what the question is asking. It's asking for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. So I need to find the kinetic energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96 the speed of light.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in particle physics, when we talk about the energy of a collider, it's usually the total energy, not just the kinetic. Or sometimes it's the kinetic energy... Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The problem statement is a bit ambiguous. It says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." So I think they're referring to the total energy, which includes both kinetic and rest mass energy.

So the formula for the total energy (gamma times m c squared) is what I need to calculate. Because at 0.96c, which is highly relativistic, the gamma factor will be significant.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So with v = 0.96c, let's compute that.

Calculating gamma:

v = 0.96c → v² = 0.9216 c².

1 - (v²/c²) = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 (because 0.28 squared is 0.0784). So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So 1/0.28 is approximately 3.571428... Let me calculate it more precisely. 1 divided by 0.28 is equal to 3.57142857... So gamma = 3.5714.

Now, the nucleus is Li-6, so I need to find its rest mass energy.

What's the mass of Li-6? Hmm, I remember that the mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons, but I might need
