Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let's see. The question is a bit tricky but I think I can handle it by breaking it down.

Alright, the setup: there's a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. Wait, and the glass is moving towards the observer in the lab. So the light is going through the glass which is itself moving towards us.

The question is asking, what's the speed of the light beam relative to the observer in the lab? And the options are given.

I remember that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's index of refraction. In vacuum, it's c, which is given as 1 here. So in the glass, the speed of light would normally be c/n. But wait, the glass is moving. Does the movement of the medium affect how the speed is measured?

Oh right, this is probably a problem involving special relativity concepts. Because when dealing with velocities of objects relative to each other, especially when those velocities are significant compared to the speed of light, you need to use the velocity addition formulas from special relativity.

Wait, but wait. The speed of light in the medium is c/n, correct? But when the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed? I think the key here is to consider the frame of reference.

So let's clarify. In the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n (since in the glass, it's slower than c). Now, from the lab frame, which sees the glass moving at velocity v towards the observer. Wait, but the light is also moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, because the glass is moving toward the observer, but the light is propagating through it in the same direction as the glass's motion. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the glass is moving towards the observer. So the light is going through the glass, which is moving towards the observer. So the light beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So from the lab frame, the light's speed is observed. Hmm.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The setup says the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam. So the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So both the glass and the light are moving in the same direction relative to the lab.

Wait,
