Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if their λ_max is the same, their temperatures must be the same too. Because if λ_max is same, T must be same since b is a constant.

Then, the radial velocities are given. Star_1's velocity is 0 km/s, so it's not moving towards or away from us. Star_2's velocity is 700 km/s. But wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. But the question says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, but maybe the observed wavelengths are the same because of Doppler shift. So, does that affect our calculation of their temperatures or luminosities?

Wait, but the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosities assuming the stars radiate as black bodies. So maybe the Doppler shift doesn't affect the calculation of luminosity? Because luminosity is intrinsic, but the observed flux would be affected by Doppler. Hmm, not entirely sure, but let's proceed.

The question is asking by what factor is the luminosity of Star_1 greater than Star_2. The options are all around 2.2 to 2.35, so I think the factor is around there.

Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Since both stars are considered as black bodies, this formula applies.

We know that R1 = 1.5 R2, and T1 = T2 because the peak wavelengths are the same. Oh wait, unless the Doppler shift affects the observed temperature? Hmm, because if a star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter, which would imply a higher temperature, but since the peak wavelengths are the same, maybe the Doppler shift was accounted for in determining the actual temperature. So the actual temperatures are the same.

Wait, no. The problem states that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest were the same. But because Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s, the observed wavelength would be Doppler shifted. So maybe the actual temperatures are different? Or do the astronomers correct for that?

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let's break it down.

If Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, the observed wavelength (λ_obs) would be shorter than the emitted wavelength (λ_emit). So the observed λ for Star_2 is λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ), but since v is much less than c (700 km/s is 0.0023% of the speed of light, which is about 300,000 km/s), the Doppler shift is small. So the observed λ would be a bit less than the emitted λ.

But the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So λ_obs for both stars is the same. But for Star_1, since v=0, its emitted λ is same as observed. For Star_2, the observed λ is same as Star_1's, which means that its emitted λ must be longer. Because Star_2 is moving towards us, its emitted λ is longer than observed, which is same as Star_1's. So the emitted λ for Star_2 is longer than that of Star_1? Wait, no. Wait, if Star_2 is moving towards us, the observed λ is blueshifted (shorter). So if Star_1's observed λ is λ1_emit, and Star_2's observed λ is λ2_emit * Doppler factor.

But since their observed λ's are same, λ1_emit = λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) )

So λ1_emit = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Which implies that λ2_emit is longer than λ1_emit because the Doppler factor is less than 1. Because Star_2's emitted wavelength is longer, which would imply a lower temperature because Wien's law says lambda_max is inversely proportional to T. So T2 < T1? But the problem says the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So perhaps their observed wavelengths are the same, but their actual temperatures could be different.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says that the peaks are
