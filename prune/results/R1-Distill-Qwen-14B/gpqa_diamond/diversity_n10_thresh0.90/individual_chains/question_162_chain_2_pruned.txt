Okay, so I have this question about a metric given in general relativity or differential geometry terms, and I need to find the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The metric provided is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that metrics in two dimensions can sometimes be written in terms of line elements, and in this case, it's a 2D metric because the line element is in terms of dx and dy only.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh right, pseudosphere usually refers to a surface with constant negative curvature. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, in some contexts, a pseudosphere is a surface in 3D, but this metric is only in two dimensions.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the geometry described by this metric. The metric seems to have a denominator (4 - x² - y²), which reminds me of the metric for a sphere. For a sphere of radius a, the metric in 2D could be something like (a²/(a² - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), but here it's expressed in terms of x and y, so maybe it's similar.

Let me think: if I have a metric where the line element is scaled by a function of position, that usually indicates some kind of warped geometry. The denominator here is 4 - x² - y², so that would be equivalent to 4 - r², where r is the radial coordinate. So that suggests
