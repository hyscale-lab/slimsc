Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's going on.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, I'm trying to figure out the structure from the NMR data. The reagents given are NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, followed by aqueous KOH and heat. I need to find the final product from the options.

First, let's break down the NMR data. The 1H-NMR peaks are at 9.72 (triplet, 1H), 6.98 (doublet, 2H), 6.51 (doublet, 2H), 6.27 (broad singlet, 2H), and 3.66 (doublet, 2H). 

I remember that a triplet around 9.7 ppm is usually indicative of an aldehyde proton. So, that's probably a -CHO group. The doublets around 6.98 and 6.51 suggest aromatic protons, maybe from a para-substituted benzene ring. Because the two doublets have two protons each, that makes sense for a disubstituted benzene, like two substituents in the para positions.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is a di-substituted ring where each substituent is a single group. For example, if one substituent is a nitro group and another is an aldehyde, but wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get a better idea.

Degree of unsaturation: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-10)/2=4. So four degrees of unsaturation. That could be two double bonds and two rings, or one double bond and two rings, etc. But looking at the NMR, I think there's a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and a double bond or ring elsewhere.

Wait, the aldehyde is a double bond (C=O). So that's one degree, the benzene ring is three (since it's a six-membered ring with three double bonds), but wait, benzene itself is three degrees (one ring plus three double bonds). Wait, no, wait. Each ring or double bond is one degree. So benzene is three double bonds, so three degrees. The aldehyde is another, so four. So that's accounted for the four degrees.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the carbons. The benzene ring would have six carbons. Then, if there are substituents attached, maybe two more carbons. So, maybe a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents.

Looking at the NMR peaks again. The triplet at 9.72 is the aldehyde. Then, the 6.98 and 6.51 doublets: maybe a para-substituted benzene ring. Let me think. If there was a substituent on the benzene, like another group, maybe an oxygen-containing group.

Wait, the 6.27 peak is a broad singlet integrating for 2H. Broad singlet could be an enol proton, or maybe an -OH group. But wait, if it's 2H, that's two protons. But -OH is usually a broad peak, but integrating for 1H. So perhaps it's an enol? Or maybe an -OCH2- group? Or maybe a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or ester.

The 3.66 peak is a doublet with 2H. That seems like a methylene group (CH2) next to an electronegative atom. So maybe -OCH2- or something similar.

Let me try to fit this together. We have a benzene ring with substituents. One substituent is an aldehyde group, maybe. Another substituent is a group that has an oxygen, perhaps a nitro group or an ether or a ketone.

Wait, but the molecular formula includes an N. So one of the substituents must include a nitrogen. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So, including one N. So perhaps the substituent is a nitro group (NO2)? But wait, nitro groups would have three substituents on the ring, but the formula only has one N. Wait, the nitro group has one N and two O's. So that could fit.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any peaks that I'd expect for a nitro group. Nitro protons? Wait, nitro groups don't have protons. So maybe the substituent is a nitro group, but that's not showing in the NMR data as a peak, because there are no protons. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a nitrile group, but that also doesn't have protons.

Wait another thought: maybe the substituent is an amino group (-NH2), but that might show up as a broad peak. Or perhaps it's an amide group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, considering the N is part of the substituent, perhaps a nitro group is present. Let's see, the formula is C8H9NO: so 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, 1 oxygen. So, the nitro group (NO2) has two oxygens. So if the molecule has a nitro group, that would account for the N and two O's. But the molecular formula only has one O. Wait, no, wait. The formula has O=1, but a nitro group has two O's. So that wouldn't fit. So maybe the substituent doesn't have a nitro group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a hydroxylamine group or something else. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to approach it from the reaction steps.

The reagents are:

1. NaNO2 and HCl: This is typically used for diazotization of aromatic amines. So, this first step would convert an amine group into a diazonium salt.

2. H2O: Maybe a hydrolysis step, but under what conditions? Diazonium salts can undergo various reactions, like hydrolysis to phenols, especially if the conditions are acidic or basic. Wait, with H2O, perhaps it's a simple hydrolysis, like the diazonium chloride being hydrolyzed to a phenol. Or maybe it's a replacement reaction, like the diazonium group being replaced by something else.

Wait, but then step three is aqueous KOH and heat. That could be a hydrolysis of an nitrile, but if the first steps have already involved a diazonium salt, then perhaps it's a substitution reaction. Diazonium salts can be used in various substitution reactions, like introducing a group into the ring.

Wait, but let me think about the structure. The starting material has a formula C8H9NO. So, perhaps it's a substituted benzaldehyde with some substituents.

Wait, let me think about the NMR again. The triplet at 9.72 is 1H, probably the aldehyde. Then, the two doublets at 6.98 and 6.51 (2H each) suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. So, the ring has two substituents in the para positions. One substituent is the aldehyde group. What's the other substituent?

The other substituent could be an -OCH2CHO group or something else. Wait, but the 3.66 peak is a doublet for 2H, which could be a CH2 next to an oxygen. Let me consider that perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a -OCH2CHO group.

Wait, that would make sense. So, the benzene ring would have a substituent of -OCH2CHO. Then, the structure would be something like phenyl-O-CH2-CHO.

But wait, let's count the carbons.
