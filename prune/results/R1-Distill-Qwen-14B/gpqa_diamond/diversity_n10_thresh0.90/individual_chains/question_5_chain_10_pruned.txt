Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. They've provided the components of the operator P (Px, Py, Pz) as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. The options are the possible eigenvectors, and I need to find the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are used to represent spin operators. Since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, which is the spin-up state, the eigenvector should correspond to that.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components. So the operator for the direction n would be a combination of Px, Py, and Pz. But since n is in the x-z plane, the direction is (x,z), which means the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, right? So the operator along n would be something like P_n = (P_x * x_component + P_z * z_component) ?

Wait, no, because the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane. So the operator would be P·n, where n is a unit vector. Suppose n makes an angle θ with the z-axis, so n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Oh wait wait, no, because it's in x-z plane. So only x and z components. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but the operator P is a vector operator, so P·n would be P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Wait, but each component Px, Py, Pz is given. So the operator for direction n is P_n = (n_x) P_x + (n_y) P_y + (n_z) P_z. But since n is along x-z, n_y is zero. So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But wait, what are the components of P_x, P_y, P_z? They are matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So let me write them down.

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
