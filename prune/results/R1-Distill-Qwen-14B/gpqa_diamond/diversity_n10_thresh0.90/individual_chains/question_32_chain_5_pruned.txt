Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of a certain nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons, which I think is Li-6 because lithium typically has 3 protons and if it has 3 neutrons, that sums up to 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. Li-6 is commonly used in some experiments, I recall.

The problem is asking for the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a moving object isn't just kinetic; it includes the rest mass energy as well. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. So I need to calculate gamma first.

Gamma is given by 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Here, v is 0.96c. Let me plug that in: sqrt(1 - (0.96c)^2 / c^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.96^2). 0.96 squared is 0.9216, so 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, since 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that: 1 divided by 0.28. Hmm, 0.28 times 3 is 0.84, but we need 1. 0.28 * 3.57 is approximately 1 (because 0.28 * 3 = 0.84, 0.28 * 4 = 1.12, so 3.57 gives around 1). So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.28 is 7/25, right? So 1 divided by (7/25) is 25/7, which is approximately 3.5714. Yeah, that's right.

Next, I need the mass of the nucleus. Since it's Li-6, the mass is approximately the sum of the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Wait, but the exact mass is better found using the mass of Li-6. Alternatively, I can use the atomic mass in u (atomic mass units) and convert that to GeV.

Wait, another approach: the mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 0.938 GeV/c² each. So for Li-6, which has 6 nucleons, the rest mass energy would be 6 * 0.938 GeV. Let me compute that: 6 * 0.938 is 5.628 GeV.

Wait, but wait. No, wait. The mass of a proton is about 0.938 GeV/c², same for a neutron. So each nucleon contributes around that. So for 6 nucleons, 6 * 0.938 is indeed 5.628 GeV/c². So the rest mass energy is 5.628 GeV.

Then, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by this rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m0 c². Since m0 c² is 5.628 GeV, E = 3.5714 * 5.628. Let me compute that.

First, 3 * 5.628 is 16.884. Then 0.5714 * 5.628: let's see. 0.5 *5.628 is 2.814, and 0.0714 *5.628 is approximately 0.403. So 2.814 + 0.403 is 3.217. So adding to 16.884 gives 20.101 GeV. But wait, that's an approximate calculation. Maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, compute 3.5714 *5.628 directly.

3.5714 *5 = 17.857
3.5714 *0.628 = ?

Let me compute 3.5714 *0.6 = 2.14284
3.5714 *0.028 = 0.100 (approx)
So 2.14284 + 0.100 is about 2.24284.
Adding to 17.857 gives 20.0998 GeV.

Wait, but wait, gamma is exactly 25/7, which is 3.57142857... So let's compute 25/7 * 5.628.

25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

So 25/7 * 5.628 = (25 *5.628)/7.

25 *5.628 = 140.7 GeV.

Now, 140.7 divided by 7 is 20.1 GeV.

Wait, but that's a bit off. Let me compute 25 *5.628:

5.628 *25: 5 *25=125, 0.628*25=15.7, so total is 140.7. Then 140.7 /7=20.1 exactly.

So the total energy is 20.1 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus.

Wait, Li-6's atomic mass is actually more accurately known. Let me think: the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0151 atomic mass units (u). Wait, but wait, wait. Let me check. No, actually, the precise mass might be a bit different. Alternatively, I can compute it based on the number of protons and neutrons.

Li has atomic number 3, so 3 protons, 3 neutrons (since it's Li-6). So total of 6 nucleons.

The mass of a proton is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So perhaps I should use more precise values.

So for Li-6, the mass would be 3 * (proton mass) + 3 * (neutron mass). So 3*(938.272 + 939.565) MeV/c².

Wait
