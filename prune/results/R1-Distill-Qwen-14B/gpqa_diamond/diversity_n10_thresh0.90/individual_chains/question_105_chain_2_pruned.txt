Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's read the question carefully. 

The setup is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. When the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing brightness variations that could mimic an exoplanet transit. The question is, what would be the radius of an exoplanet that would cause the same brightness change as these spots?

Hmm, right. So the key here is to compare the change in brightness (the dip in light curve) caused by the spots versus that caused by a planet passing in front of the star.

First, I think I need to calculate the relative brightness change (the dip) caused by the spots. Then, I'll set that equal to the dip caused by a planet and solve for the planet's radius relative to the star's radius.

Wait, but how do I calculate the brightness change due to spots? I remember that when a cooler region (like a spot) covers a part of the star, it dims the total light because that area emits less. The same goes when a planet transits, blocking some light. 

So, for the star with spots: the total brightness change is due to the spots being cooler. The area covered by spots is 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, the problem says a filling factor of 20%—so that's the fraction of the hemisphere's surface covered by spots. So, the area covered is 0.2 times the area of one hemisphere. But wait, a hemisphere is half the star's surface, right? So the total area covered by spots on the entire star would be 0.2 * (πR² / 2) * 2, because each hemisphere is half the surface. Wait, no, wait. No, the star has two hemispheres. If one hemisphere has 20% spots, then the total area of spots is 0.2 * (πR² / 2) = 0.2 * (πR²/2) = 0.1 π R².

Wait, no. Let me think again. The star's total surface area is 4πR². Each hemisphere is 2πR². So if one hemisphere has 20% spots, the area covered is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². But wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered, so the other isn't. So the total spot area is 0.2 × (hemisphere area) = 0.2 × 2πR² × 0.5? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, perhaps the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface that's spots. So each hemisphere's surface area is 2πR². So 20% of that is 0.2 × 2πR² = 0.4πR². But since it's only one hemisphere, the total spot area is 0.4πR².

But wait, the star is rotating, so as it spins, the spots come into view. When the
