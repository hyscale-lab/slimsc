Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to choose the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. They already found these planets using the Radial Velocity (RV) method, so they know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Hmm, so both planets have the same mass. That's interesting. But Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is much closer to its star, I guess, since a shorter orbital period usually means a closer orbit.

Wait, the host stars have different masses but the same radii. Planet_1's host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, so the more massive star isn't larger. Maybe it's a main-sequence star, but I'm not sure if that's relevant.

Transit probability depends on a few factors, right? I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to our line of sight. But since we don't know the orientation, the probability is a statistical thing based on the system's parameters.

I think the probability formula involves the size of the planet and the star, but also the size of the orbit. Oh right, the probability P is approximately (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by (a / (2R_star)), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, maybe it's just (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1 / (1 + (M_star / M_planet)^(1/3))) or something? I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no, let me think again. The transit probability is given by (R_p + R_s) / a, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, I think the simplified version is (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (1 + (M_s / M_p)^(1/3))) ), but maybe that's the impact parameter's effect. Hmm, maybe I should approach this more methodically.

The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes directly in front of the star from our point of view. The formula for the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / (R_s * (1 + (M_s / M_p)^(1/3)) )) )? Or perhaps it's more about the relative size of the orbit compared to the star's size.

Wait, I think the formula for transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / (2 R_s)), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, another source I recall says that the geometric probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (1 + (M_s / M_p)^(1/3))) ), but perhaps that's when considering the Doppler method's sensitivity.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up different concepts. Let's get back. The transit probability geometrically is the ratio of the area of the planet's orbit that is in the same plane as our line of sight. So it's more about the alignment. The probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / (2 R_s)) )? No, perhaps it's (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1/(1 + (M_s / M_p)^(1/3))) ), but that doesn't seem quite right.

Wait, I'm overcomplicating it. Another approach: The probability of a transit is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 + (M_s / M_p)^(1/3))) ), but I'm not confident. Alternatively, considering the orbital distance, the probability might depend on the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis, because for the planet to transit, its orbit has to be edge-on enough, and the distance from us must allow that alignment.

Wait, another thought: The transit probability P is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (sqrt(1 + (M_s / M_p)^(2/3)) )) ). No, maybe that's for the RV method's probability.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the formula for transit probability. Let me think again. The probability that a planet transits its star is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / (2 R_s)), but I'm probably getting this wrong.

Wait, no, another approach: the transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star, and the size of the orbit. The more distant the planet, the less likely it is to transit because the alignment has to be precise. So for a given star, a planet that's farther away has a smaller transit probability.

Wait, so the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / a). Because a larger semi-major axis makes the alignment less likely. Because the further away, the smaller the chance the planet will cross our line of sight.

Wait, but a is in the denominator. So higher a would mean lower probability.

Okay, let me try to get the exact formula. I'll try to recall. The transit probability is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a * (1 + (M_s / M_p)^(1/3)) )) )

Wait, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, I think the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)), so P = (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (R_s / a) ) = (R_p^2) / (R_s a ). 

Wait, that would make sense. Because a is the semi-major axis, and when a is large (planet is far), the probability is smaller. So P = (R_p^2) / (R_s a).

Wait, but I'm not sure if the formula is P = (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (R_s / a) ), which simplifies to R_p^2 / (R_s a ). So yes, that would make sense.

But wait, I think I'm missing a term involving the masses. Because the RV method gives us the minimum mass, but when considering the inclination, we can get the actual mass. Oh, but in this case, since the planets have the same mass, maybe that cancels out.

Wait, perhaps the formula is more complicated. Let me look for another approach. Another source says that the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (1 + (M_s / M_p)^(1/3)) ), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / (R_s (1 + sqrt(1 + (M_s / M_p)^(2/3)) )) )) ), but that's getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the relative sizes. Let me get the given data:

- Both planets have same mass (M_p1 = M_p2).

- Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So P1 = P2 /3.

- Host stars have same radius (R_s1 = R_s2).

- Host star of Planet_1 (star1) has twice the mass of Planet_2's host (star2): M_s1 = 2 * M_s2.

So, P1 = P2 /3.

We can find
