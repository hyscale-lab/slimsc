Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, like gold nuclei or something. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Oh, and X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So the nucleus would be lithium-6, because Li normally has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons would make it lithium-6. So the mass number A is 6.

Wait, the problem is about calculating the energy of the collider. But wait, in particle colliders, energy is usually the kinetic energy, or the total energy? Oh right, in high-energy physics, when they talk about the energy of the collider, it's typically the total energy, which includes both rest mass and kinetic. Or wait, no, sometimes it's the kinetic energy. Hmm, I need to clarify that.

The speed is given as 0.96c. So first, I think I should calculate the relativistic energy of the nucleus. The energy would be gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute gamma when v is 0.96c.

So v = 0.96c. Let's compute v²/c²: (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me think: 0.28 squared is 0.0784, because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.57142857. Yeah.

So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus is the mass times c squared. But wait, in particle physics, they often express mass in terms of atomic mass units (u) and then convert to GeV. Because 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So, the mass of the lithium-6 nucleus is 6 atomic mass units, since it's a carbon-12-like nucleus but wait, no, lithium has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so mass number 6, right.

So m = 6 * u. So m = 6 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg (if I remember the exact value of u in kg), but perhaps I don't need to compute it directly.

The rest mass energy is m*c². But wait, in terms of GeV, 1 u is 931.5 MeV, which is 0.9315 GeV. So 6 u would be 6 * 0.9315 GeV.

So 6 * 0.9315 = 5.589 GeV. So the rest mass energy is 5.589 GeV.

But wait, no. Wait, wait. The rest mass energy is E = m c². And for a nucleus, the mass is approximately A u, where A is the mass number. So for each nucleon, a proton or neutron, the mass is about 1 u. But wait, actually, the exact mass might be a bit different due to binding energy and such, but for the purposes of this problem, I think we can approximate it as 6 u.

So E_rest = 6 u * 931.5 MeV/u. Wait, but 1 u is (approximately) 931.5 MeV/c². So E_rest = 6 * 931.5 MeV = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV.

So the total energy of the nucleus is gamma times E_rest.

Gamma is about 3.5714, so 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV.

Let me compute that: 3.5714 * 5.589.

Hmm, 3 *5.589 is 16.767. 0.5714 *5.589 is approximately 3.198. So total is around 19.965 GeV. Wait, wait, let me compute it more accurately.

3.5714 * 5.589.

Let me compute 3.5 *5.589 = 19.5615. Then 0.0714 *5.589.

0.0714 *5 = 0.357, 0.0714 *0.589 is about 0.0421. So 0.357 + 0.0421 ≈ 0.3991.

So total is 19.5615 + 0.3991 ≈ 19.9606 GeV.

Wait, but none of the options are around 20 GeV. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419

Hmm, my approximate calculation gives about 19.96 GeV, which is near option C (20.132 GeV). But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the gamma calculation.

v = 0.96c.

So v^2 = (0.96)^2 c^2 = 0.9216 c^2.

So 1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

Wait, 0.28 is 28/100, which is 7/25. So 1/(7/25)=25/7≈3.57142857.

So that part is correct.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Because sometimes, in colliders, the energy referred to is the kinetic energy per particle. Oh, that's a possibility I didn't consider. Let me think.

In the problem statement, it says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c." Hmm. The RHIC's energy is typically given as the total energy, but sometimes it's the kinetic. So I need to clarify.

The problem says "energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." So the energy must be such that each nucleus has that speed, which relates to their kinetic energy or total energy.

Wait, perhaps the energy given is the kinetic energy. Let me recompute using that assumption.

Kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c².

So, E_kinetic = (gamma -1) * E_rest.

Which would be (3.5714 -1) *5.589 GeV = 2.5714 *5.589 ≈ ?

Compute 2 *5.589 =11.178, 0.5714 *5.589≈3.198. So total is 14.376 GeV.

But looking at the options, option A is 18.475 GeV, which is higher than 14.376. Hmm, so that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 3.5714 *5.589.

3.5714 *5 =17.857

3.5714 *0.589 = ?

0.5 *3.5714 =1.7857

0.08 *3.5714=0.2857. 0.009 *3.5714=0.03214.

So 1.7857 +0.2857=2.0714, plus 0.03214 ≈ 2.0714+.03214=2.1035.

So 3.5714 *5.589 =17.857 +2.1035=19.9605 GeV.

That's the total energy (gamma*m c²). So the total energy is approximately 19.96 GeV. But looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. So perhaps my approximation is a bit off, but may be due to more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v =0.96c.

v^2 = (0.96)^2 c^2 =0.9216 c^2.

1 - v²/c² =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

But wait, 0.28^2 is 0.0784, so yes.

So gamma is 1/0.28= 3.5714285714...

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate gamma using a more precise method.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it more accurately. 0.96 is 24/25.

So v = (24/25)c.

v²/c² = (24/25)^2 = 576/625 = 0.9216.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 576/625 = (625-576)/625 =49/625 =0.0784.

So the
