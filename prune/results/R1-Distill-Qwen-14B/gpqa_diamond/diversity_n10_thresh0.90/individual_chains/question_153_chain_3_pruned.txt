Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile (like an enolate) to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me try to think through each part step by step.

The problem has three parts: A, B, and C. Each involves different reactants and reagents. I need to figure out the products for each and match them with the options given.

Starting with reaction A: the reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH as the reagents. NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, which is a strong base, and EtOH is ethanol, a solvent. So, sodium ethoxide would deprotonate the dimethyl malonate to form an enolate. Dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOEt)2, so when deprotonated, the enolate would be at the alpha position, making it a good nucleophile.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH- (p-tolyl) ester. Wait, wait, the acrylate is E, so the substituents on the double bond are opposite. So it's CH2-C(O)OCH3 on one end and the p-tolyl on the other. No, wait, wait, I think the structure is CH2-C(O)OCH2CH3, but wait no, it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but the p-tolyl is attached to the middle carbon? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 with the p-tolyl group on the beta carbon? Or is it CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOEt? No, wait, the numbering might be different. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl substituent on the third carbon. Wait, that doesn't make sense because acrylate is only three carbons. Oh, wait, maybe it's the substituent on the double bond. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the middle CH2? No, wait, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but the p-tolyl is attached to the middle carbon. Oh, wait, no, maybe it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOEt. Let me draw this: the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. Carbon 3 is the carbonyl carbon. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the
