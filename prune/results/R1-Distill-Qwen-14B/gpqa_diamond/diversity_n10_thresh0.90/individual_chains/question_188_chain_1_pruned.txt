Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about interplanar distances in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my solid state chemistry class.

The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms and the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. They're asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. The options are from A to D, with some numbers close to 9 or 10.

I remember that the interplanar spacing for a crystal plane is calculated using the formula involving the reciprocal of the plane's indices and the lattice parameters. Wait, the formula is d_{hkl} = (a/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + ... )))). Oh wait, maybe it's more precise than that. Oh right! For a cubic system, it's d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But wait, this is a rhombohedral crystal, which is a type of hexagonal crystal. Or wait, no, rhombohedral is a subclass of cubic, isn't it? No, wait, no: rhombohedral has all sides equal, but angles can be different, but in this case, all the angles are 30 degrees. So maybe it's a special case.

Wait, I think the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the Miller indices multiplied by the lattice parameters, but adjusted for the angles between the lattice vectors. Because in a cubic system, the angles are 90 degrees and the formula simplifies. But rhombohedral has different angles, so I need to account for that.

The formula for interplanar distance (d) in a crystal is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about this. Or maybe it's another form. Wait, I think the formula is derived from the structure factor and the relation between d-spacing and the lattice parameters. The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal lattice is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk cos γ)/(a²) - 2(hl cos β)/(a²) - 2(kl cos α)/(a²)

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the reciprocal lattice. Alternatively, maybe I should use the relation involving the metric tensor. Oh right, the interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the norm of the reciprocal lattice vectors. But maybe that's getting a bit too detailed.

Wait, I think the formula for d_{hkl} is:

d = (1/√( (h² + k² + l²) - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ )) ) * (a)

Wait, no, perhaps that's not the correct formula. Alternatively, I remember that for a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But for non-cubic systems, you have to adjust for the angles.

Wait, let me try to recall. The general formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha (between b and c), beta (between a and c), gamma (between a and b) is given by:

(1/d²) = (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) - (2hk cos γ)/(a b) - (2hl cos β)/(a c) - (2kl cos α)/(b c)

But in this case, the crystal is rhombohedral, which means a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma. So all the a's are same, and all the angles are 30 degrees.

So substituting a = b = c = a, and all angles alpha, beta, gamma = 30 degrees.

So for a rhombohedral lattice, the formula simplifies. Let's plug in the values.

The (hkl) plane is (111). So h = k = l = 1.

So substituting into the formula:

1/d² = (1² + 1² + 1²)/a² - [2*(1*1)*cos(30) ]/(a^2) * 3 ?

Wait, wait. Let me re-express the formula correctly.

Wait, when a = b = c, and all angles are equal, the formula becomes:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(γ)/(a²)

Because each of the cosine terms would be cos(30) since alpha = beta = gamma =30. So each of the terms in the denominator is (a^2), and the three cosine terms (cos α, cos β, cos γ) are all the same.

Wait, in the general formula, it's:

1/d² = (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) - 2hk cos γ/(a b) - 2hl cos β/(a c) - 2kl cos α/(b c)

But for rhombohedral, a = b = c, and angles alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees. So substituting, we have:

Each term becomes a², and each cosine term is cos(30°).

So,

1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) ]/a² - [ 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos(30°) ] / a²

So factor 1/a²:

1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(30°) ] / a²

So,

d = a / sqrt( [h² +k² +l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ] )

Where θ is 30 degrees here.

So in this problem, h = k = l = 1.

So substituting:

h² +k² +l² = 1 +1 +1 =3

Then, the next term: 2*(hk + hl + kl) = 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) = 2*(3) =6

So,

d = a / sqrt( 3 - 6 * cos(30°) )

Compute cos(30°), which is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So,

3 -6*(0.8660) =3 -5.196= -2.196.

Wait, that can't be right. The denominator inside the square root is negative, which would make d imaginary. That doesn't make sense. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Hmm, I must have messed up the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe I got the signs wrong. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach. I remember that the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system can be found using the formula which considers the unit cell parameters.

In a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice is defined by a, b, c, but in the rhombohedral case, a = b = c, and the angles alpha = beta = gamma.

But wait, wait. No, in a rhombohedral system, all edges are equal (a = b = c), but the angles between the edges can be different. But in this case, all angles are 30 degrees.

Wait, but the formula I'm trying to use must have the angles only once. Or perhaps another way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation involving the reciprocal vectors.

Wait, maybe another way. The metric tensor for a crystal is given by:

The metric tensor g is a 3x3 matrix where the diagonal elements are a², b², c², and the off-diagonal elements are -ab cos gamma, -ac cos beta, -bc cos alpha.

In this case, a = b = c = 10 Angstroms (wait, no, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, but in crystallography, a is the lattice parameter, the distance between atoms along the lattice vectors. Wait, but in a rhombohedral structure, how many atoms are in the unit cell? Hmm, perhaps not relevant here. Oh wait, the problem says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. So perhaps a is the interatomic distance. Or perhaps I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice vectors, which would be 'a' in this case. So a = 10 Angstroms.

So, for a rhombohedral structure with a = b = c = 10 Angstroms, and angles alpha = beta = gamma =30 degrees.

The formula for the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha)/(a²)

Since all angles are 30 degrees:

1/d² = [ (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(30°) ] / a²

So for (111), h=k=l=1. So:

h² +k² +l² =3

2(hk + hl + kl) =2*(1 +1 +1)=6

So,

1/d² = (3 -6*cos30°)/(a²)

Compute cos30°= sqrt(3)/2≈0.8660.

So,

3 -6*0.866 =3 -5.196= -2.196.

Wait, so 1/d² is negative. That can't be right because d² can't be negative. That suggests an error in my formula.

Hmm, so perhaps I got the formula wrong. Maybe the correct formula has a positive sign before the 2(hk...) term.

Alternatively, perhaps I have the formula inverted. Let me think about it again.

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2hk cos gamma - 2hl cos beta - 2kl cos alpha )

But in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are same, so gamma=beta=alpha=30°, and a=b=c.

So,

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

where theta=30°, and h=k=l=1.

So,

d = a / sqrt(3 - 6* cos30° )

Which gives:

Compute 3 -6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 - 3*sqrt(3)

3 is approximately 3.0, sqrt(3)=1.732. So 3*1.732=5.196.

3-5.196= -2.196. So the denominator is sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, that suggests that perhaps the formula is actually:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha)
