Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about molecular symmetry, specifically which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry groups, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that symmetry in molecules is classified into different point groups. The question is asking about C3h symmetry. Wait, C3h is a type of symmetry in the dihedral group, right? I think C3h is actually a notation for a particular kind of molecular symmetry. Let me recall: the notation usually includes the highest symmetry axis, which is a three-fold axis (C3), and then a mirror plane (σh) that includes that axis.

So, a molecule with C3h symmetry would have a three-fold rotation axis, and also a horizontal mirror plane that includes this axis. Alternatively, sometimes C3h can be thought of as having a three-fold rotation plus a horizontal mirror, or maybe a combination of operations that give the same effect.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

Option C: triisopropyl borate.

Option D: quinuclidine.

Wait, I think triisopropyl borate is a compound where boron is attached to three isopropyl groups. So, the structure would be something like B with three (CH(CH3)2) groups. How symmetric is that? Well, each isopropyl group is the same, so the molecule should have a trigonal planar arrangement around B, right? So, the central atom has three identical groups, which would suggest a C3 symmetry, but does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, triisopropyl borate: the structure is B with three isopropyl substituents. Each isopropyl is a -CH(CH3)2 group. So, all three substituents are identical. That would give the molecule a three-fold rotation axis, but does it have a mirror plane?

Hmm, I think in such a case, the molecule might have a C3v symmetry if it has a vertical mirror plane, but for C3h, it's a horizontal mirror. Wait, or perhaps I'm getting confused between the different notation systems. C3h could also be considered as a combination of C3 and a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, some sources might say that C3h is a hexagonal symmetry, but wait, maybe that's not correct.

Wait, another approach: think about each molecule's structure.

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound, a bridged tricyclic amine. Its structure is a norbornane system with an amine. Norbornane has a certain symmetry. Quinuclidine's structure is such that it's a seven-membered ring with a bridge, leading to a structure that's somewhat similar to bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. Wait, no, quinuclidine is bicyclo[2.2.2]octane? Or is it different? Let me think: quinuclidine's structure is bicyclo[3.2.1]octane, perhaps. Wait, no, I think it's bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Anyway, regardless of the exact structure, I remember that quinuclidine has a certain symmetry. Does it have a three-fold axis? Or perhaps a four-fold? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a chair-like structure, but I don't think it's highly symmetric.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. So, B with three isopropyl groups. The arrangement would be similar to BF3, which is trigonal planar. So, the molecule would have a C3 axis (three-fold rotation) and perhaps some mirror planes. Since all substituents are the same, it should have a plane of symmetry. Let's say if we have three identical groups arranged symmetrically, the molecule should have more than just C3 symmetry. Wait, maybe it's D3h symmetry? Because for C3v, there are vertical mirror planes. Or perhaps it's C2v, or another group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again.

C3h symmetry implies a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, the molecule must look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also be symmetric across a horizontal plane.

So, what's a molecule that has such features?

Looking at option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

Wait, that's a complex name. Let me try to parse it. It's a trifuran system, which means three furan rings connected somehow. The substituents are benzene rings attached at specific positions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a tricyclic system with three furan rings connected in a way that the molecule has multiple rings.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a structure where three furan rings are fused in a specific manner, and the molecule has a three-fold symmetry. Maybe it's arranged in a trigonal fashion, so that each of the three substituents is symmetrical.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the molecule has a central point where three substituents are attached, each in a symmetric fashion.

Looking at option D: quinuclidine. I think quinuclidine has a bridge structure that might give it a certain symmetry but perhaps not C3h. Alternatively, I'm not certain.

Option A: triphenyleno[...]trifuran. Hmm, triphenylene is a polycyclic aromatic compound with three benzene rings in a sort of triangular arrangement. So, maybe this molecule has a three-fold axis because the substituents are arranged symmetrically.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct molecule is option B or A. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of each molecule's symmetry.

Triisopropyl borate: the structure is like B with three isopropyl groups. So, the molecule would have three identical substituents around the central atom. The central atom is in a plane, so the molecule has a trigonal planar geometry. So, it has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? A horizontal mirror plane would be a plane cutting through the molecule, perhaps through the central atom and some substituents. Wait, in a trigonal planar molecule like BF3, the symmetry is D3h, which includes a three-fold axis, horizontal mirror planes, and other elements. But wait, triisopropyl borate is a bit different because each substituent is an isopropyl group.

Wait, in BF3, the molecule has D3h symmetry. But in triisopropyl borate, each substituent is a larger group. However, since all substituents are the same, the molecule still would have the same symmetry as BF3, which is D3h. But wait, the question is about C3h symmetry, not D3h. So, perhaps C3h is a subgroup of D3h. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing the notation.

Wait, another angle: C3h symmetry means that the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, the molecule must appear the same after a 120-degree rotation and also be symmetric across a horizontal mirror. So, if a molecule has D3h symmetry, that includes elements beyond just C3h, like vertical mirror planes and inversion. Hmm, but perhaps some of these molecules don't have all that, only C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the options doesn't have C3h but a different symmetry.

Looking at the options again:

Option C is triisopropyl borate, which I think has D3h symmetry. Because each substituent is the same, and the molecule is trigonal planar. So, it has a three-fold axis and multiple mirror planes, including horizontal ones. So, if the question is about C3h, then this molecule has more than that, so maybe it's not the correct answer.

Quinuclidine: I think quinuclidine has a certain symmetry, but perhaps it's more of a chair-like structure or something else. Wait, quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bridge, so maybe it has a C2 axis or something else. I'm not sure if it has a three-fold rotation axis. Alternatively, perhaps it's tetrahedral in some way, but I don't think so.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

Hmm, the name suggests that it's a trifuran system (three furan rings) with benzo substituents. The substituents are attached at specific positions, which might lead to a symmetric structure. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically around a three-fold axis, then this molecule might have C3h symmetry.

Option A is triphenyleno[...]trifuran. Triphenylene is a three-fused benzene rings, so perhaps the substituents here are arranged in a way that gives a three-fold symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B. Let me think about the structures.

Wait, another thought: the concept of C3h symmetry is also present in some cyclic molecules. For example, molecules with three substituents equally spaced around a ring could have C3h symmetry. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, wait, perhaps the correct molecule is option A. Let me think about triphenyleno substituents. Triphenylene is a symmetric structure, so combining that with a trifuran might create a molecule with a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option D, quinuclidine, but I don't think so.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about each option's structure.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. As I said, it has three identical substituents around B. So, it's trigonal planar, with a C3 axis. Does it have a horizontal mirror plane? I think so. Because the substituents are arranged symmetrically, a mirror plane perpendicular to the C3 axis would be a horizontal plane. So, the molecule would have C3h symmetry. Wait, but I thought it had D3h symmetry. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the groups.

Wait, D3h is a point group that includes a three-fold axis, a horizontal mirror plane, and other elements like vertical mirrors. So, if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it also has C3h symmetry. But the question is which molecule has C3h symmetry. So, the molecule could have a higher symmetry than C3h, but as long as it has at least C3h, it would satisfy the condition.

Wait, but if a molecule has D3h symmetry, then it certainly has C3h. So, triisopropyl borate (option C) might be the correct answer. Because it would have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror.

Wait, but the name of the question is which of the following has C3h, which is a proper subset. So, perhaps the right answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the other options have C3h.

Wait, option D: quinuclidine. I think quinuclidine has a structure where the nitrogen is at the bridgehead of a bicyclic system. Its structure is bicyclo[3.2.1]octane or something else, but I'm not certain. Wait, quinuclidine's structure is bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with an amine group. So, it's a rigid structure, but does it have a three-fold symmetry? I think the molecule has a center of symmetry, but perhaps a three-fold rotation is not present. So, maybe it's not C3h.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

Hmm, the name suggests that the molecule has three benzene rings attached to a trifuran system. Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that forms a three-fold axis.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a three-fold symmetry because the substituents are attached at positions that are 120 degrees apart. That would lead to a three-fold axis.

In that case, the molecule would have C3 symmetry. If it also has a horizontal mirror plane, then it would have C3h.

But how can I be sure? Well, the positions in the name are [1,2-c], [3,4-c'], etc. So, the substituents are attached in a way that may lead to symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: I can think about the options given and perhaps the answer is option D, quinuclidine.

Wait, another thought: quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative, which is a highly symmetric molecule. Wait, no, actually, bicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a symmetric molecule with a three-fold axis. Does it have C3h symmetry?

Let me think: bicyclo[2.2.2]octane has a three-fold rotation axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If the molecule is symmetric across a plane that includes the three-fold axis, then yes.

Wait, when you look at bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, it's a very symmetric structure. So, yes, it should have C3h symmetry. Because the molecule can be rotated 120 degrees around the three-fold axis and also has a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, but quinuclidine is a substituted bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has an amine group in the bridgehead. Does that substitution affect the symmetry? If the substituent is in a symmetric position, perhaps it doesn't break the symmetry.

Wait, quinuclidine's structure has the amine in a position that is equivalent under the three-fold rotation. So, perhaps the molecule still retains C3h symmetry.

If that's the case, then option D (quinuclidine) would have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of each option's structure again.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-hexaone. So, three benzene rings connected to a trifuran. The substituents are attached in a trigonal fashion, which suggests a three-fold axis.

Option B: benzo[...]trifuran. It might have a three-fold symmetry.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. As discussed, perhaps D3h symmetry.

Option D: quinuclidine. Perhaps C3h.

So, if the question is about which has C3h, then either option C or D could be correct.

But wait, triisopropyl borate (option C) is a central boron with three isopropyl groups. It's trigonal planar, so it has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, yes, it has C3h symmetry. So, option C would be the correct answer.

Wait, then why is the option C in the choices? Let me see the options again.

The options are:
A) triphenyleno[...]hexaone

B) benzo[...]hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine.

So, if triisopropyl borate has C3h symmetry, then option C is correct.

But I'm a bit confused because I thought triisopropyl borate might have D3h symmetry, which would include C3h as a subset. So, the molecule would have C3h symmetry, making option C the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, quinuclidine.

Wait, another way to approach this: I'll recall some examples.

C3h symmetry is present in molecules like trimethylamine, but wait, trimethylamine is trigonal pyramidal, so it has C3v symmetry, not C3h. Hmm.

Another example: a molecule with a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror. Maybe like 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). Does that have C3h symmetry? Mesitylene has three substituents at 120 degrees apart on a benzene ring. The molecule has a three-fold rotation axis perpendicular to the ring. It also has a horizontal mirror plane that includes the ring. So, it has C3h symmetry.

Wait, so a structure with three substituents on a ring in a trigonal arrangement would have C3h symmetry.

Looking at the options, which one has such a structure?

Option C: triisopropyl borate. It's a central atom with three substituents arranged in a trigonal planar fashion. So, it's similar to BF3, which has D3h symmetry. So, if BF3 has D3h, then triisopropyl borate would also have D3h.

Hmm, but the question is about C3h. So, if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it certainly has C3h as a subset. So, triisopropyl borate (option C) would have C3h symmetry, making it the correct answer.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the correct answer is option A. Because the name triphenyleno indicates three phenyl groups attached in a symmetric way.

Wait, triphenylene is a molecule with three benzene rings arranged in a symmetrical manner, so perhaps attaching that to a trifuran system would create a structure with a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of rings and substituents.

Wait, another thought: quinuclidine's structure is bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with an amine group. The bicyclo[2.2.2]octane itself is a symmetric molecule. It has a three-fold axis. Does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Let me imagine the structure. If the molecule is viewed along the three-fold axis, it should look symmetric. Additionally, a horizontal mirror plane would pass through the center and reflect the substituents. So, quinuclidine (option D) would have C3h symmetry.

But wait, the substituent is an amine. Would that affect the symmetry? If the amine is in a position that is equivalent under the three-fold rotation, then the symmetry would be maintained.

Hmm, in quinuclidine, the amine is at the bridgehead, which is a unique position. So, the molecule might have a lower symmetry than bicyclo[2.2.2]octane itself. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine has C3 symmetry but not a mirror plane.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think about the options again.

The question is which molecule has C3h symmetry. So, the molecule must have a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. Central atom with three identical substituents. So, it has a C3 axis. Does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If arranged symmetrically, yes. So, it has C3h.

Option D: quinuclidine. If the structure has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror, then yes. But I'm not certain about the substituents.

If I'm to choose between options C and D, I think triisopropyl borate (option C) has C3h symmetry because it's trigonal planar with three identical groups. So, it fits the criteria.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry properties. **C₃h** symmetry requires a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that includes this axis.

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule consists of a trifuran system with triphenylene substituents. The triphenylene group is a symmetric arrangement of three benzene rings, which suggests a three-fold axis. However, the overall structure of the molecule does not clearly indicate the presence of a horizontal mirror plane. Thus, it is unlikely to have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule is a trifuran system with benzo substituents. The substituents are arranged in a way that suggests a three-fold axis. However, the structure does not clearly exhibit a horizontal mirror plane, making it unlikely to have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option C: Triisopropyl borate  
Triisopropyl borate has a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups. This trigonal planar arrangement gives the molecule a three-fold rotation axis (C₃). Additionally, the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane that includes the central boron atom and the substituents. Therefore, triisopropyl borate has **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound with a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane framework and an amine group at the bridgehead. While the bicyclo[2.2.2]octane core has a three-fold rotation axis, the presence of the amine group at a unique position disrupts the symmetry. Quinuclidine does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion  
Among the given options, only **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) has the required **C₃h** symmetry, as it possesses both a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

**Answer: C**
