Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

Two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Hmm, relative speed in relativity isn't as simple as just subtracting the two velocities. Oh right, because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't use the classical velocity addition formula. I remember the formula for relative velocity in special relativity.

Wait, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me write that down. So v1 is 0.6c, and v2 is 0.5c. So plugging those in: (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Calculating numerator: 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 → which is (1/7)*0.1c? Wait, wait, 0.1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.1428..., so 0.1428c. So about 0.14c, which matches option C and D.

Now, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared. Wait, but each has a different mass. So for each, calculate their gamma.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute each one.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So their energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Wait, but wait. Wait, 1/sqrt(0.75) is same as sqrt(4/3), which is approximately 1.1547. So 3m * 1.1547 is about 3.464 m.

So E1 is 2.5, E2 is ~3.464. Total energy E = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c². Looking at the options:

Option C: v_rel = 0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Option D: same velocity, E=5 mc².

So our calculation for E is about 5.96, so option C matches that. So the relative speed is 0.14c and total energy 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.

Wait, let me double-check the relative velocity calculation. So, (0.6-0.5)/(1 - (0.6*0.5)) → 0.1/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1/0.7 = 0.1428... So 0.14c is correct.

Are there any other factors I'm missing? Oh, wait, the problem says "the total energy of the system." So each astronaut's energy is their own gamma * mc², but since their masses are different, I have to compute each and add.

Wait again, wait a second. For the first astronaut, mass is 2m, so their energy is gamma1 * 2m c². Similarly, the second is gamma2 *3m c².

Yes, that's correct. So 2.5 + 3.464 is indeed about 5.964. So option C.

Let me glance at the options again. Option C is v_rel =0.14c, E=5.96 mc². Which matches.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed
