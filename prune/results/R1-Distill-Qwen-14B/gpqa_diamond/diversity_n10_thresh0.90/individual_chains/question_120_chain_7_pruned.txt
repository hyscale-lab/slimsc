Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my concepts, but let me think through this.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula parallax (in parsecs) is 1 divided by distance (in parsecs). So parallax plx = 1/d, where d is distance. That means when stars are closer, their parallax is larger. For example, a star at 1 parsec has a parallax of 1 arcsecond, and a star at 2 parsecs has 0.5, and so on.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniform distribution—I think that means there are the same number of stars per unit volume throughout space. Or wait, maybe per unit distance? Or is it per some other measure?

Wait, I should clarify: when they say "uniformly distributed," in an astronomical context, that usually means that the number density of stars is constant with distance. So the number of stars in a spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr is proportional to r² dr, because the volume of the shell is 4π r² dr. So more stars in larger volumes as r increases.

But the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. So I need to relate parallax to distance and then see how the number of stars in a given parallax range depends on plx.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Find the relation between parallax (plx) and distance (d).
   As I thought, plx = 1/d. So d = 1/plx.

2. Determine the range of distance corresponding to a small change in parallax, d(plx). Wait, actually, it's about a unit range of parallax. Let me think: for a given parallax plx, the distance is d = 1/plx. If parallax changes by a small amount, say, from plx to plx + delta_plx, the corresponding distance changes from d to d + delta_d.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, for a small delta_plx, how many stars are in that range.

But wait, I think it's more about how the number of stars in a given parallax bin (like between plx and plx + delta_plx) relates to plx. So I need to find N(plx) where N is number of stars per unit plx.

Since stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density (n) is constant. So the number of stars in a volume element dV is n dV.

Now, V is a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd. The volume of the shell is 4π d² dd. So the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π d² dd.

Now, we need to relate this to parallax. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. Wait, because plx = 1/d → d plx = - (1/d²) dd. So, dd = - d² d plx. But since plx is positive, and as plx increases, d decreases, but I think I can just take the absolute value for the number of stars.

So, substituting d = 1/plx into the number of stars in the shell:

N = n * 4 π (1/plx)^2 * dd.

But dd is the change in distance corresponding to a change in parallax d plx. From plx to plx + d plx, the distance changes from d to d + dd. Since d =1/plx, dd = - (d²) d plx. So the actual change in distance is |dd| = (1/plx²) d plx.

So, substituting back into N:

N = n *4 π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx / plx²).

Wait, wait. Let me clarify:

The number of stars in a parallax range plx to plx + d plx is N = n * 4 π d² dd.

But dd is the change in d corresponding to a change in plx, d plx. So:

dd = (d^2) d plx, but wait, I think I need to express dd in terms of d plx.

Wait, since plx = 1/d, then d =1/plx.

Taking derivative: d (d) = - (1/plx²) d plx.

So, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But when considering the magnitude, it's (1/plx²) d plx.

So, substituting into N:

N = n * 4 π (d)^2 * |dd|

= n *4
