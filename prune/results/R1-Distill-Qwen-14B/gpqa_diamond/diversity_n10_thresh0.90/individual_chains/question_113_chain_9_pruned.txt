Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem mentions that the compound was characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are different chemical formulas, all involving carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in varying amounts. My goal is to determine which formula fits the data.

Starting with the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption at around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around this region usually correspond to O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the peak is very broad, which might suggest it's an alcohol (like an -OH group) because carboxylic acids tend to have very strong and sharp O-H stretches, or maybe it's something else. Also, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 region often corresponds to carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, or esters. The 1650 peak could be from conjugated carbonyl groups, maybe an aromatic ring with a carbonyl or an amide, but I don't think amides are in the options here. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester or ketone.

Looking at the NMR data: there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound must have at least one double bond, perhaps in an aromatic ring or an isolated double bond. The presence of vinyl protons suggests that the structure has a double bond where the hydrogens are deshielded, like in an isolated double bond or part of a ring system.

Now, the Mass Spectrometry data shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. I need to think about what fragments would give this. Let me recall common fragments. For example, a (CH3)2CO group (like acetone) would lose a fragment, but maybe not 45. Alternatively, the 45 could be from a CH2CH2O or something similar. Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be a ketene ion, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, a common fragment is the water molecule (18), but that's not 45. Hmm. Another angle: maybe it's the molecular ion breaking down. Wait, the molecular formula options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. Let's calculate their molecular weights.

C6H12O: (6*12)+(12*1)+(16) = 72+12+16=100.
C6H10O: (72)+(10)+(16)=98.
C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32=114.
C6H12O2: 72+12+32=116.

Wait, but
