Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that an unknown compound was prepared, and several characterization techniques were used: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The task is to determine the chemical formula from the given data. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

Let me break down the information provided for each technique.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The important peaks are at 3000 (very broad), 1700, and 1650 cm^-1. I remember that IR peaks around 3000 are usually due to O-H stretching. A broad peak suggests strong hydrogen bonding, which is typical of alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait. Carboxylic acids usually have a very broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300, sometimes broader than alcohols. But the peak here is at 3000 and is broad, so maybe it's an alcohol? Or perhaps another functional group with O-H.

Then, the peaks at 1700 and 1650. 1700 is a strong peak, which I associate with carbonyl groups (C=O). The 1650 could be another carbonyl, perhaps conjugated, or maybe an aromatic ring with C=C. Wait, another possibility: if there's a conjugated carbonyl, maybe a carbonyl next to a double bond. So if the compound has both a carbonyl and another group like an ester or ketone, or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation.

Looking at the NMR spectrum: there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound likely has a double bond somewhere. So maybe an alkene or an aromatic ring. But the presence of vinyl protons suggests maybe an alkene, unless it's a substituted aromatic.

Now, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm. 45 is a common fragment. Let me think about possible fragments that add up to 45. So what could that be? Maybe a CH3CO+ (acetate) ion, which is 45 (12*2 +16*2 +1=45? Wait, CH3CO+ is C2H3O2^+? Let me calculate: Carbon is 12, so 2 *12=24. Hydrogen is 3 *1=3. Oxygen is 16 *2=32. 24+3+32=59? No wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Another possibility: CH3COO+? No, that's more than 45. Wait, maybe it's the (CH3)2CO+ ion? No, that's 58. Wait, perhaps a smaller fragment. Let me think about possible sources. 

Wait, maybe the fragment is CH2O (formaldehyde?), but that's 30. Alternatively, the fragment could be a ketene ion, like O=C=CH2, but that's maybe not. Alternatively, the m/z 45 could correspond to a fragment with a molecular formula C3H7O, wait, but 3 carbons: 3*12=36, 7 hydrogens is 7, and 16 oxygen. 36+7+16=60, no. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment like (CH3)CO, which would be 57? Wait, maybe another approach. The molecular formula of the unknown is among the options, so perhaps the molecular ion or a fragment is 45.

Wait, the molecular formulas given are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O. Let's calculate their molecular weights.

C6H12O2: 6*12=72, 12*1=12, 2*16=32. Total 72+12+32=116.

C6H10O: 72 +10 +16=98.

C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32=114.

C6H12O:72+12+16=100.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z=45. Let's see which of these could break into a fragment of 45. For instance, if the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (114), could it lose a fragment of 45? 114-45=69. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is part of a larger structure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a CH3CO+ group (45?), so the molecular formula would have that. Wait, the molecular formula for CH3CO is C2H3O2. Wait, wait, CH3CO is C2H2O2? Let me check the molecular weight: C=12*2=24, H=2=2, O=16*2=32. 24+2+32=58. Hmm, that's 58, so that doesn't match 45.

Wait another thought: maybe the m/z 45 is a fragment from a ketone or ester group. For example, if the compound is an ester, the ester group can break into the acid part and the alcohol part. Alternatively, maybe it's an acetyl group.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be a methyl group attached to something else. No, 45 is a bit higher. Let me think again. What's 45 in terms of possible structures?

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, which is 114. Let's assume the molecular ion is 114. Would a fragment of 45 make sense? 114 -45=69. 69 could be another fragment, perhaps a larger one. Maybe the ester group breaks off. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester with a fragment that includes the ester group.

Wait, another approach: the presence of a broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 in IR could indicate an O-H group. So it's likely that the compound has either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids have a strong absorption around 1700 (carbonyl) and a broad O-H. So if there's a peak at 1700 and 1650, perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl, like a ketone with adjacent double bonds or an ester.

Wait, in esters, the carbonyl is around 1740-1700 cm^-1. So a peak at 1700 would fit an ester. Then, the peak at 1650 could be from an adjacent carbonyl or something else. Alternatively, if there's conjugation, like in a conjugated ester or maybe a ketone with conjugated double bonds.

So putting that together, the IR suggests a carbonyl group (1700) and possibly an O-H (broad 3000), which could be an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But the presence of an ester would require an O-H? No, wait, esters don't have O-H groups; they have an O from the ester linkage. Wait, so maybe it's a ketone and an alcohol? Or a carbonyl and an O-H group.

Wait, the IR shows a broad peak at 3000, which is O-H. So the compound has an O-H group. So it's either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad, but also, the carbonyl would be around 1700. That fits. Alternatively, if it's an alcohol with a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester.

Wait, but if the compound is a ketone, then the carbonyl is around 1700. And an alcohol would have O-H. So perhaps it's a ketone and an alcohol, but that would make the formula something else.

Alternatively, let's think about the possible formulas. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

If the compound has both an O-H group and a carbonyl, that would account for two oxygen-containing functional groups. For instance, an ester (which has an O) and an alcohol (another O). Wait, no, an ester is R-O-CO-O-R, no, that's not right. Wait, an ester is R-O-CO-R. So the ester group contributes two oxygen atoms.

So if the compound has an ester group (O and COO), but that would already account for two O's. So perhaps the compound is an ester with another O-H group.

Wait, but if it's an ester, it's R-O-CO-R', which has two oxygen atoms in the ester group. So the formula would have at least two oxygen atoms. So looking back at the options, C6H10O2 and C6H12O2 are possibilities.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so maybe the molecule has a double bond. So perhaps it's an enol ester or something with a conjugated double bond.

The mass spec has a fragment at 45. Let me think about what that could be. Suppose the fragment is CH3COO+ (which is 45? Let me calculate: CH3COO+ has 2 carbons, 3 hydrogens, 2 oxygens. Wait, no. Wait, CH3COO- is the acetate ion, which would be (12*2)+(1*3)+(16*2)=24+3+32=59. So that's not 45. Hmm. So maybe another fragment.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is CH2O, which is formaldehyde. But formaldehyde's molecular weight is 30. Another possibility: Maybe the fragment is a ketene ion, like (CH2CO)+? Wait, that's 45? Let's calculate: CH2CO would be C2H2O. 24 +
