Okay, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, the question is about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. The key point here is about the apparent V magnitude each spectrograph can observe. 

From the question, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. That means it can see stars up to 17 mag, but not fainter than that. On the other hand, HIRES can handle stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, the star needs to be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says "brighter than" for both, which is a bit confusing. Let me think again. 

Wait, no, the way it's worded: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" by ESPRESSO. So that means apparent V ≤17? Or is it that they can only observe brighter than 17, meaning V <17? Because higher magnitudes are fainter. So, for example, a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17. So, for a star to be observable by ESPRESSO, its apparent V magnitude must be less than or equal to 17. And for HIRES, it's less than or equal to 16.

So the star must be bright enough to be seen by both. So, the apparent V magnitude of the star must be ≤16, because that's the stricter condition. Because if it's ≤16, then it's also ≤17, so both can observe it.

Now, I need to compute the apparent V magnitude for each star, considering any extinction (dust) if applicable.

Let's go through each star:

Star1: Absolute V mag is 15.5, distance is 10 pc. So, apparent V mag is m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + A_v. Wait, but does it have any extinction? Let me check the data.

Star1: RA 15, DEC -75, Mv=15.5, dist=10pc. They don't mention E(B-V) or extinction, so I think A_v is zero. So m = 15.5 + 5*log(10/10) = 15.5 + 0 =15.5. So m=15.5. So 15.5 is ≤16 and ≤17. So both can observe. But wait, Star1's apparent mag is 15.5, which is brighter than 16. So HIRES can see it, since 15.5 <=16. ESPRESSO can also see it, as 15.5 <=17.

So Star1 is detectable by both.

Star2: Apparent V mag is given as 16.5. Wait, but that's already the apparent magnitude. So m=16.5. For HIRES, they can observe up to 16. So 16.5 is fainter than 16. So HIRES can't see it. ESPRESSO can see up to 17, so 16.5 is okay for ESPRESSO. So Star2 can only be seen by ESPRESSO, not HIRES. So it won't be in the answer.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5, but E(B-V) is 0.6. So need to calculate A_v. A_v = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86. So the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m + A_v. Wait, wait. Wait, the way extinction works is that it makes stars appear fainter. So if a star's light is absorbed, the magnitude increases. So the formula is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v.

Wait, but what's the intrinsic apparent magnitude? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The star's apparent V magnitude without extinction is m0, and with extinction, it's m = m0 + A_v. Because higher magnitude means fainter. So if a star is at m0=15.5, and A_v=1.86, then the observed m is 15.5 +1.86 =17.36. 

Wait, but wait. Wait, is the 15.5 the apparent magnitude already corrected for extinction, or is that the intrinsic? Oh, the question says Star3 has apparent V mag of 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6. So I think the 15.5 is the observed apparent magnitude? Or wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, the question says: Star3 has apparent V mag of 15.5 and E(B-V)=0.6. So I think that the given apparent mag is the observed one, but the E(B-V) is the reddening. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps Star3's apparent V mag is 15.5 without considering extinction. So in that case, the observed apparent mag would be 15.5 + 1.86 =17.36.

But the question states: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1."

Hmm, perhaps the apparent magnitude given is the intrinsic, and the extinction has to be added. So, for example, the star's actual apparent magnitude (what we observe) is m = m0 + A_v. Because the extinction makes it dimmer.

So Star3's given m is 15.5, but its observed m is 15.5 + 1.86 =17.36. So observed m=17.36. ESPRESSO can see up to 17, so 17.36 is fainter than 17. So ESPRESSO can't observe it. HIRES can only go up to 16, so 17.36 is way beyond. So Star3 can't be detected by either. So it's not a candidate.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is 15.5, which includes extinction. So then, the observed m is 15.5, and A_v is 1.86? That doesn't make sense. Because if the apparent magnitude is after extinction, then A_v has already been accounted for. So maybe the given m is the observed one, and the E(B-V) is the reddening. But I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach: when the star's light passes through interstellar medium, its apparent magnitude increases (because it's dimmer). So the formula is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v.

So if a star is at a certain distance, its intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) is m0. Then, due to extinction, it's m_observed = m0 + A_v.

In Star3's case, the given apparent magnitude is 15.5, but that could be either m0 or m_observed. The question says: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us." But then, it also says about E(B-V), so I think Star3's given m is the observed (i.e., m_observed), so that the actual m without extinction would be m0 = m_observed - A_v.

Is that possible? Hmm, that would complicate things, but perhaps that's the case. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, perhaps the star's apparent magnitude without extinction is 15.5, and with extinction, it's 15.5 + A_v. So m_observed =15.5 +1.86=17.36.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of another approach. Let's consider the definitions.

E(B-V) is the color excess, which is (B - V)_observed - (B - V)_intrinsic. 

The extinction A_v is related as A_v = 3.1 * E(B-V). So in V band, A_v = 3.1 * E(B-V).

The apparent magnitude in V band without extinction would be m0. The observed apparent magnitude is m = m0 + A_v.

So for Star3, if the given apparent magnitude is 15.5, perhaps it's the observed m. Then, the intrinsic m0 would be m - A_v =15.5 - 1.86=13.64. But that doesn't make sense with the problem statement. Because the question says Star3 has apparent V mag of 15.5 and E(B-V)=0.6. So perhaps the 15.5 is the m0, and the observed m is 15.5 +1.86=17.36.

Wait, but is the given m the intrinsic or observed? The question states that Star3's apparent V mag is 15.5, but that's before considering extinction? Or is it the observed? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me look back at the question:

"Star3 - RA = 11 h and DEC = 48 deg, apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us."

Ah, the question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag" but doesn't mention whether it's corrected for extinction. So, I think that the 15.5 is the observed apparent magnitude, which includes extinction. So if that's the case, then the intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) would be m0 = m_observed - A_v. So for Star3, m0 =15.5 - 1.86=13.64. Wait, but that seems a bit odd, because without extinction, it would be brighter. But perhaps that's the case.

Wait, but if Star3's observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, and A_v is 1.86, then without extinction, it would have been 15.5 -1.86 =13.64. But then, how did they get that? I'm a bit confused, but perhaps I should proceed with this assumption.

Wait, but regardless, what's the observed apparent magnitude for Star3? If the given 15.5
