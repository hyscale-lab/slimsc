Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by a certain Lagrangian. The Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ_f ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think this is a Yukawa coupling kind of term. So the boson X couples to fermions, right?

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. And the question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, we're looking for possible decay channels where X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

Wait, kinematically allowed means the fermions' rest masses must be less than or equal to half the mass of X, because in the center-of-mass frame, each fermion would get an energy of at least their rest mass. So, the maximum mass each fermion can have is (X's mass)/2. Because when the fermion is at rest, its energy is just its mass. So for X to decay into a pair, each fermion's mass must be less than or equal to 3 GeV, because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait – wait, no, I think I'm getting that wrong. The threshold for decay is when the fermion mass is such that 2m_f ≤ m_X. So m_f ≤ m_X/2. So yeah, each fermion's mass must be ≤ 3 GeV.

So the possible fermions are those with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. Let's list all the known fermions.

The standard model fermion masses are approximately:

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~1.5 MeV (0.0015 GeV)
- Down quark (d): ~3.3 MeV (0.0033 GeV)
- Strange quark (s): ~95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
- Charm quark (c): ~1.275 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.13 GeV
- Top quark (t): ~173 GeV

Wait, wait a second. The bottom quark is about 4.13 GeV. So that's over 3 GeV. So if X is 6 GeV, then m_X/2 is 3 GeV. So any fermion pair where each has mass ≤3 GeV can be produced.

So for quarks, the possible ones are u, d, s, and c. Because:

u: ~0.0015 GeV < 3 GeV → allowed
d: ~0.0033 GeV → allowed
s: ~0.095 GeV → allowed
c: ~1.275 GeV → allowed

But the bottom quark (b) is 4.13 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So X can't decay into b and anti-b because 2m_b = 8.26 GeV, which is way more than 6 GeV. So the decay X → b b̄ is not allowed.

Similarly, top quark is way too heavy, so that's out.

What about leptons? The tau is about 1.777 GeV, so 2m_τ is ~3.554 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. Wait, wait, because m_X is 6 GeV, so 2m_τ would be ~3.554 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So wait, 2m_τ is about 3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV? Wait, no, 2m_τ would be the sum of the masses, but the condition is whether each fermion's mass is ≤3 GeV. Because for a decay into a pair, each fermion's mass must be ≤ m_X/2.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. The condition is that the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. So for X → f f̄, the invariant mass is m_X. The threshold for the decay is when 2m_f ≤ m_X. Because when the fermions are produced at rest in the center of mass frame, each has mass m_f, so 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So, for X → τ⁺ τ⁻: m_τ is about 1.777 GeV. 2 * 1.777 ≈ 3.554 GeV. Wait, but m_X is 6 GeV. 3.554 GeV is less than 6 GeV, so 2m_τ is less than m_X. Wait no, 3.554 is less than 6, but m_X/2 is 3 GeV. So if 2m_f is 3.554 GeV, which is greater than 3 GeV, that would mean that m_f is greater than m_X/2. So the tau is out. Because 1.777 GeV is more than 3 GeV /2 → 1.5 GeV. 1.777 is ~1.78 GeV, which is more than 1.5 GeV. So 2m_τ is 3.554 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV (m_X/2). So that would mean that X can't decay into tau pairs because that would require 3.554 GeV, which is less than X's mass, but wait, wait, no, because X's mass is 6 GeV, which is more than 3.554 GeV. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no, the threshold is when the sum of the masses of the decay products is equal to the mass of the decaying particle. So if the sum of the rest masses of the products is less than the decaying mass, then the decay is kinematically allowed.

Wait, no. The condition for a decay to be allowed is that the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the decaying particle. Because in the rest frame, the products can have zero kinetic energy; their rest mass sum can't exceed the decaying particle's mass.

So for X → f f̄, the sum is 2m_f ≤ m_X. So 2m_f ≤6 GeV → m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So, the fermion mass m_f must be ≤3 GeV.

So let's list all fermions with m_f ≤3 GeV:

Leptons:
e⁻: ~0.0005 GeV → allowed.
μ⁻: ~0.105 GeV → allowed.
τ⁻: ~1.777 GeV → 1.777 GeV < 3 GeV → allowed.

Wait, wait, 1.777 is less than 3, so tau is allowed. Because 2m_τ = 3.554 GeV <6 GeV. Oh wait, but since 2m_f must be ≤ m_X, which is 6 GeV. So 2*1.777=3.554 ≤6? Yes. So yes, X can decay into tau pairs.

Wait, no, wait. 3.554 GeV is less than 6 GeV, so yes, it's allowed. So tau can be a decay product.

Wait, but wait, wait. Because the sum of the fermion masses (since it's a pair, 2m_f) must be less than or equal to m_X. So for X=6 GeV, any fermion with m_f ≤3 GeV is allowed.

So for quarks:

u: 0.0015 → allowed.
d: 0.0033 → allowed.
s: 0.095 → allowed.
c: 1.275 → allowed.
b:4.13 → no, because 4.13 >3 GeV.
t: way too heavy.

So possible quarks are u, d, s, c.

So the decay products would be:

X → uū, dđ, sŝ, cč, as well as leptons: e⁺e⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, τ⁺τ⁻.

Wait, but wait, what about the top quark? It's much heavier, so it's out. So the possible decay channels are into any fermion-antifermion pair where m_f ≤3 GeV.

Wait, but then looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, τ⁺τ⁻, e⁺e⁻.

But wait, b is 4 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So decay into b b̄ is not allowed. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, τ⁺τ⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, e⁺e⁻.

Wait, does this include c? Yes. Because m_c is 1.275 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV, so allowed. And tau is allowed as above.

Option C: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, t t̄, τ⁺τ⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, e⁺e⁻. But t is 173 GeV, so no. So this option is incorrect.

Option D: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, τ⁺τ⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, e⁺e⁻. Again, b is not allowed.

So the correct decay channels would include all the allowed fermions:

u, d, s, c, e, μ, τ.

So looking at the options, option B includes c, s, u, d, τ, μ, e. But option D includes b, which is wrong, and option B does not include b, which is correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the options again.

Option A includes b, which is incorrect.

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all fermions with m_f ≤3 GeV.

Option C includes t, which is wrong.

Option D includes b, which is wrong.

So the correct option should be B.

Wait, but wait. The problem statement says the Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ_f f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) f(y). Oh, wait, I think I misread that earlier. So the interaction term is -λ_f f (ῡ + X) f. Or maybe it's written as -λ_f f (ῡ + X) f. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Yukawa coupling term where the field X couples to the fermion ψ_f.

Wait, the standard Yukawa term is something like L = -g ψ ψ X, where g is the coupling. So in this case, the term is -λ_f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the notation, but the important thing is that X couples to ψ_f, which I'll assume are all the fermions.

So the interaction is such that X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair as long as it's kinematically allowed.

So in that case, the allowed decays are those into any fermion with mass up to 3 GeV.

So the fermions are:

Leptons: e, μ, τ.

Quarks: u, d, s, c.

So all these can be decay products.

Now let's look at the options.

Option B lists: c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, τ⁺τ⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, e⁺e⁻.

That's all the allowed fermions. So the correct answer is B.

But wait, another thing to consider: the coupling's strength. The decay rates depend on the coupling strength and phase space. But the question is only about kinematical (i.e., mass) allowability. So even if the coupling is zero for some fermions, the question is just about whether the decay is possible kinematically.

So regardless of the couplings, if the fermion mass allows it, it's kinematically allowed. So the correct possible decays are all pairs where m_f ≤3 GeV.

So the possible decay channels are:

uū, dđ, sŝ, cč, e⁺e⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, τ⁺τ⁻.

Which is exactly option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction between \( X \) and fermions is described by the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) \left( \upsilon + X(y) \right) \psi_f(y),
\]

indicating that \( X \) couples to fermions. For a decay \( X \rightarrow f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the mass of the fermion \( m_f \) must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq m_X \), or equivalently \( m_f \leq \frac{m_X}{2} \). Given \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), the threshold for \( m_f \) is \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 1: Fermion Masses
The approximate masses of Standard Model fermions are:
- Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( \sim 0.0015 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( \sim 0.0033 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( \sim 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.275 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.13 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

From this, the fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are:
- Leptons: \( e, \mu, \tau \)
- Quarks: \( u, d, s, c \)

### Step 2: Kinematically Allowed Decays
The boson \( X \) can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair \( f \bar{f} \) where \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Thus, the allowed decays are:
\[
X \rightarrow u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c}, e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^-.
\]

### Step 3: Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: \( X \rightarrow b \bar{b}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, e^+ e^- \)  
  This includes \( b \bar{b} \), but \( m_b = 4.13 \, \text{GeV} > 3 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( b \bar{b} \) is not allowed. **Incorrect**.

- **Option B**: \( X \rightarrow c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \)  
  This includes all fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Correct**.

- **Option C**: \( X \rightarrow c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, t \bar{t}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \)  
  This includes \( t \bar{t} \), but \( m_t = 173 \, \text{GeV} > 3 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( t \bar{t} \) is not allowed. **Incorrect**.

- **Option D**: \( X \rightarrow b \bar{b}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \)  
  This includes \( b \bar{b} \), but \( m_b = 4.13 \, \text{GeV} > 3 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( b \bar{b} \) is not allowed. **Incorrect**.

### Final Answer
The correct option is **B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) based on the fermion mass constraints.

Answer: B
