Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

The problem says that the operator is P, and we're dealing with a muon. The eigenvector corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, I think I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like spin are represented by these matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices! So the components of P must be proportional to the Pauli matrices. Let me write them out.

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]. That's the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. And P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

But wait, the operator here is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n lies in the x-z plane, meaning it has components (n_x, 0, n_z). Since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

The operator P would be the spin operator along this direction n. The spin operator for spin-1/2 particles is given by S = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P must be (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

Wait, but the question says that the eigenvector is for the operator P, which is the vector in the direction n. So we're looking for the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

But wait, let's think about the eigenvalues. The spin operator along a direction has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. So the eigenvalue we're given is +ħ/2.

So, to find the eigenvector, I need to write down the matrix form of P and solve for the eigenvector.

Let me denote the components of the direction vector as n, which is in x-z plane. So let's say n = (a, 0, b), with a² + b² =1.

So the operator P is (ħ/2)(a σ_x + b σ_z).

Wait, σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So putting it together:

P = (ħ/2) [ a [[0,1],[1,0]] + b [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Which would be:

P = (ħ/2) [ [b, a], [a, -b] ]

Because the (1,1) element is b, (1,2) is a, (2,1) is a, and (2,2) is -b.

So the matrix is:

[ [b, a],
  [a, -b] ]

multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, but for the eigenvalue equation, ħ/2 is a scalar factor. So perhaps I can factor it out and focus on the matrix part.

Let me denote the matrix as M = (b, a; a, -b). So the eigenvalue equation is M |ψ> = λ |ψ>, where λ is the eigenvalue. But since P = (ħ/2) M, then the eigenvalue for P is (ħ/2) λ. So we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. That implies that λ = ( (ħ/2) λ ) = eigenvalue, so λ = 1, because (ħ/2)(λ) = ħ/2 → λ =1. So we're looking for eigenvectors of M with eigenvalue 1.

Wait, correct. Because the eigenvalue equation for P is:

P |ψ> = (ħ/2) M |ψ> = (ħ/2) λ |ψ> = (ħ/2) *1 |ψ> → eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

So the matrix M is [[b, a], [a, -b]], and we need to find its eigenvectors for eigenvalue 1.

The equation is: (M - I) |v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So M - I = [[b-1, a], [a, -b-1]]

We need to solve the system:

(b-1) v1 + a v2 = 0

a v1 + (-b-1) v2 = 0

Let me write the first equation: (b-1) v1 + a v2 = 0 → (b-1) v1 = -a v2 → v1 = [-a/(b-1)] v2

Wait, but (b-1) is (b -1), so let me factor that.

Alternatively, since the two equations are:

Equation 1: (b-1) v1 + a v2 =0

Equation 2: a v1 + (-b-1) v2 =0

I can write equation 1 as:

v1 = [ -a/(b-1) ] v2

Plugging into equation 2:

a [ (-a)/(b-1) v2 ] + (-b-1) v2 = 0

Simplify:

[ (-a²)/(b-1) ) + (-b-1) ] v2 = 0

Factor out v2:

[ (-a²)/(b-1) - (b +1) ) ] v2 = 0

Since v2 can't be zero (otherwise v1 would be zero too, leading to trivial solution), the term in [ ] must be zero.

So:

(-a²)/(b-1) - (b+1) = 0

Multiply both sides by (b-1):

- a² - (b+1)(b-1) = 0

Simplify (b+1)(b-1) = b² -1.

So:

- a² - (b² -1) )=0 → -a² -b² +1 = 0 → a² + b² =1.

Wait, but that's already true because a² + b² =1 since n is a unit vector. So this equation is satisfied.

So, the equations are not independent, meaning there's a one-dimensional solution space. So the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of each other.

So the eigenvector can be written in terms of v2. Let's let v2 = t, a parameter.

Then v1 = [ -a/(b-1) ] t.

But (b-1) is (b -1). Let me express everything in terms of a and b.

Wait, since a² + b² =1, maybe it's easier to parameterize a and b in terms of an angle. Let me say that the direction vector is along some angle in the x-z plane. Let's denote θ as the angle from the z-axis. Then, a = sinθ, and b = cosθ.

Because in the x-z plane, the direction vector is (x= sinθ, z=cosθ) if θ is measured from the z-axis. Alternatively, if θ is measured from the x-axis, but I think it's more common to measure angles from the z-axis when in the x-y plane, but here it's the x-z plane. Hmm, maybe I should think it through.

Wait, the direction vector n is in the x-z plane. Let me imagine the x-z plane as a 2D plane. So n can be represented as (n_x, 0, n_z), and n_x² + n_z² =1. Let me set n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ. Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to have θ such that when θ=0, direction is along z, θ=90 degrees (pi/2 radians) along x.

Wait, perhaps to model this, let me parametrize a and b as follows: a = sinθ, b=cosθ. Because when θ=0, a=0, b=1 → direction along z. When θ=pi/2, a=1, b=0 → direction along x.

So substituting, a = sinθ, b= cosθ.

Then, the expression for v1 is:

v1 = [ -a/(b-1) ] v2 = [ - sinθ/( cosθ - 1 ) ] v2.

Hmm, let's simplify this denominator. cosθ -1 = -(1 - cosθ). So:

v1 = [ - sinθ / ( - (1 - cosθ) ) ] v2 = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ) ] v2.

But sinθ/(1 - cosθ) can be simplified using trigonometric identities. Remember that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So, sinθ/(1 - cosθ) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / [2 sin²(theta/2)] ) = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] = cot(theta/2) = 1 / tan(theta/2).

So, v1 = [ cot(theta/2) ] v2.

So, v1 = [cot(theta/2)] v2.

Alternatively, let me consider choosing v2 as 1 and then find v1.

Wait, but let's write the eigenvector as (v1, v2).

So, v1 = cot(theta/2) * v2.

Let me set v2 = 1 for simplicity.

Then v1 = cot(theta/2).

So the eigenvector is ( cot(theta/2), 1 ).

But wait, this is not normalized. The components are (v1, v2) = ( cot(theta/2), 1 ).

The normalization condition is |v1|^2 + |v2|^2 =1.

So, | cot(theta/2) |^2 + 1 =1 → cot²(theta/2) +1 =1 → cot²(theta/2) =0 → which can't be right.

Wait, that suggests I made a mistake. Maybe I should proceed differently.

Wait, the eigenvector is any non-zero scalar multiple of (v1, v2). So perhaps I can express it as ( sinθ, 1 - cosθ ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's go back to the equations.

We have (b-1) v1 + a v2 =0.

Expressed as (cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0.

We can write this as (1 - cosθ) v1 = sinθ v2 → v2 = [ (1 - cosθ)/sinθ ] v1.

Hmm, that's another approach. Let me take v1 as a parameter, say v1 = t.

Then v2 = [ (1 - cosθ)/sinθ ] t.

So the eigenvector is ( t, [ (1 - cosθ)/sinθ ] t )

We can factor out t, and write the eigenvector as (1, (1 - cosθ)/sinθ )

But this must be normalized. Let's compute the normalization factor.

The norm squared is 1^2 + [ (1 - cosθ)/sinθ ]^2.

Compute that:

= 1 + [ (1 - 2 cosθ + cos²θ) / sin²θ ]

= [ sin²θ + (1 - 2 cosθ + cos²θ) ] / sin²θ

Wait, because 1 = sin²θ / sin²θ.

Wait, no, let me compute numerator:

sin²θ + (1 - 2 cosθ + cos²θ) → because sin²θ + cos^2θ =1.

So sin²θ +1 -2 cosθ + cos²θ = (sin²θ + cos²θ) +1 -2 cosθ =1 +1 -2 cosθ= 2(1 - cosθ)

So denominator is sin²θ.

So the norm squared is [2(1 - cosθ)] / sin²θ.

But 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So sin²θ=4 sin²(theta/2) cos²(theta/2).

So the norm squared becomes [2 * 2 sin²(theta/2) ] / [4 sin²(theta/2) cos²(theta/2) ) ].

Wait, 2(1 - cosθ) = 4 sin²(theta/2), because 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2).

So numerator is 4 sin²(theta/2).

Denominator is 4 sin²(theta/2) cos²(theta/2).

So the norm squared is [4 sin²(theta/2)] / [4 sin²(theta/2) cos²(theta/2)] ) = 1/(cos²(theta/2)).

Hmm, so sqrt of (1/(cos²(theta/2))) is 1/|cos(theta/2)|.

So to normalize the vector (1, (1 - cosθ)/sinθ ), we divide by 1/cos(theta/2) → multiply by cos(theta/2).

Wait no, because the norm is 1/(cos(theta/2)), so the normalized vector is [ (1, (1 - cosθ)/sinθ ) ] * [ cos(theta/2) ) ]

Wait, perhaps I should express (1 - cosθ) and sinθ in terms of theta/2.

1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2)

sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So (1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] = [ sin(theta/2) ] / [ cos(theta/2) ] = tan(theta/2 )

So the vector is (1, tan(theta/2) )

So the vector is (1, tan(theta/2) ), and its norm squared is 1 + tan²(theta/2) = sec²(theta/2 ), so the norm is sec(theta/2) = 1 / cos(theta/2).

So to normalize, multiply by cos(theta/2):

The normalized eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Wait, because (1 * cos(theta/2), tan(theta/2) * cos(theta/2) ) = ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Ah, yes! Because tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2), so multiplying by cos(theta/2) gives sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Wait, but wait. What about the phase? Because in quantum mechanics, eigenvectors can have a global phase factor. But the options given include some with exponential factors, like option B and D.

Wait, the eigenvector I found is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), but option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors multiplied by hbar and trig terms.

Wait, but I have to check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2) )

Wait, but why is hbar in the options? Because the eigenvector is a vector in Hilbert space, which is a vector of complex numbers (possibly), but the components shouldn't have dimensions of hbar. So perhaps the options have a mistake, or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, but wait, the eigenvectors are typically dimensionless. So in the options, any presence of hbar suggests a miscalculation on my part.

Wait, the operator P has components multiplied by ħ/2, but when we're finding the eigenvector, the eigenvector itself is a vector in the Hilbert space, so its components shouldn't be multiplied by ħ. So perhaps the options are incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, perhaps the operator P is the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2, but the eigenvector is for the spin operator. So perhaps the eigenvector is the same as that of the Pauli matrices, which are 2x2 matrices with entries 0,1, etc. So the eigenvectors are just dimensionless vectors.

Wait, but looking back, the options include options with hbar multiplied into the components. That seems incorrect. Hmm. Let me think.

In the question, the operator components are given as:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]

Similarly for P_y and P_z.

So the operator P is the vector in direction n, which is a combination of P_x, P_y, P_z.

But when we find the eigenvector of P, the components of the vector are just dimensionless. So the options that have hbar in them (like A, D) are suspect. Options B, C don't have hbar.

Looking back at the options:

Option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

That's exactly what I derived.

Wait, but the problem says "the normalized eigenvector", so the answer should be option C. But let me check the other options.

Option B is (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ ), which looks more like spherical coordinates for a 3D vector, not a spin-1/2 state.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors multiplied by hbar and theta/2 terms. Not sure how that comes into play.

Wait, maybe I should think about another approach. Another way to find the eigenvector is to realize that the operator P is along direction n, so it's a spin operator. The eigenstates of the spin operator along direction n are the spin-up and spin-down states. For spin-1/2, the spin-up state is given by:

|+n> = cos(theta/2) |+z> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |−z>, but wait, wait, no, phi comes into play when the direction is not in the x-z plane. Since our direction is in the x-z plane, phi is zero, so the state simplifies.

Wait, but in the x-z plane, direction n is (a, 0, b). So, in this case, phi =0. So the state would be cos(theta/2)|+z> + sin(theta/2)|-z>.

Wait, but what are |+z> and |-z> in terms of the basis vectors?

|+z> is (1, 0), |-z> is (0,1).

So |+n> = ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Which matches option C.

So that's the normalized eigenvector. So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking at the options again, option C is indeed that.


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. The task is to determine the normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Operator Structure**: The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed as:
   \[
   \vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z \right),
   \]
   where $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, and $\sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices, and $\vec{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$ is the unit vector along the arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, $n_y = 0$, and the operator simplifies to:
   \[
   \vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z \right).
   \]

2. **Eigenvector Equation**: The eigenvalue equation for $\vec{P}$ is:
   \[
   \vec{P} | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle,
   \]
   where $| \psi \rangle$ is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. Factoring out $\hbar/2$, the eigenvector equation reduces to finding the eigenvector of the matrix:
   \[
   M = n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Direction Vector Parametrization**: The unit vector $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane can be parametrized as:
   \[
   \vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta),
   \]
   where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{n}$ and the z-axis. Substituting this into $M$, the matrix becomes:
   \[
   M = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Eigenvector Calculation**: Solving the eigenvalue equation $(M - \lambda I)|\psi\rangle = 0$ for $\lambda = 1$ (corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$), the eigenvector is found to be proportional to:
   \[
   | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

5. **Normalization**: The eigenvector is already normalized, as:
   \[
   \cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1.
   \]

### Option Analysis:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$  
  This is incorrect because the components of the eigenvector should not include $\hbar$, as eigenvectors are dimensionless quantities.

- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$  
  This is incorrect because it describes a 3D spherical coordinate system, not the 2D eigenvector of a spin-1/2 system in the x-z plane.

- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This matches the derived eigenvector and is correct.

- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This is incorrect because the components include $\hbar$, which is inconsistent with the normalization of eigenvectors.

### Final Answer:
The normalized eigenvector is $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$, which corresponds to **Option C**.

Answer: C
