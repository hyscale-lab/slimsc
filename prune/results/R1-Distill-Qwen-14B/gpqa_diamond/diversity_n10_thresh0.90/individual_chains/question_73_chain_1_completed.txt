Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. Two astronauts are traveling at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's think about this.

First, the problem states: the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as classical mechanics. Oh right, you can't just subtract the speeds. I remember the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. Let me recall. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), but wait, I think it's (u - v) divided by [1 - (u*v)/(c squared)].

Wait, but wait, I think I might be getting this mixed up. Oh wait no, the correct formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Hmm, but wait, depends on the frame. Oh wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So the relative speed of one with respect to the other would be (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Wait, no, wait, the relative speed as seen from one astronaut's frame.

Let me clarify: Let's say astronaut A is moving at velocity u = 0.6c in the positive x-direction in the lab frame. Astronaut B is moving at v = 0.5c in the same direction. So from the perspective of A, what's the speed of B? Should I compute (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)) or (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²))? Wait, no, the relative speed formula is (u' - v')/(1 - (u' v')/c²), but I think I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of velocity addition. The velocity of B as seen from the frame of A would be (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), but wait, no—wait, let me get this right. The formula for velocity transformation in relativity is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So if we're in the lab frame, and I want to find the speed of B as seen from A's frame, since A is moving at velocity v = 0.6c, then the speed of B in A's frame is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). Let's compute that.

Wait, let's compute numerator and denominator. Numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.5 * 0.6)c² / c² → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So u' is (-0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. But since we're talking about speed, we take the absolute value, so 0.1428c. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c, so that's a match.

Wait, but let me double-check. Oh wait, I think the formula is correct. So the relative speed is approximately 0.1428c, so about 0.14c. Now, looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c for v_rel. So that's part one.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has relativistic energy. The total energy would be the sum of their individual energies. The relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait wait, no, wait. The formula is E = gamma * m c². So for each astronaut, their rest mass is 2m and 3m.

Wait, no: the mass given is 2m and 3m, so the rest energy would be m_rest c², but wait, in relativity, the rest energy is mc² where m is the rest mass. So the first astronaut's rest energy is 2m c², and the second is 3m c². But their energies are gamma times their rest energies, right?

So for astronaut 1: E1 = gamma1 * (2m) c² = gamma1 * 2 m c².

Similarly, E2 = gamma2 * (3m) c².

So let's compute gamma1 and gamma2.

Gamma1: v = 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut 2: v = 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Wait, wait: 3 * 1.1547 is approximately 3.464.

So total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = (2.5 + 3.464) m c² ≈ 5.964 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E = 5.96 mc², which matches this. Option B has 4.96, D has 5 mc², which is less.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

E1: 2m * 1.25 = 2.5 m c².

E2: 3m * 1.1547 ≈ 3.464 m c².

Sum is 2.5 +3.464 = 5.964 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which is close.

So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c and the energy is ~5.96 mc².

Looking at options:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Option D: same relative speed as C but E=5 mc². So D's E is smaller, which isn't the case.

So the correct options are C for both parts.

Wait, but wait another thing: the question says "the total energy of the system." In relativity, the total energy isn't simply the sum of the energies in the same frame unless the frame is the rest frame of the system. Wait, no, the system's rest frame would be different. Wait, but the problem is asking for the total energy in the lab frame, right? Because the question states the astronauts are moving at those speeds in the positive x direction in the lab frame. So yes, their energies are as calculated, and the sum is correct.

Wait, but wait a minute: another approach. Alternatively, the total energy would be the sum of their energies in that frame. So yes, I think the way I did it is correct.

So the correct answer should be option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed of one astronaut with respect to the other is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) (velocity of the first astronaut) and \( v = 0.5c \) (velocity of the second astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]

Taking the absolute value, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut:
- Mass: \( 2m \)
- Velocity: \( 0.6c \)
- \( \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25 \)
- Energy: \( E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2 \)

#### For the second astronaut:
- Mass: \( 3m \)
- Velocity: \( 0.5c \)
- \( \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547 \)
- Energy: \( E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2 \)

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).
- The total energy is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \).

Comparing with the options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect, as the relative speed is \( 1.1c \), which violates relativity.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as the total energy is \( 4.96m c^2 \), which does not match the calculation.
- **Option C**: Correct, as it matches both the relative speed \( 0.14c \) and the total energy \( 5.96m c^2 \).
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as the total energy is \( 5m c^2 \), which is too low.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
