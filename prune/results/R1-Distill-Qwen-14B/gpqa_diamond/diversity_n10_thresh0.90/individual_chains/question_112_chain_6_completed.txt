Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Alright, the problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so that's the standard spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis.

The first part of the question asks me to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, so the matrix would be 2x2 since we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles (up and down). Let me visualize that matrix. For a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So it looks like this:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Wait, but the operator matrix is given as A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. So that's correct. So the operator is represented by a matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 on the off-diagonal.

Wait a second, but this is a 2x2 matrix, so it's for a two-level system. But what's the significance of this operator? It looks like it's an operator whose eigenstates are different from the standard basis states |up> and |down>. So the measurement is being done in the eigenbasis of this operator, not the z-basis.

So the first task is to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. Then, the second part is to find the average value (expected value) of that operator.

Wait, but first I need to normalize the state |alpha>, right? Because the problem says it's proportional to that combination, so the vector isn't necessarily normalized.

Let me start by writing the state |alpha> as (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let's denote |up> as (1,0) and |down> as (0,1) in a vector notation. So the state vector would be [1+i, 2-i]^T.

To normalize this, I need to compute the inner product (the conjugate transpose times the vector). The inner product is (1+i)^* (1+i) + (2 - i)^* (2 - i). Let's compute each term.

(1+i)* is 1-i. So (1-i)(1+i) = 1*(1) + 1*(i) -i*(1) -i*i = 1 +i -i -i^2. i^2 is -1, so that adds 1. So 1 +0 +1 = 2.

Next term: (2 - i)* is 2 + i. Multiply by (2 - i): (2)(2) + (2)(-i) + i(2) + i*(-i). That's 4 -2i + 2i -i^2. The -2i and +2i cancel. Then 4 - (-1) because i^2 is -1. So 4 +1 = 5.

So the total inner product is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the normalized |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So |alpha> is (1+i)/√7 |up> + (2 - i)/√7 |down>.

Now, the next part is about the operator with the matrix A. Let me write that matrix:

A = [[0, ħ/2],
     [ħ/2, 0]]

I need to find the eigenstates of this operator. Because when measuring an operator, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes of the corresponding eigenstates in the state vector.

So to find the eigenstates of A, I need to solve the eigenvalue equation A|ψ> = λ|ψ>.

The matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvalues can be found by solving det(A - λI) =0.

The determinant of [[-λ, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -λ]] is λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0. So λ² = ħ²/4 → λ= ± ħ/2.

Wait, that's interesting. So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2. Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the trace is zero, so the sum of eigenvalues is zero, which holds. The determinant is (0)(0) - (ħ/2)^2 = - (ħ²/4), so the product of eigenvalues is -ħ²/4. Wait, that's correct because (ħ/2)(-ħ/2) = -ħ²/4.

So the eigenvalues are λ = ħ/2 and λ = -ħ/2. So the eigenstates corresponding to these eigenvalues are what?

Let's find the eigenvectors.

For λ= ħ/2:

(A - (ħ/2) I ) |v> =0 → [[-ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -ħ/2]] |v> =0.

So the equations are:

-ħ/2 v1 + ħ/2 v2 =0 → -v1 + v2=0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvector can be any scalar multiple of [1, 1]^T. But considering normalization, it's (1,1)/sqrt(2).

Similarly for λ = -ħ/2:

(A - (-ħ/2) I ) |v> =0 → [[ ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ħ/2, ħ/2 ]] |v> =0.

The equations are:

(ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → v1 +v2=0 → v2= -v1.

So the eigenvector is [1, -1]^T, normalized to (1, -1)/sqrt(2).

So the eigenstates are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), corresponding to eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think: The operator A is given as a matrix with 0 on the diagonal and ħ/2 off-diagonal. So this is actually the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (ħ/2) * σ_x.

And the eigenstates of σ_x are indeed |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively. So when multiplied by ħ/2, the eigenvalues become (ħ/2)*1 and (ħ/2)*(-1), which matches what I found.

So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |−x>, which are the eigenstates of the σ_x operator.

So now, the state |alpha> is expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, but we need to express it in terms of |+x> and |−x> to find the probabilities.

Let me compute the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

The state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Expressed in terms of |+x> and |−x>, since:

|up> = (|+x> + |−x>)/sqrt(2)
|down> = (|+x> - |−x>)/sqrt(2)

So substituting these into |alpha>:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (|+x> + |−x>)/sqrt(2) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (|+x> - |−x>)/sqrt(2)

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(2) from each term.

= [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * |+x> / sqrt(2)
+ [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * |−x> / sqrt(2)

Let me compute the coefficients.

First coefficient for |+x>:

[ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) )

= [ (1+2) + (i -i) ) ] / (sqrt(14) )

= (3 + 0) / sqrt(14) → 3/sqrt(14)

Second coefficient for |−x>:

[ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) )

= [ (1-2) + (i +i) ) ] / sqrt(14)
= (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)

So |alpha> = [3/sqrt(14)] |+x> + [(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)] |−x>

Wait, but wait a second. The first term comes from adding (1+i) and (2-i). Let me recheck that:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = (1+2) + (i -i) ) = 3 + 0 → 3.

Yes.

The second term is (1+i) - (2 -i) → (1-2) + (i + i) → -1 + 2i.

So the coefficients are correct.

But wait, the state |alpha> is already normalized because we normalized it earlier. So the sum of the squares of the absolute values of these coefficients must be 1.

Let me check:

|3/sqrt(14)|² = 9/14.

| (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14) |² → [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 → (1 +4)/14 =5/14.

So 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1. Correct.

So the expansion is correct.

Now, the probability to measure the eigenvalue ħ/2 (which corresponds to |+x> ) is |3/sqrt(14)|² =9/14 ≈ 0.64286.

Similarly, the probability to measure -ħ/2 (corresponding to |−x> ) is | (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14) |² =5/14 ≈0.35714.

Wait, but the options given are in the first part probabilities as 0.64 and 0.36, etc. Let me see.

Wait 9/14 is approximately 0.64286, which is about 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places. 5/14 is about 0.357, so approximately 0.36. So the first part would be probabilities 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, the average value of the operator A is the expectation value < alpha | A | alpha >.

Alternatively, since A has eigenstates |+x> and |−x> with eigenvalues ± ħ/2, the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So <A> = (probability of +) * (ħ/2) + (probability of -) * (-ħ/2).

From the probabilities computed, that's (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)( -ħ/2 ) = [ (9 ħ/28 ) - (5 ħ/28 ) ] = (4 ħ/28 ) = ħ/(7).

So the average value is ħ/7.

Now looking at the options:

Option A says probabilities 0.64, 0.36 and average hbar/7.

Option B: 0.54, 0.46, 3hbar/sqrt(7). No, because our average is hbar/7.

Option C: 0.28 and 0.72 → sum to 1, but our probabilities are 9/14 (~0.642) and 5/14 (~0.357), so 0.64 and 0.36.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29 → sum to less than 1. Hmm, no.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, which is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is 0.36. So the option that matches these probabilities is option A, which has 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7.

So the correct answer would be option A.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization is computed by finding the inner product of the state with itself:

\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}(2-i)|\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \) with the matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This operator is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, scaled by \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of the \( X \)-matrix, which are:

\[
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle),
\]

with corresponding eigenvalues \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \).

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of these eigenstates. Substituting \( |\uparrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+\rangle + |-\rangle) \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+\rangle - |-\rangle) \) into \( |\alpha\rangle \), we get:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}|+\rangle + \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}|-\rangle.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:

\[
P(|+\rangle) = \left|\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(|-\rangle) = \left|\frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Finally, the average value of the operator \( A \) is computed as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = P(|+\rangle) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(|-\rangle) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) 0.64, 0.36, and \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).**
