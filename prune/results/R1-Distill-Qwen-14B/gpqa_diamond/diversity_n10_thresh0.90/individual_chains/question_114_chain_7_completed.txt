Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the options provided. Let me break it down step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that NaCN is a nucleophile. In the context of ketones, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. So, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it's adding the CN- group to the carbonyl carbon. But wait, the product here has a hydroxyl group (the 2-hydroxy part). So maybe it's a substitution reaction?

Wait, wait, another thought. Oh! Maybe the NaCN is acting as a nucleophile in an enol ether formation or something like that. Or wait, wait, no. Let me think again. Oh right, when a ketone is treated with a cyanide, it can undergo a nucleophilic addition. The product is a cyanohydrin, which is an alcohol adjacent to the nitrile group.

So the first reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. The general reaction is ketone + CN- → cyanohydrin. But wait, how does that happen? Oh, right, the mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion on the carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral intermediate, and then protonation happens. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact conditions.

Wait, in the product, the structure is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. So when NaCN adds, the structure becomes (CH3)2C(OH)CNCH2-? Wait no, perhaps I should draw it.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CNCH3? Wait, no, but wait, butan-2-one is CH3-CO-CH2-CH3, wait no, wait butanone is (CH2)3CO. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So adding cyanide would give a cyanohydrin: (CH3)2C(OH)CNCH3? Wait, no, wait butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so when the cyanide adds, the carbonyl becomes a nitrile and an alcohol. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, in the product, it's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be CH2(CN)(OH)C(CH3)2? Or perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, the product's IUPAC name is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the nitrile group is on the first carbon, then the hydroxyl and methyl groups on the second. So, structure would be: CH2CN-CH(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile on C1. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, no, nitrile is at the end. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, perhaps it's CH3CH2CH2CN? Wait, no, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, which is NC-CH2CH2CH2CH3? I think I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Because butanenitrile would have four carbons, with the nitrile on C1. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons.

Butanenitrile is CH3CH2CH2CN. So butanenitrile is a four-carbon chain ending with CN. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have the OH and CH3 groups on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2CN-CH(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that would be five carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, but butanenitrile is four carbons. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methyl substituted on the second carbon of the four-carbon chain. So the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)-CH2CN? Because the ketone is in the middle, adding the nitrile to the same carbon as the OH.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is (CH3)2C(OH)-CH2CN. Wait, but that's a five-carbon chain? No, no, because butanenitrile is four carbons, so the product must fit that.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on this, but maybe I should proceed. The point is, the first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone. So the reagent A is probably an acid, because the cyanide ion is a strong nucleophile and the reaction typically requires an acid to protonate the intermediate so that the nucleophilic attack can proceed.

Wait, yes, I remember that when you add a cyanide to a ketone, it's often done under acidic conditions, as the acid helps to generate the cyanide ion and also protonates the intermediate to facilitate the reaction. So for the first reaction, reagent A is probably H3O+ (which is a strong acid), or maybe H2SO4 or something similar, but looking at the options, the choices for A are H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which is a source of H+ and SO3^2-.

But why would NaHSO3 be used here? Well, perhaps it's a milder acid or used for specific conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's about the workup.

Wait, the first reaction uses NaCN and A. So if A is H3O+, that would provide the H+ needed for the protonation. Alternatively, if A is NaHSO3, which is a weaker acid compared to H3O+.

Wait, in the formation of cyanohydrin, the reaction typically uses a proton source, like H2SO4 or HCl, to generate the CN- and to protonate the intermediate. But let me think about the reaction conditions.

So NaCN in aqueous solution is already providing CN-; but the ketone is in a solution, perhaps with H+ to facilitate the nucleophilic attack. So the reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN, in the presence of an acid (like H3O+ or HCl), to form the cyanohydrin.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+ or another acid. Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3.

But then, what about the second reaction? It's a substitution perhaps? Let me look at it.

The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, so the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. How does that happen? Usually, nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions to form either carboxylic acids or amines, depending on the conditions. But in this case, since we're getting a carboxylic acid, the hydrolysis must be under acidic conditions, perhaps with H2O and an acid catalyst.

Wait, but the reagent B is given as H2O. So the reaction is hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. The typical conditions for this are either using strong acid (like H2SO4) or strong base, but with acid, you get the carboxylic acid, while with base, you get the carboxylate which then needs to be acidified.

Wait, but in this case, the product is the carboxylic acid, so the hydrolysis must be under acidic conditions. So reagent B would be an acid, perhaps HCl or H3O+, or something else.

Wait, but the question says the reagent is B (H2O). So maybe B is providing the H+ as a catalyst. Alternatively, the reagent is HCl, for example.

Wait, let's read the question again. The second reaction is: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → product.

Wait, perhaps it's a hydrolysis in the presence of water and an acid. So B is the acid. So for example, H2O and HCl, or H2O and H3O+.

Looking back at the options, the options for B are HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, the options are:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So, for the second reaction, we're converting nitrile to carboxylic acid. The typical hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids is done under strong acidic conditions, often with H2SO4 as a catalyst. Alternatively, using HCl as a catalyst in water.

Wait, but sometimes it's done with H2O and HCl. So for the second reaction, reagent B is the acid, which would be HCl or another acid.

So putting it together:

First reaction: NaCN and H3O+ (so option A or B) or NaHSO3 (C or D). Since the first reaction is a cyanohydrin formation, which typically uses H+ as a catalyst, I think H3O+ is the right choice. So options A or B.

Second reaction: converting nitrile to carboxylic acid. For that, we typically use H2O with an acid, like HCl. So B is HCl, which would be option A (A=H3O+, B=HCl) or option C (A=NaHSO3, B=HCl).

So, let's see:

If the first reaction uses H3O+ (options A and B), and the second uses HCl (options A and C), then option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl, which fits.

Wait, but why would NaHSO3 be used as A? If the first reaction uses NaHSO3, which provides H+ (from HSO4^-), it's a source of acid. But perhaps in some cases, a milder acid is used. But I'm not sure. I think the first reaction is more commonly done with H2SO4 or HCl, but the options don't include H2SO4. So between H3O+ and NaHSO3.

H3O+ is a strong acid, while NaHSO3 is a weaker acid. But in the cyanohydrin formation, a strong acid is typically used. So perhaps the correct reagent A is H3O+, making options A and B the candidates.

Now, for the second reaction, the reagent B is H2O, but the question says + B (H2O). So perhaps B is a catalyst in the reaction, like HCl in water. So the second reaction needs H+ for the hydrolysis.

In the second reaction, the nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid. The typical conditions are either:

1. Under strong acidic conditions, like with H2SO4 as a catalyst, and heated with water.

2. Under basic conditions, which would form a carboxylate, which is then acidified.

Since the product is the carboxylic acid, the conditions are likely acidic. So reagent B is probably HCl (a strong acid) to provide the H+.

Thus, the correct options would be A=H3O+ and B=HCl, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any other possibilities? For the second reaction, another possibility is using aqueous H2O with a base, but that would produce a carboxylate, which would then need to be acidified. But the product is the acid, so I think the second step is under acidic conditions.

So putting it all together, the first reaction uses H3O+ (A) and the second uses HCl (B), which is option A.


The problem involves two reactions, and the goal is to determine the correct reagents A and B from the given options.

### Reaction 1:
The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A. Cyanohydrin formation typically requires an acid to protonate the intermediate and facilitate the nucleophilic attack of CN⁻ on the carbonyl carbon. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is commonly used for this purpose, while NaHSO₃ (a weaker acid) is less typical for this reaction. Therefore, reagent A is likely H₃O⁺.

### Reaction 2:
The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH) in the presence of reagent B (H₂O). This reaction typically requires acidic conditions to directly form the carboxylic acid. Among the options, HCl is a strong acid that can provide the necessary conditions for this transformation, while CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weaker acid and less commonly used for this specific reaction. Thus, reagent B is likely HCl.

### Conclusion:
Combining the above analyses, the correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which corresponds to **Option A**.
