Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read through the question again and break it down.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which is about 3 degrees above room temperature (since 273 K is 0°C). 

Another clue is that when a certain keto acid reacts with substance X, the product contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Additionally, substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. So, I'm thinking about common reagents like maybe something like Grignard reagents or others. 

Wait, Grignard reagents are organometallic compounds, typically RMgX, where R is an alkyl or aryl group and X is a halogen like Cl, Br, or I. They react with carbonyl groups (like in keto acids) to form alcohols. But the product here has 2 oxygen atoms. Hmm. Wait, when a Grignard reagent reacts with a ketone, which has a carbonyl group, it adds twice. Because ketones have two R groups on the carbonyl carbon, so maybe the reaction forms a secondary alcohol.

Wait, no, the product's oxygen count is 2. Let me think. The keto acid would have a structure like R-CO-OH. If X is a Grignard, the reaction would add twice, perhaps? Let me think: Grignard reagents (like RMgBr) react with ketones (like R'COR'') to form secondary alcohols. If the keto acid is reacting with X, perhaps it's adding once, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction.

But let me go back to the other parts of the problem. The gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons. So, the molecule must be a substance where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. Wait, but wait: the molecule's protons and neutrons. So, for each molecule, the total protons and total neutrons are the same. So, for example, if it's H2O, the protons would be 2 (from H2) + 8 (from O) = 10. Neutrons would be 8 (from O) + 2*(0 from H) = 8. 10 ≠8, no. Wait, but that's the molecule's total. Hmmm.

Wait, maybe each molecule has a molecule where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. Like, if W is CO2, each C is 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if it's the 12C isotope), O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. But wait, that would make the molecule have each atom with equal p and n. But the molecule as a whole? Let me think. If the molecule's total protons equal total neutrons. So, CO2 has 6 + 16 = 22 protons (6 from C, 16 from two O's each with 8). Neutrons: C has 6, each O has 8, so 6 + 2*8=22. So protons and neutrons are equal. So, yes, CO2 fits. Another possibility is H2O: 2+8=10 protons, 8+2*0=8 neutrons. No, not equal. So CO2 fits.

Alternatively, maybe H2O isn't the case, but CO2 is. Wait, when you have a violent reaction between X and Y, producing CO2 gas. That makes me think of reactions where carbonate or bicarbonate reacts with an acid, but maybe Y is water? Or another liquid.

Wait, but let's think about the reaction. Substance X reacts with Y to produce W (CO2), and a precipitate G. Then heating G gives B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which is about 4°C. So, what solid has a melting point near 4°C? Common substances include... maybe something like water (0°C), but 277 is close to 4°C, which is the melting point of something else. Wait, maybe it's a different compound. Alternatively, maybe B is sodium hydroxide? No, NaOH has a higher melting point. Hmm.

Wait, thinking about the reaction between a Grignard reagent and water. Grignard reagents react with water to produce alkane (like methane, ethane, etc.), magnesium hydroxide, and hydrogen gas. Wait, but that's H2, but earlier I thought W was CO2. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps Y is a different liquid, like an acid? If X is a carbonate salt, then reacting with acid would produce CO2. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a strong acid, and X is a carbonate, but this might not fit with the other clues.

Wait, the precipitate G forms when X reacts with Y. If Y is liquid, perhaps it's an acid. So X could be a carbonate (like CaCO3), reacting with HCl (Y) to produce CO2 (W), CaCl2 (soluble, so no precipitate? Or perhaps it's a different carbonate, like magnesium carbonate reacting with acid to form a precipitate, but I'm not sure.)

Alternatively, if X is a hydroxide, reacting with an acid would produce water and a salt. But that might not produce a precipitate unless the salt is insoluble. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal, reacting with an acid to produce hydrogen gas. But then W would be H2.

Wait, but earlier I thought W could be CO2. So let me reevaluate. The gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So, for CO2, each C has 6 p and 6 n, each O has 8 p and 8 n. So total protons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. So 22 each. So that matches. So W is CO2.

So, if W is CO2, then the reaction between X and Y produces CO2. So perhaps X is a carbonate, Y is an acid. But then, what's the precipitate G? Alternatively, maybe X is a metal carbonate, Y is an acid, producing CO2 and a salt. If the salt is insoluble, it would precipitate. For example, CaCO3 reacts with HCl to form CaCl2 (soluble), CO2, and H2O. But CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. So maybe a different carbonate. For example, if X is PbCO3, reacting with HCl would form PbCl2, which is sparingly soluble. So perhaps G is PbCl2, which would precipitate. Then, when heated, it decomposes into PbO and HCl gas, maybe? But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a metal bicarbonate and an acid. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: What's the product when a keto acid reacts with substance X? The product has 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid is like R-CO-COOH. When a Grignard reagent (X) adds to this, it would add twice to the carbonyl group, perhaps forming an alcohol. Let me think: Grignard reagents react with ketones to form secondary alcohols. So if the keto acid is, say, acetoacetic acid (CH3-CO-COOH), adding a Grignard reagent (like CH2MgBr) would add to the ketone (the middle carbonyl). So the first addition gives an alkoxide, which then can add another equivalent of Grignard. So the product would have two Grignard additions, leading to a diol? Or perhaps a tertiary alcohol.

Wait, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. The original keto acid has three oxygen atoms (two in the carboxylic group and one in the ketone). If X is adding twice, perhaps each addition brings a new group but doesn't add more oxygens. Alternatively, if the Grignard adds once, maybe it's adding to the ketone, replacing the O with R. So the product might be a secondary alcohol, which would have one more oxygen than the Grignard reagent, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ester or something else. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about other parts.

Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and especially its analog. So Grignard reagents are common, but maybe it's something else like a Gilman reagent (organocuprates). Alternatively, something like NaBH4 or LiAlH4, but those are reducing agents. Wait, but Grignard reagents react with carbonyl groups to form alcohols. So if a keto acid reacts with X, perhaps X is a Grignard reagent, leading to a secondary alcohol. For example, the keto acid would have a carbonyl group, and adding two Grignard equivalents would form a tertiary alcohol. Wait, but the product's oxygen count is 2. Let me think: the keto acid (like R-CO-COOH) has three oxygen atoms. If X (Grignard) adds to the ketone, each addition would replace the O with R. So after two additions, perhaps the product would have two R groups attached, but how does that affect the oxygen count?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a hemiacetal or something else. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think about the initial reaction.

When X reacts with Y, it releases CO2. So X is a carbonate or a bicarbonate. Or perhaps X is a metal oxide, reacting with an acid to produce CO2, but that's less likely. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal carbide, which reacts with water to produce CO2. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: What if X is a chlorinated compound, like ClCH2CH2Cl, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps X is a sodium salt of a carboxylic acid, but that might not release CO2.

Wait, going back to the Grignard idea. Suppose X is a Grignard reagent, like CH3MgBr. When it reacts with a keto acid, say, cyclohexanone (which is a ketone, not a keto acid), but in our case, it's a keto acid. So perhaps the reaction would add the Grignard to the ketone part, forming an alcohol. But I'm not sure how that affects the oxygen count. Let me think: the starting keto acid has a structure like R-C(O)-COOH. Upon reaction with Grignard, it would form R-C(OH)-CH2-OMgBr? No, wait, Grignard adds to the ketone. Let me draw it out mentally. The ketone (C=O) reacts with Grignard (RMgX) to form an alkoxide, which upon workup (acid) becomes an alcohol.

Wait, in the case of a keto acid, the Grignard would add to the ketone (the carbonyl group) but not the carboxylic acid group. So the product would be R-C-OH group attached to the Grignard's R group. Wait, perhaps the product is a secondary alcohol. Let me think of the oxygen count. The keto acid has three oxygen atoms (two from COOH and one from the ketone). If the Grignard adds twice to the ketone, then perhaps the product adds two R groups and replaces the carbonyl O with two R-O- groups. Hmm, no, perhaps each Grignard addition replaces one O.

Alternatively, maybe the product's oxygen count is the same as the starting material. Or perhaps the product has fewer oxygens. Wait, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. The starting keto acid has three. So perhaps each Grignard addition removes one O?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a hemiacetal or something else where the oxygen count changes. Maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the other parts again.

The precipitate G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. 277 K is about 4°C, which is near the melting point of water (273 K, 0°C), but a bit higher. What substances have a melting point close to that? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? Or perhaps something else. Alternatively, maybe B is sodium hydroxide, but that's about 1390 K melting point.

Wait, another angle: If G is a hydroxide, like Mg(OH)₂, which is a precipitate when a Grignard reacts with water. Then heating Mg(OH)₂ would produce MgO and water. What's the melting point of MgO? It's around 2800°C. No, that's way higher than 277 K. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a carbonate that decomposes upon heating. For example, calcium carbonate decomposes to CaO and CO2 at high temperatures, but that's way above 277 K. Hmm.

Wait, maybe B is a different compound. Let's think about the melting point of 277 K. That's about 4°C. What solid has a melting point around that? Maybe something like potassium nitrate? No, that's around 334 K. Sulfur is higher. Maybe ammonium nitrate? No, its melting point is higher. Wait, maybe something like sodium bicarbonate? No, that's about 270 K (about -3°C). Close, but not exactly 277. Alternatively, maybe it's a different salt.

Wait, another thought: If the precipitate G is magnesium carbonate, MgCO3, which is insoluble. When heated, it decomposes into MgO and CO2. The melting point of MgO is high, but if B is the product, perhaps B is MgO, but that's not near 277 K. Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide that decomposes.

Wait, perhaps G is a different compound. Let me think about the initial reaction. X reacts with Y (liquid) to produce CO2 and a precipitate. If X is a carbonate, Y would be an acid. So, for example, CaCO3 + HCl → CaCl2 (if soluble) + CO2 + H2O. But CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. So X must be a carbonate of a metal whose chloride is insoluble. Like Ag2CO3? Wait, silver carbonate is not very common. Maybe PbCO3. Lead carbonate is a white solid and reacts with HCl to form PbCl2, which is slightly soluble. So if Y is HCl, the reaction would produce CO2 and PbCl2 as precipitate. Then, when PbCl2 is heated, it might decompose into PbO and HCl gas. But what is the melting point of PbO? I think it's around 890°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is a hydroxide. For instance, if X is a metal, Y is water, and the reaction produces a hydroxide and H2 gas. But earlier, W was CO2, so that doesn't fit. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction of X with Y is a double displacement reaction, producing CO2 and a precipitate. Let me think of an example: If X is Pb(NO3)2, and Y is K2CO3, then PbCO3 would precipitate, and KNO3 would stay in solution. But then the gas W would be CO2. Then heating PbCO3 would decompose into PbO and CO2, but again, the melting point is too high.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal bicarbonate, like NaHCO3, which when reacted with an acid (like H2SO4) would produce CO2 and a sulfate. But in that case, the precipitate would be the sulfate only if it's insoluble. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate G is a sulfide? But I don't see how a carbonate would produce that. Maybe not.

Alternatively, let's think about the product of the reaction of X with the keto acid. The product contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So maybe the product is a diol (two -OH groups), but that would add two O's, but the starting keto acid has more. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a primary alcohol, which would have one O from the alcohol group. But the keto acid has more O's, so I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: perhaps X is a borohydride, like NaBH4. It's a common reducing agent. When it reacts with a keto acid, it would reduce the carbonyl group to an alcohol. Let me see: a keto acid (like R-CO-COOH) would become R-CH2-COOH. So the product has one more CH2 group and the same number of O's? Wait, the original keto acid has three O's (two from COOH, one from ketone). The product would have three O's as well (still a carboxylic acid and an alcohol group, but no ketone). So the product would have two O's from the COOH group and one from the alcohol? No, that doesn't add up. Or wait, perhaps the reaction is different. NaBH4 typically doesn't reduce ketones in the presence of acids, maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is with a Grignard reagent, but I'm still not sure.

Let me think about the elements in X. The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So, for example, if X contains Mg and Br (like MgBr2 in a Grignard reagent), then Mg has an atomic mass of about 24.3, and Br is about 79.9. Sum would be around 104.2. But looking at the options, the highest is 35, so that's probably not the case.

Wait, the options are 35, 25, 31, 29. So perhaps the elements are lighter. Let me think: what if X is something like CH3Li, which is a lithium-based organometallic? The elements would be C and Li. C has an atomic mass around 12, Li about 7. Sum is 19, which is not in the options. Alternatively, maybe X is something like NaH, which is sodium hydride. Elements are Na (23) and H (1), sum is 24, which is option B (25 is close but not exact). Hmm, but the options are given as A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Wait, another possibility: if X is something like LiAlH4, the elements are Li, Al, H. But the lightest is H (1), heaviest is Al (27), sum is 28, which isn't an option. Alternatively, maybe X is a boron-based reagent, like BH3. But then the elements are B (11) and H, sum 12, not matching.

Wait, if X is a chloride, like MgCl2, then Mg is 24, Cl is 35.5. Sum would be 24 + 35.5 = 59.5, which isn't an option. Alternatively, maybe X is a chloride and another element. Alternatively, if X is something like KCl, K is 39, Cl 35.5, sum is 74.5, not an option.

Wait, another angle: the product of X and the keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. Let's say the product is a secondary alcohol. So, the starting keto acid has a structure like R-CO-COOH. When the Grignard adds to the ketone, it becomes R-C-O-Mg-Br, but upon protonation, becomes R-C-O-R', where R' is the Grignard's R. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: Grignard addition to a ketone forms an alcohol. For example, acetone (propan-2-one) reacting with CH3MgBr gives 2-propanol. So in this case, the product has one more C, but the oxygen count remains one (the -OH group). But the starting keto acid has three O's, and the product has how many? Let me count: the Grignard adds to the ketone, so the product would be R-C-OH, but the other part (the COOH) remains. So the product would have two O's in the COOH group and one O in the alcohol, totaling three O's. Wait, but the problem states that the product has 2 O's. So that's a contradiction.

Hmm, maybe the reaction is different. If X is a different kind of reagent. Let me think of other reagents used in organic chemistry: perhaps it's a halogen, like Cl2, but that's a diatomic gas and doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, like sodium, which reacts with keto acids. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a hemiacetal, which would have fewer O's. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe X is a borohydride, like NaBH4. When it reduces a keto acid, the carbonyl becomes a CH₂ group. So the product would have the same number of O's as the starting acid. Wait, the starting keto acid has three O's (COOH has two, ketone has one), and the product would have two O's (the COOH becomes CH₂OH?),
