Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The Ca-EDTA complex is formed, and the formation constant (K) tells us how stable the complex is. A high K, like 5e10, means the complex is very stable.

The problem gives the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. Since it's a 1:1 complex (I think EDTA typically forms 1:1 complexes), the stoichiometry is Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2-.

So, the solution has 0.02 M of the CaEDTA complex. Now, I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions. The formation constant equation comes into play here. The formation constant K is equal to [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but wait a second. Do I have enough information about the EDTA concentration? Because without knowing the amount of free EDTA, I can't directly compute [Ca^2+]. But wait, maybe in this case, the solution is only the complex, meaning that all the EDTA is bound to Ca? Or is the solution a mixture of CaEDTA and excess EDTA?

Wait, the problem says it's a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, the term 'stochiometric' might imply that the solution has that exact complex in a 1:1 ratio. So perhaps the solution is made by dissolving the Ca-EDTA salt, which dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^2-... Wait, wait, no. Wait the EDTA is usually in a deprotonated form. Wait, EDTA can have different forms based on pH. But the problem says pH is ideal, so perhaps all EDTA is in the form that can bind Ca, like Y^4-.

Wait, but the problem says the pH is ideal. So I don't have to worry about the EDTA not being in the right form. So the solution is 0.02 M of Ca-EDTA, which dissociates completely into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-? No, wait, that's not right. Because Ca-EDTA is a complex ion; when you have the complex in solution, it doesn't dissociate into the ions because it's stable. Wait, no, wait. The solution contains the complex. So if you have 0.02 M of CaEDTA^2-, what does that mean for the concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-?

Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let's think about the formation of the complex. The complex is formed from Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

The reaction is: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

The formation constant K is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

But in this solution, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

I need to find [Ca^2+]. But to do that, I need to know [EDTA^4-]. Wait, but in solution, the EDTA can come from two sources: any uncomplexed EDTA, and the dissociation of the CaEDTA complex. But if the complex is very stable (since K is large), the dissociation would be minimal. So [Ca^2+] would be very low.

Wait, but wait. If the solution is purely the CaEDTA complex, that would mean that the only source of Ca^2+ is the dissociation of the complex. But since the complex is very stable (K is 5e10, which is a large number), the dissociation is negligible. So [Ca^2+] would be very low.

Wait, but let me think. The formation equation is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

If the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA^2-, then [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

What about [Ca^2+]? Let's say x is [Ca^2+]. Then, because every mole of CaEDTA that dissociates gives a mole of Ca^2+ and a mole of EDTA^4-, but if the initial concentration is 0.02 M, and dissociation is negligible, then [Ca^
