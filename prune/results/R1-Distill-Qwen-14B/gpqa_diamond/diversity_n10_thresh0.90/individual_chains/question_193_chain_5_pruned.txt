Okay, I've got this astronomy question to tackle. Let me think through it step by step. So, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, given that the number varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (d) in parsecs, right? So plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx. That seems right.

The problem says the number of stars (N) varies with plx as 1/plx^5. So mathematically, N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/plx^5.

But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in would change things. Let me see: 1/plx is d, so plx is 1/d. So plx^5 would be (1/d)^5 = 1/d^5. Therefore, 1/(plx^5) becomes d^5. So N is proportional to d^5?

Wait, no wait. Let me double-check that. Because if N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and plx = 1/d, then 1/(plx)^5 is (d)^5. So N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars increases with d^5.

But the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. It's about the number of stars per unit distance. Like, the density or something.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The number of stars in a region could depend on the volume, but volume depends on distance cubed. So normally, the number of stars might go as r^3. But in this case, it's given as varying with parallax as 1/plx^5, so that's a different relation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me approach it more systematically. Let's define the variables properly.

Parallax (plx) is 1/d, where d is the distance. So plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx.

We have N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Substituting d in terms of plx:

N ∝ (d)^5.

So N is proportional to d^5. But the question is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's about the number of stars within a certain range of distance, like between d and d+dr. That would relate to the differential number of stars.

Hmm, perhaps the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr is proportional to something. Normally, the number of stars in a shell would depend on the volume. But wait, this is a specific region where the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, which is N ∝ d^5.

Wait, perhaps the problem is saying that the number of stars in a region is proportional to 1/plx^5. Let me rephrase the question: "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5". So N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is a proportionality constant. Since plx = 1/d, then N = k * d^5.

So if N is proportional to d^5, then as d increases, the number of stars increases rapidly. But the question is about how N changes with distance, per unit distance. Wait, maybe we need to find dN/dr, the derivative of N with respect to r (distance). Because that would give the number of stars per unit distance at a particular distance.

So if N = k d^5, then dN/dr = 5k d^4. Which is proportional to r^4. Looking at the options, option C is ~ r^4.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. The problem states that in a specific region, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ d^5 as before. Then, the number of stars per unit distance would be
