Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully. The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. Hmm, I remember that reagents play a big role in determining the type of reaction that occurs.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then, the second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (H2O) to produce 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, I think this has to do with nucleophilic additions to ketones. Butan-2-one is a ketone, right? So when a ketone reacts with something like NaCN, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution or addition. Oh wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. In ketones, the alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to the carbonyl) are good for nucleophilic addition because they're less substituted but still reactive.

So butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3? Wait no, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So structure is (CH3)2C=O. When it reacts with NaCN, which is a cyanide nucleophile, it probably adds to the carbonyl group. But then what happens next?

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. The nitrile group is at the end, so maybe it's attached to the same carbon as the hydroxyl group. So that would imply that the addition of CN- occurred to the carbonyl carbon, but then what transformation happens?

Oh wait, maybe it's a case of addition followed by another reaction. Oh, like the formation of a cyanohydrin. Because when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, it forms a cyanohydrin. The reaction typically uses a strong acid as a catalyst, perhaps. Because the CN- is a strong nucleophile but might require some protonation to make the carbonyl more electrophilic.

So for the first reaction, the reagent A is probably an acid catalyst. Looking at the options, options A and B have H3
