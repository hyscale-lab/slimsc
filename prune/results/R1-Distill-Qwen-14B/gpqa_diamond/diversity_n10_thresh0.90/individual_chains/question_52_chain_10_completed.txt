Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots on its surface affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that the distribution of atoms in different energy levels depends on temperature. Oh right, the Boltzmann equation comes into play here.

Let me read the details again. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but why does the effective temperature decrease? Oh, because the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so when a significant portion is covered, the overall emission is less, hence the star appears cooler.

Now, the main part: when 40% of the surface is covered, the photospheric effective temperature decreases. But wait, the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels—level 1 and level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. And we're supposed to find by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

So the ratio, let's call it N1/N2, where N1 is the number of atoms in level 1 and N2 in level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when there are no spots, the ratio is higher, and when there are spots, it's lower.

Wait, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2 is given by the Boltzmann equation. The equation is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy factor) and E is the energy of each level. So the ratio N1/N2 would be the inverse of that, so N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ).

But wait, if I'm looking at the ratio N1/N2, then a decrease in temperature would change this ratio. Let me think: if T decreases, the exponential term (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes larger, because T is in the denominator. So exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) increases as T decreases. So N1/N2 increases when T decreases. But wait, the question says that when spots are present (so T_eff is lower), the ratio N1/N2 decreases. Wait, that's the opposite of what I just thought.

Wait, perhaps I got it backwards. Let me clarify. Let's say the transition is from level 2 to level 1. The energy difference is delta E = E2 - E1. The wavelength given is about 1448 Angstroms, so I can compute the energy difference using the relation E = hc/lambda.

So the energy difference E2 - E1 is hc/(lambda). Let me compute that. H is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s. C is speed of light, 3e8 m/s. Lambda is 1448 A, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) ) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) = approximately 1.372e-18 J per photon.

But wait, I need this in terms of eV perhaps. Because when working with thermal energy, which is on the order of kT, it's easier. So 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So 1.372e-18 J is 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.56 eV. Wait, that seems high. Wait, wait. Let me compute again.

Wait, 1448 Angstroms is in the far ultraviolet, but the energy per photon is E = hc/lambda. So 1448 A is 1448 * 1e-10 m. So E is (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) = Let's compute 1.9878e-25 divided by 1.448e-7. Hmm, 1.9878 / 1.448 ≈ 1.373. Then exponent is -25 +7 = -18. So E is about 1.373e-18 J per photon.

Now, converting to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so E = (1.373e-18) / (1.602e-19) ≈ 8.57 eV. That's a big energy difference. Wait, but that seems very high for a typical transition. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait a second, perhaps I should check the calculation again. Let me compute hc: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 m = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 m. So 1.9878 / 1.448 = approx 1.373. Then the exponent is 1e-25 / 1e-7 = 1e-18. So E is 1.373e-18 J. Now, in eV, 1eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 1.373e-18 J is (1.373e-18) / (1.602e-19) ) eV. That's approximately (1.373 / 0.1602) ) ≈ 8.57 eV. So yes, that's correct. So E2-E1 is about 8.57 eV.

Wait, that's a big energy gap. But okay, perhaps the transition is between levels that are far apart. Anyway, moving on.

Now, the Boltzmann factor for the ratio is (E2 - E1)/(k T). Let's compute that for both Teff values.

The Boltzmann factor is (E2 - E1)/(k T) = (8.57 eV) / (k T). But wait, k is the Boltzmann constant, which is 8.617e-5 eV/K. So, k T in eV units.

So when T is 6000 K, k*T = 8.617e-5 * 6000 ≈ 0.517 eV.

So the factor becomes 8.57 / 0.517 ≈ 16.57.

Similarly, when T is 5500 K, k*T = 8.617e-5 *5500 ≈ 0.4739 eV.

So (8.57) / (0.4739) ≈ 18.09.

Wait, but wait a minute. The ratio N1/N2 is inversely proportional to the Boltzmann factor. Wait no, the ratio N2/N1 is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(kT) ), as per the Boltzmann equation. So N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So the ratio N1/N2 is (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(kT) ). So in that case, when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio N1/N2 increases. Because exp(-x) becomes smaller when x increases, so when T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so exponent becomes more negative, so N1/N2 increases.

Wait, but the question states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So in that scenario, when spots are present (T=5500 K), the ratio N1/N2 is lower than when T is 6000 K. But according to my calculation, when T decreases, N1/N2 would increase because the exponential term is getting larger (since exp(-x) is a decreasing function, so if x increases, exp(-x) decreases, so N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp(-x), as x increases, N1/N2 would decrease. Wait, wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Let me think again. The Boltzmann equation is N2 = N1 * (g2/g1) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp(ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is E2-E1.

So the ratio N1/N2 is the inverse, which is (g1/g2) exp( - ΔE/(kT) ).

So when T decreases, ΔE/(kT) increases. So the exponent becomes more positive in N2/N1, but for N1/N2, the exponent is negative. So as T decreases, the term -ΔE/(kT) becomes more negative, so exp(-ΔE/(kT)) decreases. Hence, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)).

If exp(-ΔE/(kT)) decreases as T decreases, then N1/N2 decreases. But wait, the question says when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases. So according to this, N1/N2 decreases when T decreases. So the ratio is lower when T is lower, which aligns with the problem statement. So the ratio is lower when the star has spots, which matches the situation given.

Now, the question is to find the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. So the ratio without spots (T=6000 K) divided by the ratio with spots (T=5500 K).

Let me write this down:

Ratio_without = N1/N2 at T=6000 K
Ratio_with = N1/N2 at T=5500 K

So the factor is Ratio_without / Ratio_with.

Which equals [ (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k*5500) ) ) ]

The g1/g2 terms cancel out. So it's exp( [ -ΔE/(k*6000) + ΔE/(k*5500) ] )

Factor = exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/5500 - 1/6000 ] )

Compute this term: 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 -5500)/(5500 *6000) ) = 500/(3.3e7) ) = 500 / 33,000,000 ≈ 1.515e-5.

Wait, 5500 *6000 = 33,000,000. 500 divided by that is 5e2 / 3.3e7 = approximately 1.515e-5.

So the exponent becomes (ΔE/k) * 1.515e-5.

Wait, but ΔE is 8.57 eV, and k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So (ΔE)/(k) = (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) ≈ 8.57 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ approximately 99430 K.

So (ΔE)/(k) ≈ 99430 K.

Multiply by 1.515e-5: 99430 * 1.515e-5 ≈ Let's compute that.

99430 * 1.515e-5 = 99430 * 0.00001515.

Let me compute 99430 * 0.00001515.

99430 = approx 9.943e4.

9.943e4 * 1.515e-5 = (9.943 * 1.515) * 1e-1.

9.943 * 1.515 ≈ Let's compute that.

10 * 1.515 is 15.15. But 9.943 is about 0.057 less than 10. So 1.515 * 0.057 is approx 0.086. So 15.15 - 0.086 ≈ 15.064.

Multiply by 1e-1: 1.5064.

So the exponent is approximately 1.5064. So factor = exp(1.5064).

Exp(1.5) is about 4.4817, and exp(1.5064) is a bit more. Let's compute it more accurately.

We know that ln(4.5) is about 1.5040. Hmm, wait, no, actually, wait: ln(4) is about 1.386, ln(5)=1.609.

Wait, let me compute exp(1.5064):

Using a calculator, but as I don't have one, I can approximate. Let me recall that exp(1.5) is about 4.4817.

1.5064 is 1.5 + 0.0064. The derivative of exp(x) is exp(x), so the change delta_x=0.0064 would lead to delta_exp ≈ exp(1.5)*0.0064 = 4.4817 * 0.0064 ≈ 0.0288.

So exp(1.5064) ≈ 4.4817 + 0.0288 ≈ 4.5105.

So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the answer should be option C.


The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when a star transitions from having no spots (Teff = 6000 K) to having spots (Teff = 5500 K). The ratio is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{N_1}{N_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is the energy difference, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The energy difference \( \Delta E \) is derived from the wavelength of the transition (\( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \)) using \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), yielding \( \Delta E \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV} \).

The ratio \( N_1/N_2 \) decreases as temperature decreases because the exponential term \( \exp(-\Delta E / kT) \) becomes smaller. To find the factor by which the ratio changes, we compute the ratio of \( N_1/N_2 \) at \( T = 6000 \, \text{K} \) to \( T = 5500 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{N_1}{N_2}\right)_{6000}}{\left(\frac{N_1}{N_2}\right)_{5500}} = \exp\left(\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E = 8.57 \, \text{eV} \), \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \), and \( \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \), the exponent becomes:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right) \approx \frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \cdot 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.5064.
\]

Thus, the factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.5064) \approx 4.5.
\]

This matches option C.
