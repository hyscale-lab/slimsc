Okay, so I need to figure out the energy of the RHIC when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So the atomic number for lithium is 3, but if it has 3 neutrons, that means it's Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons is 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number A=6. 

The question is about relativistic energy. So I remember that the total energy of a particle is given by the gamma factor multiplied by the rest mass energy. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). 

So first, I need to find gamma when v is 0.96c. Let's calculate beta first. Beta is v/c, which is 0.96 in this case. So beta is 0.96. 

Gamma (γ) = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). Let me compute that. 

Beta squared is 0.96^2, which is 0.9216. 1 minus that is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... let me think. What's the square of 0.28? 0.28^2 is 0.0784, right? So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Hmm, 1 divided by 0.28. Let's compute that. 

1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me calculate it more accurately. 0.28 times 3 is 0.84, 0.28*3.5 is 0.98, so 3.5714 is about 3.571428... So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6, which is a carbon-12 isotope? Wait, no, Li has atomic number 3. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of the nucleus can be found using the mass of the individual nucleons. 

But wait, maybe it's easier to look up the approximate mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Alternatively, I can use the atomic mass. But I don't have the exact mass, so perhaps I should use the fact that the mass of a nucleus can be approximated using the sum of the masses of its nucleons minus the binding energy, but that's probably too complicated. Alternatively, I can use the molar mass to get the atomic mass in kilograms. 

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the rest mass of the nucleus. Let me think about the rest mass in MeV/c². Because then the energy would be in GeV. 

I know that the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So each neutron is slightly heavier than a proton. 

So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass would be:

3 * 938 (protons) + 3 * 939 (neutrons) = 3*(938+939) = 3*(1877) = 5631 MeV. 

Wait, but that might not be accurate because the actual mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons due to binding energy. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the binding energy is the energy that holds the nucleus together, so the mass of the nucleus is actually less than the sum of the individual nucleons. So if I just add the masses of the protons and neutrons, I get a higher value than the actual mass of the nucleus. But wait, I'm supposed to find the rest mass energy of the nucleus. So perhaps I can use the exact value, but without the exact mass, I might need another approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that we can use the mass of the nucleus as approximately equal to the sum of the individual nucleons, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait. Another approach: for heavy ions, the mass is often approximated as A times the mass of a nucleon. But perhaps I should calculate the exact mass of Li-6. Let me think. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.013 u, where u is the atomic mass unit. 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So let me compute the rest mass energy in MeV.

Mass of Li-6 nucleus = 6.013 u. So in MeV/c², that's 6.013 * 931.5 ≈ let's compute that.

6 * 931.5 = 5589. 0.013 * 931.5 ≈ 12.11. So total is approximately 5589 +12.11 = 5601.11 MeV. 

Wait, but wait, isn't the atomic mass the mass including electrons? Oh right, for a nucleus, the mass is the atomic mass minus the electrons. But for heavy ions, perhaps the electrons are considered negligible, or maybe in this context, the problem expects me to use the atomic mass. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the nucleus is a composite particle, so its rest mass is given by the atomic mass multiplied by c². 

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the given data. Let me proceed with the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus as approximately 6 * (proton mass + neutron mass) / 2? No, that's not right. Let's think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact mass isn't needed, but the problem gives the speed, and I can compute the energy based on the rest mass. So maybe I should proceed as follows:

The total energy E is gamma * m0 c², where m0 is the rest mass.

So I have gamma as approx 3.5714, and m0 c² is the rest mass energy.

But I need to find E in GeV. So let's compute m0 c² in GeV.

Wait, the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c²,
