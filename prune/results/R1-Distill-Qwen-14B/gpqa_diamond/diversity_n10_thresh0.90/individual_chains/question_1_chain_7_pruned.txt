Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem states that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each giving a different energy value.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the energy-time uncertainty principle is relevant here. The principle says that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least h-bar over 2π, which is a tiny number. Wait, more precisely, the formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ℏ/(2π), but sometimes people approximate it as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, depending on the exact formulation.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, right? So ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But I'm not sure about the exact factors; sometimes I see it written as (ℏ/2π) for the uncertainty product. Oh wait, the energy-time uncertainty relation is often presented as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So that's the key.

So, the idea is that if the energy difference is too small, the two states won't be distinguishable because the uncertainty in the energy would be larger than the difference, making it impossible to tell them apart. 

In this problem, the lifetimes are given. Oh, wait, the lifetimes are the lifetimes of the states. So, each state has a certain lifetime, and the uncertainty in time for each state is roughly that lifetime. So for E1, the lifetime (Δt1) is 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, Δt2 is 1e-8 seconds. 

Wait, but how does that apply to the energy difference between E1 and E2? Let me think. If we're trying to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE must be such that the uncertainty in energy for each state is smaller than ΔE. Because if the uncertainty is bigger than the actual difference, the lines would overlap, and you wouldn't be able to tell them apart.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state and ensure that the energy difference is larger than both uncertainties. Wait, but the states themselves have their own uncertainties. So the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state's energy, perhaps?

Wait, no. Let's think differently. When you have two states, each with a certain uncertainty in energy, their energy separation must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, right? Because otherwise, the two energy levels would overlap in the uncertainty range, making them indistinguishable.

So the energy difference ΔE should be greater than the uncertainty in E1 plus the uncertainty in E2. Because each state has an uncertainty in its own energy due to their lifetimes. So for E1, the uncertainty ΔE1 is ħ/(2 Δt1). Similarly, ΔE2 is ħ/(2 Δt2).

So, the minimal ΔE that allows clear distinction would be when ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2. Or perhaps, the minimal ΔE is when it's greater than the maximum of the two individual uncertainties. I'm a bit confused. Let me think step by step.

First, compute the energy uncertainty for each state.

For state 1: ΔE1 = ħ / (2 * Δt1) 
Δt1 = 1e-9 s
So ΔE1 = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) 
Calculating that: 1.05e-34 / 2e-9 = approx 5.25e-26 J. Hmm, but we need this in eV because the options are in eV.

Wait, converting Joules to eV. Since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so to convert J to eV, divide by 1.602e-19.

So 5.25e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = approx 3.28e-7 eV. So about 3.28e-7 eV.

Wait, that seems small. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, ħ is about 1.05e-34 J·s. So for ΔE1: 1.05e-34/(2 * 1e-9) = 5.25e-26 J. Then 5.25e-26 / 1.602e-19 is indeed about 3.28e-7 eV.

Similarly, for state 2: Δt2 is 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = ħ/(2*Δt2) = (1.05e-34) / (2e-8) = approx 5.25e-27 J.

Convert that to eV: 5.25e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.28e-8 eV.

So, the uncertainties are ΔE1 ≈ 3.28e-7 eV, ΔE2 ≈ 3.28e-8 eV.

Wait, that seems correct. So ΔE1 is larger than ΔE2.

So the energy difference between E1 and E2 needs to be such that it is larger than the sum of the uncertainties from each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the total uncertainty, the two levels would overlap and you can't distinguish them.

So the minimal ΔE required is larger than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but wait. The energy difference is between E2 and E1, so if E2 is higher than E1, then ΔE = E2 - E1. To resolve them, ΔE should be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties.

So, let's compute ΔE1 + ΔE2: 3.28e-7 + 3.28e-8 = 3.608e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than about 3.6e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, which option is larger than this?

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → way smaller than 3.6e-7.

B)1e-11 → 0.00001e-6 → even smaller.

C)1e-4 → 0.1e-3 → which is 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is way larger than 3.6e-7.

D)1e-8 →0.01e-6 → 1e-8 is 0.01e-6, which is 0.01e-6 = 1e-8 eV. Wait, 1e-8 is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.01e-6 eV. 0.01e-6 eV is 1e-8 eV. Hmm, but 1e-8 is 0.01e-6 → which is 0.01 μeV, but 3.6e-7 eV is 0.36e-6 eV. So 1e-8 eV is
