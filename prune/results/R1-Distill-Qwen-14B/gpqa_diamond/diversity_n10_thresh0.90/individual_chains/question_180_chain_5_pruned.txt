Okay, let's see. I have this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, so the setup is that there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. 12 of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system.

Wait, so the 13th charge is at point P, which is fixed. So the other twelve are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. Since all the charges are the same, their interactions will contribute to the potential energy.

I remember that electric potential energy for a system of point charges is calculated by considering the work done to assemble them. The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. But since we have multiple charges, each pair contributes to the total energy.

Wait, but wait. Since all the 12 charges are identical and at the same distance from P, and the 13th is fixed, maybe I can think of this in terms of interactions between the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P, and also the interactions between the 12 charges themselves.

So there are two kinds of interactions here: between each of the 12 and the fixed charge, and between each pair of the 12 charges.

But wait, the 12 charges are all at the same distance from P, but are they arranged in some way that affects their mutual distances? Oh, but the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So perhaps they're all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m, centered at P. So each of them is 2 m away from P, but what about the distance between any two of them?

Hmm, that complicates things. Because the potential energy between two charges depends on the distance between them, not just from a central point. So if all 12 are on a sphere with radius 2m, the distances between any two can vary, but maybe to minimize the potential energy, they should be as far apart as possible? Or wait, wait. No, actually, for a system of like charges, the potential energy is minimized when they are as far apart as possible because the potential energy is positive and increases as they get closer. Wait, but wait, potential energy between two positive charges is positive, right? So bringing them closer increases the potential energy. So to minimize the energy
