Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about detecting transiting planets. I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both are Earth-like and have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. The researchers want to observe the one more likely to transit because they have limited time. So, the key here is figuring out which planet has a higher probability of transiting.

Let me go through the given information again to make sure I get all the details. Both planets have the same minimum mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Wait, no, actually, the period of Planet_1 is three times shorter. So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3. So Planet_1 is much closer to its star since its orbital period is shorter.

The host stars: the star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting. So same radius but different masses. I remember that more massive stars are usually bigger, but here the same radius suggests Planet_2's host is maybe a slightly evolved star, like a subgiant or something, but that might not matter much here.

The main point is transit probability. I recall that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star, and the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. But more specifically, the probability (P) is approximately (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (a / (a√(1-e²) + R_star)), but for circular orbits, e=0, so it simplifies. Wait, maybe it's more about the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance? Because a planet is more likely to transit if its orbital plane is edge-on relative to us.

Wait, but I think the main formula for transit probability is (R*/a), where R* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis (which for a circular orbit is the orbital radius). So the probability increases when R*/a is larger. That is, closer-in planets have a higher chance to transit. Because if the planet is closer (small a), the ratio R*/a is bigger, making the probability higher.

So let's think about Kepler's third law. The orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a, the mass of the star M*, and the gravitational constant G. The formula is P² = (4π²/G M*) * a³. Since both planets have the same minimum mass (so same planet mass), but their host stars have different masses. 

Wait, but wait, the problem states that both have the same mass, so same M_planet. But the host stars have different M*, which affects their orbital periods. Wait, no, the period is given: Planet_1's period is three times shorter. So for Planet_1, P1 = P2/3.

Wait, let me write down the variables:

For Planet_1:
- P1 = P2 / 3
- M*1 = 2 * M*2
- R1 = R2 (same radius)

For Planet_2:
- P2 = P2
- M*2 = M*2
- R2 = same as R1.

Also, both have circular orbits (e=0), so we don't have to worry about eccentricity in the transit probability.

So the transit probability depends on (R* / a)² times another factor. Wait, no, the exact formula for transit probability is P = (R*/a) * (1/(1 + (M_planet/(M_star))^(1/3))) )? Or maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is approximately (R*/a) multiplied by some function of the orbital inclination, but the main point is that a is the key. Wait, but the formula I've read before is P ≈ (R*/a) * (sqrt(1 - (R*/a)^2)), but that's when considering the chord across the star. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the geometry. 

The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is aligned such that it passes directly in front of the star. The probability depends on the size of the star relative to the planet's orbital distance. So if the planet is closer (smaller a), the probability of transit is higher because the alignment is more likely.

So the formula for the transit probability is P ≈ (R*/a) * (something else), but perhaps the main factor is R*/a. Alternatively, I've read that the transit probability (the chance that we observe a transit) is given by (R*/a) multiplied by some factor involving the star's size. Wait, another approach is to consider that the probability is proportional to (R*/a), but sometimes it's squared. Hmm, perhaps I should recall the exact formula.

Wait, I think the correct formula is approximately (R*/a)^2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the area of the star compared to the area of the orbit. No, maybe the probability is (R*/a) multiplied by the fraction of the orbit where the planet would pass in front. Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to model it.

The transit probability is the ratio of the star's angular size (as seen from Earth) to the planet's orbital distance. So, the probability is roughly (R*/a) multiplied by the impact parameter. Or maybe the probability is the area of the star's disk divided by the area of the planet's orbit. But that would be (π R*²)/(π a²) )= (R*/a)^2. But wait, that's not exactly correct because the planet is moving in a circular orbit, and only a small part of the orbit would result in a transit.

Alternatively, the correct formula is P ≈ (R*/a) multiplied by (1/a) or something else. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the solid angle. The solid angle of the star as seen from the planet's position is (π R*²)/(a²). So the probability that the planet passes in front of the star is the solid angle divided by 4π, so (π R*²)/(4 π a²) )= R*²/(4 a²). But I'm not sure; maybe this isn't accurate.

Alternatively, I've read that the probability is (R*/a)^2 multiplied by the duration of the part of the orbit where a transit is possible. That might complicate things, but perhaps for the purposes of this problem, the main factor is R*/a. 

Wait, another approach: the transit probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. The higher this ratio, the higher the probability. So for a given star, a closer planet (smaller a) would have a higher R*/a, hence higher transit probability.

So, to find which planet has a higher R*/a ratio, we can calculate R*/a for each planet.

But wait, let's think about the a for each planet. The semi-major axis a is related to the orbital period and the mass of the host star via Kepler's third law. Kepler's law is P² = (4 π² G)^(-1) * (4 π² a³)/(G M*). Wait, perhaps better written as P² = (4 π² a³)/(G M*), but I'm a bit rusty. Wait, the correct formula is P^2 = (4 π² a³)/(G (M* + m_planet)). But since M* >> m_planet, it simplifies to P² = (4 π² a³)/(G M*).

So, for each planet, a is proportional to (P² M*)^(1/3). Because rearranging, a³ = (G M* P²)/(4 π²), so a = [ (G M* P²)/(4 π²) ]^(1/3).

But since we're comparing a1 and a2, and given that P1 = P2/3, and M1 = 2 M2, let's compute a1 and a2.

Let me compute a1 in terms of a2.

Let me write a1 = [ (G M1 P1²) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3)

Similarly, a2 = [ (G M2 P2²) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3)

Taking the ratio a1/a2:

a1/a2 = [ (M1/M2) * (P1² / P2²) ]^(1/3)

Given that M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = P2/3 → P1² = P2² / 9.

So,

a1/a2 = [ (2) * (1/9) ]^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 * a2.

So Planet_1 has a smaller a than Planet_2. So R*/a for Planet_1 is (R*/a1) and for Planet_2 is (R2*/a2) but R* is the same for both. So R* is the same since both stars have same radius.

So, compute R*/a for each:

P1: R*/a1 = R*/(0.606 a2) ≈ (1 / 0.606) * (R*/a2) ≈ 1.65 * (R*/a2)

So R*/a for Planet_1 is about 1.65 times that of Planet_2.

Therefore, the transit probability is proportional to (R*/a), so Planet_1 would have a higher transit probability. Because for each, it's (R*/a), and since Planet_1 has a higher (R*/a), it's more probable to transit.

Wait, so Planet_1's (R*/a) is about 1.65 times that of Planet_2. So the probability for Planet_1 is higher. So the researchers should choose Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability.

So the correct option would be C since the (R*/a) ratio is 1.65 times higher, so the probability is higher by the same factor.

Wait a moment, let me confirm. Because the transit probability is (R*/a), and if R*/a is 1.65 times higher, then the probability is 1.65 times higher. So Option C states that Planet_1 has 1.65 times higher probability.

Yes, that must be correct. So the answer should be option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which depends on the ratio \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. A higher \( \frac{R_*}{a} \) corresponds to a higher transit probability.

### Key Information:
1. **Planet_1** has an orbital period \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (three times shorter than Planet_2's orbital period).
2. The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star (\( M_{*,1} = 2 M_{*,2} \)).
3. Both stars have the same radius (\( R_{*,1} = R_{*,2} \)).
4. Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to \( \left( M_* P^2 \right)^{1/3} \).

### Step 1: Compare \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \)
Using Kepler's law, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{M_{*,1}}{M_{*,2}} \cdot \frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} \right)^{1/3}
\]
Substituting \( M_{*,1} = 2 M_{*,2} \) and \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \):
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( 2 \cdot \frac{1}{9} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]
Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606 a_2 \), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its host star.

### Step 2: Compare \( \frac{R_*}{a} \) for Both Planets
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \). Since both stars have the same radius (\( R_{*,1} = R_{*,2} \)), we compare:
\[
\frac{R_*}{a_1} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{R_*}{a_2}
\]
From \( a_1 = 0.606 a_2 \):
\[
\frac{R_*}{a_1} = \frac{R_*}{0.606 a_2} \approx 1.65 \cdot \frac{R_*}{a_2}
\]
Thus, \( \frac{R_*}{a_1} \) is approximately 1.65 times higher than \( \frac{R_*}{a_2} \), meaning Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a higher probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The probability ratio is not 1.5 times.
- **Option C**: Correct. Planet_1 has a ~1.65 times higher probability.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The probability ratio is not 2.7 times.

### Conclusion:
Planet_1 has a higher transit probability due to its smaller orbital distance, making it the preferred target for observation.
