Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity, so the conductor isn't solid; there's an empty space inside. The center of this cavity is at a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and it's given that r is less than R. So, the cavity is entirely within the conductor.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are greater than R. Also, there's an angle theta between l and s.

Hmm. So, I think I should model this using Gauss's Law. I remember that for spherical conductors, the electric field outside depends on the enclosed charge. But wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. When a charge is placed inside the cavity, how does that affect the conductor?

I recall that when a charge is inside a conducting cavity, the conductor's inner and outer surfaces get induced charges. But wait, since the conductor was initially neutral, the total charge on the inner and outer surfaces must balance. Let me think: the charge inside the cavity (+q) will induce -q on the inner surface of the conductor, and since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q.

But wait, the conductor itself is neutral, so the inner surface must have -q and the outer surface +q, right? Because the total charge of the conductor is zero. So, the induced charge on the inner surface is -q, and the outer surface has +q (since the conductor's charge is zero, outer surface must have +q to balance the inner -q and the cavity's +q).

But when considering the electric field outside the conductor, the field is due to all enclosed charges. Since the conductor is a spherical shell beyond radius R, the field outside should be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So, for a point outside, the electric field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_enclosed)/L². Here, Q_enclosed is the charge outside the Gaussian surface? Wait, no, Gaussian surface is outside the conductor. The conductor's outer surface has +q, so the enclosed charge is +q. So E points radially outward, and its magnitude is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is exactly that. But wait, I'm not sure because the position of the charge inside the cavity matters for the inner surface, but does it affect the outer surface? I think the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform because the conductor is a sphere, so regardless of where the charge is placed inside the cavity, the outer induced charge remains the same. So the field outside depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q.

But wait, the point P's position relative to the cavity's center complicates things. Because the charge is inside the cavity, but the conductor's shape might affect the field. Or does it not matter? Because from the outside, the field only depends on the total enclosed charge, which is +q. So point P is outside the conductor, so the field E at P should be same as if all the charge were at the center, regardless of where the charge was placed inside the cavity.

Wait, but the problem gives l and L, and an angle theta. So perhaps the position of the charge inside the cavity affects the field? Or is that irrelevant because from outside the conductor, the field is determined by the total charge on the conductor's outer surface?

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts of the inner and outer surfaces. Let me recap:

- The conductor is neutral.
- A charge +q is placed inside the cavity.
- The inner surface of the conductor will have -q (induced by +q).
- The outer surface must have +q because the conductor's total charge is zero, so inner is -q, outer is +q, sum is zero. Wait, no, conductor's total charge is zero initially, and when the charge is placed inside, the conductor's net charge must be zero. So, the conductor's inner surface has -q, and outer surface has +q. So, the conductor as a whole is neutral? Wait, no, if the conductor was neutral, then the outer surface would have +q because the inner is -q, and the cavity has +q, so the conductor's total charge is (-q) + (+q) = 0, so yes, conductor remains neutral.

So, when considering the electric field at a point outside the conductor (P), the Gaussian surface encloses all the charge
