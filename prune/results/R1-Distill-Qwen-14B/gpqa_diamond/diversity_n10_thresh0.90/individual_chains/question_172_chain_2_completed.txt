Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere relates to the temperature through something called the Boltzmann distribution. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, wait. I need to clarify what exactly "twice as excited" means. I think it refers to the population of a higher energy level being twice as much as in the other star. Or maybe the excitation energy is higher. Wait, no, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. So that probably factors into the equation somehow.

Since the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the Boltzmann equation applies. The Boltzmann distribution tells us the ratio of populations in two energy levels. The formula is n2/n1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, let me denote the energy levels. Let's say star_1 has a higher population in the excited state. Wait, the problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. Oh, wait, maybe it's that the ratio of excited to ground state is twice as high in star_1 than star_2. Or perhaps star_1 has a higher number of atoms in the higher energy level.

Wait, the problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps for star_1, the number of excited atoms (say, in level E2) is twice that in star_2 for the same level. No, wait, the ratio is per star. So, n1 is the number in star_1, n2 in star_2. So, n1 = 2 * n2, perhaps? Or maybe the ratio n_upper/n_lower for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmm, maybe it's that the excitation level is higher in star_1. So the excitation potential is higher, so more atoms are in higher energy states.

Actually, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me restate. The situation is that star_1 has twice the excitation (in terms of population ratio) compared to star_2. So, the ratio n2/n1 (where n2 is the upper level and n1 is the lower) in star_1 is twice that in star_2.

Wait, no. Maybe the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. But without knowing the total number of atoms, that might not be directly useful. Oh wait, but the ratio between the same energy levels in each star is what's given. So, for each star, the ratio of upper to lower level is determined by the Boltzmann factor.

Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 = (n_upper1)/(n_lower1) and similarly R2 = (n_upper2)/(n_lower2). The problem states that R1 = 2 * R2.

So, R1 = 2 R2.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, R = exp( - (ΔE) / (k T) ), where ΔE is E_upper - E_lower.

So, for each star:

R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Given that R1 = 2 R2, substituting in the expressions:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Let me take natural logarithm on both sides to simplify this equation.

ln(exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) = ln(2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) )

Simplify the left side: -ΔE/(k T1 )

The right side: ln(2) + ln(exp(-ΔE/(k T2))) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

So putting it all together:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Hmm, rearrange terms. Let's bring the ΔE/(k T2) to the left and the others to the right.

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ -1/(T1) + 1/(T2) ] = ln(2 )

Which can be written as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T2 - T1) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2 )

Wait, let me compute the term inside the brackets. Let's see:

-1/T1 + 1/T2 = ( -T2 + T1 ) / (T1 T2 )? Wait, no, wait: Let me compute the common denominator.

-1/T1 = - T2 / (T1 T2 )

1/T2 = T1 / (T1 T2 )

So adding them: (-T2 + T1 ) / (T1 T2 ) = (T1 - T2 )/(T1 T2 )

So the equation becomes:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Wait, so:

[ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] * (ΔE/k) = ln(2 )

Hmm, but in the options, I see ln(2) equals some expression. So I'll need to rearrange this equation to solve for ln(2).

So, let's rearrange:

ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) * ΔE ) ] / ( k T1 T2 )

But looking at the options, I don't see ΔE in any of them. Oh wait, perhaps the ΔE is a given value but in the options, it's treated as a constant and not part of the equation. So perhaps we can factor out ΔE and k.

Wait, but the options don't have ΔE, so perhaps the equation can be manipulated in terms of T1 and T2.

Wait, but then again, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me go back.

Wait, the given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. But in the options, the equation is for ln(2) in terms of T1 and T2, so maybe the ΔE is a known constant and not part of the equation. So perhaps the equation can be written in terms of (T1 and T2) only.

Wait, but in any case, after taking the logarithms, we arrived at:

ln(2) = [ (ΔE/k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) ]

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step. Let me redo the equation.

Starting from R1 = 2 R2.

R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So, exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ):

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = 2

Take ln on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ) = ln(2)

Which is the same as:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2)

So,

ln(2) = [ (ΔE/(k)) (T1 - T2) ) ] / ( T1 T2 )

But since the problem gives the value of ΔE as 1.38e-23 J, but in the options, the equation is in terms of T1 and T2 only. So perhaps the equation can be written as:

ln(2) = ( (T1 - T2) ) / ( T1 T2 ) * (ΔE)/(k)

But considering that (ΔE)/(k) is a constant, but the options don't include it. So maybe this approach isn't correct, and perhaps I should have considered the ratio R1/R2 = 2.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ratio of the ratios is 2. So R1/R2 = 2.

R1/R2 = [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Which equals 2.

So, exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2.

Taking ln of both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2 )

Which can be rewritten as:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

As before.

But the problem is that none of the options have ΔE or k. So perhaps that line of thinking is incorrect, and I should approach it differently.

Wait, maybe I should think about the ratio of excitation temperatures. The excitation temperature is a concept where T_exc = (ΔE)/(k ln(n_upper/n_lower)). Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right way.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the excitation temperatures for the two stars is related to the ratio of their populations. Let me denote T_ex1 and T_ex2 as the excitation temperatures for each star. Then, for star 1, n_upper1/n_lower1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T_ex1) ), and similarly for star 2.

Given that n_upper1/n_lower1 = 2 * (n_upper2/n_lower2 ), so:

exp( -ΔE/(k T_ex1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T_ex2) )

Then, as before, this leads to:

-ΔE/(k T_ex1) + ΔE/(k T_ex2) ) = ln(2 )

Which can be rewritten as ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T_ex2) - 1/(T_ex1) ) ] = ln(2 )

But I'm not sure if that's the right path. Because the question is about the effective temperatures of the stars, which are T1 and T2, not the excitation temperatures. So perhaps I'm conflating two different temperatures here.

Wait, another thought: the effective temperature is the temperature that determines the overall emission, but the excitation of atoms depends on the local temperature. So in LTE, the excitation depends on the photospheric temperature.

So, the ratio of the excitation (n_upper/n_lower) is given by the Boltzmann factor involving the star's temperature. So for star 1, R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star 2, R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

Given that R1 = 2 R2, so:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ):

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) ) = 2

Which is the same as exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ) = 2.

Take ln of both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = ln(2 )

Which can be rearranged as:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

So,

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2) / ( T1 T2 )

But looking at the options, none have ΔE or k, so perhaps I must have made a mistake in my initial setup.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should define the ratio in terms of R1 = 2 R2. So,

R1 = 2 R2 => exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ):

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ) = 2.

Then, taking ln:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2 )

Which is the same as:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = [ ln(2) *k ] / ΔE

But the problem gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute [ ln(2)*k ] / ΔE.

k is Boltzmann's constant, approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

So, ln(2) ≈ 0.693.

So,

[ ln(2) *k ] / ΔE = (0.693 * 1.38e-23 J/K ) / (1.38e-23 J )

Which is (0.693 * 1e0 ) / 1e0 ) → 0.693.

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ≈ 0.693 → approximately ln(2) because 0.693 is ln(2).

Wait, wait. So:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ≈ 0.693 → which is ln(2).

Wait, that's interesting. So we can write:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Which would make the equation:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D says:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which matches this equation.

So the correct option is D.


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The key information provided is that the excitation level of iron atoms in star_1 is twice as high as in star_2, and the energy difference between the considered energy levels is ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J. The photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann distribution applies.

The Boltzmann distribution relates the ratio of populations in two energy levels to the temperature and energy difference:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( n_{\text{upper}} \) and \( n_{\text{lower}} \) are the populations of the upper and lower energy levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratios are:

\[
R_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad R_2 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that \( R_1 = 2 R_2 \). Substituting the expressions for \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \), we get:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Dividing both sides by \( \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right) \):

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Rearranging the terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Since \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), the ratio \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \). Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the form of option D:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is given by option D.

Answer: D
