Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read it again carefully.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its area. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, differing by 1000 K. The setup is that when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing brightness variations. But the twist is that this situation is being mistaken for an exoplanet transit. The question is: what size exoplanet would cause the same brightness change as these spots?

Wait, so the problem is asking, if the star didn't have these spots and instead there was a planet transiting in front of it, what would the planet's radius have to be to produce the same change in brightness as the spots do. So I need to calculate the radius of the planet relative to the star.

Hmm, okay. I remember that when a planet transits a star, the dip in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star.

The formula is usually: delta F / F = (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius.

But in this case, the star's brightness variation isn't due to a planet, but spots. So I need to figure out what the equivalent change in brightness is from the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same change.

Let me think about the star's brightness. The star has a Teff of 6000 K. The spots are cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K. Wait, wait, the temperature difference is 1000 K, so spots are at 5000 K.

But wait, the star's overall luminosity is based on its effective temperature and radius. The star's luminosity is L = 4πR²σTeff^4. Since the radius is same as the Sun, R is R_sun, so L is proportional to R^2 Teff^4.

But the spots contribute less because they're cooler. So the total flux from the star when spots are visible will be the normal flux minus the spots' contribution.

Wait, how does the spot coverage affect the total flux? The filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So in each hemisphere, spots cover 20% of the area. But wait, the star is a sphere, so each hemisphere is half the star's surface. Wait no, the star's surface area is 4πR², so each hemisphere is 2πR². So the spots cover 20% of that, which is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, but the star's entire surface is 4πR², so the spots cover 0.4πR², which is 0.1 or 10% of the entire surface area. Hmm, but wait the problem says one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%—wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, maybe the filling factor is 20% for each hemisphere. So each hemisphere is half the surface. So each has 20% spots. So both hemispheres together would have 40% spots. But in the problem, it's stated that only one hemisphere is spotty—so perhaps the total spot coverage is 20% of that hemisphere, which is 10% of the entire star's surface.

Wait, the question says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% in each hemisphere. Or is the filling factor the fraction of the hemisphere covered? Maybe I should model it that way.

Each hemisphere has 20% of its area covered in spots. So each hemisphere's area is 2πR². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR² per hemisphere. So since the star is a sphere, and only one hemisphere is spotty, the total area covered is 0.4πR².

Wait, that's 0.4πR². The total area of the star is 4πR². So the fraction is 0.4πR² / 4πR² = 0.1, or 10% of the star's surface is covered in spots.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered. So the entire star's surface is 4πR². Each hemisphere is 2πR². So the spots cover 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². Since only one hemisphere is spotty, that's the total spot area.

So the spot
