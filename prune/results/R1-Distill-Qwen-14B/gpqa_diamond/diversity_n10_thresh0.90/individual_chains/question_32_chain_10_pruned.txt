Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the energy of the RHIC when a nucleus is moving at 0.96c. The nucleus is Lithium with 3 neutrons, so that must be Li-6, right? Because Lithium typically has 3 protons, and adding 3 neutrons gives a mass number of 6.

So the question is about relativistic energy. I remember that when particles are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we have to use relativistic equations instead of classical ones. The main formula I think I'll need here is the relativistic energy equation, which is E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity of the particle.

Gamma is calculated using the formula gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So I need to find gamma when v is 0.96c. Let me plug that in. 

First, v = 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96c)^2. Let's compute that. 0.96 squared is 0.9216, so v squared is 0.9216 c squared. Then, 1 minus that is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... let me think, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 divided by 0.28. 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me be precise. 0.28 times 3.5714 is 1: 0.28 * 3 = 0.84, 0.28 * 0.5714 ≈ 0.16. So 0.84 + 0.16 = 1. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Next, I need the mass of the nucleus. It's Li-6, so I'll need its atomic mass. I recall that the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0175668 u (atomic mass units). Oh wait, but to calculate energy, I think I need to convert this mass into kilograms or perhaps use the mass in terms of u and then apply the conversion factor to GeV.

Wait, or maybe I can use the mass in u and multiply by the energy equivalent. I remember that 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So each atomic mass unit converts to 931.5 MeV. So the rest mass energy is m*c² = mass in u * 931.5 MeV.

So let me compute the rest mass energy of Li-6. Atomic mass is 6.0175668 u. Multiply by 931.5 MeV/u. Let me calculate that:

6.0175668 * 931.5 = ?

Let me compute step by step.

6 * 931.5 = 5589.

0.0175668 * 931.5 ≈ around 16.34 (since 0.0175 * 931.5 is 16.23, and the extra 0.0000668 is negligible). So total is approximately 5589 + 16.34 ≈ 5605.34 MeV. Which is 5.60534 GeV.

Wait, that seems right. Because 1 u is almost a GeV, so 6 u would be about 6 GeV, but Li-6 is a bit more than 6 u, so maybe around 5.6 GeV? Wait, wait, no, wait: 1 u is 931.5 MeV, which is 0.9315 GeV. So 6.0175668 u would be 6.0175668 * 0.9315 GeV.

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the calculation earlier. Let me correct that. So 6.0175668 u multiplied by 0.9315 GeV/u.

So 6 * 0.9315 = 5.589 GeV. 0.0175668 * 0.9315 ≈ 0.01635 GeV. Adding them gives 5.60535 GeV. So yes, about 5.60535 GeV is the rest energy.

Now, the total energy is gamma multiplied by this rest energy.

Gamma was approximately 3.5714. So:

E = 3.5714 * 5.60535 GeV ≈ ?

Let me compute 3.5714 *5.60535.

I can think of this as (3 + 0.5714) *5.60535.

3 *5.60535 = 16.81605 GeV

0.5714 *5.60535 ≈ let's compute 0.5 *5.60535 = 2.802675, and 0.0714 *5.60535 ≈ 0.401
