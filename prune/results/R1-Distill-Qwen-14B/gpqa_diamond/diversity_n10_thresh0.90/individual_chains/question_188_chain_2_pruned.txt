Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystal structures, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have a rhombohedral crystal. Oh right, a rhombohedral structure has all sides equal and all angles equal, right? So it's like a cube that's been deformed so all the angles are the same. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between atoms along the lattice parameter, right? So the lattice parameter 'a' is 10 Angstroms.

The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Oh wait, wait! Wait a second. No, wait. That can't be right. Because in a rhombohedral structure, the angles are all equal, but 30 degrees seems quite small. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with another type of crystal structure. Oh, wait, no—rhombohedral can have angles other than 90 degrees. So maybe in this case, all angles are 30 degrees.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Interplanar distance, okay. I remember that the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + (h^2)(something) + ... Wait, no, wait. I think the formula is d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(hl cos beta) + 2(kl cos alpha) )) ), but I'm not sure. Or maybe that's for a more general case.

Wait, no. I think in the case where the crystal is cubic, the formula simplifies because all angles are 90 degrees. But here, it's a rhombohedral structure, so all angles are the same. Wait, but in this problem, the angles are 30 degrees each. Hmm.

Wait, no, maybe I should recall the general formula for interplanar spacing. The formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal is given by:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(hl cos beta) + 2(kl cos alpha) )

But wait, is that correct? Or is there a different arrangement? I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Oh, right, I think actually the formula is d^2 = (a^2)/(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2hk cos alpha + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos gamma) ), but wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos alpha - 2hl cos beta - 2kl cos gamma ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, no, I think I mixed up the signs. Let me think again. The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos gamma) - 2(hl cos beta) - 2(kl cos alpha) )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach or think about the specific case of a rhombohedral structure.

In a rhombohedral lattice, all lattice parameters are equal, a = b = c, and all angles are the same: alpha = beta = gamma. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, I think I saw a formula for d for rhombohedral systems. Let me think. Oh, right, for a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar distance can be expressed as:

d_{hkl} = a * sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - hk - hl - kl ) / sqrt(3)

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Alternatively, I think there's a relation involving the dot product or vectors. The interplanar distance is related to the reciprocal lattice. Hmm, maybe I should use the general formula with the angles involved.

Wait, in this case, the Miller indices are (1,1,1). So h=1, k=1, l=1.

The formula I think I should use is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) / (a²)

But wait, in a rhombohedral system, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all equal. So alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees. So cos(alpha) = cos(30 degrees) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So let me plug in the numbers.

First, compute the numerator:

h² + k² + l² = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Then, the other terms: hk + hl + kl. Since h=k=l=1, hk=1, hl=1, kl=1. So sum is 3. Multiply by cos alpha: 3 * (sqrt(3)/2) = (3 sqrt(3))/2.

So putting it all together:

1/d² = (3)/(a²) - 2 * [ (3 sqrt(3)/2) ] / a².

Simplify:

1/d² = [3 - 3 sqrt(3)] / a².

So d² = a² / (3 - 3 sqrt(3)).

Hmm, wait, let me compute that denominator.

3 - 3 sqrt(3) = 3(1 - sqrt(3)).

So d² = a² / [3(1 - sqrt(3))].

Wait, but 1 - sqrt(3) is negative because sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 1 - 1.732 ≈ -0.732. So the denominator is 3 times a negative number.

Wait, but that can't be right because 1/d² can't be negative. So I must have made a mistake in the sign somewhere.

Ah, I think I messed up the formula. Let me double-check. The correct formula for the interplanar distance is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha)/(a²)

Wait, no, wait. Let me look up the correct formula. Oh wait, I can't look it up, but I can think about it.

The interplanar distance is given by:

d = [ (a² (h² + k² + l²) - 2 a² (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ) ]^(-1/2) )

Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = [ (h² + k² + l²) - 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ]^(-1/2) * a

Wait, that makes sense because the denominator would be a squared.

Wait, no, more accurately, the formula is:

d
