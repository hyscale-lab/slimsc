Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's a bit involved, but let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The first part of the question involves heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) are treated with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably forming an alkene. Wait, but adamantane is a pretty rigid structure, right? So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromines on adjacent carbons in the adamantane framework. Heating with KOH would likely eliminate HBr from each Br, forming a double bond. So the product would be 1,3-adamantadiene maybe? Or perhaps a different structure since adamantane is a diamondoid.

Looking at the product's 1H NMR: 4.79 ppm (2H) suggests something with two equivalent protons, maybe adjacent to an oxygen. Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. Oh wait, maybe the elimination forms a bridge or a carbonyl? Wait, wait. KOH is a strong base, but sometimes can also act as a nucleophile. Wait, when dihalides react with KOH, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation (elimination) to form an alkene, but in this case, maybe the structure leads to forming a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: if both bromines are on adjacent carbons and are eliminated with KOH, perhaps the structure forms a cyclopropane ring? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diepoxide formation, but that usually requires a peracid. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR shows 4.79 ppm for 2H. That could be an -OCH2- group. So maybe the product is an epoxide? But then the IR would show an epoxide peak around 1250 cm-1 or so, but the given IR is at 1720, which is more of a ketone or ester. Hmm. Maybe the product is an ester or ketone.

Wait, perhaps it's a diol. But then the NMR wouldn't have a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. But with KOH, perhaps it's more elimination.

Wait, another approach. The product is a light yellow solid. I think when you have a dihalide reacting with a strong base, you get an elimination to form an alkene. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules to form 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. But where would the NMR peaks come from?

Wait, but the NMR shows peaks at 4.79 ppm for 2H, which is a bit deshielded, maybe adjacent to an oxygen. Then the IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone. Wait, but how would that form from a dihalide with KOH? Maybe via some kind of oxidation, but KOH isn't typically an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to each Br, leading to a double bond, but perhaps in adamantane, that's not possible. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the dibromide is treated with KOH to form a bridged structure. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—when heated with KOH, perhaps it forms a cyclopropane ring? Because in adamantane, the 1,3 positions are on adjacent carbons in different rings. No, that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol-like rearrangement, but that usually involves vicinal diols.

Wait, another angle: the IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm−1, which points to an ester or ketone. If the product is a ketone, maybe the elimination forms a carbonyl. But how?

Wait, perhaps the base is deprotonating to form a carbanion, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, leading to the formation of a ketone. Wait, no, elimination would form a double bond, not a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think about the possible structures.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The structure of adamantane is a diamond-like structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So, 1 and 3 positions are adjacent in this structure. So when you have two Brs on adjacent carbons, heating with KOH (a strong base) would likely lead to elimination of HBr twice, forming a double bond. So the product would be an adamantadiene, which is an alkene.

But then, where does the carbonyl come from? Because the IR shows 1720. So maybe I'm wrong about the product. Alternatively, perhaps it's not elimination but substitution. Wait, KOH could be a nucleophile. If both Brs are on adjacent carbons, could they each substitute with hydroxide, forming a diol? But a diol would have OH groups, which would absorb around 3300 cm−1 in IR, which is not mentioned here. But the IR here has a peak at 1720, so that's not likely.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a Dieckmann condensation or some kind of cyclization, but that's for esters. Not sure.

Wait, another approach: the first product is 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH. Product 1 has a carbonyl group. So perhaps the product is a cyclohexanone derivative. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbonyl via elimination of HBr. Wait, but that's a single elimination, but we have two Brs. So maybe two eliminations, each forming a carbonyl. Hmm, but that would require each Br to lose with a hydrogen, forming two carbonyls. But that would require each Br to be on a carbon adjacent to another that can lose a hydrogen.

Alternatively, perhaps the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and when each eliminates HBr, the two adjacent carbons each lose a Br and a hydrogen, forming a double bond. So the product would be an alkene bridge. But how does that give a carbonyl?

Wait, perhaps the product isn't the di-elimination product, but maybe a substitution. If one Br is replaced by OH, but with excess KOH, perhaps both Brs are replaced, leading to a diol. But the IR doesn't show the OH stretch, but maybe it's a cyclic ether. Wait, but then what would the IR show? Alternatively, perhaps the diol is oxidized, but I don't think KOH would oxidize it.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide. But then the IR would show the epoxide's C-O-C peak around 1250 cm−1, which isn't given. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. How? Maybe the elimination leads to a bridged structure where a carbonyl forms. Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates, and then an elimination occurs to form a carbonyl. Wait, that's similar to the formation of a ketone from a vicinal dihalide. Oh wait, I think I've heard of something like the formation of ketones from dihalides using strong bases. Wait, when vicinal dihalides are treated with a strong base like KOH, sometimes they can undergo dehydrohalogenation twice to form a carbonyl. For example, if you have 1,2-dibromoethane and KOH, it can form ethylene, but that's not a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe if the dihalide is in a cyclic structure. Wait, perhaps the structure allows the elimination of two HBr molecules, each leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. Wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms an alkene, and then some other reaction occurs. But the product's NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. Maybe it's
