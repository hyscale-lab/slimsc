Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their mass is negligible, which probably means we don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals.

The options are A to D, with some numbers in the order of 10^-26 or 10^-27, so the answer is likely a very small number, probably in the realm of electric potential energy calculations.

Hmm, okay. So all particles have the same charge, 2e. I remember that the electric potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula. The formula is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C², q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

Wait, but when dealing with multiple charges, the total potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for a system of n charges, you have to calculate all possible pairs. Oh yeah, because each charge interacts with every other charge.

Let me think: in this case, there are 13 charges. But one of them is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are at 2 meters away from P. So the 13th charge is at the center, and the others are arranged in a sphere around it, each at a radius of 2 meters. But wait, wait, the problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So the 13th is at P, so the distance between the 13th and each of the 12 is 2 meters.

Wait, but the 12 charges are at 2 meters from P. Are they all at the same point? Or are they spread out on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P? Hmm, the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2m from P. So each of those 12 is at 2m from P, but their exact positions relative to each other aren't specified. Since the problem is asking for the minimum energy, I think the configuration that gives the minimum potential energy is when the charges are placed as close as possible to each other. But wait, all the 12 are at a fixed distance from the central charge, but how are they arranged?

Wait, but potential energy calculations between multiple charges involve each pair. So each of the 12 charges will have interactions with the central charge and also with each other. Since the 12 are all at 2m from P, their mutual distances would vary depending on how they're arranged. But the system's energy is the sum of all the pairwise potentials. To find the minimum energy, perhaps arranging the 12 charges as close as possible to each other would lead to lower potential energy? Or wait, no, because all of them are identical and positive (since each charge is 2e, which is positive), so bringing them closer would actually make the repulsion stronger, increasing the potential energy. Wait, that's right. For like charges, the potential energy is positive because you have to do work against the repulsion to bring them closer. So arranging them as close as possible would actually increase the potential energy, not decrease.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the potential energy is the work done to assemble the system. For positive charges, bringing them closer requires work, so the potential energy is positive. So the system's potential energy is the sum of all pairwise potentials. So to find the minimum energy, I might need to arrange the charges in such a way that the potential energy is minimized. But wait, all the 12 charges are fixed at 2m from P. Are they allowed to move relative to each other, or are they fixed in place? The problem says 12 are
