Okay, so I've got this question about the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon. The goal is to find the momentum of that photon so the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state. The options are given, so I need to calculate the correct momentum.

Wait, the molecule is diatomic, made of elements X and Y. Their masses are given: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. 

So, I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state would be the lowest energy state, which is the ground state for both rotation and vibration. But when it absorbs a photon, it can transition to the next higher state. But wait, the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy—so I think that refers to the next in the rotational state, assuming the vibrational state is already in its lowest?

Wait no, maybe the molecule is in the ground vibrational state and the ground rotational state (like v=0 and J=0). When a photon is absorbed, it could either change the vibrational state (v increase by 1) or the rotational state (J increases by 1). But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, which I think would be the next vibrational state. Because in vibrational spectra, transitions are usually from v=0 to v=1, which is a higher energy jump. Alternatively, rotational transitions are usually from J to J+1, which are lower energy.

Wait no, let me think again. The energy levels for a diatomic molecule in the rotation-vibration model are given by the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. The vibrational energy is quantized as (v + 1/2) ħω, and the rotational energy is (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is v=0 and J=0. When a photon is absorbed, the molecule can transition to the next higher energy state, which would be either increasing J by 1 (J=0→1) or increasing v by
