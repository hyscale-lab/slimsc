Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. Let's break down the information given.

First, Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. That probably means X contains an element with a higher atomic number isotope. Maybe it's something like Cl-35 vs Cl-37, but wait, no, wait—wait, the heavier isotope. So like, perhaps an element with a common isotope that's heavier than usual. Hmm.

The reaction is violent and releases gas W. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, the molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons. Let me think: the number of protons is the atomic number, and neutrons are the mass number minus protons. So, for a molecule, maybe each atom has the same number of protons and neutrons. Or maybe the molecule as a whole—like, for example, if it's H2O, but that doesn't fit. Wait, the problem says the molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So, for each molecule, total protons = total neutrons.

Wait, no, maybe each molecule's composition. Let me think: for example, CO2 is a molecule. But in that case, each molecule has 1 C (6 protons, 6 neutrons?) and 2 O (each with 8 protons, 8 neutrons). Wait, but that's per atom, not per molecule. Alternatively, maybe the molecule as a whole has equal number of protons and neutrons. Hmm.

Wait, but let's think about possible gases that form when elements react. For example, if X is a metal reacting with an acid, you might get H2 gas. But H2 has two protons and two neutrons (since each H is 1 p and 1 n). So each H atom has 1p and 1n. So in H2, total protons = 2, total neutrons = 2. So yes, same. So maybe W is H2.

But let me not jump to conclusions yet. Let's see.

The precipitate G forms when X reacts with Y. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B under normal conditions is close to 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What substance melts around there? Well, water freezes at 273 K (0 C), so 277 is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe something like camphor? Or maybe it's another material, but perhaps more likely, it's a different substance. Wait, another thought: 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What melts around there? Maybe something like a low-melting metal, but that's probably not it. Alternatively, maybe B is a compound that's a solid at room temp but melts just above 0. Wait, another idea: magnesium nitride? No, that's not it. Hmm, maybe B is a type of salt. Alternatively, perhaps B is something like sodium hydroxide, but wait, no, that's not it. Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal. Let me think: Perhaps B is sodium or another metal. Wait, but sodium's melting point is around 371 K, which is higher. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound. Alternatively, perhaps B is a carbonate? No, that's not it. Hmm.

Wait, another angle. The precipitate G when heated gives B. So perhaps G is a carbonate that upon heating decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. For example, perhaps G is a carbonate, and heating it gives B as a metal oxide. But then B's melting point is around 277 K. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps B is a metal with a low melting point. Let me think: Mercury is a liquid at room temperature, but its melting point is around 234 K. That's lower than 277. Lead has a higher melting point. Wait, but 277 K is 4 C, so maybe it's a substance that's solid at 0 C but melts just above. Oh! Wait, maybe B is camphor. Camphor has a melting point around 177°C, which is higher than 277 K. No, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe it's a different compound. Alternatively, maybe B is something like paraffin wax, but that's not a pure substance. Alternatively, perhaps it's a very low melting point solid like a certain organic compound. Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal that's liquid near that temperature. Let me check some melting points:

- Mercury: ~234 K (melting point)
- Gallium: ~300 K (so 27 C)
Wait, wait! Gallium's melting point is about 29.78°C, which is 302.93 K. That's very close to 277 K? No, 277 is about 4 C. Hmm, no, that's higher. Wait, no, wait 277 K is 4 C, and Gallium's melting point is 29.78°C, which is 302.93 K. So 302 is higher than 277. So maybe not. Hmm.

Wait, another thought. The melting point of B is about 277 K. So let's calculate 277 K in Celsius: 277 - 273.15 = 3.85°C, so about 4°C. So a substance that's solid at 0°C and melts just above. What's that? Maybe paraffin wax? No, it melts higher. Maybe some sort of fat? Or perhaps a salt that has a low melting point. Wait, perhaps B is a hydrate. Or maybe it's a different kind of compound. Alternatively, perhaps it's a metal like indium? Let me check indium's melting point. Indium has a melting point of about 156.6°C, which is way higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a different approach. The problem says "the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen." So, when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. Hmm, X is reacting with a keto acid to produce something with 2 O atoms.

Wait, let me think about this. A keto acid is an organic acid with a ketone group. For example, something like acetoacetic acid. When such an acid reacts with a strong base like X, perhaps it forms a salt and water. But the product has two oxygen atoms. Hmm, wait, maybe the product is a carboxylate salt. For example, if the keto acid is RCOOH, then reacting with a base like NaOH would produce RCOO^- Na^+ and water. But that product would have more than two oxygen atoms. Hmm, maybe I'm not thinking correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps when the keto acid reacts with X, it forms something like a ketone and a carbonate? Wait, no, perhaps the reaction is something else.

Wait, what's a common reaction where a keto acid reacts with a base? Maybe it's a decarboxylation reaction. For example, when a beta-keto acid is heated with a base, it can lose CO2 and form a ketone. So the product would be a ketone. That ketone would have how many oxygen atoms? A ketone has one oxygen. So the product has one O. But the question says two O atoms. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonate. Wait, if the keto acid reacts with a carbonate, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a hemiacetal or something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is an ester, but that seems unrelated. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydration reaction. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a diethyl ether or something else, but that's a stretch.

Wait, maybe the product is a carbonate with two oxygens. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, another angle: the product has two atoms of oxygen. So maybe it's a CO2 molecule? No, that's a single molecule but with two O atoms. But that's just CO2, which has two O atoms. But the product is a compound, so perhaps the product is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, but that has three O per CO3^2-.

Wait, perhaps the product is a peroxide, but that's not likely. Hmm, this part is confusing. Let me put this aside for a moment and think about other parts.

The substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. That makes me think of common reagents. For example, NaOH is used as a base in many reactions, but it's a strong base. Alternatively, maybe something like KMnO4 or K2Cr2O7, which are oxidizing agents. But wait, the question says X incorporates a heavier isotope. So perhaps X is an element with an isotope that is heavier. For example, chlorine has Cl-35 and Cl-37. If X contains Cl-37, which is heavier.

Wait, but the reaction with Y produces gas W. Let's say Y is an acid. For example, if X is NaOH (a base), and Y is H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), then the reaction would produce Na2SO4, water, and release gas? No, that doesn't fit. Or if X is something else.

Wait, perhaps X is a carbonate. Let's say X is Na2CO3. Reacting with H2SO4 (liquid Y) would produce CO2 gas (W), Na2SO4, and water. So W would be CO2. Now, CO2 has one carbon and two oxygens. The number of protons in CO2 would be 12 (6 from C, 6 from two O's 8 each, but wait, that's for each atom. But the molecule as a whole: C has 6 protons, each O has 8. So total protons: 6 + 8*2 = 22. Neutrons: C has 6 (since it's C-12), each O has 8. So total neutrons: 6 + 8*2 = 22. So yes, same number of protons and neutrons. So W is CO2. That fits!

So in this scenario, X is Na2CO3. But wait, the problem says "substance X incorporates a heavier isotope." Sodium's main isotope is Na-23, which is stable. But if X is Na2CO3, then the C in it could be C-12, C-13, or C-14. Wait, but the problem says X has a heavier isotope, so maybe the C is C-13 or C-14. Wait, but the question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X.

Wait, but X is Na2CO3. So the elements are Na, C, and O. The lightest is Na (atomic number 11), C (6), O (8). So lightest is C at 6, heaviest is O at 8. Wait, but Na's atomic number is 11, which is higher than O's 8. Oh wait, wait, O is 8, Na is 11, so Na is heavier. So the elements in X are Na, C, O. So lightest element is C (6), heaviest is Na (11). So their atomic masses: C is 12, Na is about 23. So 12 + 23 = 35. Hmm, option A is 35.

But wait, looking back, the problem says that the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains two atoms of oxygen. So if X is Na2CO3, and the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (which is a beta-keto acid), then the reaction between a beta-keto acid and sodium carbonate would produce CO2 and a sodium salt. But I'm not sure how that product would have two oxygen atoms. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. Let me think: if a beta-keto acid reacts with a base like X (Na2CO3), maybe it loses CO2 and forms a ketone. So the product would be a ketone, which has one oxygen. But the question says two oxygen atoms. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe my assumption that X is Na2CO3 is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps X is sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3. Let's see: reacting with an acid would release CO2, same as before. But let's see if that helps with the other condition.

Wait, maybe the product of the reaction is a carbonate. For example, if a keto acid reacts with X (like Na2CO3), perhaps it forms a different salt. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's think about what X is. The problem says that when X reacts with Y, a precipitate G forms. When G is heated, B is released. So perhaps G is a carbonate, which upon heating decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. For example, heating Na2CO3 would give Na2O and CO2, but I don't think that's correct. Wait, no. Sodium carbonate upon heating decomposes into sodium oxide and carbon dioxide: 2 Na2CO3 → 2 Na2O + 3 CO2↑. But does Na2O have a low melting point? Sodium oxide's melting point is around 1650°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that can't be B.

Wait, perhaps G is a hydroxide. Like, if Y is an acid, and X is a carbonate, perhaps the reaction produces a precipitate of a metal hydroxide. For example, if X is Na2CO3 and Y is a metal nitrate, but that seems complicated.

Wait, another thought: perhaps Y is water, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid like HCl. Then X might be a carbonate. Let me see.

Wait, another angle: X is a heavier isotope, so perhaps X is a heavier version of a common element. For example, chlorine has two main isotopes, Cl-35 and Cl-37. But if X is Cl-37, then X would be a form of chlorine. But chlorine is a diatomic element (Cl2), so perhaps X is Cl2 containing Cl-37.

Wait, but then what would Y be? If X is Cl2, reacting with Y might produce HCl and gas, but the gas W would need to have same protons and neutrons. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a heavier isotope of sodium, like Na-25 (which doesn't exist) or wait, sodium's main isotope is Na-23. So if X is Na-23, but heavier isotope would be something else? Wait, perhaps it's potassium. No, sodium's isotopes are up to Na-23, which is the most stable. So perhaps X is not a metal but a nonmetal.

Wait, perhaps X is a heavier isotope of oxygen. Like O-18. But O is usually O-16. So if X contains O-18, but I'm not sure how that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like carbon with a heavier isotope, like C-14. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me go back to looking at the melting point of B. If B is something that melts around 277 K, which is about 4°C, what could that be? Let me think: maybe it's a type of wax or a specific compound. Alternatively, perhaps B is a hydrated salt. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate has a melting point lower than the anhydrous form. But I'm not sure about the exact temperature.

Wait, another approach: maybe B is a different kind of compound. Let's say G is a carbonate, and when heated, it produces B as a metal oxide and CO2. But I'm not getting anywhere with that. Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide, and upon heating, it gives a metal oxide and water. For example, heating copper hydroxide gives copper oxide and water. But that doesn't explain the melting point.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a sulfate, and heating gives a metal oxide and SO3. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps B is a type of alcohol. For example, ethanol has a melting point of -114°C, which is way below 277 K. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound.

Wait, another thought: perhaps B is a metal that's liquid near 277 K. Wait, mercury's melting point is -39°C (234 K), which is lower than 277 K. So at 4°C, mercury is still liquid. But then again, B is a solid, as it has a melting point at that temperature. Wait, maybe B is a metal that's solid at 4°C. Hmm.
