Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, I remember that SMEFT is built from the Standard Model, so it must preserve the symmetries of the SM. Oh right, the Standard Model has certain symmetries. So what are they?

The SM is Lorentz invariant, that's for sure. Lorentz symmetry includes things like rotations and boosts. Then Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz and translations. So if the SM has Poincare symmetry, SMEFT must too, because it's an effective theory built from the SM.

Wait, but are they the same? Because Poincare includes both Lorentz and translations. So if a theory respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So in that case, do I need to include both? Or is one a subset of the other?

Wait the question is about which must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. So the options include 1 (Lorentz) and 2 (Poincare). If all operators respect Poincare, then they must respect Lorentz too. So maybe if Poincare is required, Lorentz is automatically required.

But wait, can a theory respect Lorentz but not Poincare? Because Poincare includes the translation symmetry. So SMEFT should respect both because the SM does, and SMEFT is an effective theory derived from it.

So if the question includes both, then maybe options include both 1 and 2. But wait, looking at the answer options, option A is 1 and 2, option C is 1,2,4. So I need to think about whether all operators must respect Poincare.

But wait, in SMEFT, the operators are classified based on their dimension. The operators are constructed by taking higher-dimensional terms that are consistent with the symmetries of the SM. So SMEFT is built with operators that respect the same symmetries as the SM, which includes Lorentz and Poincare.

Wait, but is Poincare symmetry a separate symmetry or is it implied by Lorentz and others? Because Poincare includes Lorentz and translational symmetries. So in SMEFT, all operators must respect Poincare, which implies they must also respect Lorentz.

So if all operators respect Poincare, then they automatically respect Lorentz. So the question is, do all operators have to respect Poincare? Because the SM does, and SMEFT is an effective theory built from it, I think yes.

Therefore, options 1 and 2 must be correct. But looking at the options, option A is 1 and 2. But let's check the other options as well.

What about CP and CPT symmetries? The SM doesn't have CP symmetry as a fundamental symmetry. Wait, the SM does have CPT symmetry, but not necessarily CP. For example, the SM has CP violation in the CKM matrix.

So SMEFT, being a low-energy effective theory of the SM, would respect the same symmetries as the SM. So in the SM, the operators respect CPT symmetry but not necessarily CP. So in SMEFT, the operators must respect CPT symmetry, but not necessarily CP.

Wait, the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So for SMEFT, operators must respect CPT, but not CP. Because the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, but it does have CPT.

Wait, does the SMEFT respect CPT? Because the SM does. So all operators must respect CPT. So options 4 (CPT) is a must.

What about CP? Because the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, SMEFT doesn't either. So operators in SMEFT may or may not respect CP symmetry, but they must respect CPT.

So the correct symmetries are Lorentz (1), Poincare(2), and CPT (4). So that's options 1,2,4. Which would correspond to option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought that if Poincare is required, then Lorentz is automatically included. So the answer would include 1 and 2, and 4.

Looking back at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So that's option C.

Wait, but another thought: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all operators must be Lorentz scalars. So Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected. Poincare includes translations, but SMEFT is formulated in a way that the S-matrix is a Poincare invariant object. But perhaps the individual operators don't necessarily have to respect Poincare symmetry as a global symmetry, but the theory as a whole must be Poincare invariant.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. The operators themselves must form a Lorentz-invariant theory. So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, but the notion of Poincare symmetry might be more about the entire theory than individual operators.

Hmm, perhaps the correct symmetries that all operators must respect are Lorentz (1), and CPT (4). But then what about Poincare? Because Poincare includes translations, but SMEFT operators are local, so maybe the operators are built respecting local Lorentz symmetry, which is part of the framework.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about whether the operators in SMEFT are required to respect Poincare symmetry. Since the SM respects Poincare symmetry, the effective theory must also. So all terms in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be Poincare invariant. Because Poincare invariance is a fundamental symmetry of the SM.

So the answer is 1, 2, and 4. So the correct options are 1,2,4, which is option C.

Wait, another angle: the question is about which symmetries 'must be respected by all operators' in SMEFT. So the operators must be invariant under these symmetries.

Lorentz symmetry: yes, because operators are Lorentz scalars.

Poincare symmetry: since Poincare includes Lorentz and translations, but the operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian are local terms. So the individual terms in the Lagrangian might not have to be invariant under spatial translations, because the Lagrangian density is. Wait, no, each operator in the Lagrangian must be a Poincare invariant operator because the entire theory is Poincare invariant.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the symmetries that the effective theory must have. SMEFT must have the same symmetry as the SM, which includes Lorentz and CPT, but not necessarily CP. Poincare is part of the SM's symmetries, so SMEFT must respect it.

Thus, the correct symmetries are 1, 2, and 4. So the answer is C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an effective theory derived from the Standard Model (SM), and it must respect the same symmetries as the SM. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SM is Lorentz-invariant, and SMEFT is constructed from the SM. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. This is a fundamental requirement.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. Since the SM respects Poincaré symmetry, SMEFT must also respect it. This implies that all operators in SMEFT must be Poincaré-invariant.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not respect CP symmetry due to CP violation (e.g., in the CKM matrix). Since SMEFT is derived from the SM, it does not necessarily respect CP symmetry either. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM respects CPT symmetry, and SMEFT inherits this property. Thus, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected, as the SM does not enforce it.

Thus, the correct combination of symmetries is 1, 2, and 4, which corresponds to **Option C**.

Answer: C
