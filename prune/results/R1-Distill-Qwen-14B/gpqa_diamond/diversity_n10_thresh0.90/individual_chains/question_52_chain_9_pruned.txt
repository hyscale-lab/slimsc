Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully and then unpacking each part.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that when stars have spots, their overall brightness and temperature can change, which affects the spectral lines we observe.

So, the star's parameters are given: 1.5 solar radius, 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but wait—dark spots on a star are cooler regions, right? So when spots cover part of the surface, the star's overall emission decreases. But how does that change the effective temperature?

Wait, the effective temperature is a measure of the star's total luminosity. Oh, right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law says L = 4πR²σTeff^4. But in this problem, the Teff given when 40% is spotted is the overall photospheric effective temperature. So the star's overall Teff is lower when spots are present.

But how does this affect the ionization state of the photosphere? Well, the photosphere's temperature is what determines the ionization levels of atoms. Lower temperature means more neutral atoms, perhaps? Or wait, the ionization depends on the local temperature where the atoms are. But when spots are present, the photosphere's overall temperature is lower, but the spots themselves are cooler. So the average might be lower.

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So the average Teff across the photosphere is lower. But the spots are part of the photosphere too, so maybe the typical temperature of the photosphere is lower. So the photosphere is cooler on average when spots are present.

Now, the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. And we need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Wait, the ratio R = (n1)/(n2), where n1 and n2 are the number of atoms in levels 1 and 2, respectively. The problem says that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So when the star is spotless, the ratio is higher. So the factor would be the spotless ratio divided by the spotted ratio.

In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy), E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the transition between these levels is at 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet. Ti lines in this region are probably from neutral Ti, as ionized Ti would have different transitions
