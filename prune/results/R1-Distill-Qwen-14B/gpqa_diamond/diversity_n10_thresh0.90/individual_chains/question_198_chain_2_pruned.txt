Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations are given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants β1 to β4 are provided as 9, 40, 63, and 16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, stability constants. Right, stability constants (β) tell us about the stability of a complex. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. The formula for the nth complex would be βn = [Co(SCN)_n^2− ] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n ). 

So, the complexes would be Co(SCN)_1^2−, Co(SCN)_2^2−, etc. up to n=4. Each has a different β.

The question is about the percentage of Co(SCN)_2^2−, the dithiocyanato complex, which is blue. So I need to find the fraction of all Co species that are in the form with two SCN- ligands.

To find the fraction, I think I need to calculate the concentrations of each possible complex and then find the percentage contributed by the second complex.

I remember that when dealing with multiple complexes, the fraction can be found using the stepwise formation of the complexes. The fractions are determined by the successive formation constants and the concentrations of the ions involved.

Let me outline the approach. The general idea is to consider all the possible complexes Co(SCN)_0^2- (which is just Co^2+), Co(SCN)_1^2-, Co(SCN)_2^2-, Co(SCN)_3^2-, and Co(SCN)_4^2−. Each subsequent complex is formed by adding another SCN^- ion to the previous one.

The formation of each complex step is governed by the formation constant β. So, for each step from n=0 to n=1, n=1 to n=2, etc., the fraction of each complex can be determined.

Wait, but the overall β values given are for each complex. So β1 is for n=1, β2 for n=2, etc. So β1 = [Co(SCN)_1^2−]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]) =9.

Wait, no. The way stability constants are defined is that for each step, the formation is a stepwise process. So the overall β for the complex with n ligands is the product of the stepwise βs up to n.

Wait, no, maybe I'm confusing something. Let me think. The stability constant βn is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex with n ligands. So for each n, βn is [Co(SCN)_n^2−]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n). So each βn is the constant for that specific complex.

But wait, that can't be right because the stability constants usually build up. For example, β1 is the first step: Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ CoSCN^2−, β1=9.

Then β2 would be for the next step: CoSCN^2− + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_2^2−, β2=40.

So the overall β for Co(SCN)_2^2− is β1 * β2 = 9 *40=360. Similarly, β3 would be 360 *63=22680, and β4=22680 *16=362880.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because each βn is the stepwise addition. So the overall β for the nth complex is the product of β1 to βn.

But wait, the problem gives β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So, perhaps in this case, each βn is the overall constant for the nth complex. So β1 is for n=1, β2 is for n=2, etc. But that can't be right because then each successive β would presumably be larger, but β4 is 16, which is smaller than β3 of 63. That doesn't make sense because each step should add more stability, so higher βn.

Hmm, perhaps the question uses the stepwise formation constants. So β1 is for forming the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. Then the overall β for the nth complex is the product of β1 through βn.

Wait, but the problem gives four βs. So if each βn is a stepwise constant, then the overall β for each complex is:

β_total for n=1: β1=9.

n=2: β1 * β2=9*40=360.

n=3: 9*40*63= 22680.

n=4: 9*40*63*16= 362880.

So the stability of the complexes increases with each added SCN^-.

Now, to calculate the fraction of each complex, we need to consider all possible complexes and their concentrations in the solution.

The total concentration of cobalt species is the sum of all the [Co(SCN)_n^2− ] for n=0 to 4.

But wait, n=0 would just be [Co^2+], but in solution, with SCN^- present, the predominant species would be the various complexes. So the sum is c_total = [Co^2+ ] + [CoSCN^2− ] + [Co(SCN)_2^2− ] + [Co(SCN)_3^2− ] + [Co(SCN)_4^2− ].

To find the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2), we can model the distribution of Co species using the stability constants and the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^-.

I remember that the fraction f_n of each complex is given by:

f_n = (β1 * β2 * ... * βn ) * [SCN^-]^n / ( 1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Wait, no, the denominator is the sum of all possible complexes, each term being product of βs up to that n multiplied by [SCN^-]^n.

So, for each n, the term is (β1 β2 ... βn ) [SCN^-]^n.

So the denominator is the sum from n=0 to n=4 of (product of βs up to n) [SCN^-]^n.

Wait, but for n=0, the product is 1 (since it's the zeroth product), and [SCN^-]^0 is 1. So the term is 1.

Then, for n=1, the term is β1 [SCN^-]^1 =9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2: β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 =9*40*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

n=3: 9*40*63*(0.1)^3= 22680 * 0.001=22.68.

n=4:9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4= 362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

Wait, wait. Let me compute each term:

n=0: 1 * (0.1)^0 =1.

n=1: β1 * (0.1) =9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2: β1 β2 * (0.1)^2 =9*40=360; 360 *0.01=3.6.

n=3: β1 β2 β3 * (0.1)^3=360*63=22680; 22680 *0.001=22.68.

n=4: 22680 *16= 362880; 362880 * (0.1)^4= 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So each term is: 1, 0.9, 3.6, 22.68, 36.288.

Now, sum all these terms to get the denominator.

Sum =1 +0.9=1.9 +3.6=5.5 +22.68=28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So denominator is 64.468.

The fraction for n=2 is 3.6 /64.468.

Wait, let me compute each fraction:

f0 =1 /64.468 ≈ 0.01551 (about 1.55%).

f1=0.9 /64.468 ≈0.014 (1.4%).

f2=3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05558 (5.558%).

Wait, wait wait, that can't be right. Because the sum of these fractions should be 1, but the percentages would indicate that most of the Co is in higher complexes. Wait, looking at the denominator, the highest term is for n=4:36.288.

Wait, but 36.288 is the largest term, so the majority of the Co is in the n=4 complex.

Wait, but wait: let me compute each fraction:

n=0: 1 /64.468 ≈ 0.01551 → 1.551%.

n=1:0.9 /64.468 ≈0.014 → 1.4%.

n=2:3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05558 →5.558%.

n=3:22.68 /64.468 ≈0.3518 →35.18%.

n=4:36.288 /64.468 ≈0.5629 →56.29%.

Adding these percentages: 1.55 +1.4=2.95; +5.558=8.5; +35.18=43.68; +56.29=99.97%, which is close to 100%, considering some rounding.

So the fractions are:

n=0: ~1.55%

n=1: ~1.4%

n=2: ~5.56%

n=3: ~35.18%

n=4: ~56.29%

Wait, but the problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2. So that's approximately 5.56%, but looking at the options, the closest is option D) 16.9%, which isn't what I got. Hmm, that suggests I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I inverted the definition of β. Maybe the given β are the cumulative constants for each complex, not the stepwise. So β1 is the overall constant for n=1, β2 for n=2, etc. So the overall β for each complex is βn. So for n=2, β =40, but for n=1, β=9, etc. If that's the case, then the terms for the sum are [βn * (SCN^-)^n ].

Wait, but let me think again. The given values are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, no, that can't be because for n=4, β4=16 is less than β3=63. Which doesn't make sense because each successive complex should have a higher stability than the previous. Unless the problem is giving the stepwise constants and the overall increases. Wait, that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not multiply the βs but use them as the overall constants for each n.

Wait, that would change the approach. Let me try that.

If the βn are the overall constants for each complex:

For n=1: β1=9 ⇒ [Co(SCN)_1^2− ] = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^1.

n=2: β2=40 ⇒ [Co(SCN)_2^2− ]= β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2.

Wait, but that can’t be right because the formation of the second complex would require the first complex to form, so the overall β for n=2 would be β1 * β2, which would be 9*40=360.

Hmm, but the problem states that the βs are the stability constants for each complex. So perhaps each βn is the stepwise formation constant, meaning that the overall β for the nth complex is the product of β1 to βn.

Wait, but in that case, as I calculated earlier, the sum of the terms gives the denominator as approximately 64.468, and the fraction for n=2 is about 5.56%. But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the given β are the overall β for each complex, and each subsequent β is a stepwise addition. So:

β1 is for n=1, β2 is for the next step (n=2), etc., but each βn is for the nth complex. So the overall β for n=1 is 9, for n=2 is 40, n=3 is 63, n=4 is 16.

Wait, that would make the overall β for each complex as βn, so the fractions would be based on those.

So for each n, the term is (βn) * [SCN^-]^n.

So let me compute each term:

n=0: 1.

n=1: β1 * [SCN^-]^1 =9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2: β2* [SCN^-]^2=40 * (0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4.

n=3: β3 * (0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

n=4: β4*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

So the sum is 1 +0.9=1.9 +0.4=2.3 +0.063=2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So the denominator is 2.3646.

Now the fraction for n=2 is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈0.169, or 16.9%.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%.

But wait, earlier when I considered the product approach, I got 5.56%, but that's when each βn is a stepwise constant. But in this approach, if each βn is the overall constant for the nth complex, then the fraction is 16.9%, which matches option D.

So now I'm confused because the approach depends on how the β values are given. The question states that the stability constants of the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, etc. So are they the overall or stepwise constants?

Wait, stability constants are typically given as the overall constants for the complex. For example, the formation of Co(SCN)_n^2− from Co^2+ and n SCN^- is a single step, but in reality, it's a stepwise process. However, sometimes the βn refers to the overall, and sometimes the stepwise.

In this case, perhaps the given β are the overall for each n. So for n=1:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_1^2− ; β1=9.

n=2:

Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_2^2− ; β2=40.

So the [Co(SCN)_2^2− ] = β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2.

So the term for n=2 is 40 * (0.1)^2=0.4.

So with this approach, the sum of all terms is 1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 =2.3646.

The fraction for n=2 is 0.4/2.3646≈16.9%, which is option D.

But this contradicts my earlier approach where I considered each β as stepwise.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting results based on how I interpret the given β values. So perhaps the question is using the stepwise approach, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, another way to think about it: the overall stability constant for Co(SCN)_n^2− is the product of the stepwise βs up to n. So if each βn is a stepwise constant, then β1=9, β2=40, etc., and the overall β for n=2 would be 9*40=360.

But if the problem gives each βn as the overall (not stepwise), then for n=1, it's 9, for n=2, it's 40, etc.

So what's the correct approach?

I think in the context of the problem, the βn are the stepwise stability constants. Because when you have multiple complexes, the stepwise approach is more common. That is, each βn is the equilibrium constant for adding the nth ligand.

But the problem states that the given β are the "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes."

Stability constants are typically the overall constants for the entire complex. So for example, the overall β for Co(SCN)_2^2− would be β1*β2=9*40=360.

Wait, but in that case, when I compute the denominator as the sum of the products, I get the denominator as 64.468, but the fraction for n=2 is 3.6/64.468≈5.56%, which doesn't match any option except perhaps C) 38.1%—no, that's not close.

Wait, maybe I got the problem wrong. The blue complex is the dithiocyanato, which is n=2. So in that approach, the fraction is 5.56%, but that's
