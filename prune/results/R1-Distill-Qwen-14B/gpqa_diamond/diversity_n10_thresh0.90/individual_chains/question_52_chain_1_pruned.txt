Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, it's about stars and their effective temperatures, and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. I remember that when stars have spots, it can influence their overall brightness and temperature, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me try to break this down.

So the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. But wait, the problem doesn't seem to require that info right now. When the star's surface isn't covered by spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So the spots are making the star cooler overall.

The main question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find how much the ratio changes—so the factor is when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the number of atoms in different energy states follows the Boltzmann equation. The equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the ratio is n1/n2, is that right? Because the question says the ratio decreases. Let me think. The problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So without spots, ratio is higher.

Wait, the ratio is level 1 over level 2? Or level 2 over level 1? The question says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 and level 2. I think that's n1/n2. So when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So n1/n2 is lower when T is lower? Let's think. Because when temperature is lower, the exponential factor decreases. So in the equation, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)). If T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp() becomes smaller. So n2/n1 decreases, which means n1/n2 increases? Or wait, no. Let me re-derive.

Wait, n1 is the lower energy level, n2 is the higher. So, the ratio n1/n2 = [ (g1 / g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(kT) ) ]^{-1}.

Wait, no. Let's get the equation right. The Boltzmann equation is (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

So, suppose level 1 is lower than level 2. So E2 > E1. So E2 - E1 is positive. So the equation for n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(kT) ) =
