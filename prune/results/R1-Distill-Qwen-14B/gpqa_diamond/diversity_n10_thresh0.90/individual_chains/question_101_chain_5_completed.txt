Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction involving 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to choose the correct reagent A and catalyst B from the options given.

First, I should probably draw the structures to get a clearer picture. 3-methylpyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with four carbons and one nitrogen. The methyl group is on the third carbon. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Let me imagine that structure. So the pyrrolidine ring has a substituent at position 1, which is a cyclohexylidenemethyl group. Cyclohexylidene would be a cyclohexane ring with a double bond, right? So the substituent is a methylene group connected to a cyclohexene ring.

Wait, no, maybe it's a cyclohexylidene group attached as a methyl. So the substituent is CH2 connected to a cyclohexene (cyclohexylidene), making it a cyclohexylidene methyl group. So the substituent is like CH2-Cyclohexene.

So the reaction is an acid-catalyzed reaction between 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A. The product suggests some kind of ring formation or addition. Maybe a cyclopropane or something, but more likely a ring expansion or a substitution. Or perhaps an alkylation or some kind of ene reaction.

Wait, another thought: the product has a substituent that's a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene group. So perhaps this is a result of a Michael addition or a conjugate addition, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an enamine reaction.

Wait, enamine! That rings a bell. Enamines are typically formed from a secondary amine and a ketone or aldehyde. Enamines are used in various reactions, such as the Michael reaction or as dienophiles in Diels-Alder reactions. But in this case, the product is an enamine.

Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine is a secondary amine. If it reacts with a carbonyl compound (like an aldehyde or ketone), under acid catalysis, it could form an enamine. Enamine formation usually involves two steps: first, the amine reacts with the carbonyl to form a imine intermediate, which then undergoes dehydration to form the enamine. However, the enamine formation typically requires a ketone or aldehyde and an amine.

Wait, but wait, the product here is the enamine itself. So the starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, and the other reactant is an aldehyde or ketone. But looking at the product, the substituent is a cyclohexene with a methylene group attached. So the aldehyde would need to have a cyclohexene ring. Let me think.

Wait, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is an aldehyde with a cyclohexane ring attached. So if 3-methylpyrrolidine reacts with cyclohexanecarbaldehyde under acid catalysis, perhaps they form an enamine. Enamine formation usually requires an amine and a carbonyl, and the conditions are typically acid or base catalyzed. So in this case, if the amine is 3-methylpyrrolidine and the carbonyl is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, the product would be an enamine where the aldehyde's carbonyl is replaced by a methylene group attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, but in the product, the substituent is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl). So the structure is the pyrrolidine with a substituent at position 1, which is a methylene connected to a cyclohexene (cyclohexylidene). So that would imply that the aldehyde was cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, because the aldehyde group (CHO) would lose the O and become a CH2 group attached to the cyclohexane.

So the reaction is the formation of an enamine between 3-methylpyrrolidine and cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the reagent A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

Then the catalyst B is an acid. The options for catalyst are TsOH (p-toluenesulfonic acid) or acetic acid.

Wait, but TsOH is a strong acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts or other acid-catalyzed reactions. Acetic acid is a weaker acid but might also work as a catalyst in some cases.

In the formation of enamines, the typical procedure involves heating the amine with the ketone or aldehyde in the presence of an acid catalyst. For example, the amine and aldehyde would first form a Schiff base (imine), which then loses water to form the enamine. So an acid catalyst would facilitate this process.

Looking at the options, option A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with TsOH. Option B is same A but with acetic acid.

Which catalyst is more suitable? I think TsOH is a strong acid and is often used in such reactions. Acetic acid might be a possible catalyst, but TsOH is more commonly used for such condensations because it's a strong acid, which can help in the dehydration step of forming the enamine.

Wait, but in some cases, acetic acid is used for certain reactions, but if the reaction is acid-catalyzed and requires strong conditions, TsOH would be better. So option A would have A as cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and B as TsOH.

Looking at the options, option A is that combination. So the correct answer would be option A.

Alternatively, if the reaction involves a different mechanism, like a conjugate addition or something else, but I think the enamine formation is the key here.

Wait another thought: looking at the product structure, the substituent is cyclohexylidenemethyl. So the methylene is adjacent to the pyrrolidine's nitrogen. That would come from an aldehyde with a cyclohexane ring, because the aldehyde's carbonyl would form the enamine.

Other options: options C and D have vinylcyclohexane as A. Vinylcyclohexane is an alkene, so if A is an alkene, the reaction is different. Perhaps an addition reaction, like a Michael addition or a conjugate addition. But in that case, the product would have an added alkene substituent. But 3-methylpyrrolidine is a secondary amine. If the reaction is between an amine and an alkene, perhaps it's an alkylation, but that would require an alkyl halide or another electrophilic species. Vinylcyclohexane isn't typically used for that.

Alternatively, if the reaction is an acid-catalyzed cyclization. But I'm not sure what kind of reaction that would be.

Wait, considering that 3-methylpyrrolidine is reacting with A under acid catalysis to form the product, and the product has a cyclohexene substituent, perhaps it's a ring-forming reaction. If A is an aldehyde, then enamine makes sense. If A is an alkene, perhaps an additionâ€”like a [2+2] or some other cycloaddition? Not sure.

But given the product has a methylene group attached to a cyclohexene, it's more likely that the aldehyde is the starting material. So cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is A, and TsOH is the catalyst. So option A.

Wait, another point: the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the substituent is a methylene group connected to a cyclohexene. So the aldehyde would have been cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. When the amine reacts with the aldehyde, the product would have the substituent.

So yes, the reagent A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the catalyst is TsOH. So option A is correct.


The reaction involves 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A under acid-catalyzed conditions to produce 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. The product structure suggests the formation of an enamine, where the nitrogen of the pyrrolidine reacts with a carbonyl group from compound A to form a methylene group attached to a cyclohexene ring.

Enamine formation typically requires an amine and a carbonyl compound (aldehyde or ketone) in the presence of an acid catalyst. Among the options, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (an aldehyde with a cyclohexane ring) is the most suitable reagent (A) because it provides the carbonyl group necessary for enamine formation. The product's structure aligns with this mechanism, as the aldehyde's carbonyl group is converted into a methylene group attached to the cyclohexene ring.

For the catalyst (B), p-toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH) is a strong acid commonly used in acid-catalyzed reactions, particularly for dehydration steps in enamine formation. While acetic acid is also an acid, TsOH is more effective in facilitating the reaction conditions required for enamine formation. Therefore, TsOH is the appropriate catalyst.

The other options involving vinylcyclohexane (C and D) are less suitable because vinylcyclohexane is an alkene, and its reaction with 3-methylpyrrolidine under acid catalysis would not lead to the observed product. Thus, the correct combination is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde as reagent A and TsOH as the catalyst.

Answer: A
