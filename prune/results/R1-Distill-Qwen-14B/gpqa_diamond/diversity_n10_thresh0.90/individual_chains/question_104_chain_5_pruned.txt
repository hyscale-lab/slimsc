Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let's see. So the question is about comparing the orbital periods of two planets around two stars with the same mass. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune, and the stars are like our Sun. The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull.

The key data given are the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. I'm supposed to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the RV method relates the velocity of the star to the planet's orbit. The formula, I think, is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K. K is given by ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/1) ) * (1 / ( (P * (1 year in seconds) )^(1/3) )) ), but maybe I should think about it differently. Alternatively, perhaps it's more straightforward to relate the Doppler shifts to the velocities and then use Kepler's third law.

Wait, the RV shift depends on the velocity of the star. So the shift in wavelength (the semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift) is proportional to the velocity of the star. Oh right, the Doppler shift formula: delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the velocity and c is the speed of light. But since both stars are similar (same mass) and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), the velocity of the star would depend on the planet's orbital period and other factors.

Wait, no. I think the RV method measures the star's velocity semi-amplitude K. The formula for K is given by K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P * (1 year in seconds) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (1 + M_p / M_star )^(2/3) )) ) ), but since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Sun-like stars and Neptune-like planets), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, maybe I should think about the relation between the velocity K and the orbital period P. The formula for K is K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P * (year in seconds) )^(1/3) ) ) * [1/( (1 + M_p/M_star )^(2/3) ) ].

But since M_p << M_star (Neptune is about 1/18th the mass of Earth, and Earth is much less than the Sun's mass), M_p/M_star is negligible, so the term [1/(...)] is approximately 1. So K ≈ ( ( G * M_p ) / ( M_star ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( P^(1/3) ) ) * (1/( (year in seconds)^(1/3) )) ) ).

Wait, but I'm more interested in how K relates to the period P. Let's rearrange this formula.

Wait, let's think about K in terms of the planets' orbits. The star and planet orbit their common center of mass. The velocity of the star is K. The formula for K is K = [ (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3) )) ) * (1/( (1 year in seconds)^(1/3) )) * [ 1/(1 + M_p/M_star )^(2/3) ) ].

But since M_p is small, the denominator (1 + M_p/M_star) is approximately 1, so we can ignore it. So K ≈ [ (G * M_p ) / ( M_star ) ]^(1/3) * (1/( P^(1/3) )) ) * (1/( (1 year in seconds)^(1/3) )) ).

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think of the ratio of K between the two planets. Let me denote K1 and K2 as the velocities for planets 1 and 2, and P1 and P2 as their periods.

Since both stars are the same mass, M_star is same for both. M_p is similar (both Neptune-like), so M_p1 ≈ M_p2. So the ratio K2/K1 would be [ ( (M_p2 / M_p1 )^(1/3) ) * (P1^(1/3) ) / (P2^(1/3) ) ) ) ] ) × [ (1/(1 year s)^(1/3) ) / ( same term ) ] so that cancels out.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. From the formula, since K is proportional to ( M_p )^(1/3) / ( M_star^(1/3) ) ) × (1/P^(1/3) )

But M_p is same for both planets, and M_star same. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3).

Wait, no. Let's see:

K = ( (G M_p ) / (M_star) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P (year in s) )^(1
