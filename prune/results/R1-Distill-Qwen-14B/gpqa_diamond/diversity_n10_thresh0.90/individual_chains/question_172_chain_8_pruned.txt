Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the layer of a star where photosynthesis happens, but wait, no, that's plants. Oh right, the photosphere is where the star emits most of its light. So the question is about iron atoms in the photospheres of two stars. 

The problem says that iron atoms in star 1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star 2. Oh wait, excited in a specific energy levelâ€”so maybe their energy states are higher or something. I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics, but I think this has to do with the Boltzmann distribution. Because in thermal equilibrium, the distribution of particles in different energy states depends on temperature, right?

So the Boltzmann factor comes into play here. The number of particles in a higher energy state compared to a lower one is given by the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) = exp( - (E_upper - E_lower)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. But wait, in this problem, it's about excitation levels. So maybe the excitation is the energy difference from the ground state to an excited state. 

Wait, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level as in star_2. So for a given energy level, the population is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2. Let's denote the energy difference between the two levels as delta_E, which is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem states that the energy difference between the considered energy levels was 1.38e-23 J. So delta_E is fixed for both stars, right? Because both are looking at the same transition, same energy difference.

So for each star, the ratio of the number of excited atoms to ground state atoms would be given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star 1, (n1_upper / n1_lower) = exp( - delta_E/(k T1) ), and for star 2, (n2_upper / n2_lower) = exp( - delta_E/(k T2) ). 

But the problem says that in star 1, the excited atoms are twice as excited as in star 2. Wait, no. Let me read that again. "Iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmm, that's a little ambiguous. Are they saying that the number of excited atoms is twice as much in star 1, or that their excitation energy is twice as much? I think it's the first. So n1_upper is twice n2_upper? Or maybe n1_upper / n1_lower is twice n2_upper / n2_lower? Because the question says "twice as excited", which I think refers to their population in that energy level relative to their own lower level. So n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower). 

So let me write that equation. Let me denote the ratio for star 1 as R1 = n1_upper / n1_lower = exp( - delta_E/(k T1) ), and for star 2, R2 = n2_upper / n2_lower = exp( - delta_E/(k T2) ). 

According to the problem, R1 = 2 * R2. So:

exp( - delta_E/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( - delta_E/(k T2) )

Hmm, I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to make this easier.

ln( exp( - delta_E/(k T1) ) ) = ln( 2 * exp( - delta_E/(k T2) ) )

Which simplifies to:

- delta_E/(k T1) = ln(2) + (- delta_E/(k T2) )

Let me rearrange this:

- delta_E/(k T1) + delta_E/(k T2) = ln(2
