Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon. We need to find the momentum of that photon to switch to the next lowest energy state. The options are A to D with some numbers. 

First, I remember that in molecular spectroscopy, molecules can change their vibrational and rotational states when they absorb photons. The quantum rotation-vibration model probably considers both vibrational and rotational energy transitions.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So when they say the next state with the lowest possible energy, I think they're referring to the first excited state, which would involve the smallest possible energy increase. But I'm not sure whether this is a pure rotational transition or a vibrational one. Maybe it's a combination of both?

The molecule is diatomic, so it's like X-Y. The masses are given: Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

I think when a photon is absorbed, it can cause a transition between vibrational or rotational energy levels. The energy of the photon must match the energy difference between these levels.

Wait, but the question is about the momentum of the photon. I know that the energy of a photon is E = hν, where ν is the frequency, but also, momentum p is related to energy. For a photon, E = pc, since it's massless. So p = E/c.

But first, I need to find what the energy difference is between the states. So the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental vibrational state is the lowest vibrational state (n=0), and the rotational state is the lowest as well. Or wait, maybe the fundamental state is when both rotational and vibrational are in their ground states. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the fundamental state in the rotation-vibration model typically refers to the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it can either increase its rotational state or its vibrational state. But the next lowest energy state would be the first excited state, which could be either a vibrational or rotational transition. Oh, but wait, in the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator models, transitions can be either rotational (ΔJ=±1) or vibrational (Δn=±1), but I'm not sure if this applies here.

However, since the problem says it's a non-rigid rotor model, perhaps it's considering some coupling between rotation and vibration? Or maybe it's just the standard rotational and vibrational states. Maybe the molecule can undergo a transition from the ground state to the next higher state, which could be either a rotational or vibrational change. But which one gives the lower energy transition? Because the photon energy needs to be such that it corresponds to the smallest possible energy difference.

Wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So which transition requires less energy: a vibrational transition or a rotational one?

The vibrational energy levels have much larger spacing than rotational. For example, in the harmonic oscillator, the energy spacing is
