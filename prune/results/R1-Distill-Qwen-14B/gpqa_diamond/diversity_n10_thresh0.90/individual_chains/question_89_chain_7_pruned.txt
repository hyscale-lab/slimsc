Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. So, the question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and each reaction produces a new product. The final product's NMR spectrum is what we're focusing on, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. 

First, I'll start by breaking down each reaction. The initial compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's quite rigid. The compound has two bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions. 

Step 1: Heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when it reacts with vicinal dihalides (where two halogens are on adjacent carbons), it typically causes an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide. The bromines are on carbons 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. Hmm, so maybe it's a neighboring group reaction or perhaps an elimination that forms a ring?

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. But since the dihalide is not vicinal, perhaps it's a case of forming a bridge. Oh wait, adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so maybe the bromines are on bridgehead carbons. When KOH is used, perhaps it abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination and the formation of an exo double bond. 

Alternatively, could it be a Hofmann elimination? But Hofmann usually involves amines. Wait, no, KOH in such cases can also lead to E2 elimination. So for each Br, maybe the adjacent carbons have H's that get abstracted, leading to the formation of a double bond. But since there are two Br's, perhaps two eliminations occur.

Wait, let me think about the structure. Adamantane has four rings, so if the bromines are on 1 and 3 positions, elimination of both would form two double bonds, but that might not be possible. Alternatively, perhaps each Br undergoes elimination, forming two double bonds. No, that doesn't seem right. Maybe each Br is eliminated in a separate reaction. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is part of a separate elimination, leading to a diene?

Wait, the product after KOH is a light yellow solid, product 1. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone. Oh, that's a key point. So the product after KOH isn't an alkene but a ketone. 

Wait, how does that happen? If KOH is used in a situation where elimination doesn't occur, maybe a substitution? But KOH is a strong base, so substitution would be SN2, but in adamantane, the structure is very rigid and the carbons are bridgehead positions. SN2 is unlikely there because of poor leaving group departure and steric hindrance. So maybe elimination isn't the main pathway here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation but leading to a ketone. Wait, another possibility: if the dihalide undergoes dehydrohalogenation but in a way that forms a carbonyl group. Hmm, perhaps it's a case of the formation of a diketone? Or maybe a cyclopropane opening? Not sure. 

Wait, alternative approach: think about the NMR spectrum of product 1. The 1H NMR has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The IR peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a ketone. So product 1 is likely an adamantane derivative with a ketone group. 

The NMR data: 4.79 ppm (2H) is probably a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom, maybe O. Maybe it's a CH2 next to a carbonyl. Then 2.41-2.23 (10H) is likely CH2 groups in a more shielded environment, perhaps in the adamantane structure. The 1.94 (2H) might be another CH2 group, perhaps near the ketone.

So considering that, perhaps each Br was replaced by an oxygen-containing group. Wait, but KOH is a strong base. Maybe it's an epoxide formation? No, because 1,3-dibromoadamantane would need some sort of ring-opening but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an -O- group.

Wait, another thought: maybe the bromines are replaced by hydroxyl groups. But that would require two hydroxyls, perhaps leading to a diol. But the IR doesn't show broad peaks around 3300 cm-1 for OH, but that's not conclusive because the product is a solid and maybe the OH protons are exchanged and not observed. But the IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, not an alcohol. 

Wait, 1720 is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the product is a diketone. But how does that form? Let me think about the reaction. KOH is a base, but under certain conditions, when a dihalide is treated with a base, it can lead to the formation of a carbonyl group. 

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism. Alternatively, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide undergoes a double elimination to form a conjugated diene, but the IR doesn't show a peak corresponding to a C=C. Wait, the IR shows 1720, which is more likely a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, another possibility: the initial reaction is a double elimination of HBr, leading to the formation of a ketone. For example, in a vicinal dihalide, elimination gives an alkene, but for a 1,3-dihalide, perhaps elimination leads to a conjugated diene, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is adjacent to a CH2 group, and elimination forms a carbonyl. 

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamond-like structure with four cyclohexane rings. The 1 and 3 positions are bridgehead carbons. Each bridgehead carbon has two CH2 groups attached. So, 1 and 3 are each attached to two CH2 groups. 

When KOH is added, perhaps each Br is eliminated, but since they're on 1 and 3 positions, each elimination would form a double bond. But two eliminations would form two double bonds, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps each elimination forms a ketone. Wait, but how would that happen?

Wait, perhaps it's a pinacol-like elimination. Pinacol rearrangement involves 1,2-diols eliminating water to form a ketone. But here we have dihalides. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl, and then elimination occurs. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, probably a ketone. So product 1 has a ketone group. How could 1,3-dibromoadamantane form a ketone when treated with KOH?

Wait, perhaps each
