Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this must be a two-dimensional metric because it's in terms of dx and dy. I remember that the area element in such a metric can be found by taking the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor, multiplied by dx dy.

Wait, right, the area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy, where g is the metric tensor. So the metric tensor here is diagonal with components g_xx and g_yy. Both are 32/(4 - x² - y²), so the determinant is just g_xx * g_yy. Since they're the same, determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2.

Wait, so sqrt(det g) would be 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element dA is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Now, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh wait, pseudosphere—what's that again? I think a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, like a tractricoid. But I'm not exactly sure about the parametrization. Alternatively, in some contexts, a pseudosphere might refer to a surface in hyperbolic space.

Wait, but in the metric given, let's consider the form. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So the domain of this metric is where 4 - x² - y² > 0, meaning x² + y² < 4. So it's the region inside a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. That makes sense because if x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, and the metric becomes singular there. So the radius is 2, matching the denominator.

I think this metric is representing a hyperbolic plane because the curvature is negative. The standard metric for hyperbolic space in Poincaré coordinates is ds² = (dr² + dz²)/ (a² (1 - r²/a²)^2) or something like that, but perhaps in another coordinate system it looks different.

Wait, no, in the Poincaré disk model, the metric is (dx² + dy²)/(1 - (x² + y²)/a²)^2, right? So comparing to our given metric, which is 32/(4 - x² - y²) times (dx² + dy²). Let's see: 4 - x² - y² is 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So the denominator is 4(1 - r²), where r² = x² + y². So the metric becomes [32/(4(1 - r²)) ] (dx² + dy²) = [8/(1 - r²)] (dx² + dy²). That looks like the Poincaré disk metric with a=2 because 1/(1 - r²) comes from a=2. Because in the standard Poincaré disk, the metric is (dx² + dy²)/(1 - (r²/a²))². Wait, wait, so in our case, 8/(1 - r²) is equal to 8(1/(1 - r²)).

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the Gaussian curvature of this metric to find out what it is. The Gaussian curvature K can be found using the formula for a metric in 2D:

K = - (1/(2(r²))) * (∂/∂x (∂g_xy/∂y) - ... ) Wait, maybe a better approach is to recall that for a metric ds² = (f(x,y))² (dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature is given by K = -(1/(2f²)) * Δ(f), where Δ is the Laplacian in flat space.

So let's compute that. Here, f(x,y) = sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)). Wait, no, the metric is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²), so f(x,y) is sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)). But perhaps it's easier if I think of the conformal factor as λ = sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)).

Wait, no, because the metric is g = (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r² = x² + y². So in polar coordinates, perhaps. Wait, maybe I should change variables to polar coordinates to simplify.

Let me try that. Let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². The metric becomes:

ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²).

Now, the area element would be:

dA = sqrt(det g) dr dθ.

The metric tensor in polar coordinates is diagonal, so det g is (32/(4 - r²))^2. So sqrt(det g) is (32/(4 - r²)).

Wait, but I'm trying to compute the Gaussian curvature. Using the formula for K in terms of the conformal factor. In polar coordinates, the formula is:

K = - (1/(2)) * [ (1/r) d/dθ (√g_θθ) ) ] evaluated in a way that might be more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the Ricci scalar, but maybe I should use the formula for Gaussian curvature in isothermal coordinates. Alternatively, maybe I should remember that for a metric ds² = A(r) dr² + B(r) r² dθ², the Gaussian curvature is given by:

K = - (1/(2 A)) [ (B')/r + B'' ) ]

Wait, let me think. Alternatively, the Gaussian curvature can be calculated as:

K = [ (1/(2 A)) ] * [ (d/dr (A r)) / r ].

Wait, perhaps I should look for a formula, but since I can't refer to books, I'll try to derive it.

Wait, the formula for Gaussian curvature K of a metric ds² = A dr² + B r² dθ² is:

K = - (1/(2 A)) [ (B')/(r) + (B'' ) ]

Wait, is that correct? Let me see. I think another way is to compute the Christoffel symbols and then the Ricci scalar.

Alternatively, perhaps I should note that for the standard Poincaré disk model, which has metric ds² = (4/(a² (1 - r²/a²)^2)) (dr² + r² dθ²), the Gaussian curvature is -1/a². So in this case, a=2, because our denominator is (4 - r²) = 4(1 - r²/4). So a = 2, so the curvature K is -1/(2)^2 = -1/4.

Wait, but the standard Poincaré metric is written as ds² = (4/(a² (1 - r²/a²)^2)) (dr² + r² dθ²). So in our case, 32/(4 - r²) = 32/(4 (1 - r²/4)) ) = 8/(1 - r²/4). So 8 = (4 a²)/(a² (1 - r²/a²)^2) — wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused.

Let me compare. The standard Poincaré metric is:

ds² = ( (r² + 1)^2 )^{-1} (dr² + r² dθ²) ?

Wait, no, perhaps I should think again. The standard Poincaré model has ds² = ( (2a)/( (1 + r²/a²) ) )^2 (dr² + r² dθ²). Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up between the models.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that the metric given is equivalent to the Poincaré disk model with curvature K = -1/4. So the Gaussian curvature is -1/4, which is negative, so it's a hyperbolic surface.

But the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, wait. What's a pseudosphere's area? I think the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, and in the limit as the curvature approaches a certain value, its area is finite.

Wait, no, the pseudosphere, like the tractricoid, is a surface of constant negative curvature with finite area. Its Gaussian curvature is K = -1/a², where a is the radius of curvature. So for example, the tractricoid has an area of 4π a². Wait, because for a sphere of radius a, the area is 4π a². So for the pseudosphere, which is like a "sphere" with negative curvature, perhaps the area is similar.

Wait, but wait, the pseudosphere's area is actually 4π a², same as a sphere of radius a. But wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because the pseudosphere is a surface embedded in 3D, it's a finite area, but the hyperbolic plane is infinite. But in this question, perhaps the "pseudosphere" refers to a finite portion of the hyperbolic plane, like a disk of radius r=2.

Wait, but the options given don't have anything like 4π (2)^2 = 16π. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, let me read the question again. The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the region where x² + y² < 4 is the entire hyperbolic plane, but a pseudosphere is a finite area surface. So maybe the area is being calculated for a specific part, like a disk of radius 2 in this coordinate system.

So using the area element I found earlier: dA = [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ, because in polar coordinates dx dy becomes r dr dθ.

So the area would be the integral from r=0 to r=2 of [32/(4 - r²)] r dr, integrated over θ from 0 to 2π.

Wait, let me compute that. So the integral becomes:

Area = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr dθ.

We can split this into the angular integral and the radial integral. The angular integral is ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

So Area = 2π * ∫0^2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫_{u=4}^{u=0} [32 * (-du/2)] / u.

Which is (-32/2) ∫4^0 (1/u) du = (-16) [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0.

Wait, but integrating from 4 to 0, so [ln(0) - ln(4)].

But ln(0) is negative infinity. Oh wait, that means the integral diverges. So the area is infinite.

Wait, but that's a problem because the options include 'D) +infty'.

So the area of the region (the pseudosphere's area) would be infinite.

Wait, but why is it called a pseudosphere then? Because in reality, the pseudosphere is a finite area surface. Hmm. Maybe I'm confusing what the question is referring to. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the entire hyperbolic plane, which indeed has infinite area.

But the options include D) +infty, which would be the case if the area is infinite.

Wait, but why would the question refer to a pseudosphere of radius 2? Because in the pseudosphere (tractricoid), the area is finite, but in the hyperbolic plane, the area up to radius 2 would be infinite.

So perhaps the question is considering a hyperbolic disk of radius 2, which would have infinite area because hyperbolic space is non-compact.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric represents a pseudosphere (tractricoid), but I'm not sure.

Wait, the metric given is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). That's in the Poincaré disk model, which covers the entire hyperbolic plane within the disk of radius 2. So a pseudosphere might be a different concept here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is mistaking the hyperbolic plane for a pseudosphere. But the area of the hyperbolic plane is infinite, which would make option D) the correct answer.

But wait, what's the area of a pseudosphere? I think the tractricoid, which is a pseudosphere, has finite area. Let me think: the tractricoid has constant negative curvature, and its area is 4π a², where a is the radius of its curvature. So if a=2, the area would be 16π, which matches option B: 4π(x² + y²) evaluated at r=2 would be 4π*(4) =16π. But wait, option B is 4π(x² + y²), so if x² + y²=4, then it's 16π. But the question is asking for the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. So I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between the model and the actual pseudosphere. The metric given is a model of the hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. So if the question is about the area in this model, then the area would be infinite.

But if the question is referring to the embedded pseudosphere (tractricoid), then the area is finite. But the question doesn't specify the embedding, just the metric.

So the given metric covers the hyperbolic plane up to radius 2. So the area would be infinite, which would correspond to option D) +infty.

Wait, but when I integrated, I got an infinite area because the integral from 0 to 2 of [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr is divergent. So the area is infinite, so the answer would be D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me double-check the integral.

The integral is ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Substitute u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So the integral becomes ∫ (32 * (-du/2)) / u.

Which is (-16) ∫ (du/u) from u=4 (r=0) to u=0 (r=2). So the limits are from 4 to 0, which is the same as ∫ from 0 to 4 with a negative sign, but I think I messed up the substitution. Let me re-express it:

The original limits: r=0 → u=4, r=2 → u=0.

So integral from r=0 to 2 is ∫(u=4 to 0) [32 * (-1/2 du)] / u.

Which is (-16) ∫(4 to 0) (1/u) du = (-16) [ ln(u) from 4 to 0 ].

Which is (-16) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so ln(0) - ln(4) is (-infty) - ln(4) = -infty.

So the integral becomes (-16) * (-infty) = +infty.

So the area is indeed infinite, so option D is correct.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which represents a two-dimensional hyperbolic space in the Poincaré disk model. The region of validity is \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), corresponding to a disk of radius 2 in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. This metric is conformally flat, and the area element in such a metric is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \(\det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2\). Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

To compute the total area of the region \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), we switch to polar coordinates \(r^2 = x^2 + y^2\) and \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\). The area element in polar coordinates is:

\[
dA = \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi\). The radial integral \(\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr\) can be evaluated using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\). This gives:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \left[\ln u\right]_4^0.
\]

Since \(\ln u\) diverges as \(u \to 0\), the integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the total area of the region \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\) under the given metric is infinite.

The question asks for the area of a "pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\)." However, the metric provided does not describe a finite-area pseudosphere like a tractricoid but rather represents the entire hyperbolic plane in the Poincaré disk model, which has infinite area. Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
