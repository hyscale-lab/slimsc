Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25 degrees Celsius. The K for Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions. So in this case, Ca-EDTA is a complex, and the solution has 0.02 M of that complex. Since EDTA is a strong chelator, the complex formation is pretty much complete, especially with such a high K value.

So the K for the reaction would be the formation constant, Kf. The problem gives K_Ca-EDTA as 5e10, which I think is the formation constant. The reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

Since the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA^2-, I can model the dissociation of this complex. The dissociation would be: CaEDTA^2- ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

The formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Wait, but in the solution, the complex is probably dissociating a tiny bit, so the concentration of free Ca²+ and EDTA would be very low.

Wait, but if the complex is 0.02 M and the K is 5e10, which is a very large K, that suggests that the complex is very stable. So the dissociation would be minimal. So the concentration of free Ca²+ would be very low.

Let me think about the expression. The K for the dissociation would be 1/Kf. So K_dissociation = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, but the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote the change as x. So, when the complex dissociates, it produces x of Ca²+ and x of EDTA^4-.

So, the equilibrium concentrations would be:
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

So the dissociation equation is K_d = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-] = x^2 / (0.02) = 2e-11.

Solving for x: x^2 = 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13
x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, no: sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, because (1e-6.5)^2 = 1e-13.

Wait, 6.5 is 13/2, so yeah. So x = 2e-6.5 M.

Wait, what's 1e-6.5? That's 3.16e-7, because 10^(-6.5) = 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) ≈ 1e-6 * 0.316 ≈ 3.16e-7.

So x = 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M. That's approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in thinking about which way the K goes.

Alternatively, perhaps the K given is for the formation of the complex. So the formation equation is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2- with Kf = 5e10.

So the dissociation K would be 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So the setup is correct. So, yes, the [Ca²+] is x, which is about sqrt(Kd * C), where C is the initial concentration of the complex.

So, the calculation seems correct. So the Ca²+ concentration is approximately 6.3e-7 M, so option C is correct.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) at equilibrium be \( x \). The equilibrium concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M} \quad (\text{since } x \text{ is very small}),
\]
\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x
\]

The dissociation equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
2 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}
\]

Since \( 10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \), we find:

\[
x \approx 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
