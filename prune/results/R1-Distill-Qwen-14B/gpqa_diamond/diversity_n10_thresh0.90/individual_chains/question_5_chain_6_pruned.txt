Okay, so I need to find the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, specifically for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me break this down.

The operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So the overall operator P would be the vector sum in the direction of n, like P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

But wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane. That means the y-component of n is zero. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z). Since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1. So the operator along n would be P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the operator is a vector operator, so the operator in the direction n is P·n̂, which is n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Now, I need to find the eigenvector of this operator P_n corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The eigenvector equation is P_n |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>.

So let me write out P_n in terms of the given matrices. 

Given:
P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So P_n = n_x * P_x + n_z * P_z.

Let me compute each term:

n_x * P_x = (ħ/2) * n_x * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

Similarly, n_z * P_z = (ħ/2) * n_z * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So adding these together:

P_n = (ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Wait, because: 
- The (1,1) element is n_z * 1 (from P_z) + 0 (from P_x) → n_z.
- The (1,2) element is n_x * 1 (from P_x) → n_x.
- The (2,1) element is n_x * 1 (from P_x).
- The (2,2) element is -n_z * 1 + 0 → -n_z.

So P_n matrix is:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

We need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix for the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is (P_n - λ I) |v> = 0.

So, let λ = ħ/2.

P_n - λ I = (ħ/2) [ [n_z - 1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1] ]

Wait, no:

Wait, I'm setting up the matrix (P_n - λ I). So each element is:

( (n_z)*(ħ/2) - (ħ/2) ) for (1,1),
n_x*(ħ/2) for (1,2),
n_x*(ħ/2) for (2,1),
(-n_z)*(ħ/2) - (ħ/2) for (2,2).

Wait, λ is ħ/2, so I is [[1,0],[0,1]] multiplied by λ, which is ħ/2. So subtracting λ I would give:

For (1,1): (n_z * (ħ/2)) - ( (ħ/2) *1 ) = (n_z - 1) * (ħ/2)
(1,2): n_x * (ħ/2)
(2,1): n_x * (ħ/2)
(2,2): (-n_z * (ħ/2)) - ( (ħ/2)*1 ) = (-n_z -1) * (ħ/2)

So the matrix becomes:

[ (n_z -1) (ħ/2)   , (n_x ħ/2) ]
[ (n_x ħ/2)        , (-n_z -1) (ħ/2) ]

To find the eigenvectors, we can set up the equation (P_n - λ I) |v> = 0.

Let me represent |v> as a column vector [a; b], where a and b are the components.

So the equations would be:

( (n_z - 1)(ħ/2) ) a + (n_x ħ/2) b = 0
(n_x ħ/2) a + ( (-n_z -1)(ħ/2) ) b = 0

Since ħ/2 is a common factor, we can divide both equations by ħ/2:

(n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

These are two equations. Let me write them as:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0 --> equation (1)
n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0 --> equation (2)

We can set up the system:

Equation (1): (n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b

Assuming n_z -1 is not zero. Wait, but n is a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. So n_z can be -1 (if n_x=0). But in that case, the denominator would be (-1 -1)= -2, which is not zero. So we can proceed.

So substituting a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b into equation (2):

n_x [ (-n_x)/(n_z -1) b ] + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Simplify:

n_x^2 / (n_z -1) * b + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Factor out b:

[ (n_x^2)/(n_z - 1) + (-n_z -1) ] b = 0

Assuming b ≠ 0 (since non-trivial solution), the expression in the brackets must be zero:

(n_x^2)/(n_z -1) - (n_z +1) = 0

Multiply both sides by (n_z -1):

n_x^2 - (n_z +1)(n_z -1) = 0

Note that (n_z +1)(n_z -1) = n_z^2 -1.

So:

n_x^2 - (n_z^2 -1) = 0 → n_x^2 = n_z^2 -1

But wait, n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1 because n is a unit vector. Let's plug that in.

n_x^2 = (n_z^2) -1 → But n_x^2 = 1 - n_z^2.

So 1 - n_z^2 = n_z^2 -1 → 1 +1 = n_z^2 + n_z^2 → 2 = 2 n_z^2 → n_z^2 =1 → n_z = ±1.

But if n_z = 1, then from n_x^2 = n_z^2 -1 → n_x^2 = 0 → n_x=0. So n would be along +z direction.

Similarly, if n_z = -1, n_x=0. So n is along -z direction.

Wait, but that's a problem. Because if n is in the x-z plane and n_z is ±1, then n_x must be zero. So this suggests that the only possible solutions are when n is along the z-axis.

Wait, but the problem states that n is an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. So perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, let me double-check the setup.

Wait, when I substituted a into equation (2), perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go back.

After substituting a = (-n_x/(n_z-1)) b into equation (2):

n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0
→ n_x [ (-n_x)/(n_z-1) b ] + (-n_z -1) b = 0

So:

[ -n_x^2 / (n_z -1) ] b + [ (-n_z -1) ] b = 0

Factor out b:

[ ( -n_x^2 )/(n_z -1) + (-n_z -1) ] = 0

Multiply both sides by (n_z -1) to eliminate denominator:

- n_x^2 + (-n_z -1)(n_z -1) = 0

Expand the second term:

(-n_z -1)(n_z -1) = (-n_z)(n_z -1) -1*(n_z -1) 
= -n_z^2 +n_z -n_z +1 
= -n_z^2 + 0 +1 = 1 -n_z^2

So:

- n_x^2 + (1 -n_z^2) )=0 → 1 -n_z^2 - n_x^2 = 0 → 1= n_x^2 + n_z^2 

Which holds true because n is a unit vector. So, the equation reduces to 0=0. So the substitution is always valid, meaning equation (1) is sufficient to describe the eigenvectors.

So the eigenvectors are determined by equation (1): (n_z -1) a + n_x b =0 → a = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b

So, the eigenvector can be written as [a; b] = b [ -n_x/(n_z -1), 1 ] 

Wait, but we need to find a normalized eigenvector.

Let me express the eigenvector in terms of a parameter. Let me set b=1 (for simplicity), then a = -n_x / (n_z -1).

But wait, let's compute the normalization condition
