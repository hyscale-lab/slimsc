Okay, so I've got this problem about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but I'll try to go through it step by step.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like a two-dimensional metric because it's in terms of dx and dy only. So this is probably a 2-dimensional manifold, maybe a surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space.

I remember that in general relativity and differential geometry, the area of a surface can be found by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. But wait, since this is a 2-dimensional metric, maybe it's easier. The area element is usually sqrt(det g) dx dy, right?

So first, I need to write the metric in matrix form. The line element is ds² = g_{xx} dx² + 2 g_{xy} dx dy + g_{yy} dy². Comparing this to the given metric, it seems there's no cross term (the coefficient of dx dy is zero). So the metric tensor components are:

g_{xx} = 32 / (4 - x² - y²)
g_{xy} = 0
g_{yy} = 32 / (4 - x² - y²)

So the determinant of the metric tensor g, which is a 2x2 matrix, is (g_{xx})(g_{yy}) - (g_{xy})². Since g_{xy} is zero, the determinant is just (32/(4 - x² - y²))².

The area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy. But wait, sqrt of something squared is the absolute value. So sqrt( (32/(4 - ... ))^2 ) = |32/(4 - x² - y²)|. But I think since we're dealing with a metric, the denominator must be positive, so 4 - x² - y² > 0. Therefore, the area element becomes (32)/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

So the total area would be the double integral over the region where 4 - x² - y² > 0, which is the disk of radius 2 centered at the origin, right? Because x² + y² < 4.

So the area A is the integral over x and y, where x² + y² < 4, of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Hmm, how do I compute that integral? Maybe switch to polar coordinates since the region is a circle. Let me try that.

In polar coordinates, x² + y² = r², and dx dy becomes r dr dθ.

So substituting, the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

I can separate the integrals since the integrand is separable in r and θ.

So A = [∫0^{2π} dθ] * [∫0^2 (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr]

The θ integral is straightforward: ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

Now, the r integral: ∫0^2 (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr.

Hmm, let's do a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=4 -4=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ (32 * [ (r dr) ) / u )

Wait, substituting:

r dr = (-du)/2. So,

∫ (32 r dr)/(4 -r²) = ∫ (32 (-du/2)) / u = -16 ∫ du/u.

Limits: when r=0 → u=4; r=2 → u=0.

So the integral becomes:

-16 ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of (1/u) du.

Which is the same as 16 ∫ from u=0 to u=4 of (1/u) du.

But wait, integrating 1/u from 0 to 4 is problematic because as u approaches 0 from the positive side, the integral diverges. Because the integral of 1/u is ln|u|, which approaches negative infinity as u→0+.

Wait, let me compute it step by step:

Integral of (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2.

Let me compute without substitution first. Let me see:

Let’s integrate (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr.

Let me write it as 32 * [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So 32 * ∫ [ r/(u) ] dr = 32 * ∫ (-du/(2u)) ) = -16 ∫ du/u.

Wait, so the integral becomes -16 ln|u| + C.

Now, substituting back u=4 - r².

So the definite integral from r=0 to r=2:

At r=2, u=0. At r=0, u=4.

So ∫ from 0 to 2 of (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr = [ -16 ln|u| ] from 4 to 0.

Which is (-16 ln 0) - ( -16 ln4 )

Wait, ln 0 is negative infinity. So this would be -16 * (-infty) - ( -16 ln4 ) → 16 * infty + 16 ln4. Which is infinity.

So the integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the area A is 2π multiplied by infinity, which is infinite.

Wait, but the options have option D) +infty. So that suggests the area is infinite.

But wait, why would the area be infinite? Let me think about the metric again. The denominator is 4 - x² - y². So as x² + y² approaches 4, the metric blows up. That suggests that the surface is singular at r=2. So the surface is perhaps a hyperbolic space or something with a boundary.

Wait, the problem mentions a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh, a pseudosphere is a type of surface with constant negative curvature. But I'm not sure about the exact properties. But perhaps the area is infinite because of the singularity at r=2.

Wait, but in this case, the area integral is over the disk of radius 2, and the integral diverges because the integrand blows up at the boundary. So the area is infinite.

Looking at the options, option D is +infty. So the correct answer would be D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2-dimensional manifold. To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we use the formula for the area element in a 2-dimensional metric:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \( g \) is the metric tensor. From the given metric, the components of \( g \) are:

\[
g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}, \quad g_{xy} = 0.
\]

The determinant of \( g \) is:

\[
\det g = g_{xx} g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2 = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The total area is the double integral of \( dA \) over the region where \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0 \), which corresponds to the disk of radius 2 centered at the origin. Switching to polar coordinates (\( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \), \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \)), the integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral is straightforward:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

For the radial integral, use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \). When \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \); when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int \frac{1}{u} \, du \) diverges as \( u \to 0 \), meaning the radial integral evaluates to infinity. Therefore, the total area is:

\[
A = 2\pi \cdot \infty = +\infty.
\]

This divergence occurs because the metric blows up at \( r = 2 \), indicating a singularity on the boundary of the pseudosphere. Thus, the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.
