Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking about their relative speed and the total energy of the system. 

The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. Wait, but wait a second, when dealing with relativity, velocities don't just add up normally because of the speed limit of light. I remember something about the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Oh right, you can't just add 0.6c and 0.5c because that would give more than c, which isn't allowed.

So to find the relative speed, I think I need to use the formula for adding velocities in special relativity. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Oh wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact signs. Let me think. If both objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed should be the difference. So I'll take v1 as 0.6c and v2 as 0.5c. So plugging into the formula:

v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Simplify the numerator: 0.1c. The denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c². Oh, the c² cancels, so denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7. Let's calculate that: 0.1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.142857, so about 0.143c. So 0.14c when rounded, which is one of the options. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c for v_rel.

Now for the total energy. The total energy of a relativistic object is given by gamma multiplied by mc². So for each astronaut, I need to calculate their gamma and then sum their energies.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute each one.

First astronaut: m = 2m, v = 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma1 * m * c². Wait wait, the mass here is 2m. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: m = 3m, v = 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) = approx 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² = 1.1547 * 3 m c² = approximately 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 = about 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 mc². 

Looking back at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. That matches.

Wait, but let me double-check that calculation for E. Could I have mixed up the masses? The first astronaut is 2m, so gamma1 is 1.25, so E1 = 2.5 mc². The second is 3m, gamma2 is about 1.1547, so E2 is 3 * 1.1547 * mc², which is about 3.464 mc². So total is 5.964, which is 5.96 mc². So yes, option C.

What about the other options? Option B has 4.96, which is probably the sum of (2m gamma1) and (3m gamma2) without considering their masses correctly. Wait, no, option B's E is 4.96 mc², which is less than 5.96. Hmm, maybe someone would forget to multiply by the mass. But no, in our case, the calculation gives 5.96, which is option C. So I think C is the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using principles of special relativity.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\). We calculate the energy for each astronaut separately and then sum them.

1. **First astronaut** (\(m = 2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):
   \[
   \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6)^2}{1}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
   \]
   \[
   E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
   \]

2. **Second astronaut** (\(m = 3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):
   \[
   \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5)^2}{1}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
   \]
   \[
   E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
   \]

The total energy of the system is:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: C**
