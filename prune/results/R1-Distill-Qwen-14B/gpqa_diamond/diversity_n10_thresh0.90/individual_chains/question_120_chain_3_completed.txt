Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me think about what I know.

Parallax is a measure of distance in astronomy. The formula I remember is parallax (in parsecs) is 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, which means as distance increases, parallax decreases. Right.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, for a given range of parallax, how many stars do we have? Let's say we're looking at a small change in parallax, like from plx to plx + dplx. Wait, no, maybe it's better to think in terms of how many stars are there when you have a certain parallax range.

Wait, if the stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means that the number density is constant. So the number of stars in a region depends on the volume of that region. But I need to relate this to parallax.

Let me get the relation between distance and parallax straight. Since plx = 1/d, the distance d = 1/plx. So, as plx gets smaller, distance is larger.

Now, how does the number of stars in a given parallax interval change? I think I need to calculate the volume in terms of parallax. Because the number of stars depends on the volume, assuming uniform distribution.

Wait, stars are 3D objects, so the density is number per unit volume. But the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So perhaps I should think about how much volume corresponds to a certain range of parallax.

Let me think about a shell between parallax plx and plx + dplx. The corresponding distances would be d = 1/plx and d + dd, where dd is the change in distance. Wait, no, because plx = 1/d, so when plx changes by dplx, the distance changes by dd. Let me compute that.

If plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Taking differentials: dd = -d(plx)/plx². So, a change in parallax dplx would correspond to a change in distance dd = -dplx / plx². But since we're dealing with positive ranges, maybe I should think about the distance corresponding to a parallax range.

But wait, the volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is (4/3)π (d + dd)^3 - (4/3)π d^3. But that's approximately 4π d² dd when dd is small. So the volume is proportional to d² dd.

But since plx is 1/d, d = 1/plx. So substituting, d² is 1/plx², and dd is dplx / plx² (since plx = 1/d, dplx = -dd / d² → dd = -dplx * d² → but since parallax decreases as distance increases, I think the sign might not matter here because we're considering the absolute change in number of stars). Wait, actually, when plx increases, distance decreases, so if plx increases by dplx, d decreases by d d. So maybe the volume is 4π (d)^2 dd, and since d is 1/plx, dd is (dplx) / plx². So substituting, Volume =4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx/plx²) )= 4π dplx / plx^4.

Wait, wait, let me redo that. If I have a small change in parallax dplx, the corresponding change in distance is dd. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, taking the derivative, dd = - (dplx) / (plx^2). So the absolute change in distance is |dd| = dplx / plx^2. So the thickness in distance is dd = dplx / plx².

The volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is approximately 4π d² dd. Substituting d = 1/plx and dd = dplx / plx², the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx²) ) = 4π dplx / plx^4.

So the volume is proportional to 1/plx^4. Since the number of stars is proportional to the volume (assuming uniform density), the number of stars in a unit range of parallax (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of plx changes with plx. So for each unit increase in plx, how does the count change?

Wait, wait, no. The way I just calculated, the number of stars in each shell (which is a range of plx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. So if I have a small range dplx, the number of stars N is proportional to (dplx) * (1/plx^4).

But the question is how the number per unit range changes with plx. So if I consider the number per unit plx (i.e., dN/dplx), that would be (dN)/(dplx). Since dN = k * (1/plx^4) * dplx, then dN/dplx = k / plx^4. So the number per unit plx is inversely proportional to plx^4.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4, which would correspond to this. But wait, let me think again. Because when you have a fixed density, the number of stars in a shell is proportional to the volume, which is 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx^2) )= 4π dplx / plx^4. So if dN = (number density) * volume, number density is constant, so dN = n * (4π dplx / plx^4).

So, the number of stars per unit parallax (dN/dplx) is (4π n) / plx^4, which is proportional to 1/plx^4. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of plx decreases as 1/plx^4.

So the correct option is A) ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by analyzing the relationship between parallax and distance. The parallax formula is given as:

\[
\text{plx} = \frac{1}{d},
\]

where \(d\) is the distance to the star. This means that as distance increases, parallax decreases. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume itself.

Consider a spherical shell at distance \(d\) with a small thickness \(dd\). The volume of this shell is approximately:

\[
\text{Volume} \propto d^2 \, dd.
\]

Using the relationship \(d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}}\), we can express \(dd\) in terms of a small change in parallax \(d\text{plx}\). Taking the derivative of \(d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}}\), we find:

\[
dd = -\frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2}.
\]

Substituting \(d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}}\) and \(dd = \frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2}\) into the volume expression, we get:

\[
\text{Volume} \propto \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} = \frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars in the shell, being proportional to the volume, is:

\[
dN \propto \frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide \(dN\) by \(d\text{plx}\), yielding:

\[
\frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}\). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
