Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best. Let's see what the question says.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane must have bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane skeleton.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I think this is an elimination reaction. KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's dehydrohalogenation. But wait, since there are two bromines, perhaps it's a double elimination. So I'm thinking about E2 mechanisms here. The product would likely form a diene because two Br atoms are removed as HBr, and the double bonds form.

Wait, but wait. KOH can also perform an elimination to form an alkene. So if we have two bromines on adjacent carbons, eliminating both could form a double bond. But in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the bromines are on positions 1 and 3. Hmm, not sure about their positions. Let me think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings. The positions 1 and 3 are probably on adjacent bridgeheads. So when KOH is used, each Br would eliminate with a neighboring H, leading to the formation of a double bond.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: Maybe it's a ring-opening. No, because the product is a light yellow solid. Oh, wait, when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalo) react with KOH, they form alkenes via dehydrohalogenation. But in this case, the dihalide is 1,3, which are not adjacent. So perhaps the reaction is different. Alternatively, maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation to form a diene.

Wait, but let me think again. For a vicinal dihalide (1,2-dibromo), E2 elimination would form a double bond. But for a 1,3-dibromide, maybe the elimination would form a conjugated diene? Or perhaps it's forming a single double bond but in such a way that two Br are removed. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane... Oh, wait, maybe the structure allows for two E2 eliminations to form a diene. Because each Br is on a bridgehead, and eliminating both would form two double bonds? Or perhaps a single double bond.

Wait, maybe the product is 1,3-dieneadamantane? Or maybe a single double bond between 1 and 2, or another position. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a single elimination, but I'm not certain. Let's think about the NMR data for product 1.

The 1H NMR of product 1 shows: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. The IR suggests a carbonyl group, but wait, wait. Wait, 1720 is a strong peak, which is typical for a carbonyl. But wait, KOH is a strong base, so maybe if two eliminations happen, perhaps forming an epoxide? No, no, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone. But wait, how?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. When you have a dihalide reacting with KOH, maybe it's not E2 elimination but rather a substitution. But 1,3-dibromide is more likely to undergo elimination than substitution, especially with strong base. So maybe it's elimination. But wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is more like a carbonyl group. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I'm thinking about this wrong.

Wait, could it
