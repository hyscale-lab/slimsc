Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question is about the operator P, which is a vector operator along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvector corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that for angular momentum operators, the eigenstates are related to the direction of the angular momentum vector. But wait, in this case, the operator might not be the usual angular momentum, but let's see what the components are.

The components of the operator P are given: Px, Py, and Pz. Each is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. Let me write them down.

Px is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. That's the Pauli X matrix, right? Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. And Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

Wait, so P is a vector operator made from these Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. So, for a direction n in the x-z plane, the operator would be P · n, which is the sum of the components multiplied by their respective direction cosines. Since n is in the x-z plane, the y-component of n is zero. So n can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but wait, wait—actually, if it's in the x-z plane, then the angle φ is either 0 or 180, but wait, no, more accurately, the direction n can be represented as (n_x, 0, n_z), because it's in the x-z plane. So the unit vector would be (cosθ, 0, sinθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Because in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle.

So the operator P along n is P·n = (sinθ cosφ) P_x + (sinθ sinφ) P_y + (cosθ) P_z. Wait no, wait! Wait, actually, in the x-z plane, the direction is such that the angle would be θ from the z-axis. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) if we follow the standard convention where θ is the angle from the positive z-axis. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up the axes. Let me think: for a direction in the x-z plane, the angle would typically be measured from the z-axis towards the x-axis. So the direction cosines would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle between the direction n and the z-axis.

So the operator P_n would be (sinθ) P_x + (cosθ) P_z. Because the y-component of n is zero. So P_n = (sinθ) P_x + (cosθ) P_z.

Wait, but wait another thing: since the direction is in the x-z plane, the unit vector n can be written as (n_x, 0, n_z). But since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, assuming θ is the angle from the z-axis.

So P_n is (sinθ) P_x + (cosθ) P_z.

Now, P_n is the operator we're interested in. We need to find its eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

But wait, wait—each component of P is (ħ/2) times a Pauli matrix. So P_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, P_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, P_z = (ħ/2) σ_z. So P_n = (ħ/2)( sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ).

Wait, so P_n = (ħ/2)( cosθ σ_z + sinθ σ_x ). Hmm, maybe it's better to write it as (ħ/2) ( cosθ σ_z + sinθ σ_x ), but the order doesn't matter because it's addition.

Now, the Pauli matrices σ_z and σ_x are given by:

σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]
σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

So, the operator P_n is (ħ/2) multiplied by (cosθ σ_z + sinθ σ_x ). Let me compute that matrix.

Compute cosθ σ_z:

cosθ * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] = [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]

sinθ σ_x:

sinθ * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] = [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]

Adding them together:

[ [cosθ, 0]   [0, sinθ]   ]   = [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]
 [ [0, -cosθ]  [sinθ, 0 ] ]     [ [sinθ, 0],   [-cosθ, sinθ] ]? Wait, no. Wait, when adding matrices, you add element-wise.

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct:

Actually, when you add the two matrices, each element is the sum.

So, for the element (1,1): cosθ + 0 = cosθ.
