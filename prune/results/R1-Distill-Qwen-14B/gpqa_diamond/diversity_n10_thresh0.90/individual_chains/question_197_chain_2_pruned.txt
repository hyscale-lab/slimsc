Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and I have to identify the final product. The options are A, B, C, D. The compound X has given IR and NMR data, so I need to analyze that first to figure out what X is, and then determine what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Let me start by looking at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch, maybe an alcohol or carboxylic acid. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong absorption, probably a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretching. So putting that together, maybe compound X has an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group and possibly an O-H group.

Now the NMR data: 

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is very likely an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid because the O-H in acids are usually broad and around 10-12 ppm.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is probably aromatic protons. A doublet suggests coupling with one adjacent proton. Maybe a para-substituted benzene ring, like two protons in the ortho positions, each next to substituents.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, similar reasoning. So perhaps two protons in the meta or para positions. Wait, if the benzene is para-substituted, maybe each substituent is in the para position, giving two doublets. Let me think: if the substituent is in the para position, the adjacent Hs would be two doublets, which matches what we see here.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, maybe a CH that's adjacent to something else. Could this be a CH group near an electronegative atom like oxygen? Maybe part of an ester or a ketone group?
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, possibly two equivalent CH2 groups, maybe adjacent to a carbonyl. Or perhaps part of a larger chain attached to the aromatic ring.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet, which often indicates a methyl group attached to something with two adjacent protons, like a CH(CH3) group. Wait, maybe it's a geminal substitution, like in a ketone. Or perhaps it's a methyl group attached to a CH2 that's next to the aromatic ring.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, likely a terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain (CH2CH3). So maybe there's an ethyl group somewhere.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with substituents that include a carbonyl group, an ethyl group, and something else. Wait, but the IR has a 1720 cm-1 peak, which is more in line with an ester or ketone. However, the broad peak at 10.5 ppm suggests a carboxylic acid, but then the IR should have a broad O-H around 2500–3300 (which it does, 3400–2500). So maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, but let me check. Carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300 cm-1, which this IR shows. The 1720 would then be the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid. So that fits.

Looking at the NMR again: 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet for the -COOH proton. The aromatic protons: if the ring is para-substituted with a -COOH group, then the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each with two Hs. So for example, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) could be the ortho and meta positions relative to the substituents. Wait, but if there's a substituent in the para position, the aromatic protons would be in two sets. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent in the para position and another group attached elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the ring has two substituents. Because then you'd have a substitution pattern that leads to the doublets in the NMR. For example, if a benzene ring has a -COOH group and another substituent in the para position, then the aromatic protons would be in two doublets. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is in the para position, and there's another group in the meta.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring has only one substituent, but that doesn't explain the two doublets. So maybe the substituent is in the para position, and the ring has another substituent in the ortho or meta. Hmm.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR signals. The downfield protons are likely closer to the substituents. So 8.0 ppm is probably the protons ortho to the substituent, and 7.2 is meta. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group like -COOH, which causes the ortho and para protons to be deshielded.

But wait, in a para-substituted benzoic acid, the ring protons would be in two sets: the two ortho to the COOH (each as a doublet if they are adjacent, but if the substituent is in the para position, perhaps the ring structure is such that the neighboring Hs are equivalent. Or perhaps the substituent is in the para position, and another group is in the meta.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is not a COOH but an ester. Because if it's an ester, the carbonyl would appear around 1720 cm-1, but then the O-H would be an ester's O-H, which is less acidic than a carboxylic acid. Wait, but in the NMR, there's a broad peak, which is more characteristic of a carboxylic acid O-H. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a methyl ester or ethyl ester, but then the O-H would be an alcohol, but that doesn't fit the IR's O-H (since esters don't have O-H, unless they're something else). Wait no, esters don't have O-H; they have an OR group. So, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid.

So if it's a benzoic acid derivative, the substituents would be on the benzene ring, and perhaps another group attached through the carbonyl.

Looking at the NMR again, the 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H), 1.7 ppm (2H), 1.4 (3H), and 0.9 (3H) suggest a chain structure. Let me think:

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is a terminal methyl group. So perhaps an ethyl group (CH2CH3) attached to something. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) could be a methyl group attached to a CH2, like in a -CH2-C(CH3)- structure. Wait, or perhaps it's a methyl group attached to a CH that's next to another CH2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's an isobutyl group. Let's see: isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. But the NMR doesn't show a triplet for a CH2CH3; it shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 3H, which would be the end of an ethyl chain. So perhaps a CH2CH3 group attached somewhere. Then maybe another CH2, and a CH.

Putting that together, maybe the structure is something like a benzene ring with a -COOH group in the para position and an isobutyl group attached. Wait, but let me reconstruct:

The NMR shows:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): So two sets of two protons each, which suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, perhaps.

Wait, but a para-substituted benzene would have two equivalent protons adjacent to each substituent. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about substituents.

If the benzene has a substituent in the para position (like a carbonyl group), then the adjacent (ortho) protons would be two in number, but perhaps those are the 8.0 ppm doublets. Then, the 7.2 ppm doublets could be the protons in the meta positions. Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene, the meta positions would have two protons each, but perhaps they're equivalent if the substituent is symmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is not in the para position but somewhere else, leading to different coupling.

Wait, perhaps the benzene isn't para substituted but has two substituents. For example, a substituent in the para position and another group in the meta or ortho. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a meta-substituted benzene with two substituents.

Wait, maybe the substituents are a -COOH group and a -O-R group, but that might complicate the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group, but then the O-H wouldn't be there.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzoic acid with an ethyl group attached via a carbonyl, but wait, that's more of an ester.

Wait, maybe the structure is 4-ethylbenzoic acid. Let me think: Benzoic acid with an ethyl group in the para position. So the aromatic ring would have a COOH in one position and an ethyl group in the opposite (para) position. In that case, the aromatic protons would be in two sets of doublets. The protons adjacent to COOH would be more deshielded, hence appear at higher ppm, like around 8.0, whereas the protons adjacent to the ethyl group would be less deshielded, at lower ppm, like 7.2.

So the 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) would be the two protons ortho to the COOH group. The 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) would be the two protons ortho to the ethyl group. But wait, in this setup, the substituents are para, so each substituent has two adjacent protons. That would create two doublets in the NMR, each integrating to 2H.

But then what about the other NMR signals?

Looking at the other signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a terminal CH2CH3 group. So perhaps an ethyl chain attached somewhere. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a methyl group attached to something. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to that methyl. The 2.9 ppm (1H) would be a CH group, maybe connected to the aromatic ring.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

So, suppose the benzene ring has a -COOH group in position 4 (para) and an ethyl group attached via a CH2-CH(CH3)- group. Or maybe the ethyl is in a different position.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group or an isobutyl group. Let me think about the NMR.

The ethyl group (CH2CH3) would show as a triplet at 0.9 ppm. Then, perhaps the CH2 next to it would be a quartet. But the NMR doesn't show a quartet here. Hmm, the 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) could be a CH2 group connected to a CH that is connected to the aromatic ring.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group? Not sure.

Wait, let's think. The 2.9 ppm (1H, m) is a CH group. The 1.7 ppm (2H, m) could be a CH2 connected to that CH. The 1.4 (3H, d) could be a methyl group attached to the CH2. And the 0.9 (3H, t) is a terminal methyl. So maybe the substituent is a CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the ring.

Wait, if the substituent is a CH2CH2CH3 group, but I'm not sure. Let me think of the substituent as a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, no, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that would be a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an isobutyl group. For example, the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, that's a tert-butyl group. An isobutyl group would be CH2CH(CH3)2, but that would have a different branching.

Wait, another approach: let's try to match the NMR shifts.

The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a methyl group attached to something. If it's a -CH(CH3)2 group, but that would be a diamond-shaped structure. Alternatively, if it's a -CH2CH(CH3) group, then the CH(CH3) would have a methyl group attached.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3) group attached to the ring. So the structure would be benzene with a substituent like -CH2CH(CH3)COOH. No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached via a carbonyl. So maybe it's a benzoyl group with a substituent. Alternatively, maybe it's a benz
