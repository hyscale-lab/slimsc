Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again.

So, the question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its area, and the spots are 1000K cooler than the star's effective temperature of 6000K. The astronomers are observing this, and because only one hemisphere is spotty, the star's brightness varies as it rotates. This setup can mimic an exoplanet's effect on the star's light curve. The question is asking, if there were no spots, what exoplanet radius would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spots do.

Hmm. So, I need to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to that caused by a planet transiting the star.

Wait, right. When a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.

Similarly, the spots on the star cause a variation in brightness as the star rotates. When the spot is facing towards us, the brightness drops because that area is cooler and emits less light. But since the spots are on one hemisphere, as the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing the brightness to dip periodically.

So, the problem is asking: what planet radius would cause the same dip in brightness as these spots do.

I think I need to calculate the fractional change in brightness (delta F) caused by the spots and the planet, and set them equal to find the required planet radius.

First, let's tackle the spots. The spots are covering 20% of the hemisphere. Wait, wait, wait. The filling factor is 20%, which is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface covered by spots.

Wait, the star is a sphere, so the surface area is 4πR², but the hemisphere is 2πR². So, if the filling factor is 20%, the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR². Because the spots are only on one hemisphere. So the total area of spots is 0.4πR² (since 20% of 2πR² is 0.4πR²).

But wait, wait. The filling factor is usually the fraction of the total stellar surface covered. Wait, the question says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Oh, so the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, not the entire star. So that hemisphere has 20% of its area in spots.

So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2πR²). Because each hemisphere is 2πR² in area.

Wait, but the star's total surface area is 4πR². So the spots cover 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the spots are 0.4πR² / 4πR² = 10% of the star's total surface. So that's 10% of the star's
