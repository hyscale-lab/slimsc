Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit strange. I think I remember that the metric usually has terms with differentials squared, but here it's multiplied by this denominator. Oh right, maybe this is a 2-dimensional metric because it's only in x and y. So we're working in 2D spacetime here?

I'm trying to recall what a pseudosphere is. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Wait, but in two dimensions, that's a hyperbolic plane. The metric for a hyperbolic plane can be written in different forms, like the Poincaré disk model. Let me think about that. The Poincaré disk metric is usually something like ds² = (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate in the disk. But wait, our metric here is in terms of x and y, not r and θ.

Wait, maybe I can relate this. Let me see. If I consider radial coordinates x and y, perhaps in a polar coordinate system. Let me think, for polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then x² + y² = r². So the denominator in the metric becomes 4 - r². So the metric ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²). Hmm, that might be easier to work with.

Wait, another way to write this is ds² = (32)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²). How does this compare to the standard Poincaré disk metric? The standard one is (4/(1 - r²)^2)(dr² + r² dθ²). Let me see if these can be related. Let me compute the denominator: 4 - r² = 4(1 - (r²/4)), so 4 - r² = 4(1 - (r/2)^2). So the denominator is 4*(1 - (r/2)^2). So the metric becomes (32)/(4*(1 - (r/2)^2)) ) (dr² + r² dθ²) = (8)/(1 - (r/2)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²).

Wait, wait, let's double-check that. 32 divided by 4 is 8, yes. So the metric is (8/(1 - (r/2)^2)) (dr² + r² dθ²). Compare that to the standard Poincaré disk metric, which is (4/(1 - r'^2)^2) (dr'² + r'² dθ²), where r' is the radial coordinate in the disk.

Hmm, maybe there's a scaling factor here. Let's see if I can make this look like the standard form. Let me make a substitution: let r' = r/2. Then dr' = dr/2, and r = 2 r'. So, substituting into our metric:

dr = 2 dr', and r² = (2 r')² =4 r'².

So, substituting into the metric:

8/(1 - (r/2)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²) = 8/(1 - r'^2) [ (4 dr'^2) + (4 r'^2) dθ^2 ].

Wait, let's compute that:

= 8/(1 - r'^2) [4 dr'^2 + 4 r'^2 dθ^2 ]

= 8/(1 - r'^2) *4 [ dr'^2 + r'^2 dθ^2 ]

= 32/(1 - r'^2) (dr'^2 + r'^2 dθ^2 )

Hmm, but the standard Poincaré metric is
