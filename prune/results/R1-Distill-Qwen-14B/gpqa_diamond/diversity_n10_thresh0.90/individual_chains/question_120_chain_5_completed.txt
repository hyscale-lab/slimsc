Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, and we're supposed to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each involving different powers of 1/plx. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, so maybe I need to think about how stars' distribution affects the number we observe at different parallax ranges.

Wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Right, the formula is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So a star with a larger parallax is closer to us. So if we're looking at stars with a certain range of parallaxes, that corresponds to a certain range of distances.

The stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that their density in space is uniform. So the number density of stars is the same everywhere. But wait, when we observe them, the number we see in a certain volume depends on how that volume is projected onto the sky. Oh right, the number of stars we observe in a given direction depends on the volume of space we're looking at.

So the key here is understanding how the volume of a shell at a certain distance relates to the parallax. Let's think about a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd. The volume of that shell would be 4πd² dd, because it's a spherical shell with radius d and thickness dd. But wait, wait, wait. No, because in reality, we're looking in a particular direction, so perhaps it's a cylindrical volume? Or maybe it's more about the solid angle. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, maybe we can model the distribution as a three-dimensional uniform distribution. Since stars are spread out uniformly in space, the number of stars in a given volume depends on that volume. So the number of stars in a thin shell (like a spherical shell) at distance d with thickness dd would be proportional to the volume of that shell, which is 4πd² dd. But wait, why is that? Oh right, because the volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πr² dr, where r is the radius (distance from us), and dr is the thickness of the shell.

But wait, in our case, the parallax is plx = 1/d. So if I have a parallax range from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding distance range? Let's see, plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So if plx increases by a small amount dplx, the distance changes by dd = - (dplx)/(plx^2). Because plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Taking derivative, dd = -dplx/(plx^2). But I'm not sure if the exact change is important here because the question is about how the number per unit parallax range varies with plx.

So the number of stars in a given parallax interval (say, from plx to plx + dplx) is proportional to the number of stars in the corresponding distance range (d to d + dd). Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is constant, so the number of stars in a volume is proportional to the volume.

So the number N in the parallax interval dplx should be proportional to the volume between d and d + dd. Let's compute that volume.

The volume between d and d + dd is approximately 4π (d^2 + 2d dd) dd. Wait, no, that's the formula for the volume between two spherical shells. Alternatively, for a thin shell, the volume is 4π d² dd. So dV = 4π d² dd.

But since we want to express this in terms of plx, which is 1/d, let's substitute d = 1/plx.

So, dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * dd. But we need to express dd in terms of dplx. From plx = 1/d, we have d = 1/plx, so dd = -dplx/(plx^2). Wait, but d is a function of plx, so when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by dd. So substituting, dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-dplx/(plx^2)) ). Hmm, but the negative sign indicates the direction of change, but since we're dealing with small intervals, the magnitude is what matters.

Wait, perhaps I should express the volume as a function of plx. So, dV = 4π (d^2) * dd. But since d =1/plx, then d^2 =1/plx^2. And dd = -d (dplx) because plx =1/d, so d =1/plx. So d =1/plx, so dd = - (d dplx) = - (1/plx) dplx.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try a different approach. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is proportional to the volume of that shell, which is 4π d² * (thickness of the shell in distance). But we want to express the thickness in terms of parallax. Let me denote the differential parallax as dplx. So, since plx =1/d, the thickness in distance dd is related to dplx by dd = -d^2 dplx. Because plx =1/d → d =1/plx → dd = -d (dplx)/(plx^2) → but wait, substituting d =1/plx, we get dd = - (1/(plx^2)) dplx.

Wait, let me compute this correctly. If plx =1/d, then d =1/plx. Taking the derivative of both sides, dd = -d (dplx)/(plx^2). So yes, that's correct. So the thickness in distance, dd, is -(d^2) dplx. But d =1/plx, so dd = -(1/(plx^2)) dplx.

So substituting back into the volume: dV =4π d² * dd =4π (1/plx^2) * (-1/(plx^2)) dplx. Oh wait, but the negative sign here indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But since we're considering the magnitude for the number of stars, we can ignore the negative sign, because we're just looking at the absolute change.

So dV =4π (1/plx^2) * (1/(plx^2)) dplx ) → 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. Wait, wait, that would make dV proportional to 1/plx^4 * dplx. But that doesn't seem right. Because I thought the number of stars in a shell would depend on the square of the distance, but perhaps because the parallax is involved, it's a different power.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution. Let me go again.

The volume of the shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² dd.

We need to express this in terms of parallax plx. Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx.

So, substituting d = 1/plx into the volume:

dV =4π (1/plx)^2 * dd.

But dd is the change in distance. We have plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So, the change in plx dplx is d (dd) = -d^2 dplx (since d=1/plx, so plx =1/d → d =1/plx → d dplx = - (1/plx^2) dplx). Wait, let me compute dd correctly:

dd = derivative of d with respect to plx. Since d =1/plx,

dd = derivative of (1/plx) with respect to plx → dd = -1/(plx^2).

So for a small change in plx, dplx, the change in d is dd = -d/(plx^2) → wait, no. Wait, more accurately, d=1/plx, so dd = - (1)/(plx^2) dplx.

So, dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

So now, substituting back into dV:

dV =4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx^2) dplx )

But since we're only considering the magnitude, we can ignore the negative sign, so:

dV =4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx ) → 4π/(plx^4) * dplx.

Wait, so the volume (dV) is proportional to 1/plx^4 multiplied by the differential parallax dplx.

Now, the number of stars in this volume would be the number density multiplied by dV. But the question says the stars are uniformly distributed, so the number density is a constant, say, n. So the number of stars, N, is n * dV.

So N = n * 4π/(plx^4) * dplx.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So that's N/(dplx) = (n *4π) / (plx^4) ) * (dplx/dplx) → which is (n *4π) / plx^4.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the question asks how the number of stars per unit range of plx changes with plx. So that's N per dplx, which is the density in plx space. So that's N/(dplx) = number per unit plx.

But according to this, N/(dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. So that would suggest the answer is option A, which is ~1/plx^4.

But wait, I'm confused because I thought the number of stars in a shell would depend on 1/plx^4, but that doesn't match my initial intuition. Let me think about it again. Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, another approach: the number of stars in a given parallax interval (like per unit plx) would be the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d, with thickness corresponding to dplx. So the volume of that shell is 4π d² dd. Then, since d=1/plx, and dd is the change in d for a change in plx, which is dplx.

Wait, if plx increases by dplx, then d decreases by dd = d^2 dplx, because plx =1/d → d =1/plx → dd = -d^2 dplx (because if plx increases, d decreases). So, using this, dd = d^2 dplx.

So, the volume is 4π d² dd =4π d² * (d^2 dplx) )=4π d^4 dplx.

But since d =1/plx, then d^4 =1/plx^4. So the volume becomes 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars is N = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Therefore, the number per unit plx is N/dplx =4π n (1/plx^4).

So that's 1 over plx to the fourth power. So the answer should be option A, ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought the number of stars would be inversely proportional to plx squared, but maybe I'm confusing this with something else. Let me think of it in terms of the density.

Alternatively, considering that each star's contribution in a given direction depends on the solid angle, but I think that's not the right approach here. No, the correct approach is to model the volume in terms of parallax.

Another way: since the number of stars is uniform in space, the number per unit volume is n. The volume per unit parallax interval is dV/dplx.

From earlier, we found dV/dplx =4π d² (d^2) )=4 π d^4.

But since d=1/plx, this is 4 π (1/plx)^4.

So dV/dplx is proportional to 1/plx^4. Thus, the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the correct answer is option A: ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: 

\[
\text{plx} = \frac{1}{d},
\]

where \(d\) is the distance in parsecs. A larger parallax corresponds to a closer star. The stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning the number density of stars is constant. The number of stars observed in a given range of parallax depends on the volume of space corresponding to that range.

Consider a thin spherical shell at distance \(d\) with thickness \(dd\). The volume of this shell is:

\[
dV = 4\pi d^2 dd.
\]

Since \(\text{plx} = \frac{1}{d}\), we can express \(d\) in terms of \(\text{plx}\): 

\[
d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}}.
\]

The thickness \(dd\) in distance corresponds to a small change in parallax \(d\text{plx}\). Taking the derivative of \(d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}}\), we find:

\[
dd = -\frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2}.
\]

Substituting \(d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}}\) and \(dd = -\frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2}\) into the volume expression:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2}\right).
\]

Ignoring the negative sign (as we are considering magnitudes), this simplifies to:

\[
dV = \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this volume is proportional to the number density \(n\) of stars multiplied by the volume:

\[
N = n \cdot dV = n \cdot \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars per unit range of parallax is then:

\[
\frac{N}{d\text{plx}} = \frac{n \cdot 4\pi}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}\). This corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
