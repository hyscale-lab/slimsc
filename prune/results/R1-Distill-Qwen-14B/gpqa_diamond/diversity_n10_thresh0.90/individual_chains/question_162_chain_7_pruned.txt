Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I remember that metrics describe the geometry of spacetime, but I'm not entirely sure about all the details. Let me think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) * (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a line element in two dimensions. I think it's a 2-dimensional metric since it only involves x and y coordinates. So the spacetime here is 2D, maybe like a surface in some higher-dimensional space.

I remember that when dealing with areas in curved spaces, you often use the concept of the area element, which involves the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. Oh right, the area element dA is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor g_{μν}.

So first, I need to write the metric in matrix form. The given metric is ds² = [32/(4 -x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). That implies that the coefficients for dx² and dy² are both 32/(4 - x² - y²), and the cross terms (like dxdy or dydx) are zero. So the metric tensor would look like:

g_{xx} = 32/(4 - x² - y²)
g_{yy} = 32/(4 - x² - y²)
g_{xy} = 0
g_{yx} = 0

So the matrix form is diagonal with those entries. The determinant of a 2x2 diagonal matrix is just the product of the diagonal elements. So determinant g = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) * (32/(4 - x² - y²)) ) = [32^2]/(4 - x² - y²)^2.

Wait, so the area element dA is sqrt(determinant) dx dy. But wait, no, the area element in 2D is actually sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant. Wait, but in the case of a diagonal metric, sqrt(g) would be sqrt(g_xx * g_yy), which is the same as sqrt(g) because the off-diagonal terms are zero. So sqrt(g) would be (32)/(4 - x² - y²), because sqrt( (32/(...))^2 ) is 32/(...).

Wait, actually, the determinant g is (32/(4 -x² -y²))^2. So sqrt(g) would be 32/(4 -x² -y²). Correct.

So the area element dA is (32)/(4 -x² -y²) dx dy.

Wait, but the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh wait, wait—pseudosphere usually refers to a surface of constant negative curvature, right? But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps the metric is that of a pseudosphere. Let me think about the form of the metric. The metric I have is conformally flat because it's just a scalar function multiplied by the flat metric (dx² + dy²). So the line element is conformally related to the Euclidean metric.

In general, the area of a surface can be found by integrating the area element over the surface. So for a pseudosphere, which is a surface of constant negative curvature, the total area is finite. But wait, I might be mixing things up. Wait, the pseudosphere is a finite area surface with infinite extent, right? Or maybe not—I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about finding the area using the given metric. The pseudosphere's radius is given as r=2. Wait, what's the formula for the area of a pseudosphere? I think for a pseudosphere (which is a tractricoid), the area is 4π a, where a is the radius of curvature. So if the radius is 2, then area would be 4π * 2 = 8π? Wait but none of the options have that.

Wait, the options are A)0, B)4π(x² +y²), C)4π(x² - y²), D) +infty.

Hmm, but the options don't seem to match that. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the metric given is that of a 2D space, and the question is about the area of the entire space, not a pseudosphere.

Wait, the question says, "What is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2?" But perhaps the given metric describes a pseudosphere? Or maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the area is being calculated using the metric provided. The metric is given in terms of x and y, but I'm not sure about the limits of integration. Let's see. The denominator is (4 -x² -y²). So 4 - x² - y² must be positive to avoid singularities, so x² + y² <4. So the domain is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. Wait, because x² + y² <4 implies radius 2.

Wait, so the metric only exists where x² + y² <4. So integrating over the entire allowed area would be over a disk of radius 2. But the area element is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

So the total area A would be the integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Hmm, that integral might be tricky. Let me think about changing to polar coordinates. Let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy becomes r dr dθ. So the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ

Wait, because 4 -x² - y² is 4 - r².

So A = 32 * ∫0^{2π} dθ ∫0^2 [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr

Let me compute the inner integral first.

Compute ∫0^2 [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

Let me make a substitution: u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

When r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=4 -4=0.

So the integral becomes:

∫(u=4 to u=0) [ 1/(u) ] * (-1/2) du

= (1/2) ∫ (u=0 to 4) (1/u) du

= (1/2) [ ln(u) ] from 0 to 4.

Wait, but when u approaches 0, ln(u) approaches negative infinity. That suggests the integral diverges to infinity. So the area A would be 32 * (1/2) * [ln(4) - ln(0) ] → 32*(1/2)*(infinite) → infinite.

But wait, that's the integral from 0 to 2. So the area is infinite. So the area of the pseudosphere would be infinite? But earlier I thought pseudospheres have finite area. Hmm, perhaps because the metric's domain is a finite disk, but the area element is such that the integral diverges.

Wait, but in reality, a pseudosphere (tractricoid) has finite area. So perhaps this metric isn't that of a pseudosphere. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between the metric of a pseudosphere and this given metric. Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about integrating the area but just recognizing the form.

Wait, the options are A)0, B)4π(x² + y²), C)4π(x² - y²), D)+infty.

Wait, in my calculation, the area integral is divergent. So the area is infinite. So the answer would be D) +infty.

But wait, the question specifies the pseudosphere of radius 2. So perhaps the area is finite and the options are something else. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another thought: maybe this metric represents a hyperbolic space. Because for hyperbolic space in 2D, the metric can be written as ds² = (dr² + dz²)/(1 - (r²)/R²), where R is the radius of curvature. But in our case, the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²) = 4 - r², but our R would be 2. So perhaps this is a model of hyperbolic space with R=2.

The area of a hyperbolic plane is infinite, as it's unbounded. But if we're considering a sphere (pseudosphere) perhaps the area is finite. Wait, but a pseudosphere is a finite area surface with infinite total curvature, but the area itself is finite. So perhaps I'm getting confused between the model and the actual surface.

Wait, maybe the given metric isn't of the pseudosphere itself but of some other space. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question, because the area element leads to an infinite area.

Alternatively, perhaps the pseudosphere is compact, but in this case, the domain is x² + y² <4, which is compact, but the area element has a singularity at r=2, which is the boundary. So the integral over a compact domain with a singularity could still be finite or infinite, depending on the behavior near the singularity.

Wait, let me check the behavior of the integrand near r=2. The integrand is [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ. As r approaches 2, (4 - r²) approaches 0. So the integrand behaves like (32)/(4 - r²) * r. Let me set r=2 - ε, where ε is small.

Then 4 - r² =4 - (4 -4ε + ε²) =4ε - ε² ≈4ε when ε is small.

So the integrand ~ (32)/(4 ε) )*(2 - ε) ) * (dr) → (32)/(4 ε) * 2 ) dr → (16/ε ) dr.

So as r approaches 2, the integrand behaves like (16/(2 - r)) dr.

So the integral near r=2 is ∫ (16/(2 - r)) dr. Let me make substitution u=2 - r → du = -dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ (16/u) (-du) = ∫ (16/u) du from u=0 to u approaching 0 from positive side. That integral becomes 16 ln u, which tends to -infinity as u approaches 0. Wait, but we're looking at the integral from 0 to 2, so the integral ∫0^2 [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr is equal to (1/2) [ ln(4 - r²) ] evaluated from 0 to 2. Wait, wait, no, because when I did the substitution earlier, it's ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr = (1/2) ln(4 - r²) ) + C.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the integral.

Let me compute the integral ∫r/(4 - r²) dr.

Let me let u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) )= ∫ (-1/2) (du)/u = (-1/2) ln|u| + C = (-1/2) ln(4 - r²) + C.

So evaluating from 0 to 2:

[ (-1/2) ln(4 - (2)^2) ] - [ (-1/2) ln(4 - 0^2) ]

= [ (-1/2) ln(0) ] - [ (-1/2) ln(4) ]

ln(0) is negative infinity, so (-1/2) ln(0) is positive infinity. So the inner integral is ∫0^2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr = [ (-1/2) ln(4 - r²) ) ] from 0 to 2.

At r=2: ln(0) → -infty → (-1/2)(-infty) = infty.

At r=0: ln(4) → a finite value. So the integral is (infty) - (something finite) → infty.

So the inner integral diverges to infinity. Then the total area A is 32 * (1/2) * (infty) → infinite. So the area is infinite, option D.

But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere, which is a finite area. So why is the integral giving infinite area? Maybe the given metric isn't that of a pseudosphere but something else, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the pseudosphere's radius is 2, so the area is 4π a, where a is the radius. So if a=2, area is
