Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think it through step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question gives a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. It's reacting through a series of reagents, and I need to find the final product from the options given.

First, let's look at the NMR data. The 1H-NMR is given as:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

I remember that in NMR, the chemical shifts can tell me about the functional groups. The peak around 9.72 ppm is a triplet (t), which is pretty upfield for an aldehyde proton. Wait, no, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But this is a triplet, so maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton, like from a phenol or an enol.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's an aldehyde (RCHO) because that's around 9-10 ppm. But why is it a triplet? Hmm. Alternatively, could it be an enol proton? Or perhaps an aromatic proton adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group like nitro? Or maybe it's an aldehyde but coupled to something else.

Looking at the other peaks. At 6.98 ppm, a doublet (d) for 2H. This might be an aromatic ring with substituents. Similarly, 6.51 ppm, another doublet for 2H. So perhaps two sets of two aromatic protons, each as doublets. That suggests maybe a para-substituted benzene ring. Like if there are substituents in the para positions, the protons would be doublets. Alternatively, if it's a di-substituted ring where the substituents are in positions that cause coupling.

Then 6.27 ppm, a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests perhaps an exchangeable proton or something like an enol, or maybe adjacent to an electronegative group. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with ortho substituents, but the broadness is a bit confusing.

The 3.66 ppm, a doublet for 2H. That's around where methylene groups attached to something like oxygen might be. Like OCH2, but the coupling would depend on the neighbors. For example, in a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps part of an ester or ether.

Putting this together. Let's think about the possible structure. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So:

(2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. Which could be, say, two rings and two double bonds, or one ring, one double bond, and one triple bond, etc.

Looking at the NMR, let's see. The peaks at 6.98 and 6.51 suggest aromatic protons. So perhaps two benzene rings? Or maybe one. Let me think: if it's two benzene rings, each would have four protons, but the given data has two doublets (each 2H) and a triplet (1H), which complicates things. Alternatively, maybe one benzene ring with substituents.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's see, if it's two benzene rings, each is C6H5, but that would give us C12, which is too much. So maybe one benzene ring is present. Let's see: C6H5 would be C6H5- something else. What's the remaining structure?

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. So subtracting a benzene ring (C6H5), we're left with C2H4NO. So maybe the structure is benzene attached to a group of C2H4NO.

Wait, C2H4NO could be something like an amide, but more likely, considering the NMR, perhaps an aldehyde or a ketone. But another possibility is a nitro group. Alternatively, maybe an amino group.

Let's think about the NMR shifts again. The 9.72 ppm triplet (1H) is a key clue. If it's an aldehyde, then the triplet would imply it's coupled to two equivalent protons. So maybe the aldehyde is next to a CH2 group. Like RCH2CHO, where the CH2 is adjacent to the aldehyde. Then, the aldehyde proton would be split by the two CH2 protons, giving a triplet. The 3.66 ppm doublet (2H) could be the CH2 attached to the aldehyde. So that would fit. So the structure would have a CH2CHO group.

But wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. If the structure is benzene (C6H5) attached to something else. Let's see: C6H5-CH2CHO would be C8H7O. But the formula has C8H9NO, so there's an extra H and a N and O. So maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nitro group attached. Like C6H5-CH2-CH(NO)... Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively
