Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

Let me start by reading the question again. Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Wait, so for the relative speed, I think it's not as simple as just subtracting the two speeds because we're dealing with relativity. I remember that when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just use classical addition. Oh right, the formula for adding velocities relativistically is different. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me make sure I get that right. So here, one is moving at 0.6c, and the other at 0.5c. Since both are in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the question says they're moving in the positive x-direction. Are they moving in the same direction or opposite? The question says both are in the positive x-direction, so their speeds are in the same direction. So the relative speed is the difference between their speeds, but using the relativistic formula.

Wait, no, wait again. I think I got that wrong. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)), right? Because when you have two velocities in the same direction, you subtract the smaller from the larger to get the relative speed. So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So the relative speed is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² ). Let me compute that.

Wait, but let me compute the numerator and denominator separately. Numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/c². The c² cancels, so denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7. 0.1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c. So that's about 0.14c. Looking at the options, C and D have 0.14c for v_rel.

Now for the total energy of the system. I remember that the total energy in relativity is the sum of the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy, but wait no, wait. No, the total energy is the sum of each astronaut's relativistic energy.

Wait, each astronaut's energy is gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy. So for each, E = gamma * mc².

But wait, the masses are 2m and 3m. So their rest energies are 2mc² and 3mc². But their energies at speed v would be gamma(v) * m_i c², right?

So astronaut 1: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. So gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut 2: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 3 * 1.1547 is 3*1.1547 = about 3.4641 m c².

So total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc², but that's lower. So the E should be approximately 5.96, which matches option C.

So the relative speed is 0.14c and the total energy is 5.
