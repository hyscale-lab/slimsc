Okay, I'm trying to figure out this crystallography problem. So the question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that in crystals, the interplanar distance is calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices.

Wait, what's a rhombohedral crystal? Oh right, a rhombohedron is a type of crystal structure where all the edges are equal in length, and all the angles between the edges are the same. So in this case, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each. So the lattice is a rhombohedral one with a = b = c, and angles all 30 degrees.

The interplanar distance, d, is given by the formula d = a/(sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ)) )^(1/2). Wait, no, I think the general formula is d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \gamma) + 2(hl \cos \beta) + 2(kl \cos \alpha)}}} but wait, maybe I got the angles mixed up. I need to get the formula correct.

Wait, another thought: the formula for interplanar distance in a general crystal system is d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{(h^
