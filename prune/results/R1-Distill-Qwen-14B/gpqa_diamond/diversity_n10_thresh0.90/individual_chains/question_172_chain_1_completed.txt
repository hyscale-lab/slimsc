Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember that when atoms are excited, it has something to do with temperature. Oh right, the Boltzmann distribution comes into play here. Let me think this through.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And both photospheres are in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies. So the Boltzmann equation should be relevant here.

The Boltzmann distribution equation is something like the ratio of populations in two energy levels. The formula I recall is (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). Here, E is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this question, the energy difference is given, so E_i - E_j is 1.38e-23 J. Let's assume that g_i and g_j (the statistical weights) are the same for both stars, or perhaps the ratio g_i/g_j is the same for both stars. Because the problem is comparing the two stars, maybe the g factors cancel out.

Wait, but the problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So for star_1, n_i is twice that of star_2's n_i. So n1_i / n1_j = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j). Because if star_1 has twice as excited, then n1_i is twice n2_i, assuming the same denominator.

Wait, actually, let me clarify. Let's say the energy levels are E1 and E2. The excitation is the population in E1 relative to E2. So for star_1, n1 = 2 * n2, where n2 is the population of star_2 in that level.

So, the ratio (n1_i)/(n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i)/(n2_j). Or wait, no. Because n1_i/n1_j is the ratio for star_1, and n2_i/n2_j is the ratio for star_2. So according to the problem, (n_i)/(n_j) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So (n1_i/n1_j)/(n2_i/n2_j) ) = 2. But if the statistical weights g_i and g_j are same for both stars, then the ratios (n_i/n_j) would be proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)) for each star.

Wait, let's write that down. For star 1, n1_i/n1_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) )

For star 2, n2_i/n2_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) )

So the ratio of these two equations is (n1_i/n1_j) / (n2_i/n2_j) ) = exp[ -(ΔE/(k T1)) + (ΔE/(k T2)) )

Because when you divide the two exponential terms, you get exp( (ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ) )

But according to the problem, the ratio is 2. So:

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2.

Wait, let me double-check:

Wait, (n1_i/n1_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly for star 2. So when we take (n1_i/n1_j) / (n2_i/n2_j) ) = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Set that equal to 2.

So ln(2) = (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Hmm. Let's rearrange that equation:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) )

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So, ln(2) equals (ΔE/k) multiplied by (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

But wait, what's the value of ΔE and k? Let me plug in the numbers. The given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh! So ΔE is equal to k_B * (some temperature?), but wait, let's compute.

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * T, where T would be 1 K? Because 1.38e-23 J = (1.38e-23 J/K) * 1 K. So ΔE / k is 1 K.

So, substituting ΔE/k = 1 K into the equation:

ln(2) = (1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Which can be written as ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Looking at the options, option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So that's the correct equation.

Let me just check the other options to make sure. Option A is ln(2) = T2/T1. That doesn't match the equation we derived. Option B is (T1+T2)/(T1 T2), which doesn't fit. Option C has (T1-T2)/(T1 T2)^2, which is squared in the denominator. Our equation has only (T1 T2) in the denominator, not squared.

So the correct option is D.


The question involves determining the correct equation for the effective temperatures of two stars (star_1 and star_2) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The problem states that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2, and the energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). Both photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann distribution applies.

The Boltzmann distribution relates the populations of two energy levels as:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( n_i \) and \( n_j \) are the populations of the energy levels, \( g_i \) and \( g_j \) are the statistical weights, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant (\( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)), and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratio is given as:

\[
\frac{n_{1i}}{n_{1j}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2i}}{n_{2j}}.
\]

Dividing the equations for star_1 and star_2 and simplifying gives:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E = k \cdot 1 \, \text{K} \) (since \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)) simplifies the equation to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_2}{T_1} \) does not match the derived equation.
- **Option B**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 + T_2}{T_1 T_2} \) is inconsistent with the derived equation.
- **Option C**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{(T_1 T_2)^2} \) incorrectly includes a squared term in the denominator.

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
