Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed determined by its amplitude and the spring constant. But this is the relativistic case, so I guess things are a bit different because of the effects of relativity. 

Wait, the question says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator. The mass is m, maximum amplitude A, and follows Hooke's law F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed v_max. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is given by v_max = sqrt(k/m) * A. But that's just the classical result. Since this is relativistic, I think we need to consider the relativistic equations of motion. Oh right, in relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic plus potential; it also includes rest mass energy.

The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx², right? And the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Wait, wait. Actually, in relativity, the total energy E is gamma mc². So the kinetic energy is E - mc² = (gamma - 1) mc².

The total mechanical energy of the oscillator in the relativistic case would be the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum displacement (x = A), the oscillator is momentarily at rest, so all energy is potential. So E = (1/2)kA². But wait, that's only if it's non-relativistic. If we're considering relativistic speeds, maybe the potential energy expression is different?

Wait, maybe I should think about the energy conservation in this scenario. At maximum amplitude (x = A), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. But in the relativistic case, the potential is still (1/2)kA²? Or does it change? Hmm, I'm not so sure. Alternatively, maybe the potential energy is still treated classically, but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

At the equilibrium position (x=0), the velocity is maximum, so all energy is kinetic. So E = (gamma - 1) mc². But wait, energy must be conserved, so E should be equal in both cases.

So, if at maximum displacement, the energy is E = (1/2)kA². At maximum speed, all energy is kinetic, so E = (gamma - 1) mc². So setting them equal:

(1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc².

Wait, but wait a minute. In the non-relativistic case, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max², which gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But in the relativistic case, that's not the case anymore.

But wait, I'm not sure if the potential energy is the same. Maybe in relativistic cases, the potential energy from the spring isn't (1/2)kx². Or perhaps the oscillator's equation of motion is different.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is better. Let me think about the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian. Hmm, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, consider the force equation.

In the relativistic case, the equation of motion for a harmonic oscillator would be different. The equation is F = d(p)/dt, where p is the relativistic momentum. So F = -kx = d(p)/dt.

Since p = gamma m v, and for a harmonic oscillator, x(t) is sinusoidal. So maybe we can express x as A sin(wt + phi), but with relativistic considerations. But this might get complicated.

Alternatively, since we're looking for maximum speed, perhaps we can consider when the oscillator is at the equilibrium point (x=0), where velocity is maximum. At that point, the potential energy is zero. So the total energy is all kinetic.

Wait, but earlier I thought E = (1/2)kA² equals (gamma -1) mc². So:

(1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) mc².

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, let me rearrange that:

gamma = 1 + [ (k A²) / (2 m c²) ].

Wait, but gamma equals 1/(sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) ). So:

1/(sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))) ) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So let me solve for v.

First, take reciprocal of both sides:

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 / [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ].

Square both sides:

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 / [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ].

So:

v²/c² = 1 - [ 1 / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) )^2 ].

Hmm, let me compute the denominator. Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a parameter for simplicity. Let's say a = (kA²)/(2 m c²). Then:

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2.

Wait, but let's compute 1 - [1/(1+a)^2 ].

Wait, 1/(1+a)^2 is [1/(1 + a)^2 ].

So, 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2 = [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ]/(1 + a)^2.

Which is [ (1 + 2a + a² ) - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2 = (2a + a² ) / (1 + a)^2.

Factor numerator: a(2 + a) / (1 + a)^2.

So,

v²/c² = a(2 + a)/(1 + a)^2.

But a is (k A²)/(2 m c²), so:

v² = c² [ a(2 + a) ] / (1 + a)^2.

Wait, but I'm trying to see which option matches this. Let's look at the options.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m) )^2 )

Wait, the denominator in the sqrt is 1 - (k A²)/(2m). Hmm, but in our expression, we have (kA²)/(2 m c²), so it's divided by c² as well. So Option A's denominator is (1 - (k A²)/(2m)) which is not scaled by c², so probably not.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2) )).

Hmm, that expression inside sqrt is 1 + 1/(1 - x), where x is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let me compute what that would be.

1 + 1/(1 - x) = [ (1 - x) + 1 ] / (1 - x) ) = (2 - x)/(1 - x).

So the sqrt becomes sqrt( (2 -x)/(1 -x) ), which doesn't match what we have for v². Because in our case, v² is [ a(2 + a) ] / (1 + a )^2, and a is x. So  a = x, so it's [x(2+x)]/(1 +x)^2.

Wait, let's substitute a = x into v²:

v²/c² = [x(2 +x)] / (1 +x)^2.

So v = c * sqrt( x(2 +x) ) / (1 +x).

But I'm not sure if any of the options directly match this.

Wait, let's look at option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ).

Wait, let me compute that expression inside the sqrt.

1 - 1/(1 + a)^2, where a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Which is ( (1 + a)^2 -1 ) / (1 + a)^2.

So numerator is (1 + 2a + a² -1 ) = 2a + a² = a(2 + a).

So sqrt( a(2 + a) / (1 + a)^2 ) ) = sqrt( a(2+a) ) / (1 + a).

Which is the same as v_max = c * sqrt( a(2 +a) ) / (1 +a ), which is exactly what I have for v.

But wait, in option D, it's sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 ), which is sqrt( (2a + a²)/(1 + a )^2 ), which is same as sqrt( a(2 +a)/(1+ a )^2 ). So that's correct.

Wait, but wait, in option D, the expression under the square root is 1 - 1/(1 + ... )^2. So yes, that's exactly what I found for v²/c². So option D would be v_max = c * sqrt( [ (2a + a^2) ] / (1+a)^2 ), which is the same as I have.

Wait, but let me re-express this:

Wait, in our earlier steps, we set (1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) mc^2.

But wait, that might not be correct because in the relativistic case, the potential energy for the spring might be different. Hmm, perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, let me think again. In the non-relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the kinetic is (1/2)mv². But in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc², and the potential is still (1/2)kx²? Or is there a relativistic correction to the potential?

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic is (gamma - 1) mc². So when the oscillator is at x = A, velocity is zero, so all energy is potential: E = (1/2)k A².

At equilibrium, x=0, velocity is maximum, so E = (gamma -1) mc².

But wait, that would imply that (1/2)k A² = (gamma -1) mc².

But in reality, in the relativistic case, the potential energy might not be (1/2)k x^2. Because Hooke's law is a force, but in relativity, the force law is F = -k x, but the potential would have to be derived from the line integral of F in the relativistic context, which might not be the same as (1/2)k x².

Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the virial theorem or consider the form of the equations.

Wait, maybe another approach is to consider the energy.

In a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. In the non-relativistic case, they are equal on average, but in the relativistic case, perhaps not.

Wait, but wait, for a simple harmonic oscillator, whether relativistic or not, the potential energy is (1/2)k x². Because the force is F = -kx, so the potential is the integral of F dx, which is -(1/2)k x² + C. So assuming x=0 is the equilibrium, the potential at x is (1/2)k x².

So, in the relativistic case, at maximum displacement, x = A, so the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic is zero. The total energy is (1/2)k A².

At the equilibrium point, x=0, velocity is maximum, so all energy is kinetic, which is (gamma -1) mc². So,

(1/2) k A² = (gamma -1) mc².

So, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c²) as a parameter, let's call it a.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + a.

Take reciprocal of both sides:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + a).

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + a)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + a)^2 ].

Which can be written as:

v²/c² = [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2.

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2a + a²) - 1 = 2a + a² = a(2 + a).

So,

v²/c² = [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a)^2.

Taking square root,

v = c * sqrt( [ a (2 + a) ] ) / (1 + a).

But a is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2). Let's substitute back:

v = c * sqrt( ( (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ( 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) )

Hmm, this looks a bit messy. Let me factor out 1/(2 m c^2):

a = (k A^2) / (2 m c^2).

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ a (2 + a) ] ) / (1 + a )

= c * sqrt( [ a (2 + a) ] ) / (1 + a )

= c * sqrt( a (2 + a) ) / (1 + a )

But perhaps we can write this more simply. Let me factor a from the numerator inside the square root:

= c * sqrt( a (2 +a ) ) / (1 + a )

= c * sqrt( a (2 + a) ) / (1 + a )

Hmm. Let me see if this matches any of the options.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Wait, let's compute the argument inside the square root of option D:

1 - 1/(1 + a )^2, where a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

= [ (1 + a )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a )^2

= (1 + 2a + a² - 1 ) / (1 + a )^2

= (2a + a² ) / (1 +a )^2.

So,

sqrt( [2a + a² ] / (1 +a )^2 )

= sqrt( a(2 + a) ) / (1 +a )

Which is exactly what we have for v/c.

So, v_max = c * sqrt( [2a + a² ] / (1 + a )^2 )

= c * sqrt( option D's expression )

So, option D is correct.

Wait, but let me check the other options again.

Option C: v_max= sqrt( (k A²)/m ). That's the non-relativistic result. But in our relativistic case, it's modified, so option C can't be right when a is not negligible compared to 1.

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2m ))^2 )

Hmm, but that denominator (1 - (k A²)/(2m )) doesn't have the c², which seems off dimensionally. Because (k A²)/(2m) has units of (force * length²)/(mass) ) = (mass * length/time²) * length² / mass ) = (length^3/(time²)) ) / mass? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, k has units of N/m = kg/s². So k A² has units (kg/s²)*(m²) = kg m²/s² = (force * m ) → which is energy. So (k A²)/(2m) is (energy)/(mass c²) → dimensionless? Wait, no, because (k A²) is energy, and m c² is energy. So (k A^2)/(2 m c²) is dimensionless. So in the option A, the denominator inside the square root is (1 - (k A^2)/(2m)), but (k A^2)/(2m) has units of (N m²)/(kg) ) → (kg m/s² * m² ) / kg ) → (m^3/s² ). Which is not dimensionless, so that would make option A have a unit mismatch. So option A is likely incorrect.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) )

Wait, the denominator is 1 - a, where a is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2). So 1/(1 -a ) would be a term if a is small, but in our problem, the term inside is 1 - [1/(1 + a )^2 ].

So option D seems the correct one.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator, we analyze the system using relativistic energy conservation. The oscillator obeys Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and the speed of light \( c \). The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of its kinetic and potential energies.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the oscillator is momentarily at rest, so all energy is potential:  
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]  
   At equilibrium \( x = 0 \), the velocity is maximum, and all energy is kinetic:  
   \[
   E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

   Equating the two expressions for \( E \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
   \]

2. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v \)**:  
   Solving for \( \gamma \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]

3. **Simplifying for \( v \)**:  
   Let \( a = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:  
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + a}.
   \]  
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + a)^2}.
   \]  
   Rearranging:  
   \[
   v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + a)^2}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( a = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):  
   \[
   v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches **Option D**. The other options are either dimensionally inconsistent, do not account for relativistic effects, or are incorrect forms of the expression.

### Conclusion:
The correct expression for the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is given by **Option D**.

Answer: D
