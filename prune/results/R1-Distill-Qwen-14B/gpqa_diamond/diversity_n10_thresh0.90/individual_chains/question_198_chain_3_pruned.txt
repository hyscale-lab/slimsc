Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species in the solution. The given data includes the concentrations of Co(II) and thiocyanate ions, as well as the stability constants for the complexes.

Alright, so first things first, I need to recall what stability constants are. Stability constant (β) indicates the tendency of a complex to form. A higher β means the complex is more stable and forms more readily.

The problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, but wait—that seems odd. β usually increases with the order of the complex. So for Co(SCN)n^m+, the higher n means higher stability if β increases. Let me check the order: β1 is 9, then β2 is 40, which is higher, β3 is 63, which is even higher, and β4 is 16. Hmm, that's lower than β3. That might be a typo, but I guess I have to go with what's given.

Wait, maybe the numbering is different. Oh, right, sometimes the stability constants can be for different complexes. Like, maybe β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)2, etc. So the question refers to the dithiocyanato complex, which I think would be Co(SCN)2^2+ or something like that? Or maybe it's Co(SCN)n with n=2. Let me think.

The problem asks for the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. I remember that for Co(II), different complexes have different colors. For example, [Co(SCN)]^+ is pink, [Co(SCN)2]^0 is blue, and [Co(SCN)3]^− is green or something. So the dithiocyanato complex here would be [Co(SCN)2]^0, which has a stability constant β2=40. Wait, but the options include more than that, so I need to consider all possible complexes and their contributions.

Wait, the problem says "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes." So each
