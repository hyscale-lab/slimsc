Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diatomic molecules and quantum models. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about a diatomic molecule, made of atoms X and Y. They're modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is sometimes called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state.

The given data includes the masses of X and Y, the bond length, and the angular frequency of vibration. The options are four different momenta values.

Wait, so the molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. The next state would probably involve a transition either in rotation, vibration, or both.

In the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. So the total energy is the sum of rotational energy and vibrational energy. But wait, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0), right?

When a photon is absorbed, it will cause a transition to a higher state. But the problem asks for the photon that switches the molecule to the next lowest possible state. So what's the next state after the fundamental?

The next state could be either a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). But wait, in the case of the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For the non-rigid rotor, I guess the bond length isn't fixed, but maybe in this problem, the bond length is given, so perhaps it's treated as a rigid rotor for the rotation part.

But the question mentions the molecular bond length, so maybe that's part of the calculation for the rotational constant.

Alternatively, perhaps the next state is a combination of both rotation and vibration, but for the lowest possible energy, the photon should match the energy difference between the two levels. But wait, the problem says 'the next state with the lowest possible energy', so perhaps it's the next allowed state, which might be the first excited vibrational state, or the first rotational state.

Wait, no. The fundamental state is the lowest possible state. The next state would have the next highest energy, which is probably a combination of both rotation and vibration, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the next state is either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state, whichever requires lower energy. But wait, in terms of energy levels: typically, the rotational levels are closer together than the vibrational levels. So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 might be smaller than the difference between v=0 and v=1.

Wait, the problem is about the photon's momentum. Since photon momentum p is related to its energy via E = pc (since for photons, E=pc when considering momentum in units where c is involved), but wait, photons have energy E = hν, and momentum p = E/c = hν/c.

Wait, no. Momentum p is hν/c. Because p = E/c for photons, since E=pc.

So, the photon's momentum is p = hν/c. But I need to find the energy difference between the initial state (fundamental) and the next state to determine the required photon energy, and then compute p from that.

But what is the next state? The next state after the fundamental could be either the next rotational state or the next vibrational state. So I need to compute which of these transitions requires less energy.

The initial state is the fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0. The next state would be the one with the next higher energy. Let's compute the energy differences.

First, compute the vibrational energy difference. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w. So the difference between v=0 and v=1 is ΔE_vib = h w.

Alternatively, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = (ħ²)/(2 I), and I is the moment of inertia. I is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

Wait, but for the transition from J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = B [1*(1+1) - 0] = 2 B.

So the energy difference for rotation is 2 B.

Now, I need to calculate both ΔE_vib (h w) and ΔE_rot (2 B), and see which is smaller. The photon with the corresponding energy would be the one that allows the smallest possible transition, making it the next state.

But wait, the question says the molecule is modeled by the rotation-vibration model, which implies that the energy levels are a combination of both. So the total energy is E_total = E_vib + E_rot. So the fundamental state is (v=0, J=0). The next possible state could be (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0). The problem is to find the photon that allows the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy—meaning the smallest energy increase.

So need to calculate the ΔE for each possible transition:

1. From (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1): ΔE_rot = 2 B
2. From (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=0): ΔE_vib = h w

Whichever is smaller, the photon's energy will correspond to that.

So compute both ΔE values and compare.

First, let's compute B.

B is the rotational constant, B = (h²)/(8 π² I c²) ??? Wait, wait. Let me think about the units. No, wait, the rotational energy is given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1 or similar units.

Wait, B is given by B = (h²)/(8 π² I k c), where I is the moment of inertia, k is Boltzmann's constant, and c is speed of light. Or perhaps I should just compute B using the formula B = ħ²/(2 I), but I think I might be mixing up different constants. Let me get the correct formula.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ²/(2 I)) J (J+1). So B is E_rot per J (J+1), so B = ħ²/(2 I), where I is the moment of inertia.

Moment of inertia I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

So let's compute μ first.

The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Wait, yes, because μ = (m1 m2)/(m1 + m2). So Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But I need to convert this into kg because we're dealing with SI units.

1 amu is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.017e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

1.818 * 1.6605 = let's compute:

1.8 * 1.6605 ≈ 2.989e-27, and 0.018 * 1.6605 ≈ 0.03e-27, so total ≈ 3.019e-27 kg.

Then I = μ r². The bond length r is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r = 2e-10 m.

So r squared is (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = μ r² = 3.019e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2076e-46 kg m².

Now, B is ħ²/(2 I).

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, which is h/(2π). So ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈
