--- Full Content ---
Alright, I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Okay, the question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. So I need to figure out which one fits the given data.

First, let's look at the data. The FTIR spectrum has a very broad peak around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. So that's probably from an alcohol, carboxylic acid, or maybe an ether, but a very broad peak is more typical of an -OH group in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, the broad peak at 3000 could also be from N-H, but the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not. So maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Then, two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which is a classic carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like a conjugated double bond or an amide. But since the options have O's, maybe it's another carbonyl group. Wait, but some functional groups have two carbonyls. Like maybe a ketone and an ester, or something else.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the structure must have at least one double bond. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring, but usually aromatic protons have different chemical shifts. Hmm, but vinyl protons are typically around 4.5-6 ppm maybe, but it depends on substitution.

The mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z 45. Let me think about what that could be. Common fragments at m/z 45 are like CH3O (which is 31, but maybe with more), or perhaps (CH3)2CO+? Or maybe more accurately, methyl acetate is C2H3O2+ which is 60. No, wait, 45 is 45. Let me think. The molecular ion or a fragment of 45 could be from something like CH3CO+ (which is 43, not 45). Alternatively, maybe something like CH2O2+? Wait, formaldehyde is 30. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like (CH2O) which is formaldehyde (30). No. Or perhaps a ketene ion? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's C3H7+ which is 45? Let's check: C3H7 has a molecular weight of (3*12)+(7*1)=36+7=43? No, wait. Wait, 3 carbons: 3*12=36, 7 hydrogens is 7, so 43. So 43, but the fragment is at 45. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3)2CO+? (Which is acetone). (CH3)2CO has a molecular weight of (2*12 + 6) + 12 + 16 (O) = 24 +6=30 +12+16=48? Wait, wait, acetone is (CH3)2CO. So 2*(CH3) is 2*(15)=30, CO is 28 (12+16). Wait, 30 + 28=58. So (CH3)2CO+ would have a molecular weight of 58. So that's not 45.

Alternatively, maybe a fragment from an ester. Suppose the compound is an ester, like R-O-CO-R'. When it breaks, maybe the ester group breaks into two parts. The fragment at 45 could be something like CH3CO-O- or similar. Wait, CH3COO- is 60 (12+2*1 +16 +16). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone fragment. Let me think about other possibilities.

Alternatively, fragments can be formed by losing certain groups. For instance, if the molecule loses a larger group, what's left could be a smaller fragment. Let me think about the possible formulas.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2

B) C6H10O

C) C6H10O2

D) C6H12O

So all are six carbons. Let's think about possible structures.

FTIR has a broad peak at 3000 cm-1: probably an -OH group.

Strong peaks at 1700 and 1650: two carbonyl groups? Or maybe one carbonyl and something else. Wait, 1650 could be an aromatic ring (C=C) stretch, but that's usually around 1600-1450. Alternatively, conjugated carbonyl, like a ketone conjugated with a double bond. Or maybe an ester and a ketone.

Wait, if the molecule has two carbonyl groups, that would fit with the two peaks. So perhaps it's an ester and a ketone? Or maybe a β-keto ester, or something like that.

Now, the NMR showing vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond. So maybe the molecule is something like an α,β-unsaturated ester or something similar. For example, maybe a bicyclic ester with a double bond.

But let's get back to the mass spec. The fragment at m/z 45. What if it's a methyl group attached to something. Wait, another approach: calculate the degree of unsaturation for each option.

Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since all options have O, but no X or N, it's (2C +2 - H - O)/2.

Let's compute each option:

A) C6H12O2: C=6, H=12, O=2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -2)/2 = (14-14)/2 = 0/2=0. Hmm, that can't be right because it has O, but O doesn't contribute to DoU. Wait, no, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for A: (12 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2= 2/2=1. So one DoU, which could be a ring or a double bond.

But wait, the options have varying numbers. Let me compute all:

Option A: C=6, H=12, O=2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14 -12)/2 = 1. So one degree (could be a ring or a double bond or a carbonyl group).

Option B: C6H10O. So H=10.

DoU = (12 + 2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=4/2=2. So two degrees. Maybe a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, or a ring and a carbonyl.

Option C: C6H10O2.

DoU = (12 +2 -10 -0)/2=(14-10)/2=2. Two degrees.

Option D: C6H12O.

DoU = (12 +2 -12 -0)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one degree.

But from the IR data, there are two carbonyl peaks, which suggests two carbonyl groups, so two DoU in that aspect. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Wait, each carbonyl group is a DoU. So if there are two carbonyls (like two ketone groups or a ketone and an ester), that would account for two DoU. But the DoU calculation also includes rings and double bonds. So let's think.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond (vinyl groups are double bonds). So that's another DoU. So if the structure has one double bond (1 DoU) and two carbonyls (2 DoU), that's 3 DoU in total. But wait, each carbonyl is a DoU. Let's see.

Wait, the DoU is the sum of rings and double bonds. Each ring or double bond is one DoU. Each triple bond is two. Each carbonyl is one (since it's a double bond).

So, for the molecule, the IR indicates two carbonyl groups (so two DoU from carbonyls), and the NMR shows a double bond (another DoU) for a total of three DoU.

So, the molecule must have a total of three DoU. Let me check each option's DoU.

Option A: DoU is 1. So that's not enough. Because 1 DoU can't account for three (two from carbonyls and one from double bond). So A is out.

Option B: DoU is 2. Also not enough. So B is out.

Option C: DoU is 2. Hmm, same problem. Wait, but maybe the two carbonyls are part of the same group, like an ester (which has one carbonyl) and another functional group? Or perhaps the structure has a ring and a double bond, plus a carbonyl. Let me think.

Wait, if a molecule has a ring (1 DoU), a double bond (1 DoU), and a carbonyl (1 DoU), that's three DoU. So the DoU would be 3.

But our options:

A has 1 DoU.

B has 2.

C has 2.

D has 1.

Wait, so maybe my initial approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps not all the DoU are present as separate features. Let me think again.

Wait, the IR has two carbonyl peaks. Let's think about what structures have two carbonyls. Maybe a cyclic ester (a lactone) which has a ketone and an ester? No, a lactone is an ester. Maybe a compound with an ester and a ketone group. For example, something like an α-keto ester. So, structure could be RCOR'COOR''. Wait, but that's more than six carbons. Maybe a simpler structure: for example, a cyclopentanone ester or something similar.

But wait, the molecular formula must be one of the options.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a β-keto ester. Such as:

O
||
RC-O-CO-CH2-

But depending on substitution. For example, methyl acetoacetate is CH3COCH2COOCH3. Let's see: that's C5H8O3, which is more carbons than our options. So maybe not.

Wait, maybe it's a substituted cyclic ester with a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is an enol ester, which has a conjugated double bond.

Alternatively, let's think about the mass spec. The m/z 45 fragment. Let me think about the molecular formula and possible structures.

For example, molecular weight of each option:

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight: (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16) = 72 +12 +32=116.

Option B: C6H10O. Molecular weight: 72 +10 +16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2. 72 +10 +32=114.

Option D: C6H12O: 72 +12 +16=100.

In mass spec, the fragment at 45 could be a breaking off of a smaller group. Let me think about the possible ways each structure could fragment.

Option C: C6H10O2. Let's say it's an ester. Esters often fragment by losing the R-O group. For example, in an ester R-O-CO-R', the fragment could lose the R'COO- group, leaving R-OH. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the ester breaks into the acid and the alcohol parts. For a smaller ester, like ethyl acetate (which is C4H8O2), fragments could be at 45? Wait, ethyl acetate has a molecular weight of 88. If it breaks, the acetate part (CH3COO-) is 60, and the ethyl (C2H5) is 29. Hmm, but 45 isn't part of that.

Wait, another thought: the 45 m/z could be the fragment of a ketene ion. A ketene is R-C=O, and has a molecular weight of R's weight plus 28 (since O is 16 and the double bond is part of the structure). Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from an acyloxy group.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a diester or a structure where a fragment of 45 comes from a methyl group attached to something. Wait, 45 is 45. Let me think about possible ions.

Another approach: the most intense fragment in the mass spectrum is often the molecular ion. But in this case, the peak given is a fragment, so perhaps it's a secondary ion.

Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CO+ (which is acetone) ? Let me see: (CH3)2CO is (2*15) + 28 = 30 +28=58. No, wait, (CH3)2CO is acetone, which is C3H6O. Its molecular weight is 58. So (CH3)2CO+ would be 58. So the fragment at 45 can't be that.

Wait, another approach: 45= C3H7O+. Let's see: C3H7O is 3*12 +7 +16=36+7+16=59. No, that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps a fragment with formula C3H5O2+? Let's compute: 3*12 +5 + 32=36 +5 +32=73. No, that's not 45.

Wait, maybe it's a CH2O+ group. CH2O has a molecular weight of 30 (12+2+16=30). Hmm, but 30 is much lower than 45. Alternatively, maybe a larger fragment.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from the loss of something. For example, if the molecule is an ester, like RCOOR', and it loses R' as a fragment. Then the remaining would be RCOO-. Let's see:

If RCOO- is 45, then R is (45 - 60?) Wait, wait, RCOO would have molecular weight = (R's weight) + 44 (since COO is 44). So if the RCOO- is 45, R's weight would be 1. That doesn't make sense, since R has to be at least one carbon.

Alternatively, maybe R-O- is a fragment. For example, if the molecule is an ester, R-O-CO-R', and it loses R-O as a fragment. Then R-O would have a molecular weight of 45. Let's assume R is CxHyOz.

Wait, if R-O is 45, then the formula would have CxHyOz+1 (since R-O is R with an O added). Hmm, maybe R is CH3CH2O-? Wait, that would be 45? CH2CH2O has molecular weight: 12*2 +6 +16=24 +6 +16=46. Close, but not 45.

Alternatively, R-O is CH3O-: 15 +16=31. Not 45.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is CH2O2+. Wait, CH2O2 has a formula of C H2 O2, which is formaldehyde dihydrate? I'm not sure. Let me compute its molecular weight:12 +2 +32=46. Close to 45, but not exactly.

Hmm, maybe I should think differently. Perhaps the molecular formula has a CH2CH2O group or something else.

Alternatively, let's think about the possible structures again.

Looking at the options, perhaps option C is C6H10O2. That formula could be, for example, an ester with a double bond. Such as methyl cyclopentene carboxylate or something. Alternatively, it could be a β-keto ester, which would have two carbonyl groups.

Wait, let's see: β-keto ester would have two carbonyl groups. For example, ethyl acetoacetate is C5H8O3, but that's more carbons than our options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like cyclohexene with an ester group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the IR has a broad peak at 3000, which is probably an -OH group. So the compound has an -OH, which would be present in an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the IR would have a broad peak around 2500-3300 cm-1, which is usually a strong, broad O-H stretch. So that fits. But the presence of a carbonyl peak around 1700 cm-1 would make sense for a carboxylic acid (around 1700). But then the other peak at 1650 could be an aromatic ring, but the compound may not be aromatic. Alternatively, it's a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, but if the compound is a diacid, that would have two carbonyls, but that's less likely because the options don't have O3. Wait, the options are C6H12O2, etc.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester and a carboxylic acid. But that would require more O's.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclic ester (lactone), which would have one carbonyl. But then where does the second carbonyl come in?

Hmm. Let me think again: the FTIR shows two strong carbonyl peaks. So the compound has two different carbonyl groups. For example, an ester (around 1700 cm-1) and a ketone (around 1700 and 1650? Or maybe a conjugated ketone which has a lower wavenumber, like around 1680 or so). Alternatively, maybe an amide, but I don't think the options include N.

Alternatively, maybe one of the carbonyls is an ester and the other is a conjugated carbonyl. For example, an α,β-unsaturated ester. Such as CH2=CHCOOR. In that case, the ester carbonyl would be around 1700, and the conjugated carbonyl (maybe a ketone) could be lower, around 1650.

Wait, but if it's an ester with a conjugated double bond, then the IR would show the ester carbonyl at ~1700 and the conjugated carbonyl at ~1650. That seems possible.

So, the structure could be something like an α,β-unsaturated ester. For example, cyclohexenyl acetate or something similar.

Now, getting back to the NMR: the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests that the molecule has a double bond. So that fits with an α,β-unsaturated ester.

So, if the structure is an α,β-unsaturated ester, that would have a conjugated double bond (vinyl Hs) and two carbonyl groups (the ester and perhaps a ketone? Or just the ester and the conjugated carbonyl).

Wait, in an α,β-unsaturated ester, there's a double bond adjacent to the ester group. So the structure would be RCO-O-R'-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, wait. More accurately, it would be RCO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond. Wait, maybe something like CH2=CHCO-O-R.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCO-O-R. That would have an ester group (1700 cm-1) and the conjugated double bond (maybe the carbonyl is at 1650 cm-1? Or the conjugated double bond's C=C is showing at 1650).

Alternatively, the 1650 could be the C=C in an α,β-unsaturated ester.

So, the IR has two strong peaks: 1700 (ester) and 1650 (C=C).

But wait, the 1650 is a strong peak, which might not be just the C=C. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like a ketone.

Wait, another possibility is that the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone), but that usually has only one carbonyl group. So that doesn't fit with the two IR peaks.

Wait, another thought: maybe the compound has an ester group and a second carbonyl group, like a ketone. So, for example, a structure like RCOOR' where R has a ketone group.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a β-keto ester, which has two carbonyl groups (the keto and the ester). For example, a structure like RCOCOOR'. Let's see: that would give two carbonyls. But for that, the structure would have more than six carbons unless R is small.

Wait, let's think about the molecular formula. Let's take option C: C6H10O2. So, 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, 2 oxygens.

A β-keto ester would have the structure RCO-COOR', with R and R' being alkyl groups. Let's see: if R is methyl (1C), R' is ethyl (2C), then total C is 1 + 2 + 2 (from the two COO groups?) Wait, no, the structure would be (CH3)CO-COO(CH2CH3). That would be 1 (from CH3) + 2 (from COOCH2CH3) + 2 (the two carbonyls) but wait, that's not right. Let me count: R is methyl (1 C), R' is ethyl (2 C). The structure is CH2(CO)COOCH2CH3. Wait, no. Let me get it right: the structure would be (CH3)CO-CO-O-R. Suppose R is ethyl (2 C). So the molecule would be:

O
||
CH3-C-O-CO-O-CH2CH3?

Wait, no, that's not right. The correct structure of a β-keto ester is RCOCH2COOR'. For example, ethyl acetoacetate is (CH3COCH2COOEt), which is C5H8O3. So that's 5 carbons. But our options are for six carbons.

So, perhaps R is methyl (1 C), R' is n-propyl (3 C). Then the structure would be CH3COCH2COOCH2CH2CH3. That's 1 (CH3) + 1 (CO) + 2 (CH2) + 3 (OCH2CH2CH3) = 7 carbons. That's more than six.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me think about the options again.

Option C is C6H10O2, which has a degree of unsaturation of 2. So that could be two rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a ring and a carbonyl group.

But according to the IR, there are two carbonyl groups, which would imply two DoU from carbonyls. Plus the double bond (vinyl Hs) implies another DoU, making three total. But option C only has a DoU of 2, which doesn't add up. So maybe my initial assessment is wrong.

Wait, wait. Wait, the DoU is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for option C, C=6, H=10, O=2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14 -10)/2=2. So two DoU. Two DoU can be two rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a ring and a carbonyl, or two carbonyls.

But in the IR, two carbonyls would require two DoU. So if the molecule has two carbonyls, that accounts for two DoU, and no other rings or double bonds. But the NMR shows vinyl Hs, implying a double bond, which would require another DoU, making three. But the options only have a DoU of two. So this seems conflicting.

Hmm, perhaps the IR peaks are not two carbonyl groups. Maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is something else. For example, the 1650 could be from a conjugated double bond (C=C) stretch. So the 1700 is the carbonyl, and the 1650 is the C=C.

That would make sense. So, the molecule has one carbonyl group (e.g., an ester) and a conjugated double bond.

In that case, the DoU would be 2: one from the carbonyl, one from the double bond. That would fit with option C's DoU of 2.

So, the structure would be an α,β-unsaturated ester, which has a conjugated double bond and an ester group. So, the FTIR would show a strong carbonyl at ~1700 cm-1 and the C=C at ~1650 cm-1.

The 1H NMR would show vinyl hydrogens, which fit with the double bond.

The mass spec fragment at 45 could be from a small piece of the molecule. Let's think about how such a molecule would break apart.

An α,β-unsaturated ester might lose part of the molecule, like the ester group or the double bond part. Let's take an example: methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Its molecular formula is C4H6O2. If it breaks, perhaps the fragment could lose the methyl ester group, leaving CH2=CHCOO- with a charge. The molecular weight of CH2=CHCOO- is (2*12)+(4*1)+(2*16) )= 24 +4 +32=60. But that's higher than 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is something like cyclohexene with an ester group. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. Let's see if it can be an α,β-unsaturated ester. The general formula for an α,β-unsaturated ester is RCH2CH2COOR', but that's not exactly correct. The structure is CH2=CHCOOR', which has the formula Cn+2 H2n O2. Wait, let me think: the structure is CH2=CHCOOR', where R' is an alkyl group. Let's say R' is ethyl (C2H5). So the formula becomes CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. That's C4H6O2. So molecular formula is C4H6O2. But our option is C6H10O2. So perhaps a larger R' group.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3 (n-butyl). That would be C4+4= C8H10O2. Wait, no, that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic α,β-unsaturated ester. For example, a five-membered ring. Let's see: the molecule could be an ester with a conjugated double bond in a ring. For example, cyclopentenecarboxylic acid methyl ester. But I'm not sure about the exact structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a diester with an internal double bond. But I'm not certain.

But let's get back to the mass spec. If the fragment is at 45, what possibilities are there?

Another approach: 45 is (m/z)=45. So the fragment is a charged species with mass 45. Let's think of possible functional groups.

Wait, 45 could be the mass of a CH2CH2O group. Wait, CH2CH2O has a molecular weight of 12*2 + 2*2 + 16=24+4+16=44. Close but not 45.

Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3)CO+. (CH3CO) is 43. Hmm, but that's 43, not 45. But the peak is at 45. Alternatively, maybe O=C-O-CH2CH2? No, wait.

Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment from the ester group. For example, the ester might lose the R-O- group, leaving the acid part. If the acid part is small, its molecular weight would be around 45.

Wait, for example, if the structure is CH2=CHCOO-R, and it loses R-O-, then the remaining would be CH2=CHCOO- with a charge. The molecular weight of CH2=CHCOO- is (3*12) + 6 + (16 *2) )= 36 +6 +32=74, which is higher than 45.

Hmm, not matching.

Another approach: perhaps the molecular formula is C6H10O2. Let's calculate possible combinations. 6 carbons, 10 H, 2 O.

The molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. The molecular weight is 6*12 +10*1 + 2*16=72+10+32=114.

If the molecular ion is at m/z 114, but the given fragment is 45, which is less than half of that.

Another possibility is that the fragment comes from breaking the molecule into two parts. For example, if the molecule is an ester, it could split into an acid and an alcohol. Let's say the acid part is 45. So, the acid would be CxHyOz with a molecular weight of 45.

For example, if the acid is CH3COOH (acetic acid), its molecular weight is 60. Not 45.

Alternatively, if the acid is formaldehyde (but that's too small). Wait, maybe the fragment comes from a ketone. For example, acetone is 58, but the fragment is 45.

Hmm, maybe it's a propionyl group. Propionyl is CH2CH2CO, which has a molecular weight of 58 (12*3 +6 +16=36+6+16=58). No.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is (CH3)COO- (molecular weight 60), but that's not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a CH2O2+ ion. CH2O2 has molecular weight 12+2 +32=46. Close to 45. Maybe it's a charged fragment where one proton is lost, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a CH3O+ group (31), but 31 isn't 45.

Wait, another thought: 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CH2O+. Let me compute: (3 CH3 groups?) No, wait, (CH2CH2O+) would be 12*2 + 2 +16=24+2+16=42. No.

Alternatively, another approach: 45 is 12*3 + 3 = 39. No, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a COOCH3 group. COOCH3 is (12 +16*2 +15)=12+32+15=59. No.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think again about the possible structures.

If the compound is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which has a conjugated double bond and an ester group, then the NMR would show vinyl Hs.

The IR would have a strong peak at ~1700 for the ester and a peak around 1650 for the C=C.

In that case, the DoU would be two: one from the ester (1 DoU, since C=O is a double bond) and one from the C=C (another DoU). So the total DoU is two, which matches option C's DoU of two.

So, the formula would be C6H10O2.

Now, considering the mass spec. Let's imagine the molecule is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, but that's more than six carbons.

Alternatively, the molecule could be a five-membered ring with an ester group and a double bond. For example, cyclopentene with a methyl ester.

So, the structure would be cyclopentenecarboxylic acid methyl ester. The formula would be C6H8O2.

Wait, but option C is C6H10O2.

Hmm, perhaps the ring is saturated, but that would require more hydrogens. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, let's think about the possible molecular formula and how it might fragment. The molecular formula is C6H10O2.

If the molecule is an ester, RCOOR', and upon fragmentation, it breaks into RCOO- and R'. If RCOO- has a molecular weight of 45, then R is a methyl group (CH3, which is 15), but CH3COO- is 60. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule loses a part that's 45.

Wait, the molecular ion is at m/z 114 (for option C). If it loses 69 (114-45=69), what would that be? 69 is the molecular weight of something like cyclohexane (84) minus something. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment at 45 is a different part of the molecule.

Wait, another approach: think of common fragment ions. For example, in esters, the acylium ion (RCO+) can form. The molecular weight would be (R's weight + 28). So, if RCO+ is 45, then R would be 45-28=17. But there's no group with a molecular weight of 17 except maybe CH3NH2, which isn't applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ketene ion (R-C=O). The molecular weight would be R's weight + 28.

Wait, if the ketene ion is 45, R would be 17. Again, not possible.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to sum up what I have so far.

The compound has:

- An -OH group (broad peak at 3000 cm-1).

- Two carbonyl groups (peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1).

Wait, no, earlier I thought that one is a carbonyl and the other is a C=C. But if it's two carbonyls, then that's two DoU.

But the NMR shows vinyl Hs, which is another DoU, making three. But the options don't have a formula with three DoU.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recompute the DoU for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2.

DoU = (2*6 + 2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1.

So one DoU: either a ring, a double bond, or a carbonyl.

Option B: C6H10O.

DoU = (14-10)/2=2.

Two DoU: two rings, a ring and a double bond, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2.

DoU = (14-10)/2=2.

Two DoU.

Option D: C6H12O.

DoU = (14-12)/2=1.

One DoU.

If the IR has two carbonyl groups, that's two DoU. Plus the vinyl Hs, which is another DoU, making three. But none of the options have three DoU. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, and the IR only has one carbonyl group.

Let me reevaluate the IR data.

The FTIR shows a very broad peak at 3000 cm-1 (probably -OH), and two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Could the 1650 peak be due to an aromatic ring (C=C) instead of a carbonyl?

If that's the case, then the two strong peaks would be one carbonyl (1700) and one aromatic ring (1650). Then the DoU would be:

- One from the carbonyl.

- One from the aromatic ring (which is a conjugated ring, so one DoU).

Plus the vinyl Hs (from the aromatic ring or a double bond) would be accounted for by the aromatic ring.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl Hs. Aromatic protons have different shifts than vinyl. So maybe the molecule has both a carbonyl and a double bond (vinyl group).

In that case, the IR would have peaks at 1700 (carbonyl) and 1650 (C=C). Thus, two DoU: one from each.

So, DoU is two.

Which options have two DoU? Options B and C.

So, the formula could be either B (C6H10O) or C (C6H10O2).

Now, considering the NMR shows vinyl Hs, which implies a double bond. So the structure has a double bond and a carbonyl.

The compound could be an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, ketone, ester, etc.

Now, looking at the mass spec: fragment at 45.

If the compound is an α,β-unsaturated ester, perhaps the fragment comes from the ester part.

Wait, for example, if the ester part is ethyl (C2H5O), but that's not 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a methyl group attached to an oxygen, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another approach: if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, which is option C, then the structure could be something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Let's compute the molecular weight: (2 C from CH2=CH) + (3 C from COO) + (3 C from CH2CH2CH3) = 8 C? No, wait, that's more than six. I'm getting confused.

Wait, another possibility: the structure is cyclohexene with an ester group attached. So, the ring has a double bond (cyclohexene), and an ester group (O-CO-O). So the formula would be C6H10O2. That makes sense, as cyclohexene (C6H10) with an ester group (adding O2). So the formula is C6H10O2, which is option C.

Now, the IR would show a strong peak at 1700 (ester carbonyl) and a peak at 1650 (C=C in cyclohexene). The NMR would show vinyl Hs from the double bond in the ring. The mass spec would have a fragment at 45. Hmm, but what fragment would that be?

Wait, the cyclohexene ring with an ester group. Let's imagine the structure is something like cyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxylic acid methyl ester. The formula would be C7H10O2, but that's more than six carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted cyclohexene with an ester substituent, but without adding more carbons. Wait, maybe the ester is part of the ring. Like a lactone, but that doesn't have an ester group in the ring with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diester, but that would require more oxygens.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck again. Let me think about the mass spec fragment again.

If the molecule is C6H10O2, and the fragment is 45, perhaps it's a cleavage product. For example, the ester group could break off as a fragment.

Assuming the structure is a methyl ester (COOCH3), the COOCH3 group has a molecular weight of 60 (COO is 44, CH3 is 15; 44+15=59? Wait, 12*(2) +16*2 +15=24+32+15=71? No, wait, COOCH3 is C2H3O2, molecular weight is (2*12)+(3*1)+(2*16)=24+3+32=59.

So, if the molecule is RCOOCH3, and the R part is C5H7O, then the molecular weight is (5*12)+(7*1)+(59)=60+7+59=126. But our option is 114. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is ethyl (COOCH2CH3), which has a molecular weight of 60+15=75? Wait, COOCH2CH3 is (44) + (30) =74. So if the molecule is RCOOCH2CH3, then R is C4H9O. But that's getting complicated.

Wait, maybe the fragment is from the ester group. For example, the ester group COOCH3 (59) is bigger than 45. So perhaps the fragment is from somewhere else.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is an α,β-unsaturated diester, but that doesn't fit the options.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to look for another approach.

Option C: C6H10O2.

Possible structures: an ester with a double bond.

If the structure is CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH3 (but that's more than six carbons).

Wait, perhaps the structure is cyclopentene with a methyl ester: O=C-OCH3 attached to cyclopentene.

The formula would be C6H8O2. But option C is C6H10O2. So perhaps it's a monoene, not a cyclo structure.

Alternatively, the structure is CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. That's 2 (from CH2=CH) + 2 (from CH2COO) + 2 (from CH2CH3) =6 carbons. So molecular formula is C6H10O2. That fits option C.

So, the structure is CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3.

IR would show a strong ester carbonyl at 1700, and the C=C at 1650.

NMR would have vinyl Hs from the CH2=CH group.

Mass spectrum: when this molecule breaks apart, perhaps it loses the ethyl ester group (CH2CH3), leaving behind the CH2=CHCH2COO- fragment. The molecular weight of CH2=CHCH2COO- is (4*12) + (8*1) + (2*16) )=48+8+32=88. So that's larger than 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule breaks into two parts, one being an acylium ion. For example, the CH2=CHCH2CO+ ion would have a molecular weight of (4*12) + (6*1) + 16) =48+6+16=70. Still not 45.

Hmm.

Another possibility: the molecule is methyl vinyl ketone, but that would have a structure like CH2=C(H)COOCH3. Wait, but methyl vinyl ketone is (CH2=CH)COOCH3? No, wait, methyl vinyl ket
