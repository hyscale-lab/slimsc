Okay, so I've got this physics problem on meson resonances, and I need to find the mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember that particles like mesons can decay, and their mean lifetime has something to do with their energy and width. Wait, the mean decay distance would depend on how long the particle lives on average and how fast it's moving.

Let me think about the steps involved. First, I think I need to find the lifetime of the meson. The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So for a particle, the width Γ is like the uncertainty in energy, and the lifetime τ is the uncertainty in time. So Γ * τ ≈ ħ. Therefore, τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but I need to make sure I have the right units here. The width Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is usually in units involving J·s. So I'll need to convert Γ to Joules or something compatible.

Alternatively, I remember that the relation is τ = ħ / Γ. So yes, I should compute that.

Once I have the lifetime τ, I can find the mean decay distance by finding out how far the particle travels in that time. For that, I need the velocity of the meson. The velocity can be found using the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The production energy E_X is given as 8 GeV, and the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV.

So the energy E is the total energy, which is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, the mass energy is m_X c², which is 1.2 GeV. So the kinetic energy would be E_X - m_X c². But wait, no, because E_X is 8 GeV. So the total energy is 8 GeV, and the rest mass is 1.2 GeV. So the kinetic energy is 8 - 1.2 = 6.8 GeV. But perhaps more importantly, the momentum p can be found using the energy relation.

In special relativity, E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So rearranging, p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2). So p = sqrt(E² - m² c^4) / c. Wait, let me plug in the numbers correctly.

E is 8 GeV. m c² is 1.2 GeV. So E² is (8)^2 = 64 (GeV)^2. m² c^4 is (1.2)^2 = 1.44 (GeV)^2. So E² - (m c²)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 (GeV)^2. So pc is sqrt(62.56) GeV. Let me calculate that: sqrt(62.56) is around 7.91 GeV. So p is 7.91 GeV/c.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it more accurately. 7.91 squared is 62.56? Let's check: 7.9 * 7.9 = 62.41. 7.91 squared is (7.9 + 0.01)^2 = 7.9^2 + 2*7.9*0.01 + 0.0001 = 62.41 + 0.158 + 0.0001 = 62.5681. Oh, so yes, 7.91 GeV.

So p = 7.91 GeV/c. Now, the velocity v can be found using the relativistic relation for momentum. p = gamma m v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Alternatively, I can find the velocity using the relation v = c * (p c) / E. Wait, that might be easier.

E is 8 GeV, p c is 7.91 GeV. So v = c * (p c) / E = c * (7.91)/8. Let me compute that ratio. 7.91 divided by 8 is 0.98875. So v = 0.98875 c. That's a very high speed, close to the speed of light.

So the velocity is approximately 0.98875 times the speed of light. Now, the mean decay distance L is the velocity v multiplied by the lifetime τ. So L = v * τ.

We have τ = ħ / Γ. So let's compute τ first. Γ is given as 320 MeV. I need to convert that to Joules to use with ħ in J·s units, or maybe use natural units where c=1 and so on. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to use units where ħ c is known.

Wait, I remember that ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm, where fm is 1e-15 meters. Let me confirm: 1 fm is 1e-15 m. So if ħ c is about 197.33 MeV·fm, then I can use that to convert units.

Wait, so Γ is 320 MeV. τ = ħ / Γ. But ħ in units of MeV·s can be found using ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm, so ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c. Hmm, but c in m/s is about 3e8 m/s. So:

ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

But wait, maybe I should think in terms of natural units where c=1. Let's see. Alternatively, maybe using the formula τ (in seconds) = ħ (in J·s) / Γ (in J).

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to compute τ. Let me see:

Gamma (Γ) is 320 MeV. I'll convert Γ to Joules. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 1 MeV is 1e6 eV, so 320 MeV is 320e6 * 1.602e-19 J.

Let me compute that:

320e6 = 3.2e8, so 3.2e8 * 1.602e-19 = approx 5.1264e-11 J.

Wait, 320e6 * 1.602e-19 = 320 * 1e6 * 1.602e-19 = 320 * 1.602e-13 = let me compute 320 * 1.602 = 512.64, so 512.64e-13 J = 5.1264e-11 J.

Now, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (5.1264e-11 J) = (1.0545718e-34) / (5.1264e-11) s.

Calculating that: 1.0545718e-34 / 5.1264e-11 = approx 2.057e-24 seconds.

Wait, that seems really small. Let me see: 1e-34 / 1e-11 is 1e-23. So 1.05e-34 /5e-11 is about 2.1e-24 s. Yes, that makes sense.

Now, the lifetime τ is 2.057e-24 seconds. Then, the velocity v is 0.98875 c. The speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. So v ≈ 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, the mean decay distance L is v * τ.

So L = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s = approximately 6.105e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, options A and C are around 5e-15 and 5e-16, and B and D are around 4e-15 and 4e-16. My calculation gives about 6e-16 m, which isn't exactly matching any of the options. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, maybe I should check the calculations again.

Wait, let me recompute Γ in J: 320 MeV is 320e6 eV, so 320e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 320 *1e6 * 1.602e-19 = 320 *1.602e-13 = 512.64e-13 J = 5.1264e-11 J. That seems right.

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So τ = ħ / Γ = 1.05457e-34 /5.1264e-11 = let's compute this division precisely.

1.05457e-34 /5.1264e-11 = (1.05457 / 5.1264) ) * 1e-34+11 = 0.2057 * 1e-23 = 2.057e-24 s. That's correct.

v is 0.98875 c. c is approximately 2.9979e8 m/s. So 0.98875 * 2.9979e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s. Correct.

So L = v * τ = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s. Let me compute that:

2.966e8 * 2.057e-24 = (2.966 * 2.057) * 1e8-24 = 6.104 * 1e-16 = 6.104e-16 m.

Hmm, so approximately 6.1e-16 m. But none of the options are close to that. Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in calculating the velocity.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using relativistic beta (β) as v/c. Because in relativistic terms, β = v/c, and γ = E/(m c²).

Wait, the energy E is 8 GeV, and m c² is 1.2 GeV, so γ = E/(m c²) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

Then, β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) = sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)) ) = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So that's correct, so v = 0.9887 c.

Wait, maybe I should use a more precise value for c. Let me see, perhaps it's more accurate to use c as 299,792,458 m/s, but for approximation, 3e8 is okay.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the momentum. Let me recalculate the momentum p. E is 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV.

E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 → (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2 = (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 (GeV)^2.

So pc = sqrt(62.56) GeV = 7.91 GeV. So p = 7.91 GeV/c.

Then, another approach: the velocity can be found using β = pc/(E) → β = (7.91 GeV/c) / (8 GeV) ) = 7.91 /8 ≈ 0.98875. So that's the same as before.

So the velocity is correct, 0.98875 c.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of τ. Let me recheck the calculation of τ.

Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 320e6 eV, so 320e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 320e6 * 1.602e-19 = 320 * 1.602e-13 = 512.64e-13 J = 5.1264e-11 J.

So τ is hbar (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (5.1264e-11 J) = (1.05457e-34) / (5.1264e-11) s.

Let me compute that as 1.05457 /5.1264 = approximately 0.2057 → 0.2057e-23 s → 2.057e-24 s.

So that's correct.

Then, L = v * τ = 2.9979e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s ≈ ?

Wait, 2.9979e8 * 2.057e-24 = let's compute 2.9979 * 2.057 = approximately 6.175e-16 m.

Wait, that's around 6.175e-16 meters. But the options are all around 4e-15, 5e-15, 4e-16, 5e-16.

So my calculation is about 6e-16, but the options are A)5.0223e-16, D)4.06e-16, B and C being higher.

Hmm, perhaps my approach is correct, but I made a miscalculation in units.

Wait, another approach: maybe using natural units where c=1 and ħ=197.33 MeV·fm.

Wait, τ (lifetime) is ħ / Γ. So, τ = ħ / Γ → in units where ħ is 197.33 MeV·fm and Γ is in MeV.

So τ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / (320 MeV) ) → 197.33 /320 fm = approx 0.6166 fm → 0.6166e-15 meters.

Wait, that's 6.166e-16 meters. That's about 6.16e-16 m, which is close to what I previously calculated with the other method. So this seems correct. But in the options, option A is 5.0223e-16 m and option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Wait, but that's 0.616 fm, which is 6.16e-16 m. That's about 6e-16 m. But none of the options match this exactly. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 197.33 /320 precisely.

197.33 /320 = approx 0.616659 fm. So 0.616659e-15 m = 6.16659e-16 m.

Wait, but the options don't have that. The closest is option A, which is 5.0e-16 m, but my result is about 6.16e-16 m. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the approach with natural units is more accurate because it avoids unit conversions. Let me double-check that.

In natural units where c=1 and ħ=197.33 MeV·fm, the lifetime τ = ħ / Γ = 197.33 MeV·fm / Γ (MeV). So 197.33 /320 = approx 0.616656 fm. So τ = 0.616656e-15 m.

Then, the velocity is β c. We found β to be ~0.98875. So the mean decay length is L = β c τ.

Wait, because tau is the proper lifetime, the lifetime in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. Wait, no, wait: the lifetime τ is the proper lifetime, so when the particle is moving, the lifetime observed in the lab frame is gamma times longer. So L = v * gamma tau.

Wait, that's a crucial point! I think I made a mistake earlier by not considering that the mean lifetime observed in the lab frame is longer than τ. Because the lifetime is a proper time, the lab frame would measure a longer time due to time dilation.

So, the decay length is L = v * gamma * tau.

Ah, that changes things. I think I forgot the gamma factor earlier. That explains why my previous calculation was off.

So, let me correct that. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c² ) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667.

So gamma is 6.6667.

Then, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau.

So L = v * gamma * tau.

Wait, but tau is 0.616656e-15 meters (since when c=1, time is measured in inverse energy, so perhaps that's where I get confused). Wait, no, in natural units, where c=1 and ħ=197.33 MeV·fm, the units for tau would be in fm (since MeV·fm / MeV = fm).

So tau is 0.616656 fm.

So the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau → gamma is 6.6667, so 6.6667 * 0.616656 fm ≈ 4.111 fm.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, wait, no, because in natural units, the lifetime tau is 0.616656 fm (since 1 fm is 1e-15 m), and the velocity v is beta c, which is beta in natural units (since c=1). So beta is 0.98875.

So the mean decay length L = beta * gamma * tau * c. But since c=1 in natural units, it's beta * gamma * tau.

Wait, but tau is in fm, which is 1e-15 m.

So L = beta * gamma * tau (fm) * 1e-15 m/fm.

Wait, L = 0.98875 * 6.6667 * 0.616656 fm.

Wait, 0.98875 *6.6667 ≈ 6.591.

6.591 * 0.616656 ≈ 4.066 fm.

So L ≈ 4.066e-15 m.

Wait, that's 4.066e-15 m, which is option B (4.0655e-15 m) or option D (4.0655e-16 m). Let me check the options.

Looking back, the options are:

A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m

B) 4.0655 *10^-15 m

C)5.0223 *10^-15 m

D)4.0655 * 10^-16 m.

So option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close to my result of 4.066e-15 m.

So that must be the correct answer. So the mistake earlier was not considering the time dilation effect, i.e., the gamma factor, which increases the mean decay length by a factor of gamma.

So the steps are:

1. Calculate tau (proper lifetime) using tau = ħ / Gamma.

2. Calculate gamma = E / (m c²).

3. The mean decay length L = beta * gamma * tau.

Now, let's compute it more precisely.

Compute tau first:

tau = ħ / Gamma → in natural units, ħ is 197.33 MeV·fm. Gamma is 320 MeV.

tau = 197.33 /320 → let me compute that precisely.

197.33 / 320 → 0.61665625 fm.

Now, gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6666667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.988734.

So beta is approximately 0.988734.

Now, L = beta * gamma * tau.

beta * gamma = 0.988734 *6.6666667 ≈ let's compute that.

0.988734 *6 = 5.9324, 0.988734 *0.6666667 ≈ 0.659156. So total is approximately 5.9324 + 0.659156 ≈ 6.591556.

Then, multiply by tau: 6.591556 * 0.61665625 fm.

6.591556 * 0.61665625 ≈ let's compute:

6 *0.61665625 =3.700 (approx)

0.591556 *0.61665625 ≈ about 0.364. So total approx 4.064.

So 4.064 fm, which is 4.064e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we proceed as follows:

### Key Information and Formulas
1. **Lifetime Calculation**:  
   The proper lifetime \( \tau \) of the particle is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}.
   \]  
   Using natural units where \( \hbar c = 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm} \), and \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} \), we calculate:  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm}}{320 \, \text{MeV}} = 0.616656 \, \text{fm} = 0.616656 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
   \]

2. **Relativistic Factors**:  
   The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} = \frac{8 \, \text{GeV}}{1.2 \, \text{GeV}} = 6.6667.
   \]  
   The velocity \( \beta \) is calculated using the relativistic relation:  
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{(m c^2)^2}{E^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{(1.2)^2}{8^2}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.988734.
   \]

3. **Mean Decay Distance**:  
   The mean decay distance \( L \) is given by:  
   \[
   L = \beta \gamma \tau.
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   L = 0.988734 \times 6.6667 \times 0.616656 \, \text{fm}.
   \]  
   First, calculate \( \beta \gamma \):  
   \[
   \beta \gamma = 0.988734 \times 6.6667 \approx 6.591556.
   \]  
   Then, calculate \( L \):  
   \[
   L = 6.591556 \times 0.616656 \, \text{fm} \approx 4.064 \, \text{fm} = 4.064 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
   \]

### Final Answer
The calculated mean decay distance \( L \) is approximately \( 4.064 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which matches closely with option **B** (\( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)).

Answer: B
