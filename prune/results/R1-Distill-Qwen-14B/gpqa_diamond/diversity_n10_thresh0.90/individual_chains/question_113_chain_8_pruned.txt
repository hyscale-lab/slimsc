Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question lists the characterization techniques used: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Each of these gives certain clues, so I'll go through each one to gather information.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, another thing is that if it's a very broad peak, maybe it's from an -OH group, perhaps in an alcohol or maybe a carbonyl with an adjacent O-H. Wait, no, more likely an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. Oh, but carboxylic acids have a broad and strong O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm^-1, sometimes even broader. But if the peak is very broad, that could fit.

Then, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, 1700 is a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower than a regular carbonyl. Wait, but 1650 could be an conjugated carbonyl group or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents. Alternatively, maybe an amide or something else? Or perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl like an ester or a ketone with some conjugation. Wait, but wait, another possibility: if there's a conjugated carbonyl, like in an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. That would lower the carbonyl's stretching frequency. So 1700 could be a ketone or ester, and 1650 another carbonyl, maybe like an ester or something else. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is not a carbonyl. Wait, maybe it's a C=C stretch. Because the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond.

Wait, the C=C stretching in alkenes is usually around 1640-1680 cm^-1, so 1650 would fit that. So perhaps the 1700 is a carbonyl (like ester or ketone) and 1650 is a C=C. So that suggests the compound has both a carbonyl group and a double bond.

Moving on to the 1H NMR data. It says there are several peaks, including some for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, typically showing up around 4.5-7 ppm, depending on substitution. So that tells us there's at least one double bond in the molecule, perhaps an alkene group.

The Mass Spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let me think: what fragments give m/z 45? Maybe CH3CO+ (since 45 is 12*2 +1*3 +16=45?), but wait, CH3CO would be 45. So that could suggest an acetyl group. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like C3H7O+? Or another possibility: the fragment could be a ketene ion (like (CH3)2CO+ would lose something), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the molecular ion might break into smaller ions. Another thought: the molecular formula options are all C6H10 or C6H12 with O or O2. So the molecular weight of each option would be:

C6H12O2: (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16) =72+12+32=116
C6H10O: 72 +10 +16=98
C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32=114
C6H12O: 72 +12 +16=100

So the molecular ion would be around 100-116. The fragment at 45 is about half of that, which makes sense for a fragment like a CH3CO+ (45), which would come from an ester, maybe.

Putting this together, let's think about the possible structures.

The FTIR has a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1, which suggests an O-H group, perhaps an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, the other peaks are 1700 and 1650. So if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad, but another carbonyl (the carboxylic acid's C=O) would be around 1700. But then why is there another peak at 1650? That might not fit, unless it's another group. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. Because esters have a carbonyl around 1700-1750, and if there's another carbonyl group, like a ketone, that could be lower. Or perhaps the ester has some conjugation, lowering the carbonyl.

Wait, but if the compound has both a carbonyl and a double bond, maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. That structure would have a conjugated double bond and an ester group. Let's think about the formula.

If I have an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, the structure would be something like CH2=CH-CO-O-R. But let's think about the molecular formulas.

Looking at the options:

Option A is C6H12O2. That would fit an ester, perhaps with some rings or substituents. For example, an ester with a cyclic structure.

Option C is C6H10O2. That would be similar, but with two double bonds maybe? Because esters have one double bond (from the carbonyl), and if there's another double bond, that would account for the vinyl protons in the NMR.

So let's consider each option:

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X and N are zero. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring or a double bond. But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond. So that would account for one degree, leaving another possible ring or double bond. Alternatively, maybe the ester has a ring.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation: (12+2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees, which could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a triple bond (unlikely here).

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees: (12*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)=4/2=2. So two degrees. Which could be two double bonds, or a double bond and a ring.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees: (14-12)/2=1. So one degree, perhaps a ring or a double bond.

But from the IR, we have a carbonyl (so that's one degree, a double bond) and a C=C from the 1650 cm^-1, so that's another degree. So total two degrees, which would require the molecular formula to have two degrees of unsaturation, so the formula must have 2 DoU.

Looking at the options:

Option A: DoU=1 → no, because we have two (C=O and C=C).

Option B: DoU=2 → possible.

Option C: DoU=2 → possible.

Option D: DoU=1 → no.

So from the IR and NMR, the compound has two degrees of unsaturation, so options B and C are possibilities. But wait, let's check the molecular formulas.

The molecular formula for option B is C6H10O. That would imply perhaps a cyclic ether with a double bond or something else, but how does that fit with the functional groups seen?

Alternatively, perhaps the IR's 1700 is a ketone. But if the formula is C6H10O, a ketone and a double bond would account for two DoU. So that might fit, but what about the other data.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. The IR shows O-H (broad) and two carbonyls? Wait, no, wait: the FTIR has a broad peak at ~3000 (O-H), and two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. If the compound is a diester, perhaps? For example, an ester with a conjugated double bond.

Wait, but I might be getting confused. Let me think again. The IR has a broad peak (O-H), two carbonyl peaks, and a C=C. Wait, no, the 1650 is a C=C. So perhaps the compound has both an O-H and two carbonyl groups? Or perhaps one carbonyl and a C=C.

Wait, but how can it have two carbonyl peaks? Unless it's a conjugated system. Or perhaps one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic ring. No, aromatic C=C would be lower, around 1450-1600. So 1650 is more like an isolated double bond.

Wait, maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl, and 1650 is a conjugated C=C.

So the compound has a carbonyl group (like ester, ketone, acid, etc.), a C=C, and an O-H group.

Wait, but if there's an O-H, another carbonyl, and a C=C, that adds up to three groups. Let's think about possible structures.

One possibility is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, but that would have an O-H if it's a hydroxy ester, but lactones are cyclic esters without an O-H. Hmm, maybe not.

Another option: an aromatic ring with substituents, but the 1650 peak is more likely an alkene.

Wait, maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So that would have a structure like CH2=CHCOOR, but arranged in a way that the double bond is conjugated with the ester carbonyl. That structure would have a double bond (C=C), a carbonyl (ester), and perhaps an O-H group elsewhere.

But wait, if the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with an alcohol group, like a hydroxyl group attached, then we could have:

Structure: something like CH2=CH-CO-O-R-OH? Hmm, not sure. Maybe it's a diol ester or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a beta-keto ester, but that wouldn't explain the O-H.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is from a phenolic group. But then the IR would have a broad peak, but the NMR would show aromatic protons, which the question doesn't mention. The NMR only mentions vinyl hydrogens, so maybe it's a diene or a simple alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is part of a hemiacetal or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the mass spec has a peak at 45, which is CH3CO+ (45). If the compound is an ester, then perhaps the ester group is present, leading to a fragment that includes the acetyl group.

So, the presence of a fragment at m/z 45 suggests an acetyl group is part of the molecule. So that would point towards an ester, since esters can fragment to form acetyl ions.

So if the compound is an ester and has a conjugated double bond, that would fit with the IR data.

So let's think about the possible formulas. The options with two degrees of unsaturation (B and C) could fit.

Option B: C6H10O. If it's an ester, the formula would be R-O-CO-R'. For example, if R is CH2CH2 and R' is CH2CH2, but that would give a molecular formula of C4H8O2, which isn't the case. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester with a ring. Wait, but let's calculate the ester formula.

An ester has the formula RCOOR', so general formula is (R is (n) carbons, R' is (m) carbons) → C(n+2)H(2n+3)O2. Wait, no, the ester is RCOOR', so R is (n) carbons (like CH3CH2...), so RCOOR' would have (n+2) carbons. Wait, let me think again.

Actually, the general formula for an ester RCOOR' is: number of carbons is (n) from RCOO and (m) from R', so total n + m + 1 (since RCOO is from RCOO-). Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about options.

Option C is C6H10O2. So if it's an ester, the formula would be something like RCOOR', which requires RCOO- (n carbons) and R' (m carbons). So total n+ m + (from RCOO is 2 carbons if R is CH3, but wait, RCOO is (n+1) carbons where R is n carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, considering that the molecular weight of the compound is 114 (option C: C6H10O2). So maybe it's an ester with a double bond and an O-H group.

Wait, but if it's an ester, the structure would have O-CO-O, but if there's an O-H, perhaps it's a hemiacetal or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal diol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the structure is a cyclic ester, a lactone. But then there's no O-H unless it's a diol ester. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an aromatic ester, but again, the NMR doesn't indicate aromatic protons, only vinyl.

Wait, another approach: the presence of an ester group would give a carbonyl peak around ~1700 cm^-1. The 1650 peak could be the C=C in the ester. So perhaps the ester is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, like CH2=CHCOOR. In that structure, the double bond is conjugated with the carbonyl, which would lower the carbonyl's stretch to about 1700 (if it's an ester), and the C=C would be around 1650.

So that fits the IR data. Then, the O-H in the FTIR suggests that there's another hydroxyl group in the molecule, perhaps a secondary or primary alcohol.

So the structure could be something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH. Let's check the formula.

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH would be:

CH2=CHCOO is 3 carbons (if CH2=CHCOO- is the acid part), then the alcohol is CH2CH2OH (but I think I made a mistake here). Let me count:

CH2=CH-CO-O-CH2CH2OH. So the ester is CH2=CHCOO- linked to CH2CH2OH.

Wait, but that would make the ester group as CH2=CHCOO- and the alcohol as CH2CH2OH. But that would be a diol ester, perhaps? Wait, no, that's not an ester. An ester is RCOOR'. So in this case, R is CH2=CHCO and R' is OCH2CH2OH. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. The ester group is R-O-CO-R'. So if R is CH2CH2OH and R' is CH2=CHCO, that would make it CH2CH2O-CO-CH2=CHCO. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like HOCH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that doesn't include a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an alpha,beta-uns
