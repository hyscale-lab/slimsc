--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem about Michael addition reactions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each being a Michael addition reaction. I need to figure out the reactants and major products for each and then match them with the options given.

Let's start with part A. The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). 

I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diester, so it's a strong base and can deprotonate to form an enolate. The enolate will attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

The alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl here is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3, but wait, no, wait— the formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So methyl would be CH2=CHCOOCH3. But wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would mean the substituent is on the third carbon? Wait, no. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think the structure is CH2=C(-something)-COOCH3. For methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the double bond is between C2 and C3? No, wait, acrylate is CH₂=CH–COO–. So the structure is CH₂=CH–COOCH3, but with a substituent on the 3rd carbon, which would be the CH2 group? Or is the substituent on the acrylate part?

Wait, maybe the structure is CH₂=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Because 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon from the ester. But wait, the carbonyl is at the end, so maybe the substituent is on the double bond's other carbon.

Wait, the correct structure of (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate methyl ester would be CH₂=CH–COOCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the double bond. Hmm, no, perhaps I should draw it.

Let me structure it step by step. The acrylate group is CH₂=CH–COO–. The substituent is on the third carbon, which would be the CH₂ group? Wait, no. Wait, the acrylate is CH₂=CH-CO-OCH3. So the substituent is on the CH₂ part? Or on the CH part.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH₂=CH–COOCH3, with the p-tolyl group attached to the middle carbon. So that would make it CH₂=C(p-tolyl)–COOCH3. But the configuration is E, so the substituents should be on opposite sides.

So when the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks, where does it attack? The enolate is a strong base, so it abstracts a proton alpha to the carbonyl in the other compound. Wait, no, in the Michael reaction, the enolate acts as a nucleophile, attacking the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

So the enolate will attack the less substituted side? Or the more substituted side? Wait, the Michael donor is the enolate, which attacks the Michael acceptor, the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

So the Michael acceptor here is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So when the enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks, it will add to the beta carbon of the acrylate. So where is the beta carbon? The acrylate is CH₂=C(p-tolyl)–COOCH3. The carbonyl is at the end, so the beta position is the CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl. Wait, no. The carbonyl is the COOCH3, so the double bond is between C1 and C2, with C1 being CH₂, C2 being C(p-tolyl), and C3 being the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH₂=CH–COOCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the CH₂. That would make it CH₂(p-tolyl)=CH–COOCH3. But that doesn't seem right. Or maybe the substituent is on the other end.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH₂=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. So the carbonyl is at the end, and the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, with the p-tolyl on carbon 2.

So in that case, the Michael acceptor is CH₂=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. The enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta carbon (the CH₂ group) of the acrylate.

Wait, no. The alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is CH₂=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. So the carbonyl is at the end, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH₂=CH–COOCH3, but the middle CH has a p-tolyl group. Or wait, maybe it's CH₂=C(p-tolyl)–COOCH3? That would mean the double bond is between C1 and C2, with C2 having the p-tolyl group and the COOCH3 on C3.

So the attack would be on the beta position, which is C2 (since the carbonyl is C3). Wait, no, the carbonyl is C3, so the alpha is C2, the beta is C1. Wait, no. Let me think: the carbonyl is at the end, so the alpha is the adjacent carbon (C2), and the beta is the other carbon (C1) of the double bond.

So the enolate attacks the beta position (C1), which is the CH₂ group. So the addition would happen at C1.

When the enolate attacks, it forms a new bond between the enolate's carbon and the beta carbon. So the product will have the two parts connected.

So the enolate from dimethyl malonate is the conjugate base. Dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH2. When deprotonated, the enolate is CH2C(OOCH3)–O–. Wait, no. Dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOCH3)2. Deprotonation occurs at one of the alpha positions, so the enolate would be CH2–C(COOCH3)2–O-.

When this enolate attacks the acrylate, it adds to the beta carbon (CH2) of the acrylate. So the acrylate has the structure CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Wait, perhaps it's better drawn as CBr2=CH–COOCH3 where Br is p-tolyl.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to think about the product structure. The Michael addition would add the enolate to the acrylate. So the product would have the two carbonyl groups from the malonate and the substituent from the acrylate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH2. When it loses a proton (from one of the CH2's alpha protons), the enolate would be CH2–C(COOCH3)2–O-. This enolate will attack the beta position (CH2) of the acrylate.

But wait, the acrylate is CH₂=CH–COOCH3. Hmm, no, wait. Maybe the acrylate is CH₂=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. So when the enolate attacks the beta (CH₂) of the acrylate, the product would have the two CH2 groups connected.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product structure. The Michael addition would connect the enolate's carbon to the beta carbon of the acceptor. So the product would be a new compound where the two carbonyl groups (from the malonate) are attached.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a conjugate addition. So, the product would have the carbonyl groups from the malonate and the substituent from the acrylate.

Wait, perhaps the product is a triester. Because dimethyl malonate has two methyl esters. So when the enolate attacks, it would form a new carbon-carbon bond, and the product would have three ester groups.

Wait, for example, when CH2(COOCH3)2–O– attacks the CH2 of CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3, the product would be CH2–C(COOCH3)2–CH2–C(p-tolyl)–COOCH3? No, perhaps the structure is more like:

The enolate attacks the acrylate, adding a new group. So the acrylate becomes connected to the malonate's carbons.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the product structure. The product would be a trimethyl something. Because the options for part A are all trimethyl... So option A has trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.

Wait, so the product would be a tricarboxylate. So perhaps the enolate from the malonate adds to the acrylate, creating a new carbon chain with three ester groups.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOCH3)2. The enolate is CH2–(COOCH3)2–O–. When it attacks the acrylate, which is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3, the attack would be at the CH2 group.

So the product would be CH2–(COOCH3)2–CH2–C(p-tolyl)–COOCH3. But that doesn't make sense because the connectivity would be CH2–C(COOCH3)2–CH2–C(p-tolyl)–COOCH3. But that's a 4-carbon chain? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a propanetricarboxylate. Because the enolate adds to the acrylate, making a longer chain. So the structure would be something like:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C-(p-tolyl)
   || 
   O-C-OCH3
   |
   CH2-COOCH3

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the product after the Michael addition would have three ester groups. So the formula would be O=C-OCH3 at three positions.

Wait, the product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Structure is:

COOCH3
|
O=C-OCH3
|
CH2–C(p-tolyl)–CH2–C(OOCH3)2

Hmm, no, wait. Let me think again. The dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH2. When it acts as a donor, the enolate attacks the acrylate at the beta position, which is the CH2 group next to the double bond.

So the product would be (CH3COO)2CH2–CH2–C(p-tolyl)–COOCH3. Wait, but that would be a four-carbon chain. Wait, no, perhaps when the enolate attacks, it adds to the acrylate, so the two compounds combine.

Wait, the enolate has a negative charge on the oxygen, attacking the acrylate's CH2 group. So the product would have a structure where the two compounds are connected.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a trimethyl ester where the central carbon has two ester groups, and another ester from the acrylate.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the product structure from the options. Option A for part A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
C(CH2C6H4-para)–CH2–C(O)OCH3
|
O-C-OCH3

Wait, that structure doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a propane with two ester groups on one end and another on the other.

Wait, propane has three carbons. So positions 1, 1, and 3 would have ester groups. So:

Carbon 1: two esters (O-CO-OCH3)
Carbon 3: one ester (O-CO-OCH3)
And in between, a p-tolyl group on carbon 2.

Hmm, so the structure would be:

(CH2(COOCH3)2)–CH(p-tolyl)–CH2(COOCH3)

Wait, but that's four carbons. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the product is:

The enolate (from malonate) adds to the acrylate, leading to a longer chain. So the product would be CH2(COOCH3)2–CH2–C(p-tolyl)–COOCH3. But that would make a four-carbon chain, with three ester groups on the first and fourth carbons.

Wait, but the product might be a tricarboxylate. So probably, the product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. So that would have three ester groups on a three-carbon chain. So:

Carbon 1: two esters
Carbon 2: p-tolyl group
Carbon 3: one ester

So structure: O=C-OCH3 at C1 (two times), C2 has p-tolyl, and C3 has O=C-OCH3. So it's:

O=C-OCH3
|
O=C-OCH3–C–CH2–C(p-tolyl)–CH2–C(O)OCH3?

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should move on and come back.

Next, part B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> B.

So the reactants are 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile. Conditions are MeOH and H3O+.

Wait, this seems like a Michael addition as well. The piperidine has a cyclohexenyl group attached to it. The (E)-but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCN, but with E configuration, so the substituents (CH3 and CN?) Hmm, but but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2CN, but I think it's CH2=CHCN, but E geometry would have the higher priority groups on opposite sides. Wait, but but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2CN? No, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN? Wait, no. Wait, I think but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CH–CH2–CN? No, wait, the structure of but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCN, but wait, that would be propenenitrile. Wait, perhaps I should get the structure right.

Butenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN. But wait, but-2-enenitrile would have the nitrile group on C4? No, wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CH–CH2–CN. Wait, that's five atoms. No, but but-2-enenitrile would have four carbons, so it's CH2=CH–CH2–CN, but that's but-3-enenitrile. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CH–CH2–CN? No, because butenitrile would be four carbons in total. So but-2-enenitrile is CH2–CH2–CH2–CN with a double bond between C2 and C3? Wait, no. Alternatively, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CH–CH2–CN. Wait, but that would be four carbons: positions 1,2,3,4. So the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the nitrile is at C4. So structure is CH2=CH–CH2–CN.

Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH–CH2–CN, which is but-2-enenitrile. So the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the nitrile is on C4.

Wait, the (E) configuration would have the higher priority groups (CH2 and CN) on opposite sides. So the substituents on either end of the double bond would be CH2 (from C2) and CN (from C4), but I'm not sure.

In any case, the Michael addition would involve the piperidine's enolate attacking the alpha-beta unsaturated nitrile.

Wait, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine has a cyclohexene ring attached to a piperidine. The cyclohexene is at position 1, so the piperidine is connected to the cyclohexene at the same position where the double bond starts.

So the structure is cyclohexene (with double bond between C1 and C2) attached to piperidine. The piperidine is a six-membered ring with one nitrogen. So the enolate would form in the piperidine ring, perhaps at the alpha position to the cyclohexene.

Wait, but wait, the cyclohexene is conjugated with the piperidine. So the piperidine is connected to the cyclohexene, which is an alpha-beta unsaturated system. So the enolate would form in the piperidine, which is the nucleophile. Or perhaps the other way around.

Wait, in Michael addition, the enolate (nucleophile) attacks the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (or similar) compound. But here, the piperidine is the donor, providing the enolate. So 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine would form an enolate, which would attack the (E)-but-2-enenitrile.

Wait, but but-2-enenitrile is an alpha-beta unsaturated nitrile. So the reaction is a Michael addition where the piperidine's enolate attacks the nitrile's beta position.

So the product would be a new carbon-carbon bond between the enolate (from piperidine) and the beta carbon of the nitrile.

So the product structure would have the nitrile group connected to the piperidine via a new carbon chain.

Wait, but the conditions are MeOH and H3O+. So after the addition, perhaps there's an acid workup, but I'm not sure.

Looking at the options, for part B, the options are either 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile or 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile.

Wait, but the product after the Michael addition would have the nitrile group attached to a new carbon that's connected to the piperidine.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic compound where the nitrile is attached to the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, perhaps the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, which would mean a four-carbon chain with a nitrile at the end, and a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 2.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to a six-membered ring with the nitrile group attached.

Wait, perhaps the product is a butanenitrile with a substituent from the cyclohexene.

But I'm a bit stuck. Let's think about the piperidine and the added group.

The piperidine has a cyclohexene ring. When the enolate attacks the nitrile, the new bond forms between the enolate's carbon and the nitrile's beta position. So the product would have a new carbon chain connecting the piperidine to the nitrile.

Wait, but the product structure given in option B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. So that's a butanenitrile (four carbons) with a cyclohexyl group on the third carbon, where the cyclohexyl has a ketone at position 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ring expansion or contraction.

Wait, perhaps the cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane with a ketone when the addition occurs. So the enolate in the piperidine attacks the nitrile, leading to a new ring structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic compound. But I'm not sure.

Moving on to part C. The reactants are C and but-3-en-2-one, with KOH and H2O. The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, but the question for part C is: what is C? The product is given as 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So the reaction is a Michael addition where the enolate of C attacks the alpha-beta unsaturated ketone (but-3-en-2-one). So but-3-en-2-one is CH2=C(O)CH2CO.

Wait, but but-3-en-2-one is (CH3)C=CH–CO? No, wait, but-3-en-2-one would be CH2=C(O)CH2CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-one is:

O
||
CH2–C–CH2–CH3

Wait, but with the double bond between C3 and C4. No, wait, numbering from the carbonyl group. But-3-en-2-one: carbonyl at C2, double bond between C3 and C4. So structure is CH2–CO–CH2–CH2.

Wait, maybe it's CH2–CO–CH2–CH2, but that's not possible. Let me think again. The correct structure for but-3-en-2-one is:

O
||
CH2–C–CH2–CH3
   |
   CH2

Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-2-one is (CH2)2-CO. Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as CH2=CH–CO–CH3. No, that would be but-2-en-2-one.

Wait, but-3-en-2-one: the carbonyl is at position 2, and the double bond is between positions 3 and 4. So the structure is CH2–CO–CH2–CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, that would be impossible because but-3-en-2-one is CH2–CO–CH2–CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4, which would be CH2–CO–CH2–CH2 as CH2–CO–CH=CH2. Wait, no, that's but-3-ene, but the carbonyl is at position 2.

So but-3-en-2-one is CH2=C(O)CH2CH3. Wait, no, that's but-2-en-2-one. I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to think of it as (Z)- or (E)-but-3-en-2-one. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2–CO–CH2–CH2, but I'm not getting it right.

In any case, the reaction is a Michael addition where the enolate of compound C attacks the alpha-beta unsaturated ketone (but-3-en-2-one). The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So the product has a cyclohexane ring with two ketone groups at positions 1 and 3, and a substituent at position 2 which is a 3-oxobutyl group.

So the substituent is a four-carbon chain (butyl) with a ketone at position 3. So the structure is CH2–CH2–CO–CH2– attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, but how does that form from the Michael addition? The enolate from C attacks the alpha-beta unsaturated ketone (but-3-en-2-one). So the product would have the enolate's carbon connected to the alpha carbon of the ketone.

Wait, the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. That suggests that the cyclohexane has two ketones (1,3-dione) and a substituent at position 2 which is a butyl group with a ketone at position 3.

So the substituent is -(CH2)3-CO- ?

Hmm.

In the Michael addition, the enolate (from C) would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated ketone. So the ketone would be at the end, and the enolate adds to the middle carbon.

So if the ketone is but-3-en-2-one, the structure is CH2–CO–CH2–CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4 (but that's impossible, so perhaps it's CH2–CO–CH2–CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3). No, I'm getting stuck on the structure.

Alternatively, but-3-en-2-one is CH2–CO–CH2–CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2–CO–CH2–CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. Hmm, but that would make it CH2–CO–CH2–CH2–CH2? No, wait, but it's but-3-en-2-one, which is four carbons in total. So the structure is CH₂–CO–CH₂–CH₂, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So it's CH₂–CO–CH₂–CH₂ with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. So it's CH₂–CO–CH₂–CH₂. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's CH₂=CO–CH₂–CH₂, but that's three carbons, so probably not.

This is getting a bit too complicated. Maybe I should look at the options to see which ones make sense.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. C is 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option B: A is the same as A, B is the same, C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option C: A is trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate. B is 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile. C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option D: A is the same as C, B is same as C, C is 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

For part C, the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the starting material C must form the enolate that attacks the ketone.

Wait, the product is a cyclohexane-1,3-dione with a substituent. So C must be something that, when deprotonated, forms an enolate that adds to the ketone.

Wait, but but-3-en-2-one is the Michael acceptor, and C is the nucleophile. So C must provide the enolate that attacks the ketone.

So the product has a cyclohexane ring with two ketones and a substituent. So C must be a cyclohexane-1,3-dione derivative, perhaps, which when deprotonated forms an enolate that adds to the ketone.

Wait, but the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the substituent is a butyl group with a ketone at position 3.

So the substituent is -(CH₂)₂-CO- ?

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the enolate from cyclohexane-1,3-dione attacks the alpha-beta unsaturated ketone. The enolate would add to the beta position of the ketone.

So the enolate would be from the cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which is a strong base. The attack would form a new bond, creating the substituent on the cyclohexane.

So in the product, the cyclohexane has the substituent at position 2, which is a butyl group with a ketone.

So the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which suggests that the substituent is a four-carbon chain with a ketone at the third position.

Thus, the starting material C must be cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which when deprotonated forms an enolate that attacks the ketone.

Wait, but what is the structure of C? Because the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which is formed from the reaction of C with but-3-en-2-one.

So perhaps C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Because when it forms the enolate, it attacks the alpha-beta unsaturated ketone, leading to the product.

So looking at the options, for part C, the product is given, so what is C?

Looking at the options, option B says for C: cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option D says C: 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, but if the reaction is done with KOH and H2O, perhaps the product is a diol or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the enolate forms and attacks the alpha-beta unsaturated ketone, leading to the product.

So option B's C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which would make sense as the starting material.

But wait, looking back, the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which implies that the substituent is added to the cyclohexane ring.

So C must be the enolate donor, which is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So in the options, option B says C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

But in the reaction, C is the starting material. So for part C, the product is given as 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, so C must be the enolate donor, which is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So option B's C is correct.

Putting it all together:

For part A, the product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. So options A and B have this for A.

For part B, the product is either 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile or 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile. Looking at the options, option A for B is the former, option C and D have the latter.

But wait, the reaction is done in MeOH and H3O+. So after the Michael addition, perhaps there's an acid workup, leading to some protonation. But the product's structure would determine the correct option.

Assuming that the piperidine-derived enolate adds to the nitrile, leading to a new ring structure. If the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, that suggests a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 2. So option A's B is this.

But wait, the piperidine is a six-membered ring. Adding a four-carbon chain (butanenitrile) might form a ring. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the product retains the cyclohexene's ring but adds the nitrile group.

But I'm not sure, so perhaps I should look at the options.

The correct option for part B is either option A or option C. Since the options for part B in option A is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, and in option C it's 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile.

If the conditions are acidic (H3O+), perhaps the product is protonated, leading to the formation of a ketone if there was an enol. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. So option A's B is correct.

So for the three parts:

A: trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.

B: 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

C: cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Looking at the options, option B has A as correct, B as correct, and C as cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So the correct option would be option B.


The question involves analyzing three Michael addition reactions and determining the correct products and starting materials based on the given options. Here's the breakdown:

### Part A
The reactants are **dimethyl malonate** and **methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate** with **NaOEt, EtOH**. Dimethyl malonate acts as the nucleophile, forming an enolate that attacks the β-carbon of the α-β unsaturated carbonyl compound, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The product is a trimethyl ester with the structure **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. This matches the description in **Option A** and **Option B**.

### Part B
The reactants are **1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine** and **(E)-but-2-enenitrile** with **MeOH, H3O+**. The enolate formed from 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**, where the nitrile group is attached to a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 2. This matches the description in **Option A**.

### Part C
The reactants are **C** and **but-3-en-2-one** with **KOH, H2O**. The product is **2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**, which indicates that the starting material **C** must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. This is consistent with **Option B**.

### Final Answer
Combining the results for all three parts, the correct option is **Option B**, where:
- **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**
- **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**
- **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**

Answer: B
