Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem describes a reaction involving Substance X. Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which under normal conditions would be around 4 degrees Celsius, right? Because 273 K is 0°C, so 277 is about 4°C. So B is probably a solid that's just a bit above freezing.

Next, the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X contains two oxygen atoms. Also, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Hmm, I remember that some reagents like KMnO4 or other strong oxidizing agents are used, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So I need to identify what X is first.

Let's break down the reactions. X reacts with Y to form gas W, precipitate G. When G is heated, B is released. The gas W has equal protons and neutrons. So the molecule must be something like H2O or CO2 because the number of neutrons equals protons in the molecule. Wait, but for a molecule, the count would be per atom, not the molecule as a whole. Oh wait, no, the question says the gas W has a molecule where each molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for each molecule, the sum of protons equals the sum of neutrons across all atoms in the molecule.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think about possible gases. For example, H2O: each molecule has 2 H and 1 O. The protons in the molecule would be 2 (from H) + 8 (from O) = 10. The neutrons would be 1 (H has one proton, so usually one neutron, but wait, hydrogen has isotopes. However, if it's just H, not deuterium, so each H has 0 neutrons. So O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So the total neutrons in H2O would be (each H has 0) + 8 = 8
