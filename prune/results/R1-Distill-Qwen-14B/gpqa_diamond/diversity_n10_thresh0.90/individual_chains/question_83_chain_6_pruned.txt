Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm. Alright, let's break this down.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you titrate it with NaOH, which is a strong base, it forms acetate ions. The pH changes based on how much base has been added.

But wait, before that, there's a dilution step. So the first thing I need to do is calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.

Okay, so dilution. The initial volume is 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. We add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 liters).

Using the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 L. So,

0.05 * 0.02 = M2 * 0.04

So M2 = (0.05 * 0.02)/0.04 = (0.001)/0.04 = 0.025 M.

Wait, wait. 0.05 M times 0.02 L is 0.001 moles. Then, after adding 20 mL (0.02 L) of water, the new volume is 40 mL, so 0.04 L. So moles remain the same, 0.001, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yeah, that's 0.025 M acetic acid after dilution.

So now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Let me tackle the equivalence point first. Because that's a common scenario.

At equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid present. So let's calculate that.

The diluted acetic acid solution is 40 mL, 0.025 M.

Moles of acetic acid = M * V = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

NaOH is 0.1 M. Let's find the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence.

Moles NaOH = 0.001 mol. Volume = moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL.

So, the equivalence point is when 10 mL of NaOH has been added.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form acetate ions. So the solution will consist of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH). So the solution will be basic because acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid.

To find the pH, I can calculate the concentration of acetate ions and then use the Kb of acetate to find the pH.

First, find the concentration of acetate after the reaction.

The total volume at equivalence is the initial 40 mL plus 10 mL of NaOH, so 50 mL (0.05 L).

Moles of acetate = 0.001 mol. Concentration = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, the Kb for acetate. Since Ka for acetic acid is 1.85e-5, Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, that's Kb for acetate. But since Kb is small, the solution is weakly basic. So we can set up the equation for hydrolysis:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb expression is [CH3COOH
