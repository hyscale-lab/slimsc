Okay, so I have this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, let's break it down. So the researchers have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, and they want to know which one has a higher probability of transiting so they can prioritize their observations.

Both planets were detected via the RV method. So we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. The question states that both have the same mass. Oh wait, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star because the orbital period is shorter when you're closer (like how Mercury has a shorter year than Earth).

The stars hosting these planets have the same radii. Oh, but Planet_1's host has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. Oh, right, stars with higher mass are generally larger, but in this case, they have the same radius despite Planet_1's host being more massive. Interesting, maybe they're both on the main sequence but for different reasons.

Wait, the question says that the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved. So maybe Planet_2's host is a bit older or starting to expand, but they've managed to have the same radius as Planet_1's host. Hmm, not sure if that affects the transit probability directly, but perhaps it's a detail for stellar properties.

The key is the transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. The formula I think is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/(1 - e^2)) ), but wait, that's when incorporating eccentricity. But in this case, the orbits are circular, so e is zero. So the probability simplifies to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1), which is just (R_p^2)/(R_s^2). So the probability is proportional to (planet radius squared) divided by (star radius squared). 

But wait, do I have the right formula? Because another thought comes in: the transit probability also depends on the orbital distance. Oh no, wait, I might be mixing things up. Let me think again. Oh, the formula for the probability of a transit is actually the ratio of the area of the planet's orbit that is in the same plane as our line of sight. Wait
