Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to the distance to a star. Oh right, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger, and if it's farther, the parallax is smaller.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that their actual spatial density is the same throughout the space. But wait, when we observe them, their distribution in terms of parallax might not be uniform because parallax depends on distance.

I'm a bit fuzzy, but I think the concept here is about how the number of stars you observe at a particular parallax changes with the parallax value. So, if I have a unit range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density is constant. Let me think about the volume of a spherical shell at a certain distance. The volume of a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr would be the surface area of the sphere (4πd²) multiplied by dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be the number density (n) times 4πd² dr.

But parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that in. The volume shell becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 times dr. Wait, dr is the change in distance, but I need to express this in terms of parallax. So, dr = change in distance, and plx is 1/d, so d(plx) would be the change in parallax. Let me think about how d and plx are related. If plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, differentiating both sides, d(plx) = - (1/d²) dd. So, dd = -d² d(plx). Since d is positive, the negative sign indicates that as d increases, plx decreases.

So, the number of stars in a range of parallax d(plx) would be n (number density) times 4π (1/plx)^2 times the change in distance dr. But from the differentiation above, dr = (1/plx²) d(plx). Wait, I'm a bit confused about the substitution here.

Let me approach it differently. The number of stars in a thin shell is n * 4π d² dr. Since we have a range of parallax, let's think about how the volume element in parallax space looks. Because d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/(plx)^2. So, the number of stars becomes n * 4π * (1/(plx)^2) * dr. But dr is related to d(plx). Let me find dr in terms of d(plx).

From d = 1/plx, differentiating both sides: dr = - (1/(plx)^2) d(plx). Hmm, so dr is proportional to d(plx) but with a negative because as plx increases, d decreases. But since we're dealing with small increments, the negative sign just indicates direction, but when considering the number of stars, we take the magnitude. So, dr = (1/(plx)^2) d(plx).

Putting this into the number of stars: N = n * 4π * (1/(plx)^2) * (1/(plx)^2 d(plx)) ). Wait, that would give N = n * 4π * (1/(plx)^4) * d(plx). But wait, that can't be right because the number of stars should decrease more smoothly. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should model the number of stars per unit parallax interval. So, how does the number of stars in a small range of plx (dplx) depend on plx?

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is the volume of the shell times the number density. The volume of
