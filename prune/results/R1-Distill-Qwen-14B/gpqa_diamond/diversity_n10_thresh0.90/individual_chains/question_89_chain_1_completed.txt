Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it one reaction at a time.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very rigid. So 1,3-dibromo would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in this structure. When you heat it with excess KOH, I think that's probably an elimination reaction. With KOH, especially in high heat, dibromides often undergo elimination to form alkenes. So maybe 1,3-dibromoadamantane becomes something with a double bond.

The product is a light yellow solid. The IR spectrum shows an absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. Wait, that's a strong carbonyl peak. So maybe the product isn't just an alkene but something with a carbonyl group. Hmm, could it be an epoxide? No, because epoxides don't have carbonyls. Wait, another possibility: maybe it's an elimination to form an alkene and then some kind of oxidation? No, KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Wait another thought: when you have a dibromide and you eliminate, you get an alkene. But if it's a vicinal dihalide, elimination gives an alkene. But how does that lead to a carbonyl?

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide? No, because epoxide formation usually involves bases, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but then maybe some further reaction. Oh wait, wait! Wait, the product is 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH, and if it's heated, perhaps it's a double elimination—the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, so when they eliminate in a vicinal dihalide, they form an alkene. But why the IR shows a carbonyl?

Oh, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing a substitution. But that would lead to a diol. But the IR would then show O-H stretches, which aren't mentioned here. The IR peak is at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl, like a ketone or ester.

Wait, maybe the reaction is more like an E2 mechanism. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane—each Br is on C1 and C3. Heating with KOH (a strong base) would lead to elimination. But wait, if the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, maybe elimination leads to formation of a diene? Or perhaps a different structure.

Wait, another angle: maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, and then perhaps some other reaction. But the IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl. Oh! Wait, perhaps it's a Dieckmann cyclization? No, that's for esters. Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait another thought: maybe when two Br atoms are eliminated, the structure forms a ketone. How? Oh, wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to a double bond, but then maybe some rearrangement... Hmm, no, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is adamantanone. If the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane and upon heating with KOH, it loses two equivalents of HBr to form an alkene, but wait, that would give an alkene. Oh wait, but in that case, why is there a carbonyl? Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a pinacol-type elimination? But pinacol rearrangement requires a diol, not a dihalide.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the NMR data. The product 1 has 1H NMR as follows: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is probably a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe an epoxide? Or an ether? Or perhaps an alcohol? Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl, so maybe it's an ester or a ketone.

Wait, 4.79 for 2H could be a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like an epoxide. But then what about the carbonyl? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal diol, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, let me think again. The reaction is 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Heating. KOH is a strong base, so perhaps it's an elimination reaction to form an alkene. But then how does that lead to a product with a carbonyl?

Ah! Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't a simple elimination. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some other process. Wait, another possibility: the base could cause the formation of a carbonyl group via a radical mechanism? Or maybe the structure is such that elimination leads to a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon elimination forms a diradical, which then forms a carbonyl. I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide. Epoxides have O in a three-membered ring. So in the NMR, an epoxide's protons are usually around 3.5-4.5 ppm as a triplet. But in the NMR given, there's a 4.79 for 2H. Maybe that's the epoxide's CH2.

Wait, but then why the IR shows a carbonyl. Oh, maybe the epoxide is part of a ketone. Hmm, maybe it's not an epoxide but a ketone.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the product is a diketone. But 1,3 positions being brominated, after elimination, maybe the structure is such that two carbonyls are formed. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane. No, because cyclopropane would have different NMR shifts, and no carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is an ester? But why would KOH produce an ester? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: the IR peak at 1720 could be an ester carbonyl or a ketone. If it's a ketone, the NMR would have the carbonyl as a singlet but not in the H spectrum. The H NMR has a 4.79 (2H), which could be adjacent to oxygen. Maybe it's a geminal diol, but that's more acidic. Wait, but maybe it's an alcohol. But then the IR would show O-H stretch, which isn't mentioned. So probably not.

Wait, maybe the 4.79 is a CH2 group connected to an oxygen, like an ether or ester. If it's an ester, the carbonyl peak in IR makes sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ketone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, with four cyclohexane rings fused together in a particular way. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two adjacent carbons. Heating with KOH could cause elimination to form a double bond between those two carbons, making an alkene. So the product would be an adamantene derivative with a double bond.

But then why the IR shows a carbonyl? Unless the elimination leads to some rearrangement forming a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the elimination forms a conjugated diene, but that doesn't directly lead to a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the base induces a shift, leading to a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbene? No, that's not likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an enol ether, which would have an oxygen and a double bond. But the IR would still show the carbonyl.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck on the first step. Let me try to figure out the first reaction.

1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH (excess) → product 1.

Assuming elimination, two HBr molecules are lost, forming a double bond between C1 and C3. So product 1 would be an adamantadiene? But that's a diene. But the IR shows a carbonyl. So I'm not connecting the dots.

Wait another thought: maybe the reaction is a Hofmann elimination or something else that forms an amide, but no, that's for amines.

Wait, maybe it's a neighboring group participation. Is there any possibility that the structure can form an oxide? Such as an epoxide. If two Br atoms are adjacent, elimination would form an epoxide.

Wait, let me think about that. If you have a dihalide, specifically a vicinal dihalide, treating with a base can lead to elimination of two equivalents of HX (here, HBr) to form an epoxide. Oh, wait! Wait, wait—epoxides are usually formed from vicinal dihalides when treated with a base. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a vicinal dihalide (if C1 and C3 are adjacent?), wait, no. Wait, in adamantane, the positions are such that 1 and 3 might not be adjacent. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Wait, the structure of adamantane has multiple fused cyclohexane rings. The 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on carbons that are not adjacent. Because in the adamantane structure, the positions are each part of a different cyclohexane ring. So if 1 and 3 are not adjacent, elimination to form a double bond between them isn't straightforward. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.

If 1 and 3 are not adjacent, perhaps the elimination isn't possible. But the question says it's heated, so perhaps another pathway.

Wait, perhaps the KOH is causing a substitution reaction. For example, each Br is replaced by an OH group. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would become 1,3-diol. But then the IR would show broad O-H peaks, which aren't mentioned. Also, the NMR would have OH protons, but they might be exchanged and not show up, but the 4.79 (2H) could be the diol's protons. But the IR at 1720 is a carbonyl, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the first step. Let me think about the subsequent steps to see if that helps.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So perhaps product 1 is being subjected to a Friedel-Crafts reaction. But product 1 has a carbonyl (from IR), so maybe it's an acylation.

Wait, but what does product 1 look like? If product 1 is a ketone (due to carbonyl), then heating with Al isopropoxide could lead to some kind of acylation. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires an aromatic ring, which adamantane doesn't have. Hmm. Or perhaps it's an acylation of some other structure.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. So if product 1 is an epoxide, then heating with Al isopropoxide would do what? Maybe ring-opening? Or perhaps it's a catalyst for some other reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester. Then, using a Lewis acid like Al isopropoxide might promote some kind of elimination or rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol. If it's a diol, then heating with Al isopropoxide could lead to hemiacetal or acetal formation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the IR of product 1 shows a carbonyl, so it's more likely a ketone or ester.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the first reaction is a substitution, but not with both Br atoms. If only one Br is replaced, but that would leave another Br, which might lead to some elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction forms a carbonyl group through elimination. Wait, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules, perhaps via a conjugated elimination, forming a carbonyl group in between.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let me think of the possible structure. If the structure has two Br atoms on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond. But if they're not adjacent, maybe a different reaction.

Wait, maybe it's a di-elimination that results in a ketone. For instance, if the elimination leads to a conjugated diene which then undergoes some kind of cyclization to form a carbonyl. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that eliminating both bromides forms a bridge or a ring with a carbonyl.

Wait, another angle: Perhaps the product 1 is a diketone. But how?

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. Wait, that doesn't fit because we have two Br atoms.

Alternatively, maybe each Br undergoes elimination, each forming a carbonyl. But that would require each elimination to form a carbonyl, which I don't think is possible.

I think I'm stuck on the first step. Maybe I should try to figure out product 2 and see if that helps.

Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. If product 1 is a ketone, maybe product 2 is an enol ether or some kind of enol. Alternatively, if product 1 is an ester, perhaps product 2 is an acetal or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is the result of a ring-opening. For example, acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide would form a diol.

But then ozone is bubbled through product 2 to form product 3. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into smaller fragments.

Wait, but product 3 is formed by ozonolysis. So product 2 must have a double bond. Then, product 3 would result from breaking that double bond.

So if product 2 has a double bond, what does product 1 need to be? Well, product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide to form product 2. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone, which upon treatment with Al isopropoxide undergoes some kind of elimination to form a double bond. For example, a ketone could undergo acid-catalyzed dehydration to form an alkene, but that's usually more associated with alcohols. Alternatively, if product 1 is a diol, Al isopropoxide could catalyze elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, so if product 1 is a diol, then product 2 would be an alkene. Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

But wait, the initial reaction after KOH produces product 1, which has a carbonyl (IR at 1720). So if product 1 is a diol, that doesn't fit the IR data. So perhaps product 1 has a carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the NMR of product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, etc.

Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, product 3 would have carbonyl groups. The most deshielded H would be near the carbonyl, perhaps as an alpha proton.

Wait, for example, if the double bond in product 2 is between carbons A and B. Ozonolysis would cleave it, and each fragment would have a carbonyl group. The H's next to the carbonyl (alpha H's) would be deshielded and appear downfield.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded H would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's say it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. The coupling would depend on the neighboring H's.

Wait, for example, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R', then the CH2 groups next to the carbonyl would have coupling with each other. So each H on the CH2 would be a quartet (each splits into a quartet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2), but wait, if each CH2 has two H's, the coupling between them would be a triplet. Because each H on one CH2 would couple with two H's on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, no. Let's think: each CH2 has two H's. The H's on each CH2 are identical (they're a singlet for their own group). When you look at the splitting from the adjacent CH2, each H on the first CH2 is split by the two H's on the adjacent CH2. So each H would be a triplet.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. For two adjacent CH2 groups: each H on the first CH2 is coupled with the two H's on the second CH2.

So each H on the first CH2 would have a triplet (n+1, where n=2 from the adjacent CH2).

Wait, but if two H's are on each CH2, then each H on the first CH2 is coupled with two H's on the second, so n=2, so each would be a triplet.

But wait, for the first CH2, each H is coupled to two H's on the next CH2, which are equivalent. So each H on the first CH2 is a triplet. Similarly, each H on the second CH2 is a triplet.

Wait, but sometimes the splitting can lead to more complex patterns if there are more adjacent H's. Alternatively, if each CH2 is next to another CH2, their coupling can lead to more complex splitting.

Wait, but in the case of ozonolysis, the product would be two carbonyl groups. Let's imagine the double bond in product 2 is in a structure like R-CH2-CH2-R', but that's not a double bond. No, wait, if product 2 is R-CH2-CH2-R' with a double bond, it would be R-CH2-CH2-R' as a single bond, but that's not ozonolysis.

Wait, product 2 has a double bond, so ozonolysis would break that. For example, if product 2 is R-CH2-CH2-R' with a single bond, no, but with a double bond: R-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-R' wouldn't make sense. Let me think of a specific example.

Suppose product 2 is an alkene, say, CH2=CH-... Then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. Each fragment would have a carbonyl group, and the H's adjacent to them would be deshielded.

In the case of ozonolysis, the cleavage of a double bond leads to the formation of carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 has a structure like R-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-R', but that's not a double bond. No, it's more like R-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH2-R' or something similar. Wait, no, product 2 is made from product 1 by heating with Al isopropoxide. So product 1 must be something from which product 2 can form an alkene.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether. Then, ozonolysis would not act on an enol ether. Wait, no, ozonolysis targets double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond.

Wait, another angle: if product 1 is an epoxide, then product 2 would be a diol after acid-catalyzed ring-opening. But then product 2 would have two adjacent OH groups, which could lead to elimination upon heating, forming a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, and product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

But let's try to connect this. Suppose product 1 is a ketone, perhaps 1,3-adamantanedione. Then, product 2 would be an enol ether or something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, which when treated with a Lewis acid like Al isopropoxide, would lose water and form a double bond (dehydration). Then product 2 would be an alkene. Ozonolysis would break that into two carbonyl groups.

So, for example, if product 1 is a diol (say, 1,3-adamantanediol), and product 2 is 1,3-adamantadiene. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyls, leading to product 3 as two ketones.

But then the NMR of product 3 would show the H's adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Those H's are deshielded, so they would appear downfield.

In the NMR, the most deshielded H would be adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say the structure is a diketone. Each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group. So each CH2 would have two H's that are next to a carbonyl.

Each CH2 group's H's would be split based on their neighboring H's. If each CH2 is next to another CH2, the coupling would lead to triplet patterns.

Wait, let's imagine the structure after ozonolysis. Suppose product 3 is two carbonyl groups connected by a chain. For example, if product 2 was CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 (some structure), then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. But in reality, given the adamantane structure, the ozonolysis would probably cleave into smaller rings or bridge structures.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, and the H's next to the carbonyl are each in a CH2 group. Each H on the CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH2's H's.

So, each H on the first CH2 is next to two H's on the adjacent CH2. So each H would be a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Looking at the options, option A is triplet.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps each CH2 is next to another CH2, which is next to another CH2, leading to more splitting. Wait, but in a simple case, two CH2 groups next to each other would lead to each H being a triplet.

Alternatively, if the H is adjacent to more than one set of H's, the splitting could be more complex. For example, if a CH2 is next to two different groups, each with H's, then the splitting could be a triplet of triplets.

But in the case of ozonolysis, assuming the product is a diketone with two CH2 groups adjacent to each carbonyl, each CH2 would be next to another CH2 group from the other side.

Wait, perhaps each H is next to two H's on one side and two H's on the other. So each H would have coupling with two sets of two H's, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, let me think of a specific example. Suppose the structure is (CH2)2CO-R and another part.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the actual splitting. Let's say each H on CH2-A is adjacent to two H's on CH2-B. Similarly, each H on CH2-B is adjacent to two H's on CH2-A.

So each H on CH2-A would split into a triplet due to coupling with CH2-B's two H's. Similarly, each H on CH2-A is also adjacent to another group, say, another CH2, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group that's next to another CH2 and perhaps a CH group. But without a clear picture, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is next to a CH group. So, the H's on the CH2 would be adjacent to the H's on the CH and the H's on the adjacent CH2. For example, a structure like CH2-CO-CH2-CH3. No, that doesn't make sense for ozonolysis.

Wait, another approach: when a double bond is cleaved via ozonolysis, the resulting carbonyl groups are at the ends. So the H's adjacent to the carbonyls would be on either end. For example, if the ozonolysis cleaves a symmetrical double bond, the product would be two identical carbonyl compounds. But if the double bond is asymmetrical, the products would be different.

Assuming the most deshielded H is on a CH2 next to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, the splitting would be a triplet.

Wait, but let's think of a specific structure. Suppose product 3 is two carbonyl groups connected by a chain:

O=C-R-CH2-CH2-CO=O

Wait, but that's not possible because ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls. So, for example, if product 2 was CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, ozonolysis would give two aldehyde groups if each end is CH2. But in adamantane, perhaps it's more likely to form ketones.

Wait, perhaps each end after ozonolysis is a ketone. So each R group would be something like (CH2)k-CO.

In such a case, the H's adjacent to the CO would be on a CH2 group. Each H on that CH2 would be adjacent to another CH2 group. So each H would be coupled to two H's, leading to a triplet.

So the most deshielded H (on the CH2 next to CO) would have a triplet coupling pattern.

Looking back at the options, option A is triplet.

But wait, another angle: what if each CH2 is next to more than one set of H's? For example, if each CH2 is next to another CH2 and another CH group. Then, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is adjacent to two different sets of H's, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to visualize. Suppose the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO=O

But that's a four-carbon chain between two ketones. The H's on the middle CH2 groups (positions 2 and 3) would have different coupling patterns.

The H's on the CH2 next to the CO (positions 1 and 4) would be adjacent to the CH2 in the middle. Each H on position 1 would be next to two H's on position 2. So each H on position 1 would be a triplet.

The H's on position 2 would be next to two H's on position 1 and two on position 3. So each H on position 2 would be a quartet (n=3, so quartet? Or is it more?), wait, n is the number of neighboring H's. Each H on position 2 is adjacent to two H's on position 1 and two H's on position 3. So each H on position 2 would be split by 2 + 2 = 4 H's. So each would be a quintet (n=4, so 5 peaks). But wait, that's not one of the options.

But the question asks for the most deshielded H, which is probably the one closest to the carbonyl, i.e., position 1. So the H on position 1 would be a triplet.

Thus, the correct answer would be A) triplet.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH**  
   - The reaction likely involves elimination of two equivalents of HBr, forming a carbonyl-containing compound.  
   - The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group (likely a ketone).  
   - The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a structure with a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative group (likely oxygen, as indicated by the carbonyl).

2. **Reaction 2: Heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide**  
   - Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely catalyzes a reaction involving the carbonyl compound.  
   - This step likely forms an alkene (product 2), as ozonolysis in the next step targets double bonds.

3. **Reaction 3: Ozonolysis of product 2**  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3.  
   - The cleavage introduces carbonyl groups at the sites of the former double bond.  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group, likely part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl.

4. **Coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen**  
   - The CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl is coupled with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH2 group.  
   - This results in a triplet coupling pattern due to the splitting caused by the two equivalent hydrogens on the neighboring CH2.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

**Answer: A**
