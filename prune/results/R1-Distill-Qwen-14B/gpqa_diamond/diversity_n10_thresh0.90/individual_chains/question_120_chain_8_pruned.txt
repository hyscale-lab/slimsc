Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different power laws.

Let me think. Parallax is related to distance. I remember that parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance, right? So distance d = 1/plx.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. Wait, what's the distribution here? If stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density is the same in all directions. So the number density is uniform in space. But when we observe them, their distribution along the line of sight (distance) will affect how we perceive their counts based on parallax.

Wait, the number of stars per unit volume of space is constant. So if I consider a small volume element, the number of stars in it is proportional to the volume. But how does this translate into the number per unit parallax?

Let me approach this step by step. Let's say I have a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr. The volume of this shell is approximately 4πd² dr. Since the number density is uniform, the number of stars in this shell would be n * 4πd² dr, where n is the number density.

But the parallax plx is 1/d. So d = 1/plx. Therefore, dr = -d (d plx) / (d plx)^2? Wait, maybe I should express everything in terms of plx. Let me see.

Let me compute the number of stars per unit parallax. So, for a given parallax plx, the number of stars per unit plx (d plx) would be n * 4πd² * (dr), but I need to express dr in terms of d plx.

Wait, parallax plx = 1/d. So, d plx = - (1/d²) dd. Because d plx = d (1/d) = - (1/d²) dd. So, dd = - d² d plx.

So, dr is the thickness in distance. Let me consider a small change in plx, d plx. The corresponding change in distance is dd = - (d²) d plx. But wait, the shell's thickness dr is the same as dd? Or is it more about the volume element?

Wait, maybe I should think about this in terms of how the number of stars in a range of parallax depends on plx.

The number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + d plx is proportional to the volume of the shell between d and d + dd, where d = 1/plx and dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. So the volume of the shell is 4π d² dd.

Substituting, the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (- (1/plx²) d plx) ) = 4π (1/plx)^4 (-d plx).

But since d plx is negative when plx increases (as d decreases), but we're considering a positive change in plx, we can take absolute values. So the number of stars per d plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, so the number of stars per unit change in plx would be proportional to 1/(plx)^4. So the number density in plx space, so the number per unit plx would go as ~1/plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait. Another approach. Let me think about the differential number of stars. The number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + d plx is the number density times the volume between d and d + dd.

dN = n * 4π d² dd.

But dd is the change in distance. Since plx = 1/d, then d plx = -1/(d²)
