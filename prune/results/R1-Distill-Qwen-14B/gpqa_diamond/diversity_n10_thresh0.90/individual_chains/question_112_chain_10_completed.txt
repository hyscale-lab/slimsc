Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'm going to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem starts by giving the state |alpha> of an electron. It's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I know that |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so they're the standard basis states for spin-1/2 systems. That means I can write |alpha> in terms of these basis vectors.

But wait, the question says it's proportional, so I need to normalize this state. The first thing I should probably do is find the normalization constant. To normalize, I have to compute the inner product of |alpha> with itself and then take the square root to find the normalization factor.

So, the state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let's compute the inner product <alpha|alpha>:

<alpha|alpha> = (1-i)(2+i) + (2+i)(1-i) ?

Wait, no. Wait, the inner product is the sum over the components multiplied by their complex conjugates. Since the basis states |up> and |down> are orthonormal, the inner product simplifies to the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each coefficient.

So, the coefficient for |up> is (1+i). The magnitude squared is |1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient for |down> is (2 - i). The magnitude squared is |2 - i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5. So the total is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the normalization constant is 1/sqrt(7), so |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> all multiplied by 1/sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the first part of the question asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds familiar. Let me think about what operator that is.

In a two-level system, the Pauli matrices come into play. The Pauli X matrix has 0 on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal. Similarly, the Pauli Y and Z have different structures. But the given matrix is a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements are zero and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. So let's write it out.

The operator A is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. So:

A = [ [0, hbar/2], 
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait a second, that's the same as sigma_x multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so (sigma_x) * (hbar/2) gives the matrix A.

So the operator A is (hbar/2) sigma_x. The eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of this operator A. So the eigenstates of A will be the same as those of sigma_x, just scaled by hbar/2. Since the eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Let me confirm that.

Yes, sigma_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, and the corresponding eigenstates are (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) and (|0> - |1>)/sqrt(2), where |0> and |1> are the basis states. So in our case, the eigenstates of A are the same, because scaling the operator by a scalar doesn't change the eigenvectors, just scales the eigenvalues.

So the eigenstates of A, which I'll call |+> and |->, are:

|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, wait. Let me get the signs right. Hmm, wait no: the eigenvectors for sigma_x are (1,1) and (1,-1), so yes, |+> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), |-> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

But wait, sometimes the order could be different. Let me think. The eigenvalues of sigma_x are +1 and -1. So when sigma_x acts on |+>, it gives +1 * |+>, so the state (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) is the +1 eigenstate. Similarly, the state (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) is the -1 eigenstate.

So the operator A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, so its eigenvalues are (hbar/2)*1 and (hbar/2)*(-1), that is, ±hbar/2.

But the question is about the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A. So we need to find the probability that, when we measure A, the outcome is the eigenvalue +hbar/2, and similarly for -hbar/2.

In quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenstate in the state vector.

So, the state |alpha> is expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, but we need to express it in terms of |+> and |->.

Alternatively, we can compute the inner product of |alpha> with each of the eigenstates |+> and |->.

Let me write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

And the eigenstates |+> and |-> are:

|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, the inner product < + | alpha > is:

< + | alpha > = [1/sqrt(2)] [ < up | + < down | ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Simplify this:

= [ (1+i) * < up | up > + (2 - i) * < down | up > ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))

But < down | up > is zero because they are orthogonal. So,

= (1+i) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, the inner product for |-> is:

< - | alpha > = [1/sqrt(2)] [ < up | - < down | ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

= [ (1+i) * < up | up > - (2 - i) * < down | down > ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))

= [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))

= [ 1 +i -2 +i ] / (sqrt(14) )

= ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14 )

Now, to find the probabilities, we take the square of the magnitude of these inner products.

First, for |+>:

|< + | alpha >|^2 = | (1 +i) / sqrt(14) |^2

The magnitude squared of (1 +i) is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. So:

= 2 / 14 = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857.

Wait, that's about 0.142857. But wait, that's the probability for |+> ?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) is sqrt(14). So, 1/sqrt(14) is the denominator. So the absolute square is ( (1+i) / sqrt(14) )*(1-i)/sqrt(14) ) = (2)/(14) = 1/7.

Hmm, wait, that would give 1/7 as the probability for |+>, and the same process for |->. Let me compute that.

Wait, the inner product for |-> is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14). Let me compute the magnitude squared.

The numerator is (-1 + 2i), so | -1 + 2i |^2 is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4 =5.

So |< - | alpha >|^2 =5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Wait a minute, but wait. 1/7 is approximately 0.142857, and 5/14 is approx 0.35714. But 1/7 +5/14 is (2 +5)/14=7/14=1/2. That can't be right because the probabilities should add up to 1. So something’s wrong here.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the inner products. Let me recheck.

Wait, wait, |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7). So when I compute < + | alpha >, which is (|up> +|down>)/sqrt(2) dotted into |alpha>, I get:

= [ (1+i) * 1 + (2 -i) *1 ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)).

Because < up | up> is 1, < down | up> is 0, and < down | down> is 1. So:

= (1+i + 2 -i) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

= (3) / (sqrt(14)).

So < + | alpha > is 3/sqrt(14). Then |< + | alpha >|^2 is 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Wait, that makes more sense because 9/14 + something else should add up to 1.

Similarly, for |->, let's compute < - | alpha >.

< - | alpha > = [ (1+i) * 1 - (2 -i)*1 ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

= [1 +i -2 +i ] / sqrt(14)

= (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14).

The magnitude squared is | -1 + 2i |^2 = (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5. So |< - | alpha >|^2=5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Ah, so the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. 9/14 is about 0.642857, and 5/14 is 0.35714.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have exactly 9/14 and 5/14. Hmm, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar / 7
B) 0.54, 0.46 and 3hbar / sqrt(7)
C) 0.28, 0.72 and hbar / sqrt(7)
D) 0.61, 0.29 and 2hbar / sqrt(7)

Hmm, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64. So option A has 0.64 and 0.36. But 0.64 +0.36=1, which is okay, but 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is 0.642857, so 0.64 is close, but let's see what the other terms are.

The average value of the operator A is the expectation value <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, and sigma_x has the eigenvalues +1 and -1, the expectation value is (hbar/2) * <sigma_x>.

But <sigma_x> is the expectation value of sigma_x in state |alpha>, which is the sum over the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, perhaps we can compute <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> directly.

Wait, sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix, whose matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, perhaps it's easier to compute <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> using the matrix representation.

But maybe another approach is better. Let me think.

The expectation value of A is (hbar/2) times the expectation value of sigma_x in |alpha>.

The expectation value of sigma_x is given by:

< sigma_x > = <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>

Let me compute that.

First, express |alpha> as a vector. |alpha> is:

[ (1+i) / sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Because |up> is the first basis vector and |down> is the second.

So, write |alpha> as a column vector:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Now, sigma_x is the 2x2 matrix:

[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ]

So, sigma_x |alpha> is:

[ (2 -i)/sqrt(7),
  (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So, <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> is the inner product of |alpha> with sigma_x |alpha>.

Which is:

[ (1-i)/sqrt(7) , (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ) ] multiplied by [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1 +i)/sqrt(7) ) ]^T.

Wait, no, the inner product is (conjugate transpose) times sigma_x |alpha>.

Wait, |alpha> is a column vector, so <alpha| is the conjugate transpose.

So:

<alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] multiplied by [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1 +i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So multiply the first component of the row vector with the first component of the column vector, plus the second component multiplied by the second component.

So:

= [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ] / (7)

Compute each term:

First term: (1 - i)(2 -i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2 = 2 -3i -1 = (1 -3i).

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2(1) +2i +i(1) +i^2 = 2 +3i -1 = (1 +3i).

So sum is (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) )= 2.

So <sigma_x> = 2/7.

Therefore, the expectation value of A is (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar /7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Now, looking back at the probabilities I found earlier: 9/14 (~0.643) and 5/14 (~0.357). Which option has these probabilities and an average of hbar/7?

Looking at the options:

Option A: probabilities 0.64 and 0.36. 0.64 +0.36=1. The average is hbar/7. So that's a match.

Option D: 0.61 and 0.29. 0.61 +0.29=1. The average is 2hbar/sqrt(7). So that's not it.

Wait, but wait: 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places. So option A's first probability is 0.64. The second is 0.36, which is 5/14≈0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded.

So option A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and average is hbar/7. That matches.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure that I computed the probabilities correctly. Because earlier I thought I was getting 9/14 and 5/14, but when I did the inner products again, I realized I had made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier when I reevaluated. Let me go through that again.

Wait, |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

The eigenstates of A (which is (hbar/2) sigma_x) are |+> and |->, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

So the inner product < + | alpha > is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

= [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / ( sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) )

= (3) / sqrt(14).

So |< + | alpha >|^2 = (3^2) / (14) =9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, < - | alpha > is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / ( sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) )

= [ (1+i) -2 +i ] = [ (-1) + 2i ] / sqrt(14).

The magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) / 14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.35714.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

9/14 is 0.642857, which is approximately 0.64, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is approximately 0.36.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7, which matches option A.

But wait, looking at the options, option A says the average is hbar/7, and probabilities 0.64 and 0.36. So that would be option A.

But wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the probabilities using the eigenvectors. Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities are calculated as the square of the coefficients when |alpha> is expressed in the eigenbasis of A.

But I think I've done that correctly.

So, the answer to the first part is probabilities of about 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A is:

A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar / 7

So the answer should be option A.


The problem involves an electron in a state described by \( |\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}} \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be computed.

### Step 1: Eigenstates of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix:  
\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x, \quad \text{where } \sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are:
\[
|+\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
These eigenstates are also the eigenstates of \( A \), with eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \).

### Step 2: Probabilities of Measuring Eigenstates
The state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is expressed as:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \) are given by the square of the magnitudes of the inner products \( \langle +|\alpha\rangle \) and \( \langle -|\alpha\rangle \), respectively.

#### Inner Products:
1. \( \langle +|\alpha\rangle \):
\[
\langle +|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ \langle \uparrow| + \langle \downarrow| \right] \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]
\[
\langle +|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{14}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(+|\alpha\rangle) = |\langle +|\alpha\rangle|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.642857.
\]

2. \( \langle -|\alpha\rangle \):
\[
\langle -|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ \langle \uparrow| - \langle \downarrow| \right] \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]
\[
\langle -|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{14}} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(-|\alpha\rangle) = |\langle -|\alpha\rangle|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357143.
\]

### Step 3: Average Value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is the expectation value \( \langle \alpha|A|\alpha\rangle \). Using the fact that \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), this becomes:
\[
\langle \alpha|A|\alpha\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \alpha|\sigma_x|\alpha\rangle.
\]
The expectation value \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) is computed as:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)}{7}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{2}{7}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Step 4: Matching with Options
The probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). These match **Option A**.

ANSWER: A
