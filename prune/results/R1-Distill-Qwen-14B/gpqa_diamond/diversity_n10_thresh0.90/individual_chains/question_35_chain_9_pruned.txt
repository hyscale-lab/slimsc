Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The S matrix has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). We need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this operator and determine which statement about the process is correct.

So, the plan is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix Ay, then look at the options and see which one is correct.

First, let's write down the matrix Ay. Since c is h/(4π), and S is as given, Ay = (h/4π) * S.

So S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

So multiplying by c, Ay becomes:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Which is:
[ 0    (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   0 ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues of Ay, I remember that we need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So let's write out Ay - aI:

[ -a    (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ].

Calculating each part:

First term: a^2.

Second term: [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ].

Let me compute that. i * i is i² = -1. So (-i) * i is -(i²) = -(-1) = 1.

So the product is (-i)(i) = (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. Then multiplied by h^2/(4π)^2.

Wait, wait. Let me compute it step by step.

The product is (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)).

Which is (-i)(i) * (h^2)/( (4π)^2 )

What's (-i)(i)? Let's see: i * i is i^2 = -1. So (-i) * i is (-i²) = -(-1) = 1.

So the product becomes (1) * (h^2)/(16 π²) ) = h²/(16 π²).

So the determinant equation is:

a² - [ h²/(16 π²) ] = 0.

So a² = h²/(16 π²).

Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4 π).

Wait, because the square root of h²/(16 π²) is h/(4 π) and negative is -h/(4 π).

So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a= -h/(4π).

Wait, wait. But wait, the problem says that the matrix operator S is part of Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues come from c times the eigenvalues of S.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the eigenvalues of S first.

Wait, S is a 2x2 matrix, which is a spin matrix. Wait, S in quantum mechanics is usually represented as (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So perhaps S here is (ħ/2) times σ_y, which would be (ħ/2)[[0, -i], [i, 0]]. But in this problem, c is h/(4π), and S is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So perhaps S is the Pauli Y matrix times something.

Wait, the Pauli Y matrix is σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is exactly σ_y. So the eigenvalues of S would be ±1, because Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1.

Wait, no. Wait, the Pauli matrices have trace zero and determinant -1. So for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues λ satisfy λ² = determinant. The determinant of σ_y is -1. So the eigenvalues are sqrt(-1) and -sqrt(-1), which are i and -i. Wait, that can't be right because for Pauli matrices, the eigenvalues are ±1 when you have σ_y multiplied by something else, perhaps.

Wait, no, let me think again. The Pauli matrices, like σ_y, have eigenvalues ±1. So if S is σ_y, then its eigenvalues are ±1. So then Ay = c·S would have eigenvalues c*(±1) = ±c. Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues of Ay would be ±h/(4π).

Wait, that's what I found earlier. So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a= -h/(4π).

But wait, looking back at the problem statement, the operator A_y is c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is the given matrix.

So the eigenvalues are a = c * eigenvalues of S.

Since S has eigenvalues ±1, the eigenvalues of A_y would be ± c, which is ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait, that's if S is indeed the Pauli Y
