Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution with EDTA. Let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on EDTA complexes, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question says: What's the concentration of calcium ions in a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, meaning it forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The formation constant (K) tells us how strong the complex is. A high K means the complex is stable, so the metal is tightly bound.

In this case, the solution is a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, I might think that the concentration of Ca²+ would just be 0.02 M, but that's probably not the case because the complex dissociates to some extent.

Wait, but if the complex is stoichiometric, maybe it's 1:1. So each Ca²+ is bound by one EDTA^4- ion. So the formula would be something like CaEDTA^2-?

When the complex dissociates, it would release Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. The reaction should be: CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

The formation constant K is given, which is K = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-].

Wait, but K is for the formation of the complex. So the formation reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-, and K for that would be 5e10.

So, for the dissociation, the K would be 1/(5e10), because K Dissociation = 1/K Formation.

So the dissociation expression is Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-] = 1/(5e10).

Now, let's think about the initial concentrations. When we have 0.02 M CaEDTA^2-, that's the initial concentration. Let's say x is the amount that dissociates.

So, at equilibrium:
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since Kd is very small, x is tiny)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

Wait, but EDTA is a polydentate ligand, and in solution, it exists in different protonated forms depending on pH. But the question says pH is ideal, which probably means that EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form, EDTA^4-, which is needed for the complex formation. So we don't have to worry about other forms of EDTA, I think.

So substituting into the Kd expression:

Kd = (x)(x) / (0.02) = x² / 0.02 = 1/(5e10)

So, x² = (0.02) * (1/(5e10)) ) = 0.02 / 5e10 = 2e-3 /5e10 = 4e-13.

Wait, wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12. Which is 0.4e-12, or 4e-13.

So x squared is 4e-13, so x is the square root of that. Square root of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5? Wait, wait. Let me calculate this right.

Square root of 4 is 2, square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 *
