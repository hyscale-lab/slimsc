Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices given are A to D, each combining some of these symmetries.

Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a theory that extends the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators, which are used to parameterize beyond the Standard Model physics. These operators are organized based on their dimension, and they need to respect certain symmetries.

The first thing I need to figure out is what each symmetry entails and whether SMEFT operators must adhere to them.

Starting with Lorentz symmetry. I think Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. Since the Standard Model itself respects Lorentz symmetry, I would expect SMEFT operators to also respect it. Because if they didn't, that would imply the breakdown of a fundamental symmetry of our spacetime, which is pretty significant. So I think Lorentz symmetry (option 1) must be respected.

Next is Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like shifting position in space and time). But wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a bigger symmetry group that includes Lorentz and translations? But SMEFT operators are written in a way that they form a valid theory under the Standard Model's symmetries. Wait, wait. Let me think. The Standard Model already respects Poincare symmetry. So do SMEFT operators automatically respect it as well? Because the operators are part of a Lorentcovariant theory, which also respects Poincare. Or do they not necessarily? Hmm, maybe the SMEFT operators are constructed to be Poincare invariant. Because if they weren't, it would mean the theory isn't consistent under spacetime translations, which is part of the fundamental symmetries. So I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should recall that in SMEFT, the operators are typically written as Lorentz-invariant. But Poincare is a larger group. Do SMEFT operators respect Poincare symmetry? Or is it automatically implied because the SM does? Hmm.

Wait a second, the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so all the operators should respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model. The Standard Model respects Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT operators must as well. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are required. So options that include both 1 and 2 would be correct. But looking at the options, option A is 1 and 2, option C is 1,2,4. Hmm.

Then comes CP symmetry. CP stands for Charge conjugation (C) and Parity (P) together. I think that the SMEFT does not necessarily respect CP symmetry. Because the Standard Model already has CP violation in the CKM matrix, and some beyond the SM theories also violate CP. So the SMEFT operators can violate CP; it's not a must. So operators can have terms that break CP, so the symmetry doesn't have to be respected. So option 3 is not a must.

What about CPT symmetry? CPT is a combination of Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. I remember that in quantum field theories, CPT symmetry is fundamental. The CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant theory must respect CPT symmetry. So if SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must automatically respect CPT. Therefore, all operators must respect CPT symmetry.

Wait, so putting this together. The symmetries that must be respected by all operators are Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Wait, but earlier I was confused about Poincare. Let me think again. Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, but is it Poincare-invariant? Well, the SMEFT is constructed with operators that are Lorentz scalars, so they transform appropriately under Lorentz transformations. But do they also have to transform appropriately under translations? Well, all operators in the SMEFT are local, meaning they are constructed from fields at the same spacetime point. But for them to form a Poincare-invariant theory, they'd have to be invariant under spacetime translations. But in practice, the operators are terms in the Lagrangian, which are constructed in such a way that the whole Lagrangian is translation invariant. So each individual operator doesn't need to be translation invariant; the sum is. So maybe the individual operators don't have to respect Poincare symmetry, only the entire Lagrangian does. Hmm, this complicates things.

Wait, but the question is about all operators respecting the symmetry. So if each operator isn't required to respect Poincare, then perhaps only Lorentz and CPT have to be respected. Because Poincare symmetry is more about the structure of the entire theory, not each operator.

Alternatively, maybe Poincare symmetry is automatically respected because the theory is built to be so. Wait, the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, which is part of Poincare. So perhaps all operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare. But I'm now getting confused.

Wait, another approach. Which of these symmetries are automatically respected by the SMEFT, based on its construction.

I know that SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. Hence, Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely a must. Also, since the CPT theorem applies to any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry (4) must be respected. Now, what about Poincare (2)?

Poincare symmetry includes not just Lorentz transformations but also translations. Do SMEFT operators need to respect translations? Well, the operators are terms in the Lagrangian, and the Lagrangian as a whole must be translation-invariant because it's the integral of the action over spacetime, and the action must be invariant. But each operator doesn't have to be translation-invariant itself, as long as the combination leads to a translation-invariant Lagrangian. For example, each operator is a local term, but when you sum them, with appropriate coefficients, the entire Lagrangian is translation-invariant. So perhaps individual operators don't have to respect Poincare symmetry, but the entire theory does. So the question is about whether all operators must respect Poincare symmetry, or only the theory as a whole.

If that's the case, then Poincare symmetry is not a symmetry that each operator must respect, but Lorentz and CPT are. Wait, but Lorentz is part of Poincare. So if the operators are Lorentz scalars, they respect Lorentz symmetry, which is part of Poincare. But I'm not sure if each operator must respect the full Poincare symmetry.

Hmm. Maybe the confusion arises because Poincare includes translations, which are global symmetries. Operators don't need to respect global symmetries; the Lagrangian as a whole must. So individual operator terms don't have to transform in any particular way under translations. Therefore, Poincare symmetry (2) is not a must for each operator, but Lorentz symmetry (1) is. Also, since CPT is a consequence of Lorentz symmetry, all operators must respect CPT (4).

So to recap:

Must be respected: Lorentz (1), CPT (4).

Poincare (2) is part of the theory's structure but individual operators don't have to respect itâ€”only the Lagrangian as a whole does.

Wait, but the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So Poincare is about the entire theory, not each operator. Therefore, operators don't need to respect Poincare, only Lorentz and CPT.

Wait, but according to the CPT theorem, any Lorentz-invariant theory must respect CPT. So in SMEFT, since all operators are Lorentz scalars, they must respect CPT. So 4 is a must.

So the symmetries that must be respected by all operators: 1 (Lorentz), 4 (CPT).

Wait, the options don't have a choice with 1 and 4. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 1,2

B) 3,4

C) 1,2,4

D) 1,3,4

Wait, so the correct answer would be those that include 1 and 4. Looking at the options, option C includes 1,2,4, which includes 1 and 4.
