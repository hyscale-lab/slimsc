Okay, so I've got this physics problem about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm, let's try to break it down.

The problem says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We're supposed to find the speed of the light relative to the observer. The options are A through D, and the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1.

Wait, but wait. I remember that in a medium like glass, the speed of light is v_medium = c/n. So normally, without any movement, the light's speed in the glass would be 1/n. But because the glass itself is moving, that must affect the observed speed somehow.

But wait, does the movement of the glass affect the speed of the light within it? Or is it more about how the observer perceives the light's speed?

I think this is a situation where we have to consider the relativistic addition of velocities. Because when objects are moving relative to each other, their velocities don't just add up linearly. Oh wait, but waitâ€”light's speed is always c in any inertial frame according to Einstein's postulates, right? But wait, that's in a vacuum. In a medium, things might be different.

Wait, no, that's a point I'm not sure about. So in a vacuum, the speed of light is c regardless of the source's motion. But when the light is in a medium, like glass, the speed is v = c/n. So how does the medium's motion affect this?

Oh, wait, maybe I should think of the glass as a frame of reference moving at velocity v relative to the lab. Then, the light's speed in the glass is v_light_glass = c/n (since n is the refractive index). But from the lab's perspective, what's the speed?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, which is towards the observer. So, in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v = c/n towards the same direction as the glass's velocity.

So from the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass, the light's speed would be the sum of the glass's speed and the light's speed in the glass, but considering relativity.

Wait, but wait. The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame.
