Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are four possible chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Alright, breaking down the information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks in IR usually correspond to O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the broadness could also be due to other things. For example, O-H in phenols or maybe an amide, but amides might have different absorption ranges. Another point is that there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. The 1700 region is typically a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring (like C=C). Hmm, but 1650 is lower than 1700, which might indicate an aromatic ring or possibly conjugated carbonyls.

Wait, but wait. The 1700 is a strong peak. So that's probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But the 1650 could be an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring?

But wait, another thought. If there's a conjugated system, like an aromatic ring attached to a carbonyl, that might cause the carbonyl peak to shift a bit. For example, in a benzophenone derivative, the carbonyl might be around 1680-1700. Alternatively, maybe an ester or ketone with conjugation.

Then, looking at the 1H NMR. It says there are several peaks, including ones corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound likely has a double bond, possibly in an aromatic ring or an isolated double bond. For example, if it's an alkene, you'd see coupling in the NMR, or maybe a triplet or something else. But since it's vinyl, maybe it's an aromatic ring, like in a benzene derivative, which would have protons in a certain region.

Wait, but wait. If the compound has an aromatic ring, then in the IR, the 1650 could be the C=C stretching of the aromatic ring. So that makes sense. So maybe the compound is an aromatic ester or something with both a carbonyl and aromatic rings.

Then, the Mass Spectrometry part. The fragment peak is at m/z=45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let's think about possible fragments. For example, CH3CO+ is 43, but maybe a fragment like (CH2)2O or something else. Wait, 45 could be a -CHO group? Because CHO has a molecular weight of 29 (12+16+1?), no wait, no. Wait, wait, let me calculate: CHO is 12 (C) +16 (O) +1 (H) = 29. So that's not 45.

Alternatively, 45 could be a fragment like C3H7O or maybe something else. Another possibility is that the fragment is (CH2)2CO, which would be (12*3) + (2*5) + 16 = 36 + 10 +16=62. No, that's not right.

Wait, what if it's a methyl ester? Like, if the compound is an ester, maybe the loss of the ester group gives a fragment. Alternatively, perhaps it's a (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. Acetone has a molecular weight of 58 (12*3 + 16*3 + 1*6? Wait no: 3 carbons: 3*12=36, 6 H:6*1=6, and 1 O:16. 36+6+16=58. Hmm, but that's the molecular ion. If it's a fragment, perhaps it's a CH2 group attached to something else. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene or something.

Wait, 45. Let me think of what compounds have a molecular weight of 45. Hmmm. Maybe (CH3)2O? No, that's 45? Let me calculate: CH3-O-CH3. Each CH3 is 15, so 15 + 15 +16 (O) = 36? No, wait: 12 + 3*1 =15 per CH3. Two CH3 groups: 15*2=30. O is 16. 30+16=46. Oh, wait, that's 46. Close, but not 45.

Another possibility: maybe the fragment is (CH2)2CHO. That would be something like a CH2CH2CHO group, but its molecular weight would be (2*12)+(4*1) +12 (C from CHO) +16 (O) +1 (H from CHO) = 24 +4 +12 +16 +1=57. No, that's not 45.

Wait, maybe it's a carbonyl group. Let's see, if the fragment is CHO (29), then maybe that's not it. Alternatively, is there a fragment that's a ketone or an aldehyde? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is 45 as a result of losing something else. For example, if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the molecular weight would be (6*12) + (10*1) + (2*16) = 72 +10 +32=114. So if the molecular ion is 114, and a fragment is at 45, that would mean losing 69 (if the molecular weight is 114). But wait, perhaps the fragment is a part of the molecule. Alternatively, maybe the 45 is a neutral loss.

Wait, 45 could be a fragment of an ester. For example, if the ester is something like CH2CH2COO-R, the fragment could lose the R group and have the remaining part.

Alternatively, 45 could be a CH2CH2CO group. Wait, CH3CH2CO has a molecular weight of 58 (3 carbons: 3*12=36, 5 H:5, O=16, so 36+5+16=57? Wait, no, wait. Let me compute CH2CH2CO: that's actually CH2CH2CO- is three carbons: 3*12=36. Then, hydrogens: each CH2 has 2 H, so two CH2 would have 4 H. CO has one O and one H (if it's like CH2CH2COH, but I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketone. For example, if we have acetone, which is (CH3)2CO, but that's 58, not 45.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the molecular formulas given.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2: molecular weight =6*12 +12*1 +2*16=72+12+32=116.

B) C6H10O: 6*12 +10 +16=72+10+16=98.

C) C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32=114.

D) C6H12O: 72 +12 +16=100.

The mass spectrum has a peak at m/z=45. So perhaps the molecule breaks into a fragment of 45. Let's see what the possible fragments would be for each formula.

Option A: 116. If the molecule breaks to produce 45, then the other part would be 71.

Option C: 114. If 45 is a fragment, the other part is 69.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecular ion is 45, but that seems unlikely because the options have higher molecular weights.

Wait, wait. Another approach: in mass spectrometry, the presence of a fragment at m/z=45 could indicate the loss of a certain group. For example, in esters, you often see the loss of the alkoxy group as an intense peak. For example, if the ester is R-O-CO-R', then the loss of R-O- would leave the CO-R' part. Let's see what that might look like.

Wait, if the molecule is an ester, it would have the formula R-O-CO-R'. The molecular ion would be the molecular weight of R-O-CO-R'. If the ester has a structure like CH3COOR', then upon cleavage, you might lose R-O- as a fragment, which would be (CH3COO-) would have a molecular weight of 59 (CH3COO- is 12*2 + 16*2 + 1*4 = 24 +32 +4=60? Wait, CH3CO
