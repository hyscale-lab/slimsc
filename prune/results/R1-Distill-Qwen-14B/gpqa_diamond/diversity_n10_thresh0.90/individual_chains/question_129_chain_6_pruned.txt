Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question is about. The question involves a reaction scheme with compounds A through E, and I need to identify what E is. There are multiple-choice options given, so I'll have to work through each step.

Starting with the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form E.

And there are two hints provided:

a) A, when reacted with a phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while E's is around 1715 cm^-1.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, the IR data. A peak around 1750 cm^-1 likely indicates a carbonyl group, probably a ketone. Because ketones typically absorb around 1700-1750. So A has a ketone. Then, E's peak is at 1715, which is a bit lower. Lower wavenumbers for carbonyls might suggest a shift, maybe due to conjugation or ring strain. Alternatively, it could still be a ketone but in a different environment. But wait, if E is formed from the elimination of an inert gas, perhaps it's a ring formation or deoxygenation?

Looking at the reaction steps:

A → B with HCN. So adding HCN—this is a nucleophilic addition, perhaps to a carbonyl group. So if A is a ketone, adding HCN would give a cyanohydrin. So B would be a cyanohydrin. The structure would have an -OH and a -CN group attached where the carbonyl was.

Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That's hydrogenation, likely of triple bonds or maybe the nitrile group. Wait, nitriles can be reduced to amines, but with H2 and Pd, maybe we're hydrogenating triple bonds or maybe the nitrile to an amine, but more likely, the triple bond is being hydrogenated. Wait, but in a cyanohydrin, the structure after adding HCN would have an adjacent -CN and -OH group. Let me think: when a ketone (A) reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin (B), which is a compound with an -OH and -CN group on adjacent carbons.

Wait, no. Wait, when a ketone (like cyclohexanone) reacts with HCN, it adds across the carbonyl group. So the product would have an -OH and -CN on the same carbon? Or adjacent carbons? Let me recall. The cyanohydrin formation: the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by an -OH and the H adds to the carbonyl carbon. Wait, no, the H adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the CN adds to the adjacent carbon. Wait, no, the H adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the CN adds to the same carbon? Or opposite?

Wait, maybe I should think about the mechanism. The ketone (A) has a carbonyl group. HCN adds to the carbonyl, with the H attaching to the carbonyl C and the CN attaching to the adjacent R group. So the product B would have a structure like R-C(OH)-CN, but wait, that can't be right because the nitrile is on the same carbon as the OH. Wait, maybe it's R-C(OH)-CH2-CN? No, wait. Let me think. Maybe I should draw it out mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition is such that the H adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the CN adds to the same carbon, making an adjacent structure. Wait, maybe I'm confusing it with another reaction. Let me think: in the cyanohydrin formation, the ketone (RCOR') reacts with HCN to form R-C(OH)-CN-R'? Or perhaps the H adds to the carbonyl C, and the CN adds to the adjacent (alpha) carbon.

Wait, no, cyanohydrin formation is a type of addition where the nitrile group adds to the carbonyl, making a new carbon-carbon bond. Oh, right, the mechanism is that the nucleophilic CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the H+ adds to the oxygen. But wait, no, because HCN is more about adding H and CN across the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product structure. For example, if A is cyclopentanone, adding HCN would give a cyanohydrin where the OH and CN are on adjacent carbons. So the structure would have an -OH on one carbon and a -CN on the next. So, B would be something like cyclopentane with two adjacent groups: OH and CN.

Then, B is subjected to hydrogenation with H2 and Pd. So that's a catalyst for hydrogenation. The nitrile group (CN) can be hydrogenated. Under hydrogenation conditions, nitriles typically get reduced to amines. So CN would become CH2NH2? Or wait, with H2 and a catalyst, perhaps the nitrile group is converted to an amine.

Wait, no, another possibility: the hydrogenation could be reducing a triple bond. But wait, the cyanohydrin doesn't have a triple bond. Oh, wait, unless the compound B has a triple bond elsewhere. Oh, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the reactions.

Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me go step by step.

First, the problem statement says that compound A reacts with HCN to form B. So, A is a ketone, as indicated by the IR peak at 1750. So, A is a cyclic ketone, perhaps.

Then, B is a cyanohydrin. That is, the product of HCN addition to a ketone. So, the structure would have an -OH and a -CN group on adjacent carbons.

Next, B is reduced with H2 and Pd. So, reducing the nitrile group. Nitriles, when reduced with H2 and a catalyst like Pd, are typically reduced to primary amines (-CH2NH2), but if there's a possibility of hydrogenation, perhaps the nitrile becomes an amine group. Or, wait, another thought: the hydrogenation could be adding hydrogen across a double bond, but in a cyanohydrin, the nitrile is a group, not a double bond. So perhaps the nitrile group is being hydrogenated to an amine.

Wait, but the product after hydrogenation is compound C. Then, C reacts with HNO2 to form D. HNO2 is nitrous acid, which is typically involved in diazotization reactions, but that's usually with aromatic amines. Alternatively, for aliphatic amines, especially primary aliphatic amines, HNO2 can lead to various products, but perhaps in this case, it's forming a diazonium salt, which then undergoes elimination.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is: B has a nitrile group. So when B is hydrogenated, the nitrile (RCN) becomes a CH2NH2 group. So then, compound C would have an amine group.

Then, compound C is treated with HNO2. Let's say if C is an amine, then HNO2 would react with it. For a primary amine, HNO2 would typically form a diazonium salt, which can then undergo decomposition upon warming or other conditions. But in this case, the reaction is in the presence of HNO2, which probably would cause the amine to form a diazonium salt, which might undergo elimination, especially if the conditions are such.

Wait, but then D is formed upon reaction with HNO2. So, perhaps the amine in C is converted into a diazonium salt, which then loses N2 (inert gas) to form a compound D, which would have a carbocation structure, perhaps leading to a ring formation, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another possibility: when HNO2 is used on a secondary amine, it can lead to the formation of an N-nitrous intermediate, but that's not common. Alternatively, perhaps the amine is primary, and upon treatment with HNO2, it forms a diazonium chloride, which then upon elimination (like heating or other conditions) would lose N2 and form a carbocation, leading to a ring contraction or expansion.

Alternatively, perhaps after the amine is formed (compound C), treatment with HNO2 leads to the formation of a nitroso compound, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the overall transformation. Let me outline the steps:

A (ketone) → B (cyanohydrin) → C (after H2/Pd, which reduces nitrile to amine) → D (after HNO2) → E (elimination of inert gas, perhaps N2).

Wait, but the elimination of an inert gas in the last step suggests that a molecule of N2 might be released. So, maybe D is a diazonium salt that loses N2 to form E.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination is of HCN or another inert gas, but the problem states it's an inert gas. So, perhaps N2 is the inert gas.

Let me think about the overall process. The steps might be leading to a ring contraction or expansion via the formation of a carbocation.

Wait, another angle: the initial compound A is a cyclic ketone. Let me think about the hints. Hint a) says that A, when reacted with a phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Phosphorous ylides are typically used in the Wittig reaction. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting an ylide with a carbonyl group. So, when A (a ketone) reacts with a ylide, it forms an alkene.

The product given is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me parse that.

The main ring is cyclopentane. At position 4, there's a substituent which is propan-2-ylidene. Propan-2-ylidene would be (CH3)2C=, so the substituent is a methylene
