Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Wait, right, parallax (plx) is the apparent shift of a star's position as seen from Earth as we orbit the Sun. The formula I think is plx in arcseconds equals 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/d, where d is distance. That means that as parallax decreases, the distance increases.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed, so their actual number density is the same throughout space. So, the number of stars shouldn't depend on how far away we look in terms of distance, but it's about how we count them with parallax.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, if I have a range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Since stars are uniformly distributed, the actual number in a spherical shell of radius d at distance d would be proportional to the surface area of the shell. Because as you move outward, each shell's volume increases, so to keep the number density same, the number of stars per shell increases with area.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, number density is stars per volume. So, if stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a volume is proportional to the volume. So, the number of stars in a thin shell (like a sphere of radius d and thickness dr) would be 4
