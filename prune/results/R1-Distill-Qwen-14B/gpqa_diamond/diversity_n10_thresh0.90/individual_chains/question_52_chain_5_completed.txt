Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

So, the problem is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots. When there are no spots, the star's effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find by what factor the ratio changes when the star is spot-free compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels depends on the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels (n1 and n2) is given by:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights (degeneracy factors) for each level, E is the energy, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, the ratio is decreasing when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature is lower. Let me think about how that affects the ratio.

The stars have spots, which are cooler regions. Wait, but the overall photospheric temperature is given as 5500 K when 40% is covered. Wait, no, the Teff is 5500 K when the surface is 40% covered. Oh wait, no, the Teff is the effective temperature, which is an average. But when spots are present, the overall emission from the star changes because spots are cooler and emit less. So the Teff is lower.

But wait, the photosphere is the star's atmosphere. When spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature is lower. So the star's photosphere is cooler now. 

So the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels depends on the temperature. Let me denote the two levels as level 1 and level 2, with E1 and E2 (assuming E2 > E1 since the ratio n1/n2 is involved). The ratio is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) )

Wait, but when the temperature decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp(...) becomes smaller. So n1/n2 would decrease if E2 > E1. Because if T decreases, (E2-E1)/(kT) increases, so the exponent becomes more negative, so the exponential term is smaller, making the ratio n1/n2 smaller.

But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T is lower (5500 K), the ratio is lower than when T is higher (6000 K). So the ratio (n1/n2) is lower at 5500 K. So when the star has no spots, the ratio is higher.

The question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes. So the factor is (n1/n2)_6000K / (n1/n2)_5500K.

Let me compute that. Let's denote the ratio as R = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

But when considering the ratio R between the two cases, the (g1/g2) factors would cancel out because they're the same in both cases. So the factor is exp( [ -ΔE/(k*T_spot) + ΔE/(k*T_clear) ] )

Wait, because when T is T_spot = 5500 K, R_spot = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T_spot) )

Similarly, R_clear = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T_clear) )

So the ratio R_clear / R_spot is exp( [ -ΔE/(k*T_spot) + ΔE/(k*T_clear) ] )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/T_clear - 1/T_spot ] )

Because it's [ (-1/T_spot) + (1/T_clear) ] = (1/T_clear - 1/T_spot)

So now I need to compute this exponential term. But I don't have the value of ΔE. Wait, the problem gives the wavelength corresponding to the transition between the two levels as approximately 1448 Å. So I can find ΔE from the wavelength of the emitted photon.

The energy of a photon is given by E = hc / λ, where h is Planck's constant, c the speed of light, and λ the wavelength.

But in the Boltzmann equation, we're looking at the energy difference between the two levels. So ΔE = hc/λ.

So let me compute ΔE in terms of temperature. Wait, but I'll need to compute it in units that can be used with the Boltzmann constant.

Let me get the constants:

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s
c = 2.99792458e8 m/s
λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m (since 1 Å = 1e-10 m)
k = 1.380649e-23 J/K

So ΔE = h c / λ = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m)

Let me compute that:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m
Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = approximately 1.373e-18 J

Wait, let me compute it more accurately:

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 m (since 1448e-10 = 1.448e-7 m)

So 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18 ≈ 1.373 * 1e-18 J

So ΔE ≈ 1.373e-18 J per photon.

But when considering energy differences in terms of thermal energy, we can express this as ΔE/(k T), which is a dimensionless quantity.

So let's compute this for both T_clear = 6000 K and T_spot =5500 K.

Compute ΔE/(k T):

At T_clear =6000 K:
ΔE/(k T) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * 6000 K) 
= (1.373e-18) / (8.28e-20)
= approximately 16.56

At T_spot=5500 K:
Same ΔE, so (1.373e-18) / (1.38e-23 *5500)
= (1.373e-18) / (7.59e-20)
≈ 18.07

Wait, wait, because when T is lower, ΔE/(k T) is higher, which makes sense because the denominator is smaller.

Wait, but in the Boltzmann factor, exp(-ΔE/(kT)) is the term. So for higher T, this exponent is less negative, making the ratio larger.

Now, the factor we're interested in is exp(ΔE/(k) [1/T_clear - 1/T_spot} )

Which is the same as exp( (ΔE/k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Let me compute 1/6000 and 1/5500:

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667
1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818

So their difference is 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151

Wait, wait, no, wait: 1/T_clear is 1/6000, and 1/T_spot is 1/5500. So [1/T_clear - 1/T_spot] is (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) )= (-500)/(33,000,000) )= -1/(66,000) ≈ -1.515e-5

Wait, no, wait, because when I subtract 1/5500 from 1/6000, I get a negative number. So the factor is exp( ΔE/(k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Which is exp( (ΔE/(k)) * [ (5500 - 6000)/(6000 *5500) ] )

So that would be exp( (ΔE/(k)) * (-500)/(33e6) )

Wait, let me compute the value inside the exponent:

(ΔE/(k)) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (ΔE/(k)) * (-500)/(33e6 )

= (ΔE/(k)) * (-500)/(3.3e7 )

I can compute this as:

(-500)/(3.3e7) ≈ -0.00001515

So the entire term is (ΔE/k) * (-0.00001515 )

But wait, I already computed ΔE/(k T) for both temperatures. Maybe a smarter way is to compute (ΔE/(k T)) for each T, then use that.

Let me compute (ΔE/(k T)) for T_clear and T_spot.

At T_clear =6000 K:

ΔE/(k T) = 16.56

At T_spot=5500 K:

ΔE/(k T) = 18.07

So for the factor R_clear / R_spot:

exp( [ (ΔE/(k T_spot)) - (ΔE/(k T_clear)) ] )

Wait, because the exponent is (ΔE/(k)) * (1/T_clear - 1/T_spot) )

Which is (ΔE/(k T_spot) ) - (ΔE/(k T_clear) )

Wait, wait, let's see:

Let me expand [1/T_clear -1/T_spot ] = [ (T_spot - T_clear) / (T_clear T_spot) ) ]

But perhaps it's easier to compute the exponent as:

(ΔE/k) * (1/T_clear - 1/T_spot) ) = (ΔE/(k T_clear )) - (ΔE/(k T_spot )) )

Which is (16.56) - (18.07) )= -1.51

So the exponent is -1.51

So the factor is exp(-1.51) ≈ ?

Wait, but wait, no.

Wait, no, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check.

The factor R_clear / R_spot is exp( [ (ΔE/(k T_spot)) - (ΔE/(k T_clear)) ] )

Because [1/T_clear - 1/T_spot] = (T_spot - T_clear)/(T_clear T_spot )

So (ΔE/k) [1/T_clear - 1/T_spot] = (ΔE/(k T_clear )) - (ΔE/(k T_spot) )

Which is 16.56 -18.07 = -1.51

So the exponent is -1.51, so exp(-1.51) ≈ ?

Exp(-1.51) is approximately 0.221.

So R_clear / R_spot = 0.221, which is about a factor of 4.53, because 1/0.221 ≈4.53.

Wait, wait, wait no. Because R_clear is the ratio when T is 6000, and R_spot is the ratio when T is 5500.

We are to find the factor by which the ratio changes when the star is clear compared to when it has spots. So the factor is R_clear / R_spot = exp( -1.51 ) ≈ 0.221. So the ratio is 0.221 times when the star has spots. So the factor is about 0.221, which is a decrease. But the question says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which is consistent.

Wait, but the question asks for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So the ratio when clear divided by when spot is 0.221, which is a factor of about 0.22, meaning the ratio is 0.22 times as much when clear compared to when spotted. So the ratio drops by a factor of ~4.5 when there are spots.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify: R_clear is higher than R_spot. So R_clear is the ratio when the star is clear, which is higher than R_spot (when there are spots).

So the factor is R_clear / R_spot = exp( -1.51 ) ≈ 0.221. That means R_clear is 0.221 times R_spot. Wait, that can't be right because 0.221 is less than 1. So if R_clear is lower than R_spot, that's contradictory because earlier I thought R_clear is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, let's go back. The exponent is:

exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T_clear - 1/T_spot) )

Wait, 1/T_clear is 1/6000, 1/T_spot is 1/5500. So 1/T_clear - 1/T_spot = (5500 -6000)/(5500*6000) )= (-500)/(33,000,000) = -5e2/(3.3e7 )= -0.00001515.

So the exponent is (ΔE/k) * (-0.00001515 )

But ΔE/(k) is (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = approximately 9950 K.

Wait, let me compute ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k)= (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) ≈ 9950 K.

So now the exponent is (9950 K) * (-0.00001515 ) ≈ -0.1505.

So exp(-0.1505) ≈ 0.861.

So the factor R_clear / R_spot = 0.861. So approximately 0.86, which is a factor of about 1.16.

Hmm, that's different from the previous calculation. Where did I go wrong before?

Ah, I think I made a mistake in the earlier approach by considering ΔE/(k T) for each temperature. Let me redo the calculation.

Alternative approach: compute (ΔE/(k T)) for each T.

At T_clear =6000 K: (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K *6000 K) )= 1.373e-18 / (8.28e-20) ≈ 16.56

At T_spot =5500 K: (1.373e-18) / (1.38e-23 *5500) )= 1.373e-18 / (7.59e-20)≈18.07.

The exponent in the ratio R_clear/R_spot is (ΔE/k) (1/T_clear - 1/T_spot) )

Which is (ΔE/k) [ 1/6000 - 1/5500 ]

Which is (ΔE/k) * ( (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) )) = (ΔE/k) * (-500)/(33,000,000 )

Wait, 6000 *5500 =33,000,000.

So (ΔE/k) is 9950 K.

So 9950 K * (-500)/(33e6) )= (9950 * -500 ) / (3.3e7 )

Calculate numerator: 9950 *500=4,975,000. So with the negative sign: -4,975,000.

Divide by 3.3e7 (33,000,000):

-4,975,000 /33,000,000 ≈ -0.1507.

So exponent is -0.1507.

exp(-0.1507)= approx 0.861.

So R_clear/R_spot = 0.861. So the ratio is 0.861 times as much when clear as when spotted. So the factor is about 0.86, which is a decrease of about 15%.

But wait, the options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

Hmm, none of these match 0.86. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the reciprocal. Because when the star has spots, the ratio decreases, so the ratio when clear is higher than when spotted. So the factor is R_clear / R_spot, which is greater than 1. But according to this calculation, it's about 0.86, which is less than 1, which would mean R_clear is less than R_spot, which contradicts the problem statement.

Ah, here's the mistake. The ratio n1/n2 when the star has spots is lower. So R_spot = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T_spot) )

R_clear = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T_clear) )

So R_clear/R_spot = exp( ( -ΔE/(k T_clear) ) + ( ΔE/(k T_spot) ) )

= exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T_spot - 1/T_clear) )

Because:

R_clear/R_spot = [exp( -ΔE/(k T_clear) ) ] / [exp( -ΔE/(k T_spot) ) ]

= exp( -ΔE/(k T_clear) + ΔE/(k T_spot) )

= exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T_spot - 1/T_clear) )

So the exponent is (ΔE/k) (1/T_spot - 1/T_clear )

Which is (ΔE/k) [ (1/5500 ) - (1/6000 ) ]

Which is (ΔE/k) [ (6000 -5500 )/(5500 *6000) ) ]

= (ΔE/k) (500)/(33e6 )

So 500/(33e6 )= 5e2/(3.3e7 )= 5/(330) ≈0.01515.

So the exponent is (ΔE/k ) * 0.01515.

Earlier, I calculated ΔE/k as approximately 9950 K.

So 9950 * 0.01515 ≈ 151.3 K.

Wait, no, wait: 9950 *0.01515 = let me compute it.

0.01515 is approximately 0.015.

So 9950 *0.015 = 149.25.

So exponent is 149.25, so exp(149.25) is a huge number, which can't be right.

Wait, that can't be correct because the ratio can't be that high. So I must have messed up the calculation somewhere.

Wait, let's compute ΔE/(k) correctly.

ΔE = h c / λ.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ =1448 Å =1448e-10 m.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10 )

= (1.9878e-25 ) / (1448e-10 )

= 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448 ) * 1e-18 = 1.373 *1e-18 J.

So ΔE is 1.373e-18 J.

k =1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) )= 1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.373 /1.38 ) *1e5.

≈ 0.995 *1e5 =99,500 K.

Wait, earlier I thought it was 9950 K. Oh! I missed a factor of 10. So correct value is 99,500 K.

So ΔE/(k) is approximately 99,500 K.

So now, the exponent is (99500 K) * (500)/(33e6 )

Wait, 500/(33e6) = 500/(3.3e7 )= 5/(33e5) )= approximately 1.515e-5.

So 99500 * 1.515e-5≈ 1.507.

So exponent is approximately 1.507.

So exp(1.507) is about 4.5.

Because exp(1.5) is about 4.48, so 1.507 is about 4.5.

So R_clear/R_spot = exp(1.507) ≈4.5.

So the factor is approximately 4.5. Thus, the ratio when the star has no spots is about 4.5 times higher than when it has spots. So the factor is 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star is clear (no spots) compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the two levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The ratio of the populations depends on the temperature \( T \), and the problem specifies that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, consistent with the lower temperature in the spotted case.

The wavelength of the transition corresponds to \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \), so the energy difference \( \Delta E \) is calculated using:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

The Boltzmann constant is \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), so:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99,500 \, \text{K}.
\]

The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\frac{R_{\text{clear}}}{R_{\text{spot}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spot}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{clear}}}\right)\right),
\]

where \( T_{\text{clear}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \). Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{spot}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{clear}}} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 0.00001515.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spot}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{clear}}}\right) = (99,500)(0.00001515) \approx 1.507.
\]

Finally, the factor is:

\[
\frac{R_{\text{clear}}}{R_{\text{spot}}} = \exp(1.507) \approx 4.5.
\]

This means the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in the two energy levels is approximately 4.5 times higher when the star is clear compared to when it has spots. 

ANSWER: C
