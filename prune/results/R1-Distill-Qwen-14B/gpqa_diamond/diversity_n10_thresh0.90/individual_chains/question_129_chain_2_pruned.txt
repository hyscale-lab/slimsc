Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question involves a series of reactions starting from compound A and going through several steps to form compound E. I need to figure out what E is based on the reactions and the hints provided.

First, let's break down the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (probably nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints given are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) IR spectrum of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is at 1715 cm^-1. 

The options are A, B, C, D, each a different cyclic ketone.

Hmm, okay. Let's start with compound A. The IR peak at 1750 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group, probably a ketone. So A is likely a ketone. 

Looking at hint a), when A reacts with a phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, what's a phosphorous ylide used for? Ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes by reacting with ylides. So the product of the Wittig reaction between A and the ylide is that cyclopentane compound.

So, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw this structure. The cyclopentane ring has substituents. At positions 1 and 2, there are methyl groups. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a CH2-C(CH3)= group attached via the double bond. So the structure is a cyclopentane ring with methyl groups at 1 and 2, and at 4, a group that's like a propenyl substituent.

Wait, no. The propan-2-ylidene group is actually a methylene group with a propyl substituent. So it's like (CH2C(CH3)2)– but I'm not exactly getting it. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be =C(CH2CH3)CH3? Or maybe =CH(CH2CH3)? No, wait. Propan-2-yl is (CH3)2CH–. So propan-2-ylidene would be =C(CH3)2? Because ylidene groups are double-bonded. So the substituent at position 4 is a double bond attached to a cyclopentane ring, and the substituent on that double bond is two methyl groups, maybe.

So, the product of the Wittig reaction is this cyclopentane structure. Since the Wittig reaction adds an alkene, the starting material A must have been a carbonyl group that, when reacted with the ylide, forms that alkene.

Wait, the Wittig reaction replaces the carbonyl oxygen with the R2P=CH– group. So in the reaction, the carbonyl (A) reacts with the ylide (R2P=CH–R') to form an alkene R'CH=CH–R and triphenylphosphine oxide.

So, in the product, there's a new double bond. So the structure has a double bond where the carbonyl was. So in the product, the ring has a substituent that's a double bond connected to a propan-2-ylidene group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure of compound A is a cyclopentanone. Because when A (a ketone) reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin (compound B). Then, when B is reduced with H2 and Pd, it forms compound C. Then, compound C reacts with HNO2 to form D, and D loses an inert gas to form E.

Wait, let's think step by step.

Reaction 1: A + HCN → B. A is a ketone, so this is a cyanohydrin formation. The cyanohydrin adds a hydroxyl group and a cyanide to the carbonyl carbon. So B would have an alcohol and a nitrile group adjacent.

Reaction 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. Pd is usually a catalyst for hydrogenation. So the nitrile group (CN) would be reduced to an amine (CH2NH2?), but wait, no. Wait, the reduction of a nitrile typically gives an amine. Wait, no. Wait, nitriles are reduced to amines under certain conditions (like LiAlH4), but hydrogenation with Pd might reduce nitriles to alkanes. Wait, no. Let me think: H2 with Pd would typically reduce triple bonds to single bonds. Nitriles (C≡N) are usually hydrogenated to amines (CH2NH2) under high pressure, but I'm not so sure. Alternatively, could it be that the nitrile becomes an amine? Or perhaps the nitrile is hydrogenated into a methylene group.

Wait, another thought. Let me think of the structure of B. B is the cyanohydrin of A. So if A is a cyclopentanone, say 4-methylcyclopentanone, then the cyanohydrin would add a CN and an OH group on the same carbon. So the structure would be a cyclopentanol with a cyanide group attached to the same carbon as the OH.

When B is reduced with H2 and Pd, perhaps the nitrile group is reduced. Nitriles can be hydrogenated to amines. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile becomes an amine group, but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is converted into an amine, which upon elimination would form something else.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the other steps.

Reaction 3: Compound C reacts with HNO2. HNO2 is nitrous acid, which is typically used for diazotization of aromatic amines or for the formation of alkenes via the Cope elimination. Wait, but in aliphatic amines, nitrous acid can lead to different reactions, like the formation of an oxime or the formation of an imine. Alternatively, in the presence of heat, it might lead to elimination.

Alternatively, compound C could be a secondary amine. Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let's go back.

Wait, perhaps compound C is a secondary alcohol. Because if B is a cyanohydrin (with OH and CN), then reducing B with H2 and Pd could reduce the nitrile group to a primary amine (CH2NH2). But that doesn't make much sense because the hydrogenation of a nitrile typically gives a primary amine, RCH2NH2. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is hydrogenated to an amine which is then deaminated to form an alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is hydrogenated all the way to a methyl group. Wait, nitriles can be hydrogenated to amines, but under high pressure with catalysts, maybe they go further. Or perhaps the nitrile is converted to an amine, which upon treatment with HNO2, forms a diazonium salt, which then eliminates to form an alkene.

Hmm, perhaps the sequence is as follows:

A is a ketone → B is the cyanohydrin (so adds OH and CN to the same carbon) → C is the product of reducing B. Let's think: B has a structure where the ketone carbon becomes a CH(OH)CN group. When B is hydrogenated, maybe the nitrile group (CN) is reduced to CH2NH2. So C would have a CH(OH
