Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located in the qubit space. Let me break it down.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. For pure states, the density matrix is a projector, but for mixed states, it's a statistical mixture.

Wait, so what does this ρ look like in terms of qubit states? Let me write it out in matrix form. The basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ correspond to the computational basis, right? So |0⟩ is [1; 0] and |1⟩ is [0; 1]. The matrix for |0⟩⟨0| would be a diagonal matrix with 1 and 0. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is diagonal with 0 and 1.

So when I add |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|, I get a 2x2 matrix with 1s on the diagonal. Multiplying by 1/2, the density matrix ρ becomes [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. Oh, that's the identity matrix scaled by 0.5. So ρ = (I)/2, where I is the 2x2 identity matrix.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position of this density matrix in the qubits space. I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation. Because for a single qubit, any state can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere.

Wait, but the Bloch sphere is for pure states. How does that apply to mixed states? Oh right, for mixed states, the density matrix can be represented as a point in the Bloch sphere as well, but it's the expectation values that matter. The general form for a qubit density matrix is (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. Here, r is the Bloch vector.

So let me write the given ρ in that form. The given ρ is [ [0.5, 0], [0, 0.5] ]. Let's see, I is [ [1,0],[0,1] ], so if I subtract I, I get [ [-1,0], [0,-1] ] multiplied by 0.5, which gives [ [-0.5,0], [0,-0.5] ].

Wait, no, wait a second. The general form is (I + r·σ)/2. Let me compute this.

The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So, r·σ is rx σx + ry σy + rz σz.

So (I + r·σ)/2 would be (1/2) * [ [1 + rz
