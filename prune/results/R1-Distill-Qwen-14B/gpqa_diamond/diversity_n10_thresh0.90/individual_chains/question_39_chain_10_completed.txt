Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that's under the same conditions. The particle moves along the x-axis in a tube. The wave function for each is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. When they measured the position of the particles, none were found at x < 1 or x > 3. So the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3.

The question is asking for the numerical value of "a". The options are A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

Hmm. I remember that the wave function must satisfy certain conditions. Like, the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. Also, the wave function should be normalizable, which means the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function over all space should equal 1.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That seems a bit odd. Because typically, the wave functions are complex, but they have a specific form. Let me think about the form here.

Oh wait, the wave function is a complex number. So the general form is ψ(x) = R(x) e^{iθ(x)}, where R is the magnitude (real) and θ is the phase. But in this case, the wave function is written as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So that's a complex number where the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5.

Wait, but if the wave function is like that, then the probability density is |ψ(x)|^2, which is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2, because when you square a complex number, you get the sum of squares of the real and imaginary parts. Wait, no. Wait, let me think again.

The absolute square is |ψ|^2 = (Re ψ)^2 + (Im ψ)^2. So for ψ = A + Bi, it's A² + B². So in this case, ψ is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5)i. So Re(ψ) = a/sqrt(1+x), Im(ψ) = -0.5. So |ψ|^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

Wait, but then the integral of |ψ|² from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1 because the total probability is 1.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Wait, but that feels a bit strange because the wave function usually has a specific form, especially in bound states. But given the problem, that's the setup.

So let's set up the integral:

∫ (from 1 to3) [ (a²)/(1 + x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me break this into two integrals:

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 plus integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3 equals 1.

Compute each part.

First integral: a² * ∫ 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to 3:

[ln(4) - ln(2)] = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So first integral is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 * (3 -1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the equation becomes:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides:

a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Calculate ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7209.

Then a is sqrt(0.7209) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait a minute. The wave function given is (a/sqrt(1 +x)) - 0.5i. Is this the correct form for a wave function? Because usually, the wave function would have a real and imaginary part, but in this case, the imaginary part is a constant, -0.5i. That's a bit unusual because in many cases, the imaginary part varies with x.

Wait, but perhaps the wave function is given as a sum of two terms, one varying with x and the other a constant. But wouldn't that complicate the normalization? Because the integral includes a term that's a constant, which leads to a term proportional to the interval length.

Wait, but in our calculation, we did include that. So perhaps the approach is correct. But let me double-check the calculations.

Yes, the integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 is a² * ln(2), and the integral of 0.25 is 0.5. So the equation is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1. So a² ln(2) = 0.5, a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.72. So a ≈ sqrt(0.72) ≈ 0.8485, which is about 0.85. So option B.

I think that's correct.


To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function, which states that the total probability of finding the particle in the allowed region (between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \)) must equal 1. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1 + x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1 + x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two separate integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1 + x} \, dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 1
\]

### First Integral:
\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1 + x} \, dx = \ln(1 + x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
\]

Thus, the first term becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2)
\]

### Second Integral:
\[
0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

### Combining Results:
\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Subtracting \( 0.5 \) from both sides:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7209
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7209} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
