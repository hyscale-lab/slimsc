Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, we can't just use classical mechanics; we have to use special relativity. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed here probably refers to the speed of one astronaut as observed from the other's frame of reference. Because in relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. Oh right, Einstein's velocity addition formula is needed here. Or wait, is it the relative speed as in the speed of one relative to the other when considering their frames? I think that's right.

First, let me tackle the relative speed. Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame, what's the speed of B? Or the other way around? Wait, the problem says "relative speed", which is a bit ambiguous. But typically, the relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is the difference of their speeds, but relativistically, it's not that simple.

Wait, no. The correct way is to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is: u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²), where u is the velocity of one object in the other's frame. So if A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c in the same direction, from A's frame, what's B's speed?

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. Let me denote the frame where both are moving in the positive x-direction. So, say, in the lab frame, A is moving at v = 0.6c, and B is moving at u = 0.5c. But wait, that can't be right because if they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed isn't just 0.1c. Oh no, wait, no. Because in relativity, you can't just subtract velocities normally. So the formula is needed.

Wait, wait a second. Let me clarify the setup. Are both astronauts moving in the same direction? The question says they're moving in the positive x-direction, so yes. So, if I'm an astronaut on A, what is the speed of B according to me?

So the velocity of B in the lab frame is 0.5c, and the velocity of A is 0.6c. To find the velocity of B as seen from A's frame, we apply the velocity addition formula.

Wait, let me think about it: the velocity u' (of B) in A's frame is given by (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c² ), where v is the velocity of A relative to the lab frame. So u is B's velocity in the lab frame, which is 0.5c, and v is A's velocity, 0.6c.

So plugging in: u' = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c² ) = (-0.1c)/(1 - (0.3 c²)/c² ) = (-0.1c)/(1-0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.142857 c.

Wait, but speed is a positive quantity, so the relative speed is 0.142857 c. So approximately 0.14c, which is about 0.142c. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Wait, but the relative speed is just the magnitude, so 0.14c. So that's our first part.

Now for the total energy of the system. The total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for astronaut A: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c.

Gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c² ) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E_A = gamma_A * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c.

Gamma_B = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2 ) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25 ) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

So E_B = gamma_B * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.4641 m c².

Total energy E_total = E_A + E_B ≈ 2.5 + 3.4641 ≈ 5.9641 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option B says E=4.96... and v=0.1c, which doesn't match our calculations. Option D has E=5mc², which is close but not exact.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculations. Did I compute gamma correctly for both?

Gamma for A: 0.6c. So 1 - (0.6)^2 = 0.64. Square root is 0.8. So 1/0.8 is 1.25. That's correct.

Gamma for B: 0.5c. So 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. Square root is about 0.8660. So 1/0.8660 is approximately 1.1547. Correct.

So E_A = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5, correct.

E_B = 1.1547 *3m c² ≈ 3.464, yes.

Sum is about 5.964 m c². So the closest option is option C: E=5.96 mc².

So the relative speed is 0.14c, and the total energy is 5.96 mc². So the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of one astronaut as observed from the other's frame of reference is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \(u = 0.5c\) (velocity of astronaut B in the lab frame),
- \(v = 0.6c\) (velocity of astronaut A in the lab frame).

Substituting the values:

\[
u' = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1429c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the relative speed is the magnitude, so:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut A
- Mass: \(2m\),
- Velocity: \(0.6c\).

\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_A = \gamma_A \cdot 2m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut B
- Mass: \(3m\),
- Velocity: \(0.5c\).

\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_B = \gamma_B \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B \approx 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \approx 5.9641m c^2
\]

### Conclusion
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:
