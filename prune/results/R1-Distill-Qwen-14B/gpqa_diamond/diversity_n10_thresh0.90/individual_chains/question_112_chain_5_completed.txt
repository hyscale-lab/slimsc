Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is a bit involved, so I'll tackle it step by step.

First, the problem states that the state of the electron is |alpha>, which is proportional to (1 + i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. And |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I remember that spin states are usually represented as two-level systems, so |up> and |down> form an orthonormal basis.

Wait, the state is proportional, which means it's not normalized yet. I'll need to normalize it. The normalization factor is 1 over the square root of the sum of the squares of the coefficients. So the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). Let me calculate the sum of their magnitudes squared.

The magnitude squared of (1+i) is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. For (2-i), it's (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 +1=5. So the total is 2 + 5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the next part is about measuring the eigenstates of an operator with a given matrix A. The matrix elements A_ij are hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, for a 2x2 matrix, that would mean A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. Oh right, because when i≠j, A_ij is hbar/2, else zero. So the matrix is [[0, ½ ħ],[½ ħ,0]].

I've heard that such a matrix corresponds to the spin-x operator multiplied by ħ/2. Wait, no, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. Those eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because the eigenstates of X are the symmetric and antisymmetric states.

Wait, so when we measure the operator A, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of A would be the same as for the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The eigenvalues of X are +1 and -1, so the eigenvalues of A are (ħ/2)(+1) = ħ/2 and (ħ/2)(-1) = -ħ/2. So the possible results are ± ħ/2.

But the question is about the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate. Wait, no, the question says, "the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator." Oh wait, eigenstates, so we need to find the projection of |alpha> onto each eigenstate of A.

So let me denote the eigenstates of A as |+x> and |−x>. Where |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2). I think that's correct.

The probability to get each eigenstate is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between |alpha> and the eigenstate. So I need to compute |< +x | alpha >|² and |< -x | alpha >|².

Alternatively, I can express |alpha> in the x-basis and find the expansion coefficients. Let me try that approach.

First, let me express |alpha> in terms of |up> and |down>. From earlier, |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, let me write |alpha> as a vector in the z-basis:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 −i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

The x-basis states are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2).

So I can express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x> by finding the coefficients c_+ and c_- such that:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |−x>.

Let me write this out:

c_+ = < +x | alpha > = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2 −i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ]

Because |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so when you take the inner product with |alpha>, each term in |alpha> is multiplied by 1/sqrt(2).

So c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2−i) ] / ( sqrt(7)*sqrt(2) )

Simplify numerator:

(1+i + 2 -i) = 3. So c_+ = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Wait, sqrt(7)*sqrt(2) is sqrt(14).

Wait, let me recalculate:

(1+i) + (2 - i) = 1 + i + 2 -i = 3 + 0i = 3.

So c_+ = 3 / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, c_- is < -x | alpha >.

|−x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), so:

c_- = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) - (2 −i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ]

= [ (1 + i) - (2 - i) ] / (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2))

= (1 + i - 2 + i ) / sqrt(14)

= (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)

Wait, let me compute (1+i) minus (2-i):

1 + i -2 +i = (1-2) + (i +i) = (-1) + (2i) = -1 + 2i.

So c_- = (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14).

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|² and |c_-|².

Compute |c_+|²: |3/sqrt(14)|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857, which is approximately 0.64. Hmm, looking at the options, option A's first number is 0.64, and option D is 0.61. Wait, 9/14 is exactly 0.642857..., so approximately 0.643. So if one of the options has 0.64, that's possible. But let's compute the other.

|c_-|² = | (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14) |².

The magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + 2^2 ) / 14 = (1 +4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, but 5/14 is about 0.357, so the probabilities are approximately 0.6429 and 0.3571.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which fit. But let's check the other options.

Wait, but wait: wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, the initial state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, all over sqrt(7).

So when I compute c_+, it's (1+i + 2 -i) / sqrt(7)*sqrt(2) = 3/(sqrt(14)), which is correct.

So |c_+|² = (9)/(14) ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, |c_-|² is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) / 14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.357143.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36. So the probabilities are about 0.64 and 0.36.

But wait, let's check the other part of the question: the average value of the operator A.

The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is a matrix, perhaps it's easier to compute this expectation value.

But given that A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, I can compute the expectation value as (1/2) <sigma_x>, where sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix.

Another approach: the expectation value <A> is equal to (alpha | A | alpha).

A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. So let me write |alpha> as a column vector in the z basis: the components are (1+i)/sqrt(7) and (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

So the vector is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So compute <alpha| A |alpha>:

= [ (1+i)/sqrt(7)*, (2 -i)/sqrt(7)* ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute it as the sum over the elements. Let me write down the matrix A and perform the multiplication.

Alternatively, perhaps using properties of Pauli matrices.

Wait, since A = (ħ/2) * sigma_x, then <A> = (ħ/2) <sigma_x>.

The expectation value of sigma_x for a state |psi> is given by:

<sigma_x> = (psi| sigma_x |psi).

And sigma_x in terms of |up> and |down> is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the expectation value is psi_up * psi_down* + psi_down * psi_up*.

Wait, because sigma_x swaps |up> and |down>, so the expectation is <up| sigma_x |psi> * <psi | down> + <down| sigma_x |psi> * <psi | up>?

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let me write |psi> as a column vector [a; b], where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), and b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Then sigma_x is the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], so sigma_x |psi> is [b; a]. So the inner product <psi | sigma_x | psi> is a* b + b* a.

So:

<sigma_x> = a* b + b* a.

So let's compute a and b.

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7)

b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

a* = (1 -i)/sqrt(7)

b* = (2 +i)/sqrt(7)

So a* b = (1 -i)(2 -i) / 7

Compute numerator: (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2.

i^2 is -1. So 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Similarly, b* a = (2 +i)(1 +i) /7.

Multiply numerator: 2*1 + 2i +i*1 +i^2 = 2 +2i +i -1 = (2-1) +3i = 1 +3i.

So a* b + b* a = (1 -3i + 1 +3i)/7 = (2)/7.

So <sigma_x> = 2/7.

Thus, <A> = (ħ/2) * (2/7) ) = ħ/7.

So the expectation value is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says the average is hbar/7. So option A's average is correct.

Wait, but let me check the probabilities again. The options in A are 0.64 and 0.36, which are 9/14 ≈0.642857 and 5/14≈0.3571. So 0.64 is 9/14 (since 9/14=0.642857...), and 5/14 is approximately 0.357.

Wait, but option A says 0.64 and 0.36. So 0.36 is 9/25, which is 0.36, but 5/14 is about 0.357, which is close to 0.36.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357, and the average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.

Yes, that matches.

Wait, but let me look at the other options. For example, option D says 0.61. Oh, but 9/14 is about 0.643, which is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places.

So the correct option seems to be A.


The problem involves an electron in the state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, where |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The state is normalized by dividing by the square root of the sum of the magnitudes squared of the coefficients, yielding |alpha> = [(1+i)/√7] |up> + [(2-i)/√7] |down>.

The operator in question has a matrix representation A where A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. This corresponds to the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2. The eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix, which are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/√2 and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/√2, with eigenvalues ±ħ/2.

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A, the state |alpha> is expressed in the x-basis. The coefficients of |+x> and |−x> are calculated as:

- c_+ = ⟨+x|alpha⟩ = [(1+i) + (2-i)] / √14 = 3/√14
- c_- = ⟨−x|alpha⟩ = [(1+i) − (2-i)] / √14 = (-1 + 2i)/√14

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

- |c_+|² = (3/√14)² = 9/14 ≈ 0.643
- |c_-|² = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357

Thus, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

The average value of the operator A is calculated as ⟨A⟩ = ⟨alpha|A|alpha⟩. Using the fact that A = (ħ/2)σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix, the expectation value of σ_x for |alpha> is computed as:

⟨sigma_x⟩ = a* b + b* a,

where a = (1+i)/√7 and b = (2-i)/√7. Substituting these values:

- a* = (1-i)/√7, b* = (2+i)/√7
- a* b = (1-i)(2-i)/7 = (1-3i)/7
- b* a = (2+i)(1+i)/7 = (1+3i)/7

Thus, ⟨sigma_x⟩ = (1-3i + 1+3i)/7 = 2/7. Therefore, ⟨A⟩ = (ħ/2)(2/7) = ħ/7.

From the given options, the probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, along with the average value ħ/7, match option A.
