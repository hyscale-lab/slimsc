Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, I need to figure out which of the options are correct. Let me break it down.

The question lists four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincaré, CP, and CPT. The options are combinations of these. I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory, so it includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the Standard Model's symmetries. But wait, what's the deal with each of these symmetries?

Starting with Lorentz Symmetry. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory because the Standard Model is Lorentz-invariant. So any operator in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. That makes sense because without it, the theory wouldn't be consistent with special relativity and the principles of how particles interact at high energies.

Next, Poincaré symmetry. The Poincaré group includes Lorentz transformations and translations. Since SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant effective theory, it should also respect Poincaré symmetry. Wait, wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because in an effective theory, the Poincaré symmetry might already be included in the framework, so all operators would have to obey it. So I think 1 and 2 are both required.

Then there's CP symmetry. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. I remember that the Standard Model isn't CP-symmetric because of processes like CP violation in the strong force. But does SMEFT require operators to conserve CP? Well, SMEFT itself doesn't necessarily have to conserve CP because the SM already includes CP violation. So operators in SMEFT might not need to respect CP symmetry. So 3 might not be a must.

Lastly, CPT symmetry. CPT is Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. I think the Standard Model is CPT-symmetric because all observed processes respect it. Since SMEFT is an extension of the SM, it must also respect CPT symmetry, right? Because any operator that violates CPT would lead to serious issues, like acausal behavior or non-unitarity. So I think 4, CPT symmetry, must be respected.

So putting it together, which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect? Lorentz (1) and Poincaré (2) are yes. CPT (4) is yes. CP (3) is no. So the operator must respect 1, 2, and 4.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4. So the answer should be C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework that extends the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators consistent with its symmetries. To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT, we analyze the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant because it is built as an effective theory of the Standard Model, which respects Lorentz symmetry. Any operator in SMEFT must therefore preserve Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: The Poincaré group includes Lorentz transformations and translations. Since SMEFT is already Lorentz-invariant and built within the framework of the Standard Model, it naturally respects Poincaré symmetry as well.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model, and by extension SMEFT, is not required to respect CP symmetry. CP violation is observed in the Standard Model, and SMEFT allows for operators that violate CP. Therefore, CP symmetry does not need to be preserved.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The Standard Model is CPT-symmetric, and SMEFT, as an effective theory, must also respect CPT symmetry. Violating CPT symmetry would lead to serious physical inconsistencies, such as acausality or non-unitarity.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not required.

**Answer: C**
