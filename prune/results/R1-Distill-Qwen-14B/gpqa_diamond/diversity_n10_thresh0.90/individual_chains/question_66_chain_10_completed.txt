Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT, and the symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, I remember from my studies that SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible interactions that can occur at a certain energy scale, higher than the electroweak scale. These interactions are organized into operators of increasing dimension.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry.

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetry? Oh right, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, like the whole set of symmetries in Minkowski spacetime. But wait, in SMEFT, when you write operators, they're usually local, so they must respect the symmetry of the spacetime. So any operator you add must be a Lorentz scalar because the theory is Lorentz invariant. So Lorentz symmetry must be a must.

Poincare symmetry includes translations. Well, the operators in SMEFT are built from the fields of the Standard Model, which already respect Lorentz symmetry. But do they have to respect Poincare? Well, since the SM fields are local, the operators would need to be invariant under spacetime translations, which they are because they're built from local field operators. But I'm not entirely sure if Poincare symmetry is a separate condition or just a part of the overall framework. Hmm, but wait, the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's supposed to be valid in a certain approximation, but I think the operators are required to form a Lorentz-invariant theory. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely required.

Now, what about CP and CPT symmetries? I remember that the SM is CP symmetric (except for the CKM CP violation, but the theory itself respects CP). So in SMEFT, if you add operators, they should come in CP even or odd pairs to maintain CP symmetry. But wait, no, I think only certain operators are allowed. Or wait, maybe not all operators must respect CP. Because the SMEFT can include operators that break CP if the theory isn't CP symmetric, but wait, in the SM, the vacuum can have a CP phase, but the theory is CP invariant.

Wait, no, the Standard Model is CP symmetric. So in SMEFT, operators must be CP even or, if there's a CP violation, they can come as combinations. But wait, maybe the operators are not required to respect CP symmetry. Because you can have operators that break CP. But in the SM, it's CP symmetric, so the effective theory should preserve that. So I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, but the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So operators in SMEFT must be built in a way that the entire theory remains consistent. So Lorentz symmetry is a must because it's part of the framework. Poincare symmetry? Since Lorentz includes the rotations and boosts, and Poincare adds the translations. But operators are local, so they should respect Poincare. Or maybe it's automatically included.

Wait, but in the SMEFT, the operators are constructed as local operators, so they must be scalars under the Poincare group, right? Wait, no, Poincare includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. So any operator must be a scalar under Poincare. But wait, in practice, in the SMEFT, the operators are written as Lorentz scalars built from SM fields. So do operators have to respect Poincare symmetry? Or is it automatically satisfied because the fields transform in a way that the operators are Poincare scalars?

Wait, Lorentz symmetry is a spacetime symmetry, and Poincare is that plus translations. So when you construct the operators, they must be invariant under Lorentz transformations and translations. But because the fields already transform under Lorentz, the operators are constructed to be Lorentz scalars. So I think the operators automatically respect Poincare if they're built as Lorentz scalars. So maybe Poincare isn't a separate symmetry that the operators must respect, but Lorentz is a necessary condition. Or wait, the question says which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the operators are already built to be Poincare scalars, then Poincare symmetry is automatically respected, so both 1 and 2 are correct.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think again. Poincare includes translations, so the Lagrangian must be invariant under spacetime translations, leading to conservation of energy and momentum. But the operators in SMEFT are part of the Lagrangian, so they should respect all symmetries of the Lagrangian. So the Lagrangian has to respect Poincare. Thus, the operators must also respect that. So 2 is correct.

But wait, the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, which implies it's Poincare-invariant. But maybe the question is whether the operators themselves must respect Poincare. Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around: the theory as a whole must respect Poincare, so all operators must be Poincare scalars, which they are because they're built from fields that transform in a way that the operators are scalars.

Wait, perhaps Lorentz symmetry is a subset of Poincare. So if operators respect Lorentz symmetry, they automatically respect Poincare if they also respect translations. But operators are local, so they're invariant under translations. So maybe the operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. But then why are both 1 and 2 in the options? The options say 1 and 2 (A) is an option, and C includes 1,2,4.

Wait, but wait. Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. So if an operator respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz as well. So if all operators respect Lorentz, they might not necessarily respect Poincare, but in reality, the operators are built to be Poincare scalars. So maybe both 1 and 2 are correct. So the options would be A (1 and 2) or C (1,2,4). But the question is which must be respected by all operators.

Wait, another angle: What is the fundamental symmetry that the operators must respect? The SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so operators must be Lorentz scalars. Poincare includes translations, which operators would respect because they're local. So 1 and 2 are both necessary? Or perhaps Poincare is a given because the operators are local, so 1 and 2 are both correct. So that would point to either A or C.

But let's think about other symmetries. CP symmetry is a combination of charge conjugation and parity. The SM is CP invariant, so the SMEFT must preserve CP symmetry. Or does it? Wait, no. I think that the SMEFT can include operators that break CP. Because the effective theory can include terms that violate CP, but in the SM, the theory is CP symmetric. So the SMEFT operators can include terms that break CP, but perhaps only in certain cases. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the SMEFT is an effective theory that must match with the SM at low energies. Since the SM respects CP (except for possible CKM violation, but the theory itself is CP symmetric), the SMEFT operators must be arranged in a way that doesn't introduce CP violation beyond what's present in the SM. So if the operator itself violates CP, then the theory as a whole would have new CP violation, which might not be present in the SM. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So I'm thinking that operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry. For example, they can include terms that violate CP, leading to new physics beyond the SM.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Another point: the SMEFT is built in a way that it's a valid effective theory, which must be renormalizable or at least power-counting renormalizable. So the operators must form a renormalizable theory. But how does that relate to symmetries? Maybe the operators must form a Lorentz-invariant theory, which implies Lorentz symmetry, but CP and CPT may or may not be respected.

Wait, but the SM respects CPT symmetry. So in the SMEFT, the operators must be such that the overall theory respects CPT. Because the SM does, and the SMEFT is an extension that must preserve all the symmetries of the SM. So CPT must be respected. But wait, do the operators individually need to respect CPT, or the entire theory?

I think the entire theory must respect CPT, but individual operators may not. For example, an operator that violates CPT would make the theory non-unitary, which is not allowed. So the theory must respect CPT, meaning that all operators must be such that the combination in the Lagrangian is CPT invariant. But the individual operators don't have to respect CPT on their own, as long as when combined, the entire Lagrangian is CPT symmetric.

But the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. So if an operator by itself doesn't violate CPT, but when combined with others they form a CPT invariant theory, then individual operators might not have to respect CPT. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps all operators must be CPT invariant. Because if an operator isn't, then when you take the hermitian conjugate, it would mess up the theory's unitarity. So I think operators in the SMEFT must be CPT invariant. Because the theory must respect CPT, so each operator must be CPT invariant. Because otherwise, their inclusion would break CPT symmetry, leading to non-unitarity.

So, putting this all together: operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (so 1 is correct). Poincare, which includes Lorentz and translations, operators must also respect it because they are local. So 1 and 2 are correct.

CP symmetry: Do operators have to respect it? Since the SM is CP symmetric, but SMEFT can include new physics beyond the SM, which might violate CP. For example, the Weinberg operator is a dimension-6 operator that's CP even. But if there's a CP-odd operator, that would allow for new CP violation. But does the theory as a whole have to respect CP? The SM is CP invariant, but the SMEFT can include terms that violate CP, so individual operators don't have to respect CP. So 3 is not necessarily a must.

CPT symmetry: Operators must respect it because the SM does, and the SMEFT must be a valid extension. So 4 is correct.

So in the options:

1) Lorentz Symmetry: yes.

2) Poincare: yes.

3) CP: no.

4) CPT: yes.

So which options include 1,2,4? Let's see the options:

A) 1,2 → correct on these but miss 4.

C) 1,2,4 → yes.

So the correct answer would be 1,2,4, which is option C.


To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the symmetries in question:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, meaning all operators must be Lorentz scalars. This is a fundamental requirement for the theory to be consistent with spacetime symmetries. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since the operators in SMEFT are local and respect Lorentz symmetry, they automatically respect translations as well. Thus, Poincaré symmetry is also a requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model (SM) is CP symmetric, but SMEFT can include operators that violate CP symmetry. For example, dimension-6 operators can introduce new CP violation, which is allowed in SMEFT as it extends the SM. Therefore, CP symmetry does not need to be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM respects CPT symmetry, and SMEFT must preserve this symmetry as well. If operators violated CPT symmetry, the theory would become non-unitary, which is not allowed. Hence, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are **Lorentz symmetry (1)**, **Poincaré symmetry (2)**, and **CPT symmetry (4)**. CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily required.

The correct answer is **C) 1, 2, 4**.
