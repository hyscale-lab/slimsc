Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me see... I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, so first, the operator P is probably the angular momentum operator, right? Because in quantum mechanics, the angular momentum components are usually represented by L_x, L_y, L_z, but here it's called P. Oh well, same idea.

The direction n is in the x-z plane, so the angle theta is measured from the z-axis. Since it's arbitrary, the eigenvector should be along that direction. But wait, for the angular momentum operator, the eigenvectors are the eigenstates of L_z, which are the |l, m> states. Oh wait, but here the operator is given in terms of components, and the direction is arbitrary, so maybe we need to construct the operator along n and find its eigenvectors.

Wait, no. Another approach: The operator for the component along a direction n is P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), I think, wait wait, no: Let me get the coordinate system right. In spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and phi is the azimuthal. So a vector in the x-z plane would have phi = 0, so n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that? Wait, no. Wait, no, the unit vector in the x-z plane would have direction (n_x, 0, n_z). Because the y-component is zero.

So n_x² + n_z² =1, since it's a unit vector. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, maybe? Or the other way around. Wait, in standard spherical coordinates, the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis, so n_x would be r sinθ cosφ, but since φ is zero, cosφ is 1, so n_x is r sinθ. But since it's a unit vector, r is 1, so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

Wait, but wait, in standard, the unit vector is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). So if phi is zero, the vector is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So yes, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So the operator P along n is P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Given that P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], and P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]].

Let's compute P_n. So P_n = (sinθ)*(ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + (cosθ)*(ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]].

Let me compute this matrix. Let me factor out ħ/2 first.

So P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix inside:

sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] is:

[[0, sinθ],
 [sinθ, 0]]

cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] is:

[[cosθ, 0],
 [0, -cosθ]]

Adding them together:

[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So P_n is (ħ/2) times this matrix. So the matrix is:

[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So the operator P_n is (ħ/2) times this matrix. Now, we need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, because the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So we set up the equation:

P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Wait, no. The eigenvalue equation is (P_n - (ħ/2) I) |ψ> = 0.

So let's write the matrix of (P_n - (ħ/2) I):

Each element is (matrix element) - (ħ/2) * delta_ij.

So the matrix becomes:

[ cosθ - (ħ/2)(1) / (ħ/2) ? Wait, no. Wait, P_n is (ħ/2) * matrix, so (P_n - (ħ/2) I) is (ħ/2) (matrix) - (ħ/2) I.

So factor out (ħ/2):

(ħ/2)(matrix - I), where matrix is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Wait, matrix is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]], so matrix - I is [[cosθ -1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1]]

So the matrix for (P_n - (ħ/2) I) is (ħ/2) times [[cosθ -1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1]]

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to write the eigenvalue equation as:

( P_n - (ħ/2) I ) |ψ> = 0.

So |ψ> is a 2-element vector [a, b]^T.

So the equation is:

[ [ (ħ/2)(cosθ) - (ħ/2) , (ħ/2) sinθ ]   [a]   = [0]
  [ (ħ/2) sinθ, (ħ/2)(-cosθ -1 ) ] ] [b]     [0]

Wait, no. Let me write it correctly.

Wait, more accurately, the matrix for P_n is:

(ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So when we subtract (ħ/2) I, each diagonal element is (ħ/2) (element) - (ħ/2) (1 for diagonal). So the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2)[ [cosθ -1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1] ]

So the system of equations is:

( (cosθ -1) a + sinθ * b ) * (ħ/2) = 0
( sinθ * a + (-cosθ -1) b ) * (ħ/2) = 0

But since ħ/2 isn't zero, we can ignore it for the equations.

So:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0  ---> equation 1
sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0  ---> equation 2

We can write equation 1 as:

(cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b
=> a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ - 1) ] b

Hmm, let me compute - sinθ / (cosθ -1 ). Let's factor the denominator: cosθ -1 = -(1 - cosθ) = - (2 sin²(theta/2)).

And sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So substituting:

a = [ - (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) / ( - 2 sin²(theta/2) ) ] b
Simplify numerator and denominator:

The negatives cancel. So:

a = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] / [ 2 sin²(theta/2) ) ] b
= [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b
= cot(theta/2) b

So a = cot(theta/2) b.

So the eigenvector can be written as [a, b]^T = [cot(theta/2) b, b]^T = b [cot(theta/2), 1]^T.

We can choose b =1 for simplicity, but the eigenvectors are determined up to a scalar multiple.

Wait, but let's check equation 2 to see if it holds.

Equation 2: sinθ a + (-cosθ -1 ) b = 0.

Substitute a = cot(theta/2) b.

So:

sinθ * cot(theta/2) b + (-cosθ -1) b = 0.

Factor out b:

[ sinθ cot(theta/2) + (-cosθ -1) ] b = 0.

Because b is not zero (it's an eigenvector), the expression in brackets must be zero.

Compute sinθ cot(theta/2). Let's note that cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2).

And sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So:

sinθ cot(theta/2) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] * [cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] 
= 2 cos²(theta/2).

So the expression becomes:

2 cos²(theta/2) + (-cosθ -1) = ?

Now, cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2) -1.

So substituting:

2 cos²(theta/2) - (2 cos²(theta/2) -1) -1.

Expand:

2 cos²(theta/2) -2 cos²(theta/2) +1 -1 = 0.

Yes, it equals zero. So equation 2 is satisfied.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [cot(theta/2), 1]^T.

But we need to normalize it.

So the vector is [a, 1]^T, where a = cot(theta/2).

The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |1|^2 = 1.

Wait, since the problem is in quantum mechanics, the eigenvector must be normalized.

So |a|² + |b|² =1.

But a is cot(theta/2), and b is 1.

So |a|² + |b|² = cot²(theta/2) + 1 = csc²(theta/2) = 1/sin²(theta/2).

So the normalization factor is sqrt( sin²(theta/2) ) = sin(theta/2), assuming theta/2 is between 0 and pi/2, which it is since theta is between 0 and pi (as it's a polar angle in the x-z plane).

So the normalized eigenvector is:

[ a, 1 ]^T * sin(theta/2) = [ cot(theta/2) sin(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Simplify each component:

cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)

So first component:

cot(theta/2)* sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)

Second component: sin(theta/2)

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure.

Wait, the eigenvector is [a, 1], and we have to multiply by the normalization factor, which is sin(theta/2). So:

a becomes [cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) ] = cos(theta/2).

b becomes [1 * sin(theta/2) ] = sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But wait, looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but that's a two-component vector.

Wait, but the options might have some scaling factors. Let me check the options again.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). So it's a vector with these components.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)). Hmm, includes hbar and some sqrt factors.

Wait, but the eigenvector components are unitless (or in terms of quantum states, they're dimensionless, as they're vectors in Hilbert space). So hbar shouldn't be part of the vector components. So options A and D include hbar, which seems odd because eigenvectors are just vectors, like [a, b]^T, with a and b being dimensionless.

Wait, let me look again. The options are:

A) (sqrt(2/3) hbar, sqrt(1/3) hbar)
B) (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin theta)
C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))
D) (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(
