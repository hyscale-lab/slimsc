Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think. So, the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2 in a specific energy level. And the energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of particles in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor, right? The probability of a particle being in a higher energy state is lower if the temperature is lower, because the exponential term becomes smaller.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where n_i and n_j are the number densities, g are the statistical weights, E the energies, k the Boltzmann constant, and T the temperature.

In this case, the question says the excitation is twice as much for star_1 compared to star_2. So I think that means n_1/n_2 = 2. Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of their populations. Let me clarify. The problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So the excitation level for that energy level is higher in star_1. That would imply that the population n1 (for that level) is higher compared to star_2's n2. So n1/n2 = 2.

Wait, but wait, let me think. The energy difference is ΔE = E_i - E_j. But for the Boltzmann factor, it's E_i minus E_j, but if E_i is higher, then the ratio n_i/n_j depends on that.

Assuming that the ground state is E_j and the excited is E_i, so the energy difference is ΔE = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J.

So the ratio n1/n2 = 2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, no. Let me correct that. Wait, actually, the Boltzmann equation for each star would be:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

But in this problem, the energy levels are the same for both stars, so g1/g2 is the same for both. So for star_1, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star_2, n2'/n2'' = same g ratio * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, but the problem states that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So perhaps the ratio of n1 (excited state) to n2 (ground state) is twice as much as the same ratio in star_2.

So, let me define for star_1: n1_1 = 2 * n1_2, where n1_2 is the
