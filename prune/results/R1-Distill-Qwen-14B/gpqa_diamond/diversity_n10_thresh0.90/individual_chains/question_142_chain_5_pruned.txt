Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me the density matrix ρ as 1/2 times (|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. So, this ρ is a density matrix for a qubit, right?

I think the density matrix for a pure state |ψ><ψ| would have all the information about that state. But this ρ looks like it's a mixture of the states |0> and |1>, each with a coefficient of 1/2. Oh wait, because when you expand ρ, it's (|0><0| + |1><1|) all multiplied by 1/2. So each term has a coefficient of 1/2.

Wait, so |0><0| is a projector, which is a matrix with 1 in the (0,0) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has a 1 in the (1,1) position. So adding them together, the matrix would have 1s on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere. Then multiplying by 1/2 would give a matrix with 1/2 on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere.

Wait, let me write that out. The |0><0| matrix is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], then multiply by 1/2: [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So the density matrix ρ is a diagonal matrix with 0.5 on both diagonal elements.

Now, what's the geometrical position of this matrix in qubit space? Hmm. I remember that the space of qubit density matrices is a 3-dimensional space since a 2x2 density matrix has four entries, but due to the constraints (trace 1, positive semidefinite, Hermitian), it's a 3D space. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a representation of this space, where each point represents a possible state of the qubit.

The Bloch vector (r) for a qubit density matrix is related to the off-diagonal elements. The general form of a density matrix is [[a, b], [c, d]], but since it's Hermitian, c is the conjugate of b. The trace is a + d = 1. The density matrix can also be written using the Bloch vector components.

The Bloch vector r = (x, y, z) is defined such that the density matrix can be represented as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. Let's see: I is the identity matrix, so I/2 is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. Then r·σ would be x*σ_x + y*σ_y + z*σ_z. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when we take (I + r·σ)/2, the diagonal elements are (I has 0.5 on diagonals) plus (r_z * σ_z)/2. Because σ_z is diagonal, its contribution is (r_z *1)/2 on the diagonal.

Wait, let me write this out. The (I + r·σ)/2 matrix would be:

First, I/2 is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Then, r·σ is x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z. So each term:

x σ_x = [[0, x], [x, 0]]

y σ_y = [[0, -i y], [i y, 0]]

z σ_z = [[z, 0], [0, -z]]

So adding those together: [[z, x - i y], [x + i y, -z]]. Then
