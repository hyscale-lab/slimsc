Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because these types of questions can get a bit tricky. Let's take it step by step. The question is about the stability constants of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes and determining the percentage of a specific blue complex.

Alright, let's parse the problem. We have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are for the complexes up to the fourth one: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I assume is the Co(SCN)_2 complex, maybe the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ species. Or wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands, so that would probably be the second complex, Co(SCN)_2^2+.

Wait, but the problem says "dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." So each has a certain number of SCN- ligands. The first complex would have one, the second two, etc. But wait, the options are for the percentage of the blue ones. I remember that the different complexes of Co(II) have different colors. The blue one is the [Co(SCN)_4]^3− complex. Or was it another? Hmm. Wait, the problem says "dithiocyanato," which might mean two SCN ligands. But I'm a bit shaky on that. Alternatively, maybe each complex has a different number of ligands. Let me think. The stability constants are for the complexes: [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+), [Co(SCN)_3]^+, and [Co(SCN)_4]^3−. So beta1 is for the first complex, beta2 for the second, beta3 for the third, beta4 for the fourth.

Wait, but the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I thought that [Co(SCN)_4]^3− is the blue one, which is the fourth complex, so that would be the one with four SCN- ligands. But wait, the question says dithiocyanato, which means two SCN- ions. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the blue one is the [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) complex. Or maybe it's the [Co(SCN)_4]^3−, which is a different color. I'm not exactly sure, but I'll proceed.

Wait, in the problem statement, they're asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato implies two SCN- groups, so that would be the [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) complex, which is the second complex, with stability constant β2=40. So the question is about the percentage of Co in the [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) form.

Wait, but wait, what's the color of each complex? I remember that [Co(SCN)_4]^3− is a blue complex. So if the problem refers to the blue complex, that's the fourth one, [Co(SCN)_4]^3−, which would have four SCN- ligands, hence the stability constant β4=16. So the problem is asking for the percentage of the [Co(SCN)_4]^3− species.

Wait, but the question says "dithiocyanato," which I initially thought meant two SCN- ligands. Hmm, maybe that's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps "dithiocyanato" refers to two SCN in the complex, but perhaps the term is used differently. I'm a bit confused about that. Let me think again.

Wait, the term "dithiocyanato" might refer to a complex with two SCN ligands. So the [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) complex is the dithiocyanato one. But I'm not entirely certain. Maybe I should proceed with the calculations regardless and see.

So, the problem is about the distribution of Co species in solution, given the total Co concentration and the concentration of SCN-. The solution is a mixture of all possible Co-SCN complexes.

The total Co concentration is given as 0.01 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (log β) are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, no, stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, etc. Are these in terms of the formation of the complexes? So, for each complex, the stability constant is the product of the formation steps.

Wait, the general approach for these problems is to calculate the fraction of each complex and then sum them up to get the desired percentage.

The total concentration of cobalt is given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M. This includes all species: free Co^2+, [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+), [Co(SCN)_3]^+, [Co(SCN)_4]^3−.

Wait, but the problem says "the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species." So perhaps "dithiocyanato" refers to the complex with two SCN- ligands, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+). But if the blue complex is the [Co(SCN)_4]^3−, which has four ligands, then I need to be careful.

Wait, perhaps I should figure out which complex is blue. I think [Co(SCN)_4]^3− is the blue one, which is the fourth complex, so with four SCN ligands. But the question says dithiocyanato, which might mean two SCN, so perhaps the problem is about the [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) complex. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Maybe I should proceed, assuming that the problem is asking for the [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) complex, which would correspond to β2=40.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the [Co(SCN)_4]^3− complex, which has β4=16. I'm a bit stuck. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can proceed by considering all possible species and then calculate their concentrations relative to each other.

The general approach for these problems is to use the stability constants and the concentrations to find the fraction of each species.

The species are:

1. Co^2+ (free ion)
2. [Co(SCN)]^+ 
3. [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+)
4. [Co(SCN)_3]^+
5. [Co(SCN)_4]^3−

Wait, but the problem only gives four stability constants, up to [Co(SCN)_4]^3−. So all five species are present, but the problem is about which fraction is the largest.

Wait, but the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species: [Co^2+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) + [Co(SCN)_3]^+ + [Co(SCN)_4]^3− = 0.01 M.

Wait, but the formation of each complex is given by the stepwise formation constants. For example, β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+ from Co^2+ and SCN−. Then β2 is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) from [CoSCN]^+ and another SCN−, and so on.

Wait, actually, stability constants are for each complex, but they can be defined in a cumulative way. For example, β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+ from Co^2+ and SCN−.

Then, β2 is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) from [CoSCN]^+ and an additional SCN−. Similarly, β3 is the formation of [Co(SCN)_3]^+ from [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) and another SCN−. And β4 is the formation of [Co(SCN)_4]^3− from [Co(SCN)_3]^+ and another SCN−.

Wait, but in that case, the overall formation constants for each complex would be the product of the stepwise constants up to that point. For example, the overall β for [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) would be β1 * β2, and for [Co(SCN)_3]^+, it would be β1 * β2 * β3, and for [Co(SCN)_4]^3−, it would be β1*β2*β3*β4.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again. The overall stability constant K for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^m is the product of the stepwise formation constants up to n ligands. So for [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+), the overall β would be β1 * β2.

Similarly, for [Co(SCN)_3]^+, β_total = β1 * β2 * β3.

And for [Co(SCN)_4]^3−, β_total = β1 * β2 * β3 * β4.

But wait, the given values are β1, β2, β3, β4 as 9,40,63,16. So let's correct the approach.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is that β1 is for the first complex, [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is for the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+), and so on. That is, each βn is the overall formation constant for the nth complex, not the stepwise. But that's a different approach.

Wait, the problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So perhaps β1 is the overall stability constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is the overall for [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+), etc. So that each βn is the total for the nth complex.

But that's a different approach. Which one is correct?

Ah, the problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes," which suggests that each βn is the overall formation constant for the nth complex. So β1 is the stability constant for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+), etc.

Wait, but then the stepwise formation would be different. Because the stepwise constant for adding a ligand would be the ratio of the overall constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the given β's are the stepwise formation constants. That is, β1 is the formation of [CoSCN]^+ from Co^2+ and SCN−, β2 is the formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) from [CoSCN]^+ and SCN−, and so on.

But I'm a bit confused because the way the problem presents the β's could affect the calculation.

I think the correct approach is to model each complex's concentration based on the overall stability constants. So each complex's concentration is determined by the overall β and the concentrations of the ions.

Wait, but perhaps the problem uses the stepwise formation constants. Let me think again.

If I proceed with the stepwise approach, the overall formation constant for each complex is the product of the stepwise β's up to that point.

So, for example, the overall β for [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) is β1 * β2. Similarly, β for [Co(SCN)_3]^+ is β1 * β2 * β3, and for [Co(SCN)_4]^3−, β1 * β2 * β3 * β4.

Given the values: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So:

β_total for [CoSCN]^+ is 9.

β_total for [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) is 9 *40=360.

β_total for [Co(SCN)_3]^+ is 9 *40 *63 = 9*40=360; 360*63=22680.

β_total for [Co(SCN)_4]^3− is 9*40*63*16=22680 *16=362,880.

Wait, that seems like a big jump. Now, with these overall β values, the concentrations of each complex can be determined based on the total Co concentration and the [SCN-] concentration.

Wait, but the problem gives [SCN-] as 0.1 M. So with that, I can compute the fraction of each complex.

The general formula for each complex's concentration is:

[Co(SCN)_n] = βn * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^n / (1 + sum over all species' terms)

Wait, but the total Co concentration is the sum of all the Co species. So, [Co^2+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) + [Co(SCN)_3]^+ + [Co(SCN)_4]^3− = 0.01 M.

But to compute these, I can model each species as:

For each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^m:

[Co(SCN)_n] = βn * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^n / (denominator)

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the distribution using the formation constants.

Alternatively, considering the distribution of the complexes, the fraction of each complex can be found by:

f_n = (βn * [SCN-]^n) / (sum over all k of βk * [SCN-]^k )

But wait, this is accurate only if all species are considered and the free Co^2+ is accounted for. Hmm, perhaps not exactly, because each β includes the free Co^2+.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to write the distribution of each species as:

f_n = (βn [SCN-]^n ) / ( [Co^2+] + sum_{k=1 to 4} (βk [SCN-]^k) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact approach. Let me think again.

An alternative approach is to let x be the concentration of free Co^2+. Then, the concentrations of each complex can be expressed in terms of x and [SCN-].

So:

[Co^2+] = x

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN-]

[Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) = β2 * [CoSCN]^+ * [SCN-] = β1 β2 x [SCN-]^2

Wait, no, because if β2 is the stepwise constant, then [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) = β2 * [CoSCN]^+ * [SCN-] = β2 * (β1 x [SCN-]) * [SCN-] = β1 β2 x [SCN-]^2.

Similarly,

[Co(SCN)_3]^+ = β3 * [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) * [SCN-] = β1 β2 β3 x [SCN-]^3.

[Co(SCN)_4]^3− = β4 * [Co(SCN)_3]^+ * [SCN-] = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN-]^4.

So, each complex is built step by step. Now, the total Co concentration is the sum of all these plus the free Co^2+.

So,

x + β1 x [S] + β1 β2 x [S]^2 + β1 β2 β3 x [S]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 x [S]^4 = c_Co = 1e-2 M,

where [S] is [SCN-] = 0.1 M.

Plugging in the numbers:

x [ 1 + β1 [S] + β1 β2 [S]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4 ] = 1e-2.

Given that β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16, and [S]=0.1.

Let me compute each term:

Term 1: 1

Term2: β1 [S] =9 *0.1=0.9

Term3: β1 β2 [S]^2 =9 *40*(0.1)^2= 360 *0.01=3.6

Term4: β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 =9*40*63*(0.1)^3= 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 * (0.001) =22.68.

Term5: β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4 =9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4.

Compute numerator: 9 *40=360; 360 *63=22680; 22680 *16=362880.

Denominator: (0.1)^4=1e-4.

So term5 =362880 * 1e-4=36.288.

So sum all terms:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

+3.6=5.5

+22.68=28.18

+36.288=64.468.

So the sum is approx 64.468.

So,

x * 64.468 = 1e-2 → x = (1e-2)/64.468 ≈ 0.0001551 M.

Wait, that's [Co^2+] = x ≈ 1.551e-4 M.

Now, the concentration of each complex can be found.

For [CoSCN]^+:

= β1 x [S] =9 * 1.551e-4 * 0.1 =9 * 1.551e-5 ≈ 1.396e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)_2]^(2+):

= β1 β2 x [S]^2 =9*40 * 1.551e-4 * (0.1)^2.

Compute:

9*40=360.

1.551e-4 * 0.01=1.551e-6.

So 360 * 1.551e-6 ≈ 5.5836e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)_3]^+:

=β1 β2 β3 x [S]^3.

9*40*63= 9*40=360; 360*63=22680.

x [S]^3 =1.551e-4 * (0.1)^3=1.551e-4 * 1e-3=1.551e-7.

So,

22680 * 1.551e-7 ≈ 22680 * 1.551e-7 ≈ 3.513e-3 M.

Wait, let me compute that properly:

22680 * 1.551e-7 = (22680) * (1.551 *1e-7) )

22680 ≈2.268e4.

2.268e4 * 1.551e-7 = (2.268 * 1.551) * 1e-3 ≈ 3.514 * 1e-3 = approx 0.003514 M.

[Co(SCN)_4]^3−:

=β1 β2 β3 β4 x [S]^4.

β1 β2 β3 β4 =9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16=362880.

x [S]^4 =1.551e-4 * (0.1)^4 =1.551e-4 *1e-4=1.551e-8.

So,

362880 *1.551e-8 = (362880) * (1.551e-8) = approximately?

Well, 362880 ≈3.6288e5.

3.6288e5 * 1.551e-8 = (3.6288 *1.551) * 1e-3.

3.6288 *1.551 ≈ 5.626.

So 5.626e-3 = 0.005626 M.

Now, let me list all the species:

Co^2+ : 1.551e-4 M → 0.0001551 M

[CoSCN]^+ :1.396e-4 → 0.0001396 M

[Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) :5.5836e-4 → 0.00055836 M

[Co(SCN)_3]^+ :0.003514 M

[Co(SCN)_4]^3− : 0.005626 M

Wait, let me check if the sum is 0.01 M.

Adding all:

0.0001551 + 0.0001396 = 0.0002947.

+0.00055836 → 0.00085306.

+0.003514 →0.00436706.

+0.005626 →0.010 (approx 0.01), which matches the total Co concentration given. So that's correct.

Now, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. So, which species is that?

If "dithiocyanato" means two SCN ligands, then it's [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+). But if the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^3−, which is the fourth complex, then that's the one we're looking for.

Wait, but looking at the concentrations:

[Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) is 0.00055836 M, which is 0.0558% of the total.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the total Co is 0.01 M, and each species is a fraction of that.

Wait, no, the sum of all the species is 0.01 M. So each species's fraction is their concentration divided by 0.01.

So, for each species:

Co^2+ → 0.0001551 / 0.01 = 1.551% 

[CoSCN]^+ →0.0001396 /0.01=1.396%

[Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) →0.00055836/0.01=5.5836%

[Co(SCN)_3]^+ →0.003514/0.01=35.14%

[Co(SCN)_4]^3− →0.005626/0.01=56.26%

Wait, that's a big percentage for the fourth complex. But the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. If the blue one is [Co(SCN)_4]^3−, which is 56.26%, but that's not one of the options. The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Hmm, but if the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+), its fraction is 5.58%, which isn't in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach because I used the stepwise β's as the overall formation constants. Let me reevaluate the initial assumption.

Wait, because the given β's are the stability constants for the complexes, perhaps each β represents the overall formation constant for that complex, not the stepwise. That changes things.

So if β1 is the overall stability constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+), etc., then the approach is different.

In that case, the concentration of each complex is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = βn * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^n / ( 1 + sum_{k=1 to 4} βk [SCN-]^k )

But wait, this would require knowing all species, but the free Co^2+ is part of the denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps the total concentration is:

c_Co = [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1 to4} [Co(SCN)_n]

Each [Co(SCN)_n] = (βn [SCN-]^n [Co^2+]) / (1 + sum_{m=1 to4} βm [SCN-]^m )

Wait, but that sounds complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should model it with the overall formation constants.

Given that [Co(SCN)_n] = (βn [Co^2+] [SCN-]^n ) / (1 + sum (βm [SCN-]^m )) )

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

The correct way to model this is using the stability constants as the overall constants for each complex. So, for each n, [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+] [SCN-]^n / D, where D is the sum of βm [SCN-]^m for m=0 to 4. Wait, but [Co^2+] is m=0, which would have β0=1.

So, D = 1 + β1 [S] + β2 [S]^2 + β3 [S]^3 + β4 [S]^4.

But then, [Co^2+] = (x) = (D * [Co^2+])? Wait, perhaps I should let [Co^2+] = x, then:

Each [Co(SCN)_n] = (βn x [S]^n ) / D.

And the total Co concentration is x + sum_{n=1 to4} (βn x [S]^n ) / D ) = 0.01 M.

Which simplifies to x * (1/D + sum(βn [S]^n / D )) ) = x ( (D + sum(βn [S]^n )) ) / D ) ) = x * ( (D + sum(βn [S]^n )) ) / D ) ) = x ( (sum_{m=0}^4 βm [S]^m ) ) / D ) ) = x ( D ) / D ) = x = 0.01 M.

Wait, that can't be right because that would imply x=0.01 M, which would mean [Co^2+]=0.01 and all other species are zero, which can't be the case. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

I think I'm getting confused because I'm mixing up the stepwise and overall formation constants. Let me try a different approach.

Alternative approach: Let's model the fraction of each complex based on their overall stability constants and the concentration of SCN−.

The fraction f_n of each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^m is given by:

f_n = (βn [SCN-]^n ) / ( 1 + sum_{k=1}^4 βk [SCN-]^k )

Wait, but then the free Co^2+ is accounted for in the denominator as 1.

Wait, that's a possible approach. Let me compute the denominator.

Denominator D = 1 + β1 [S] + β2 [S]^2 + β3 [S]^3 + β4 [S]^4.

Given that β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16; [S]=0.1.

So compute each term:

1 → 1.

β1 [S] =9*0.1=0.9.

β2 [S]^2 =40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

β3 [S]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063.

β4 [S]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

Now sum all terms:

1 +0.9 =1.9.

+0.4=2.3.

+0.063=2.363.

+0.0016=2.3646.

So D=2.3646.

Now, the fractions are:

f1 = (β1 [S] ) / D → (0.9) / 2.3646 ≈ 0.3806 → 38.06%.

f2 = (β2 [S]^2 ) / D → (0.4) / 2.3646 ≈ 0.1689 → 16.89%.

f3 = (β3 [S]^3 ) / D → 0.063 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.0266 → 2.66%.

f4= (β4 [S]^4 ) / D → 0.0016 /2.3646 ≈0.000676 → 0.0676%.

Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of f1 + f2 +f3 +f4 is 38.06 +16.89 +2.66 +0.0676 ≈ 57.67%, but the free Co^2+ would have a fraction of 1/D =1/2.3646 ≈42.34%, which would sum to 100% (42.34 +57.67 ≈100%).

Ah, so the fractions are:

Free Co^2+: 42.34%.

[CoSCN]^+ :38.06%.

[Co(SCN)_2]^(2+):16.89%.

[Co(SCN)_3]^+ :2.66%.

[Co(SCN)_4]^3−:0.0676%.

But the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. If the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^3−, its fraction is about 0.0676%, which is negligible and not matching any options. But the options are much higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SC
