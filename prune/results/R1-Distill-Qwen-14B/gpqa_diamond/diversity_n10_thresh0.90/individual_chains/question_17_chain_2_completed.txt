Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think about how to approach it. The question says the solution contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds to Ca²+ ions. The problem gives me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, so I probably don't have to worry about other factors affecting EDTA's protonation states or anything like that. 

Wait, what's the setup here? The Ca-EDTA complex is in solution, so that's the complex itself. The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. The formation constant K is given, which is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. So K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). 

But wait, the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. So the complex is 0.02 M, which is the concentration of the CaEDTA^2- complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and I need to find [Ca²+]. 

Assuming that the EDTA is in excess? No, wait, no, because the problem says it's stoichiometric. Hmm, stoichiometric usually refers to the molar ratio, so probably the solution is prepared with a 1:1 ratio of Ca²+ and EDTA. But when they form the complex, it's all tied up. So when the complex dissociates, the [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] come from that dissociation. 

Wait, since the complex is 0.02 M, and the reaction is 1:1:1 (1 Ca, 1 EDTA forms 1 complex), the total concentration of all species (free Ca²+, free EDTA^4-, and complex) should add up to 0.02 M? No, wait, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so the sum of [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] would be 0.02 M minus the concentration of the complex? Or maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let me think. The solution is just the complex, which is 0.02 M. So in solution, the complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are zero, and as the complex dissociates, they form. 

So in the dissociation, each mole of complex gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-. So the concentration of Ca²+ will be x, and EDTA^4- will be x, and the complex will be 0.02 - x. But for very strong complexes (since K is 5e10, which is a huge number), x should be very small compared to 0.02. So, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So we can approximate.

So the K expression is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10. 

Substituting the concentrations: 5e10 ≈ (0.02) / (x * x) → 5e10 ≈ 0.02 / x². 

So solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-12 / 5e10? Wait, wait, 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12, which is 4e-13. So x² = 4e-13 → x ≈ sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2*3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7 M. Wait, that's one of the options. Let me check the options.

Option C is 6.3e-7 M. That seems to fit. 

Wait, but let me double-check. So x = sqrt( (0.02) / (5e10) ) → 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5)*1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is approximately 6.32e-7. Yep, that's correct. 

So the [Ca²+] is approximately 6.3e-7 M. So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The equilibrium constant expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Since the solution is stoichiometric and the pH is ideal, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Let the concentration of free calcium ions be \( x \). At equilibrium, the concentration of free EDTA ions will also be \( x \), and the concentration of the complex will be approximately \( 0.02 - x \). Given that \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \) is very large (\( 5 \times 10^{10} \)), \( x \) will be very small compared to 0.02, so we approximate \( 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \).

Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \approx \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

\[
5 \times 10^{10} \approx \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
