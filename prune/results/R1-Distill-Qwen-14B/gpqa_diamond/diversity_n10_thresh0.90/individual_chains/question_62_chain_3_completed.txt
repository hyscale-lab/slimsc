Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question asks for the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I'll try to visualize the structure of the target molecule. The main chain seems to be a cyclohexane ring. Attached to it is a carbonyl group (since it's a carbaldehyde), which is an aldehyde. Also, there's a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is then attached to the cyclohexane ring. So, the structure might look like a cyclohexane ring with a CH(OH-cyclohexyl)CH2CHO group or something similar.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynyl means a triple bond attached to the cyclohexane. So, it's cyclohexane with an -C≡CH group.

I need to figure out the reactions that will transform ethynylcyclohexane into the target compound. Let me think about the possible steps.

The target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane, which itself is attached to another cyclohexane. The aldehyde group suggests some kind of oxidation or perhaps a keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, maybe the process involves adding a substituent to the ethynyl group. Ethynyl groups can be functionalized in various ways. One common approach is using Sonogashira coupling, but I don't see that in the options. Alternatively, maybe using some kind of metallation.

Looking at the options, all of them start with NaNH2 and some chloride. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. Methyl chloride is a methylating agent. So the first step in many options is deprotonation followed by alkylation.

Ethyynylcyclohexane has acidic protons on the sp-hybridized carbon. So treating it with a strong base like NaNH2 would deprotonate it, forming a cyclohexenide with a negative charge on the carbon. Then, when methyl chloride is added, it would alkylate that carbon. Wait, but wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a terminal alkyne. Deprotonating it with a base like NaNH2 would give a lithium acetylide? Or maybe a sodium acetylide, but NaNH2 in ammonia would deprotonate it to form an acetylide.

Wait, no. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, and ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne. So when treated with NaNH2, it would deprotonate to form a cyclohexenide (with a -) and then react with methyl chloride as an alkylating agent. So the triple bond would become a CH2 group. So after step 1, the ethynyl group (-C≡CH) would become -C(CH3)2? Wait, no. If you deprotonate the ethynyl group and then treat with CH3Cl, you'd add a methyl group to the acetylide. So, the product would be CH2CH2C(CH3)–Cyclohexane? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2CH2-C≡CH. No, wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, no. No, the ethynyl group is directly attached to the cyclohexane. So it's cyclohexane-C≡CH.

So when NaNH2 is added, it deprotonates the sp carbon to form a cyclohexenide acetylide: cyclohexane-C≡C^– Na^+.

Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would be an alkylating agent. So the acetylide would attack CH3Cl to form cyclohexane-C≡C–CH3? No, wait, no. Because acetylide is a strong base and would attack an alkyl halide. Wait, but CH3Cl is a primary alkyl halide. So the acetylide would take the methyl group, leading to cyclohexane-C≡C–CH3.

Wait, but wait, typically, alkylating an acetylide would replace the H on the sp carbon with an alkyl group. So, starting from CH≡C-R, deprotonate to RC≡C^– Na^+ , then treat with R'X: would give RC≡C–R'? So in this case, R is cyclohexyl, R' is methyl. So the product after step 1 would be cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3, which is 1-methyl-1-cyclohexylethyne. Wait, but that's a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the first step is deprotonation to form the acetylide, and then alkylation adds a methyl group to the other end. So the product would have a methyl group adjacent to the triple bond. So, the molecule becomes CH2-Cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. No, wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation adds a methyl group to the cyclohexyl part. Hmm, that doesn't quite make sense. Maybe I need to think about what the product would look like.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to form a Grignard reagent or a strong base, and then perform an alkylation. But in this case, NaNH2 is used, which would deprotonate the terminal alkyne, making it a strong nucleophile.

After the first step, the product would be cyclohexylacetylide (cyclohexane with a -C≡C^- group). Adding methyl chloride would give cyclohexylacetylide with a methyl group added, making cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH3? Wait, no. Let me think of the mechanism. The acetylide is a strong base and attacks the methyl chloride. So the acetylide (nucleophile) attacks the CH3 in CH3Cl. So the alkyne would become -C-CH3, but wait, the acetylide is on the sp-hybridized carbon, so the attack would occur at the same carbon. So the triple bond would become a single bond with a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is: CH2CH2-C≡CH (ethynylcyclohexane) treated with NaNH2 and then CH3Cl. So the product would be CH2CH2-C≡C-CH3? No, wait, that's just adding a methyl to the triple bond. So the product would be 1-methyl-1-cyclohexylethyne? Hmm.

But looking at the target molecule, perhaps this isn't the path. Alternatively, maybe the first step is a deprotonation and alkylation to form a larger alkyne, but perhaps that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a C-H insertion, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the initial step is forming the cyclohexenide, which then undergoes alkylation. So the result would be a longer chain. Let me think about the next steps in the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Steps 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. 

Wait, step 2 is hydrogenation with Pd. So that would convert an alkyne to an alkene, or a triple bond to a single bond. But if step 1 adds a methyl to the triple bond, then step 2 would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making a single bond.

Wait, but let me think about each option.

Option C: Steps 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Then step 3. O3/(CH3)2S. Then step 4. Ba(OH)2.

Wait, step 2 is hydrogenation. So perhaps converting the alkyne to an alkane? Or perhaps a trans or cis addition.

Wait, perhaps the process involves oxidation, hydrogenation, and then some kind of ozonolysis.

Alternatively, maybe the starting alkyne is converted into a diol via some dihydroxylation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH-)something and a CH2CHO group.

So perhaps the synthesis involves adding a hydroxymethyl group to the cyclohexane, and then introducing the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve the following:

1. Alkyne functionalization to introduce a substituent.

2. Hydrogenation to form a ring or a chain.

3. Ozonolysis to cleave a double bond and form carbonyl groups.

Wait, but let's think about each option.

Option D: Steps 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH.

NaNH2 and methanol. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, and methanol is a good nucleophile. So perhaps it's a deprotonation and then an alkylation with methanol? Or perhaps it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, NaNH2 is used to deprotonate, and then methanol is an electrophile. Maybe forming an ether? Not sure.

Option B: Steps 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liquid NH3; 3. O3/H2O; 4. NH4OH.

Hmm, step 1 would alkylate the acetylide with ethyl chloride, making a longer chain.

But I'm not entirely confident. Maybe I should think about the target molecule and see what functional groups need to be formed.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

Breaking it down: The cyclohexane ring has a substituent which is CH(OH-cyclohexyl) and a CH2CHO group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is cyclohexane with a -CH2-C(OH)(cyclohexyl) group and a -CHO group. No, wait the name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the numbering is such that the substituents are on the same carbon. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexane with a CH2 group attached to another cyclohexane ring and a hydroxyl group, and also a -CHO group.

Wait, perhaps the target is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a CH2 group connected to another cyclohexane (cyclohexyl), a hydroxyl group (-OH), and a CH2CHO group. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C(OH)(cyclohexyl)-CHO? Not sure. Maybe it's better to draw it mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is cyclohexane with a CH2-OH group, where the oxygen is connected to a cyclohexyl group. But that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2CHO group. Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure.

Wait, perhaps the target molecule is formed via a series of reactions that include alkyne functionalization, hydrogenation, oxidation, and ozonolysis.

Another approach: Let me think about each reagent's role.

- Step 1 in most options is NaNH2 and a chloride. This likely forms an acetylide and alkylates it.

- Step 2 varies: some options hydrogenate, others use Li/NH3 (which is for reductions, like in the Birch reduction, or for deprotonating something else), or O3 for ozonolysis.

Wait, maybe the target has a cyclopropane ring or a diene that's been hydrogenated. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene, which is then oxidized.

Wait, another thought: The target has a carbaldehyde group (CHO). That suggests that a CH2 group was oxidized. So perhaps there was a CH2CH2 group that was oxidized to CHO. Alternatively, perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to an alcohol was oxidized.

Let me think about the possible reactions.

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH), perhaps the first step is to add a methyl group via alkylation to form cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3 (but I'm not certain). Then, hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would make a longer chain. Or, maybe hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis or trans double bond.

Wait, if step 2 is hydrogenation with H2 and Pd, that would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So, the alkyne becomes an alkane. So, the product after step 2 would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? That doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 1, the alkyne is converted into an alkyne with a larger substituent, and then step 2 hydrogenates it to a diol. No, because the reagent in step 3 in some options is Ba(OH)2, which is used in the Birch reduction or for epoxide openings, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: After step 1, the alkyne is converted into an alkyne with a substituent, then step 2 is hydrogenation to make a single bond, making a cyclohexane ring attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to another CH3 group. But that doesn't seem to fit the target.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is alkylation to add a methyl group, making cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2-CH3. Then step 2 is hydrogenation (maybe partial) to make a double bond, like cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the target's structure is such that after some steps, including ozonolysis, we form carbonyl groups. So maybe the process involves adding a double bond that is cleaved by ozonolysis to form two carbonyl groups.

Let me think: if the product after step 2 is a diene, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl compounds. But how does that fit into the target?

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is functionalized to form a longer chain with a triple bond, then hydrogenated into a single bond, then ozonolysis isn't applicable.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne functionalization to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to form a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis to break a double bond into two carbonyls.

Wait, but without a double bond, ozonolysis wouldn't do anything.

Hmm, perhaps another approach: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2CHO group. That suggests that perhaps the molecule was formed via a Grignard reaction or another alkylation to add a hydroxyl group.

Wait, perhaps the first step adds a methyl group to the alkyne, making it a substituted alkyne. Then, hydrogenation reduces the triple bond to a single bond, making a longer chain. Then, ozonolysis could cleave a double bond, but this doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, maybe the sequence involves forming an epoxide, which is then opened to form a diol, but I don't see that in the steps.

Wait, looking at the reagent options again:

Option C's steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylate the acetylide.

2. H2/Pd-c → hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis on a double bond? But if the previous step made a single bond, where would the double bond come from?

Wait, perhaps after hydrogenation, we have a single bond, but perhaps another step introduces a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans alkene.

Wait, wait. Step 2 in option C is H2/Pd-c. That's a hydrogenation catalyst, which would typically hydrogenate a triple bond to a single bond. But if the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans alkene, that would require a different catalyst. Wait, no. To hydrogenate an alkyne to cis or trans alkene, you need a different condition, like using Lindlar's catalyst for cis or a different approach for trans. But Pd is often used for full hydrogenation to single bonds.

Wait, but if step 2 is H2 and Pd, that would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making it a cyclohexane with a CH2-CH2-CH3 group? No, that's not right. Let me think. Starting with cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3 (from step 1), step 2 would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, giving cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that doesn't seem to fit the target.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the target again.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

So the cyclohexane has a substituent at position 1, which is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group and a carbaldehyde (CHO) group.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has two rings: one cyclohexane attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to another cyclohexane, and also a CH2CHO group.

Hmm. So perhaps the synthesis involves adding a hydroxyl group and a methyl group to the starting material.

Wait, another angle: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl group (CH(OH)-cyclohexyl) and a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group (CHO attached to the cyclohexane).

So the process might involve:

1. Adding a methyl group to the alkyne to form a substituted alkyne.

2. Hydrogenating the alkyne to a single bond.

3. Performing ozonolysis to create carbonyl groups.

4. Oxidizing or hydrolyzing to form the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups.

Wait, but ozonolysis requires a double bond. So maybe after hydrogenation, there's a double bond somewhere else in the molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into an alkene, then ozonolysis is used.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

Step 1: Alkyne is alkylated, adding a methyl group.

Step 2: Alkyne is hydrogenated to a trans-alkene.

Wait, but how? If you hydrogenate an alkyne with a specific catalyst, you can get cis or trans alkenes. For example, using Lindlar's catalyst gives cis, while using Na/NH3 gives trans.

Wait, looking at option B: Step 2 is Li/liquid NH3. That's used for Birch reductions, which typically reduce aromatic rings. Or maybe for deprotonating compounds. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps after alkylation, the alkyne is hydrogenated to a trans-alkene, then ozonolysis is used to cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let me imagine the steps.

Option C: Steps 1 and 2.

Step 1: Alkyne becomes CH2CH2-C≡C-CH3 after alkylation. Then step 2: H2/Pd-c, which would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, giving CH2CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to cyclohexane.

But that gives a straight chain. Then, in step 3, ozonolysis is used on which double bond? Because after step 2, the bond is a single bond. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 1 and 2, we have a diene, and then ozonolysis cleaves it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne deprotonated and alkylated (step 1).

2. Hydrogenated to a cis or trans alkene (maybe step 2 is a different hydrogenation condition to form a double bond).

3. Ozonolysis of the double bond to form carbonyl groups.

4. Then, some kind of oxidation or hydrolysis to form the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups.

But looking at the options, I don't see such a sequence.

Wait, option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps alkylation with methanol? Or deprotonation and oxygen nucleophilic attack.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, which would deprotonate the alkyne. Then methanol would react as an electrophile. But alkyne acetylides are nucleophilic. So methanol would react with the acetylide? Or perhaps the acetylide would attack the methanol, leading to an ether formation? Hmm, I'm not too sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is introducing a hydroxyl group. But I'm not certain.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about each option and its possible outcome.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylate acetylide, adding a methyl group.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate triple bond to single bond, so the molecule becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2 → what's that used for? Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, often used in elimination reactions or for epoxide openings, but not sure here.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → these are conditions for acid-catalyzed hydration of a carbonyl? Or maybe for oxidation?

Wait, after step 2, the molecule is a straight chain. Step 3: Ba(OH)2 could cause elimination, forming a double bond. Then, step 4 might be oxidation.

Not sure if this leads to the target.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkylate acetylide with ethyl group.

2. Li/liq. NH3 → probably a Birch reduction, which reduces aromatic rings. But our molecule is not aromatic. Alternatively, Li/NH3 is used to deprotonate or for reductions.

3. O3/H2O → ozonolysis of a double bond to form carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → workup after ozonolysis, perhaps hydrolysis.

Not sure how this leads to the target.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → add methyl to acetylide.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate triple bond to single.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis of a double bond. But where is the double bond? Unless step 2 didn't fully hydrogenate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe step 2 in option C uses H2 and Pd-c, which is a catalyst. Perhaps in this case, the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene instead of a single bond. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, creating two carbonyl groups.

So after step 2, the molecule is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the alkyne after step 1 is cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Then, hydrogenation (step 2) would make cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? But that doesn't have a double bond. So maybe I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 doesn't hydrogenate the triple bond but does something else. I'm a bit confused.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → maybe deprotonate and then alkylate with methanol, but I'm not certain.

2. Li/liq. NH3 → perhaps Birch reduction or another type of deprotonation.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis, perhaps breaking a double bond to form carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → workup.

But again, I'm not sure how all these steps align with the target structure.

Wait, perhaps the target is formed via a hydroxymethyl group addition. So maybe the steps involve:

1. Adding a methyl group to the alkyne.

2. Hydrogenating the triple bond to a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis to break the double bond into carbonyls.

4. Hydrolysis to form the -OH and -CHO groups.

But how does that fit into the reagents?

Wait, let's think about option C again.

After step 1, the alkyne is CH2Cl (no, wait, methyl chloride adds a methyl group). So after step 1, the molecule is cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd-c → hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But that doesn't have a double bond, so ozonolysis in step 3 wouldn't do anything. So option C doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans alkene. But under H2 and Pd, I think the triple bond would be fully hydrogenated to a single bond.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the first step adds a methyl group, step 2 hydrogenates to a cis-alkene, step 3 ozonolysis cleaves the double bond, and step 4 forms the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups.

But how would that happen? Let me outline:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → after NaNH2 and CH3Cl, becomes cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenate using H2 and Pd → becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. No double bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't work.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the correct sequence is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane is deprotonated and alkylated to form cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Wait, no, because adding methyl chloride would add a methyl group to the sp carbon, making it CH2-C≡C-CH3, but attached where?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation adds a methyl group to the cyclohexane, but that's not how acetylide chemistry works.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step forms a cyclohexenide, which then undergoes a coupling reaction. But I'm not sure.

Maybe I should think about each option's reagents and what's possible.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. So the acetylide would react with methanol. Methanol is a good nucleophile, but in this case, maybe it's acting as an electrophile. Alternatively, NaNH2 in NH3 would deprotonate the alkyne, making the acetylide, which would then react with methanol. But acetylide is a strong base and would deprotonate things, not react as a nucleophile. Wait, no, the acetylide is a strong nucleophile. So perhaps the acetylide would attack a methyl group from CH3OH. Wait, but CH3OH is a poor electrophile, unless something activates it.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is more about deprotonating and then alkoxylation. But I'm not sure.

Another possibility: NaNH2 in NH3 is a strong base. Maybe it deprotonates the alkyne, making an acetylide, which is then treated with methanol. So the acetylide would attack the methyl in CH3OH, forming a new carbon-carbon bond. But I'm not sure how that would proceed. Maybe the product would be CH2(OH)-cyclohexane or something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps this step is a Grignard-like reaction, but with NaNH2. Not sure.

Moving on, step 2 in option D is Li/liq. NH3. That's a common condition for Birch reductions, which reduce aromatic rings. But our starting material isn't aromatic. Alternatively, Li/NH3 can be used for deprotonating certain compounds, like in the formation of alkyllithium reagents.

But I'm not certain. Maybe after step 1, we have a di- or tri-substituted acetylide, which is then further functionalized.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the target's functional groups again.

The target has both a hydroxyl group and a carbaldehyde group attached to the same carbon on the cyclohexane. So perhaps the molecule has a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group and a CH2CHO group.

Wait, that suggests that the molecule has a vicinal diol, which upon oxidation could form a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's formed via a conjugate addition or some type of elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence involves adding a methyl group, then oxidizing it to a ketone, and then doing some kind of conjugate addition.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the correct answer by elimination.

Looking at the options, option C has O3 and (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup for ozonolysis. Ozonolysis is used to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups.

So, if after step 2, the molecule has a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls.

So, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to add a methyl group.

2. Alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene (using a different catalyst, but perhaps in the option it's done via H2/Pd).

3. Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups.

4. Oxidation or hydrolysis forms the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups.

Wait, but how would that form two carbonyl groups? Let's imagine:

After step 1: cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: Hydrogenation with H2 and Pd. But if the alkyne is hydrogenated to a trans-alkene, then step 3 would cleave the double bond.

So, ozonolysis of a trans-alkene would give two aldehyde groups? Or ketones, depending on the structure.

Wait, ozonolysis of a trans-alkene would give two carbonyl groups. So, for example, if the molecule is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3 after step 2, but that's a single bond, not a double bond. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is hydrogenation to a cis-alkene. Then ozonolysis would cleave into two carbonyls.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of a specific example.

Suppose we have 1-pentene. Ozonolysis would cleave it into two aldehydes (formaldehyde and butanal, depending on the structure). But in our case, the alkene is part of a cyclohexane ring.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C, because it includes ozonolysis and reductive workup.

Wait, after step 1 and 2, the molecule would have a double bond, and ozonolysis would cleave it. Let me think about the possible outcomes.

If the alkene is between two cyclohexane rings, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. But how does that lead to the target structure?

Alternatively, perhaps the target is formed by adding a hydroxymethyl group via oxymercuration or some other method, but I don't see that in the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to add a methyl group.

2. Triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond, giving a longer chain.

3. Ozonolysis is not applicable here, so perhaps my previous approach is wrong.

Hmm. Another angle: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is attached to the cyclohexane. So perhaps the synthesis involves adding a hydroxyl group to the chain.

Wait, perhaps step 3 in option C is ozonolysis followed by reductive workup, which would produce aldehydes. Then, step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which could cause some elimination or epoxide formation. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the correct option is C, because it includes the necessary steps to form the carbonyl groups.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to think of each option's steps and their possible outcomes.

Option C: Steps 1-4.

1. Alkyne becomes alkylated methyl.

2. Hydrogenated to single bond.

3. Ozonolysis on a double bond (but where is the double bond?), unless step 2 didn't hydrogenate the triple bond but instead added hydrogen in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 doesn't hydrogenate the alkyne but does something else. I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reagents in option C. Step 3 uses O3 and (CH3)2S, which is a reagent for reductive workup (as opposed to oxidative, which uses H2O). So ozonolysis followed by (CH3)2S would break the double bond into carbonyl groups without further oxidation.

So, if step 2 forms a double bond, then step 3 would cleave it.

Let me think:

After step 1: cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2 and Pd-c → hydrogenate triple bond to single bond, making cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But no double bond, so ozonolysis in step 3 wouldn't do anything. So option C doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is a different condition. Wait, maybe the catalyst is wrong. For partial hydrogenation of an alkyne to an alkene, you might use a different catalyst, like Lindlar's (for cis) or a poisoned catalyst for trans. But in option C, the catalyst is H2/Pd-c, which I think leads to full hydrogenation.

So perhaps option C is not correct.

Another possibility: The correct sequence involves alkylation, hydrogenation to an alkene, ozonolysis, and then forming the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups.

But which option does that? Let's look.

Option D: Steps 1-4.

After step 1: alkylation with methanol. But I'm not sure. Step 2: Li/liq. NH3. Maybe Birch reduction, but not applicable. Then ozonolysis and workup.

Not sure.

Option B: Step 2 is Li/liquid NH3, which I think is for deprotonation. Then ozonolysis. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, I'm really stuck. Let me think about the target again. It’s a cyclohexane ring with a CH(OH-Cyclohexyl) and a CH2CHO group. So perhaps the molecule is formed by adding a hydroxymethyl group to the cyclohexane and then oxidizing a neighboring CH2 to CHO.

So the steps would involve:

1. Introducing a substituent with a methyl group.

2. Forming a double bond adjacent to the substituent.

3. Ozonolysis to form a carbonyl group.

4. Hydrogenation or oxidation to form the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C, because it includes ozonolysis, which would form carbonyl groups necessary for the aldehyde.

I think I'm going to have to make a best guess here.

Looking at the options, option C's step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reagent used for reductive workup, giving aldehydes and ketones without further oxidation. Then, step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base and could cause elimination or epoxide opening.

Wait, perhaps after ozonolysis, we have two carbonyl groups, one of which is the aldehyde needed. Then, Ba(OH)2 could perform an elimination, forming a hydroxyl group.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne alkylated.

2. Partial hydrogenation to alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form two carbonyls.

4. Hydrolysis to form hydroxyl groups.

But I don't see that in the options.

Wait, considering all this, I think option C is the correct one because it includes the necessary steps for introducing substituents and forming carbonyl groups via ozonolysis, which could lead to the aldehyde in the target molecule.


The question involves determining the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane and a carbaldehyde group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride likely alkylate the ethynyl group, adding a methyl group.
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, forming a longer chain.
   - Step 3: Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, possibly causing elimination or epoxide formation.
   - Step 4: H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, and H₂O suggest acid-catalyzed hydration or oxidation.
   - This sequence does not align well with the formation of the target molecule, as it lacks a clear pathway to introduce the hydroxyl and aldehyde groups.

2. **Option B**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and ethyl chloride alkylate the ethynyl group, adding an ethyl group.
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH₃ could deprotonate or reduce, but its role here is unclear.
   - Step 3: O₃/H₂O performs ozonolysis, cleaving a double bond into carbonyl groups.
   - Step 4: NH₄OH is a workup reagent after ozonolysis.
   - This sequence does not clearly explain how the hydroxyl and aldehyde groups are introduced.

3. **Option C**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride alkylate the ethynyl group, adding a methyl group.
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd-c hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, forming a saturated compound.
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S performs ozonolysis, cleaving a double bond into carbonyl groups.
   - Step 4: Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, possibly facilitating elimination or epoxide formation.
   - This sequence includes ozonolysis, which is critical for forming carbonyl groups, aligning with the target molecule's aldehyde group. However, the exact formation of the hydroxyl group remains unclear.

4. **Option D**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methanol may deprotonate or alkylate the ethynyl group, but the exact reaction is ambiguous.
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH₃ could deprotonate or reduce, but its role here is unclear.
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S performs ozonolysis, cleaving a double bond into carbonyl groups.
   - Step 4: NH₄OH is a workup reagent after ozonolysis.
   - This sequence does not clearly explain how the hydroxyl and aldehyde groups are introduced.

### Conclusion:
Option C is the most plausible sequence because it includes ozonolysis, which is essential for forming the aldehyde group in the target molecule. While the exact formation of the hydroxyl group is unclear, the inclusion of reagents that can introduce carbonyl groups makes this option the most aligned with the target structure.
