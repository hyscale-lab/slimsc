Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says: There's an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. So first, I'm thinking about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Since all the charges are identical and the same sign, the potential energy will be positive because like charges repel. Wait, but the problem is about the minimum energy, so maybe I should think about how the charges are arranged to minimize the potential energy.

Wait, but 12 charges are at 2 meters from point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So, the setup is similar to 12 charges placed on a sphere of radius 2 meters around point P, which has the 13th charge. So I guess the potential energy comes from the interactions between all the pairs.

Wait, but since the 13th charge at P is fixed, and the 12 others are constrained at 2 meters away, perhaps the potential energy is the sum of the interactions between each of the 12 and the fixed one, plus the interactions among the 12 themselves.

So, the total potential energy U would be the sum of two parts: U1 is the energy due to the 12 charges each interacting with the fixed charge at P, and U2 is the energy due to the interactions between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but wait, each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from P, so each is at a distance of 2 meters from the fixed charge. So the potential energy between each of the 12 and the fixed charge at P would be (using Coulomb's law for potential energy between two point charges): U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988×10^9 N·m²/C².

Wait, but each of the 12 charges is 2e, and the fixed charge is 2e as well, right? Because all 13 are identical. So each interaction between the fixed charge and a moving charge is (2e)*(2e)/(2 m) multiplied by each of the 12 charges.

Wait, but wait, the fixed charge is at P, so each of the 12 charges is at 2 m from P. So for each of these 12, the potential energy due to the fixed charge is (k (2e)(2e)) / 2 m. But since there are 12 such charges, the total U1 would be 12 times that.

Then U1 = 12 * [ (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m) ) ]

Wait, but wait, let me make sure about signs. Since the charges are all positive, the potential energy between each pair is positive. So each of the 12 charges contributes a positive amount to the potential energy when considering their interaction with the fixed charge.

But then
