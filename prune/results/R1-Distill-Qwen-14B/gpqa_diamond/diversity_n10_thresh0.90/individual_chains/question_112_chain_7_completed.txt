Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. Let me read the problem again.

We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. That part I think I get. So, these are the standard spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis.

First, I need to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij. The rule is A_ij = ħ/2 if i is not equal to j, else 0. Hmm, so for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So the matrix would look like:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2 0 ]

Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix. So this operator must be acting on a two-level system, like spin-1/2 particles. The eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of the given matrix.

I remember that such a matrix is the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2. Oh wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this matrix would be (ħ/2) * σ_x. So, the eigenvalues of σ_x are +1 and -1. So the eigenvalues of this operator A would be (ħ/2)(1) and (ħ/2)(-1), which are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

But wait, the question isn't about finding the eigenvalues; it's about finding the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate. Oh right, the operator's eigenstates are different from the |up> and |down> states. So the state |alpha> can be expressed in terms of the eigenstates of A, and the coefficients would give the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator A is the same as the spin in the x-direction. Because the spin-x operator for an electron is (ħ/2)σ_x, which has the same matrix as A. So the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction, which are the |+x> and |-x> states.

So, to find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of A (which are the x-spin eigenstates), I need to expand |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.

But wait, I don't know the explicit form of the |+x> and |-x> states. Let me recall. The |+x> state is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and the |-x> state is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Because σ_x has eigenstates that are those superpositions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can diagonalize the matrix A to find its eigenstates. But since I know A is proportional to σ_x, which I've already dealt with, maybe I can proceed without diagonalizing.

So the first step is to normalize |alpha>, because right now it's proportional to that expression, not necessarily normalized.

The given state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

The normalization factor is 1 / sqrt(|1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2).

Let me compute |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|2 -i|^2: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5.

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(2+5) = 1/sqrt(7). So the actual state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> all multiplied by 1/sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of operator A, which are |+x> and |-x>, as I thought earlier.

The |+x> state is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and the |-x> state is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>.

To find c_+ and c_-, I can express |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me solve for |up> and |down>:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) => sqrt(2)|+x> = |up> + |down>
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) => sqrt(2)|-x> = |up> - |down>

Adding these equations: 2|up> = sqrt(2)(|+x> + |-x>) => |up> = (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2).

Subtracting the two equations: 2|down> = sqrt(2)(|+x> - |-x> ) => |down> = (|+x> - |-x> )/(sqrt(2)).

So, substituting back into |alpha>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (|+x> + |-x> )/sqrt(2) ) ] + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (|+x> - |-x> )/sqrt(2) ) ]

Let me factor out 1/(sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)):

= [1/(sqrt(14)) ] [ (1+i)(|+x> + |-x> ) + (2 -i)(|+x> - |-x> ) ]

Expanding this:

= [1/sqrt(14)] [ (1+i)|+x> + (1+i)|-x> + (2 -i)|+x> - (2 -i)|-x> ]

Combine like terms for |+x> and |-x>:

For |+x>:
(1+i) + (2 -i) = (1+2) + (i -i) )= 3.

For |-x>:
(1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) )= (-1) + 2i.

So,

|alpha> = [1/sqrt(14)] [ 3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |-x> ]

Hmm, that's not quite right because the coefficients should give probabilities when squared. Wait, but let me check my steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in expanding the terms. Let me redo that part.

Original expression:

(1+i)|+x> + (1+i)|-x> + (2 -i)|+x> - (2 - i)|-x>.

So group |+x> terms: [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] |+x> 

Which is (1+i + 2 -i) = 3.

Similarly for |-x> terms: [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] |-x> 

Which is (1 +i -2 +i) = (-1 + 2i).

So, yes, that's correct.

So |alpha> = [3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |-x> ] / sqrt(14).

Wait, but for the coefficients to have the correct magnitude, perhaps I should compute them correctly.

Wait, no. The state |alpha> is expressed as c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>.

So, c_+ = 3 / sqrt(14), and c_- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficients should have their magnitudes squared give the probabilities. Let me calculate |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2: (3/sqrt(14))^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Compute |c_-|^2: [ (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14) ] multiplied by its complex conjugate [ (-1 -2i) / sqrt(14) ].

So |c_-|^2 = [ ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, but that's approximately 0.64 and 0.36, which are options A and D.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A has probabilities 0.64 and 0.36. But wait, wait a second. The sum of these probabilities should be 1. 9/14 is approx 0.642857, and 5/14 is approx 0.357, so together that's 14/14=1. So that's correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation of c_+ and c_-.

Wait, I think I made a mistake when I was substituting. Let me retrace.

I have |alpha> expressed as:

[ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Then I substituted |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |-x>:

|up> = (|+x> + |-x> )/sqrt(2)
|down> = (|+x> - |-x> )/sqrt(2)

So,

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) * [ (|+x> + |-x> )/sqrt(2) ) ] + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * [ (|+x> - |-x> )/sqrt(2) ) ].

So factor out 1/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)):

= [1/(sqrt(14)) ] [ (1+i)(|+x> + |-x> ) + (2 - i)(|+x> - |-x> ) ]

Expanding this:

(1+i)|+x> + (1+i)|-x> + (2 - i)|+x> - (2 - i)|-x>.

Grouping terms:

|+x> [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] + |-x> [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ]

Compute each:

For |+x> coefficient: (1+i + 2 -i) = 3.

For |-x> coefficient: (1 +i -2 +i) = (-1 + 2i).

So, |alpha> = [3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |-x> ] / sqrt(14).

So, c_+ = 3/sqrt(14), c_- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, but the probabilities are |c_+|² and |c_-|².

So |c_+|² = (3)^2 /14 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

|c_-|² = | (-1 + 2i) |^2 /14. The magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) =1+4=5. So 5/14≈0.357.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357, which would correspond to 0.64 and 0.36, option A.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, and average value hbar/7.

Wait, but the question also asks for the average value of the operator A. Let me think about that.

The average value of operator A is <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is a Hermitian operator (because it's a spin operator), the expectation value is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their respective probabilities.

Wait, no, wait. The operator A has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the expectation value <A> would be (probability of +ħ/2) * (ħ/2) + (probability of -ħ/2) * (-ħ/2).

But wait, let me think. The eigenstates |+x> and |-x> have eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively.

So the expectation value is ( |c_+|^2 * (ħ/2) ) + ( |c_-|^2 * (-ħ/2) ).

So, substituting the values:

|c_+|^2 =9/14, |c_-|^2=5/14.

So,

<A> = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = [ (9/14 -5/14) ) * (ħ/2) ) ] ?

Wait, no. Let me compute it correctly.

= (9/14)*(ħ/2) + (5/14)*(-ħ/2)

= [9/(14) -5/(14)] * (ħ/2 )

= (4/14) * (ħ/2) = (2/7) * (ħ/2) = ħ/(7).

So <A> is ħ/7. So that would match option A, which says the average value is ħ/7, and the probabilities 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7.

But wait, let me double-check the average value calculation because I might have confused the probabilities.

Wait, the state |alpha> is expressed as c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>. So the expectation value is c_+ (ħ/2) + c_- (-ħ/2).

Wait, no. Because |+x> has eigenvalue +ħ/2, so <A> = |c_+|^2*(+ħ/2) + |c_-|^2*(-ħ/2).

So,

= (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = [ (9/14 -5/14) ) ] * (ħ/2) ) 

Which is (4/14) * (ħ/2) = (2/7) * (ħ/2) = ħ/(7).

So yes, average is ħ/7. So the option A says average hbar/7.

But looking back, the probabilities are 9/14≈0.6429 and 5/14≈0.357, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So option A's probabilities match.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7. So that's correct.

But wait, let me look at the other options to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29 and 2hbar/sqrt(7). Hmm, doesn't match the probabilities.

Option B: 0.54 and 0.46, average 3hbar/sqrt(7). Doesn't match.

Option C: 0.28 and 0.72, average hbar/sqrt(7). Doesn't match.

So the correct answer is option A.

But wait, wait a moment. Is there any possibility I made a mistake in the expansion? Let me double-check.

Wait, when I substituted |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, perhaps I messed up the signs or the coefficients.

Wait, |up> is (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2), correct. |down> is (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2), correct.

So when substituting into |alpha>:

(1+i)|up> = (1+i) (|+x> + |-x> ) / sqrt(2).

(2 -i)|down> = (2 -i) (|+x> - |-x> ) / sqrt(2).

So adding these:

(1+i)(|+x> + |-x> ) + (2 -i)(|+x> - |-x> )

= [ (1+i)|+x> + (1+i)|-x> ) + (2 - i)|+x> - (2 -i)|-x> ) ]

Grouping terms:

|+x> [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] + |-x> [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]

Which is:

|+x> [3 ] + |-x> [ (1 +i -2 +i) ] = |+x> *3 + |-x> * (-1 + 2i )

Yes, that's correct.

So the coefficients are 3/sqrt(14) and (-1+2i)/sqrt(14), with squares 9/14 and 5/14. So everything seems correct.

Thus, the answer is option A: 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7.


The problem involves calculating the probabilities of measuring an electron in the eigenstates of an operator \( A \) with matrix representation \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be determined. The state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is given as proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-component of spin.

### Key Steps:
1. **Normalization of \( |\alpha\rangle \):**
   The given state is \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the normalization factor:
   \[
   |1+i|^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 5, \quad \text{so normalization factor} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2+5}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}.
   \]
   Thus, the normalized state is:
   \[
   |\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|\downarrow\rangle.
   \]

2. **Eigenstates of \( A \):**
   The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
   \[
   A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 \end{bmatrix},
   \]
   which corresponds to \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), which are:
   \[
   |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
   \]

3. **Expressing \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \):**
   Using the relations:
   \[
   |\uparrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x\rangle + |-x\rangle), \quad |\downarrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x\rangle - |-x\rangle),
   \]
   substitute \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) into \( |\alpha\rangle \):
   \[
   |\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x\rangle + |-x\rangle) + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x\rangle - |-x\rangle).
   \]
   Factor out \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \):
   \[
   |\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \big[ (1+i)(|+x\rangle + |-x\rangle) + (2-i)(|+x\rangle - |-x\rangle) \big].
   \]
   Expand and group terms:
   \[
   |\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \big[ 3|+x\rangle + (-1+2i)|-x\rangle \big].
   \]
   Thus, the coefficients are:
   \[
   c_+ = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_- = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
   \]

4. **Probabilities:**
   The probabilities of measuring \( |\alpha\rangle \) in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are given by \( |c_+|^2 \) and \( |c_-|^2 \), respectively:
   \[
   |c_+|^2 = \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad |c_-|^2 = \left(\frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
   \]

5. **Average value of \( A \):**
   The eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The expectation value is:
   \[
   \langle A \rangle = |c_+|^2 \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + |c_-|^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
   \]
   Substituting \( |c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \) and \( |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \):
   \[
   \langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} - \frac{5}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{4}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
