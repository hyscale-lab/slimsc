Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the Radial Velocity (RV) method. Two stars with the same mass as the Sun each have a planet with masses similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

The key data is the periodic shift in their spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm. I remember that the RV method detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift relates to the star's velocity towards and away from us. 

Wait, but how does that velocity relate to the planet's orbital period? Oh right, higher velocity would mean a shorter period because the star is moving more quickly in its orbit around the barycenter. But wait, no, wait. The RV method measures the star's velocity. So the star moves in response to the planet. The more massive the planet, the higher the velocity shift. But in this case, the planets have similar masses to Neptune, so their masses are about the same. Oh wait, but the problem says their masses are similar, so maybe that's a red herring, and we can consider them same mass.

Wait, but the stars have the same mass as the Sun. So both stars are identical. So the shifts in their spectral lines are due to their velocities as they orbit the planet. But wait, wait, no. The star and planet orbit a common center of mass. The RV method measures the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's mass and orbital period.

The formula I think I need is the one that relates the RV semi-amplitude (K) to the orbital period. The semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_*)^(1/3) )) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( sin i ) / (2π * (1 AU) )

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the exact formula. Alternatively, I think the formula can be approximated when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass, which it is for Neptune and the Sun-like star. So M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So the formula simplifies.

I recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_*)^(1/3) ) ) ) * ( (1) / (P) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe that's not the right way. Alternatively, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude is related to the velocity of the star in its orbit. 

The star and planet orbit their common center of mass. The star's velocity is given by:

v = ( (G * (M_p) * P) / (4 * pi^2 * (a_*) ) ) )^(1/3)

Where a_* is the radius of the star's orbit around the barycenter. But a_* is related to the planet's orbital radius, a. Since M_* >> M_p, a_* ≈ (M_p/(M_* + M_p)) * a ≈ (M_p/M_*) * a. But since M_p is much less than M_*, a_* ≈ (M_p/M_*) * a.

Alternatively, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (2 pi G) / (c) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(0.5) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )

But since e=0 for circular orbits, and M_p << M_*, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (2 pi G) / c )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Since both planets have similar masses to Neptune, M_p is the same for both. Also, the stars have same mass, so M_* is same. Sin i is 1 for both since the orbits are circular and we can assume face-on, so i=90 degrees, but wait, no. Wait, sin i is 1 only if the orbit is edge-on. But the question doesn't specify that. Wait, but in RV detection, sin i affects the measured RV because K is proportional to sin i. But in this problem, we're given the shifts, so perhaps the sin i is the same for both planets. Or maybe it's given that they were detected, implying sin i is close to 1 for both. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the inclination is the same for both, so sin i cancels out when taking the ratio.

Since both stars are similar, and P is the period we're trying to find, perhaps the ratio of K1 and K2 can be used to find the ratio of P1 and P2.

Let me write down the formula for K:

K = ( (v) ) = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )

But I might be getting the exact formula wrong. Alternatively, let's think in terms of the formula where K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (P)^(-1/3). Wait, no:

Another approach: for the same star, K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) ) * (sin i) / ( (P)^(1/3) ) )

But wait, perhaps more accurately, since K depends on the velocity of the star, which is (2 pi a_*) / P, where a_* is the star's orbit radius. a_* is (M_p/(M_* + M_p)) * a, approximately M_p/(M_*) * a when M_p << M_*. 

So, v = (2 pi a_*) / P = (2 pi * (M_p a) / M_*) ) / P.

But a is the planet's orbital radius. From Kepler's third law, a^3 = (G M_* P^2) / (4 pi^2). So a = [ (G M_* P^2) / (4 pi^2) ]^(1/3).

Substituting a into v:

v = (2 pi (M_p / M_*) [ (G M_* P^2/(4 pi^2) )^(1/3) ) ]) / P

Simplify:

v = 2 pi M_p/(M_*) * [ (G M_* P^2/(4 pi^2) ) ]^(1/3) / P

Let's cube the terms. Let's compute each part step by step.

First, inside the cube root:

(G M_* P^2)/(4 pi^2) )= (G M_* (P^2) )/(4 pi^2 )

So when we take the cube root, it becomes (G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(2/3) ) / (4 pi^2 )^(1/3 )

So putting back into v:

v = [2 pi * (M_p/M_*) ] * [ (G M_* )^(1/3) * P^(2/3) ) / (4 pi^2 )^(1/3) ) ] / P

Simplify denominator:

Denominator is (4 pi^2 )^(1/3) ) = 4^(1/3) * pi^(2/3)

So,

v = (2 pi M_p/M_*) ) * ( G^(1/3) M_*^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) ) / (4^(1/3) pi^(2/3) ) ) ) * 1/P

Simplify the terms:

Let me write this as:

v = [ 2 pi / (4^(1/3) pi^(2/3)) ) ] * (M_p / M_*) * ( G^(1/3) M_*^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) ) * (1/P )

Let me compute each part:

First, 2 pi divided by 4^(1/3) pi^(2/3):

2 / 4^(1/3) = 2 / (2^(2/3)) ) = 2^(1) / 2^(2/3) ) = 2^(1 - 2/3) ) = 2^(1/3)

Similarly, pi / pi^(2/3) )= pi^(1 - 2/3)= pi^(1/3)

So that part is (2^(1/3) pi^(1/3)) )

Second, (M_p / M_*) * M_*^(1/3) )= M_p * M_*^(-1) * M_*^(1/3) )= M_p * M_*^(-2/3)

Third, P^(2/3) * (1/P )= P^(-1/3)

So putting it all together:

v = (2^(1/3) pi^(1/3)) ) * ( G^(1/3) ) ) * ( M_p M_*^(-2/3) ) ) * ( P^(-1/3) )

So,

v = ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) * (1/ P^(1/3) )

Which can be written as:

v ∝ ( M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But since M_p is the same for both planets, and M_* is the same for both stars, the ratio of v1 and v2 (K1 and K2) would be inversely proportional to the cube root of their periods.

Wait, but in the problem, K1 is 5 milliangstroms, and K2 is 7 milliangstroms. So K1 = 5, K2 =7.

So K1/K2 = 5/7.

But from the formula, since v is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), K1/K2 = (1/(P1^(1/3))) / (1/(P2^(1/3))) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, hold on. Because K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), so K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3), where C is the constant for other factors which are same for both planets.

So K1 / K2 = (1/P1^(1/3)) / (1/P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

To find the ratio P2/P1, we cube both sides:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

Wait, wait no, because (P2/P1)^(1/3) = 5/7, so:

P2/P1 = (5/7)^3

Wait, wait, no. Let's think again.

The ratio K1/K2 = (5/7) = [ (P2/P1)^(1/3) ]

So, (5/7) = [ (P2/P1) ]^(1/3 )

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the cube root:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

So, P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1

Which would mean that P2 is (125/343) times P1. 125/343 is approximately 0.364 times. So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So P2 = 0.36 * P1 → P2 is about 0.36 times P1, meaning it's shorter. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1, so it's about 0.36 times as long. Therefore, the ratio of P2/P1 is 0.36, which is approximately 0.36.

But wait, wait, I think I got this backward. Because if K is higher, then the period is shorter. Let me think again.

The RV semi-amplitude K is higher when the star's velocity is higher. K is higher when the period is shorter. Because for a given planet mass, a shorter period would mean the star is moving back and forth more quickly, leading to a higher observed shift. So if K2 is higher than K1, planet #2 must have a shorter period than planet #1.

Wait, but the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is shorter, then P2/P1 is less than 1.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.7143)^3 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is about 0.36 times P1, meaning P2 is shorter than P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, so it's shorter. Hence, the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes the formula can be counterintuitive.

Another approach, perhaps using the formula for the RV semi-amplitude:

K = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(P) )^(1/3)

But since M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So,

K ≈ (27 pi G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i ) / ( M_*^(1/3) ) ) * (1/P )^(1/3)

So,

K = C * (M_p) / ( M_*^(1/3) ) * (1/P )^(1/3 )

Because the other terms are constants for both stars.

So, K1/K2 = [ (M_p1 / (M_*^(1/3) P1^(1/3)) ) ] / [ (M_p2 / (M_*^(1/3) P2^(1/3)) ) ]

But M_p1 and M_p2 are similar, let's say M_p1 = M_p2 = M_p. So,

K1/K2 = [ (1/P1^(1/3) ) ] / [ (1/P2^(1/3) ) ] = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So,

5 /7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Cubing both sides,

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1 → P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1 ≈ (125/343) * P1 ≈ 0.364 * P1.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1, which is 0.364 times as long as P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, which means it's shorter, and the ratio is about 0.36. So the answer is option A) ~0.36.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the Radial Velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV semi-amplitude is given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies that the ratio of \( K_1 \) to \( K_2 \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the ratio of their orbital periods:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides to solve for \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \):

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Therefore, the orbital period of Planet #2 is about 0.36 times as long as that of Planet #1.
