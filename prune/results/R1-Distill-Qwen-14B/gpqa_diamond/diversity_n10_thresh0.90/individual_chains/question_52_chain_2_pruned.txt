Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

So the question is about a star's photosphere and the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The star has some spots, and when it does, the effective temperature changes, which affects this ratio. I need to find out by what factor the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, let's break this down. The star's parameters are given: radius 1.5 solar radii, mass 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by dark spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Wait, effective temperature is related to the star's luminosity and radius. But in this case, the spots are making the star appear cooler overall. So when spots are present, the average temperature of the entire photosphere is lower.

The main point is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when there are spots, the ratio is lower, and without spots, it's higher. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations N1/N2 is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(kT)), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the ratio when the star doesn't have spots versus when it does. So the effective temperature is 6000 K without spots and 5500 K with spots.

But wait, wait. When spots are present, the overall temperature is lower, so the photosphere is cooler. So the ionization and excitation states of atoms like Ti would change. Ti is neutral, so perhaps we're looking at excitation rather than ionization. Because at lower temperatures, atoms are less likely to be in higher energy states.

Wait, the question states it's about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. So that's about excitation within neutral Ti. So in LTE, the excitation is governed by the Boltzmann equation. So the ratio should be higher at higher temperatures because the exponential term becomes larger.

Let me think. The ratio N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )^-1. So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio increases.

So when the star has spots, T_eff is lower (5500 K), so the ratio N1/N2 should decrease. Which matches the statement in the question that the ratio decreases when the star has spots.

We need to find the factor by which the ratio changes. So the factor is (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_with_spots.

Let me write the formula. The ratio without spots is (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE / (k T1) ), where T1 is 6000 K. And with spots, it's (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE / (k T2) ), where T2 is 5500 K.

So the factor is [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ].

Simplify this: exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let me check the signs. The exponent is [ - (ΔE)/(k T1) + (ΔE)/(k T2) ) ].

Factor out ΔE/(k): ΔE/(k) ( -1/T1 + 1/T2 ) = ΔE/(k) ( (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

So exponent is ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

But let me plug in the numbers. Let me compute 1/T2 - 1/T1.

Wait, T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K. So 1/T2 is 1/5500 ≈ 0.0001818, and 1/T1 is 1/6000 ≈ 0.0001667. So 1/T2 - 1/T1 ≈ 0.0000151.

But wait, the exponent is ΔE/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ). Oh wait, because the factor is (N1/N2)_1 / (N1/N2)_2 = [ exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) )

Wait, no. Let me re-calculate the ratio correctly.

Ratio without spots: R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T1) )

Ratio with spots: R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T2) )

So the factor is R1/R2 = [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Because when you divide, exponents subtract: exp( a ) / exp( b ) = exp( a - b )

So a is -ΔE/(k T1), b is -ΔE/(k T2). So a - b is [ -ΔE/(k T1) ) - (-ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ]

Wait, no. Let me clarify:

Wait, in the factor R1/R2, it's [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] divided by [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ].

Which is exp( ( -ΔE/(k T1) ) - ( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) )

= exp( ΔE/(k) [ (1/(T2) ) - (1/(T1) ) ] )

So that's correct.

Now, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Angstroms. That's in the near ultraviolet or far UV. Let's calculate the energy difference ΔE.

We know that the energy of a photon is E = hc / λ.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J*s.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

λ is 1448 Angstroms, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So ΔE = hc / λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) 

Compute that:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = approximately 1.373e-18 J per photon.

Now, we can compute this in terms of eV, because Boltzmann's constant is more conveniently used in eV/K units.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So ΔE in eV is 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.57 eV.

So ΔE ≈ 8.57 eV.

But wait, let me double-check that calculation.

Wait, hc = 12400 eV·Angstrom approximately. Because 12400 eV·Angstrom is a commonly used value.

So wavelength λ = 1448 A.

So E = hc/λ = 12400 eV·A / 1448 A ≈ 8.57 eV.

Yes, that's correct.

So ΔE is about 8.57 eV. Now, the exponent in the factor is (ΔE/(k)) * (1/T2 - 1/T1).

Wait, but k is Boltzmann's constant, which is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So let's compute (ΔE)/(k) = 8.57 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 8.57 / 8.617e-5 = approx 99400 K.

Wait, 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ 8.57 * (1 / 8.617e-5) ≈ 8.57 * 11602 ≈ 99,400 K. Hmm, which is about 1e5 K.

So (ΔE)/(k) ≈ 99400 K.

Now, compute the term (1/T2 - 1/T1):

T1 = 60
