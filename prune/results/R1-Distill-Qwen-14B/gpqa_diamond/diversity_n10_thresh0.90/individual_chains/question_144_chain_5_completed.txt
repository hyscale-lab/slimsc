--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given values are E_X =8 GeV, mass m_X=1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X=320 MeV. The options are A to D, with some numbers in meters, so it's a decay length problem.

Wait, right, the mean decay distance (or mean proper decay length) depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime gamma factor times beta. Or wait, no, maybe it's the lifetime multiplied by the velocity times the speed of light. Wait, let me think again.

The mean decay distance L is given by L = γβcτ, where τ is the proper lifetime, γ is the Lorentz factor, β is the velocity over c, and c is the speed of light. But wait, I remember another way. Alternatively, L is c multiplied by the lifetime, but considering the particle's speed. Wait, no, because the lifetime as measured in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. So, the proper lifetime τ is hbar over the width Γ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but Γ is the decay width, which is related to the lifetime. The uncertainty principle tells us that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. For a resonance, Γ is the uncertainty in energy, so the lifetime τ is approximately ħ/(Γ). But I'm not entirely certain about the exact formula here. Let me check.

Yes, the mean proper lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. Because Γ is the decay width, which is the total energy uncertainty of the particle. So τ = ħ/(Γ). And Γ is given in MeV. But wait, I need to work in consistent units. So I should convert everything into SI units, probably.

But another approach: the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime. The formula is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. Got it.

Once I have τ, I need to find the lifetime in the lab frame. But wait, no, L is the distance traveled before decaying. So the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. The lab frame measures the lifetime as γτ, because of the Lorentz factor. So the distance L is velocity times time, which is v * (γτ). But v is beta times c. So L = βγ c τ.

Wait, another way: L = v * t, where t is the lifetime in the lab frame. v is beta c. t is gamma tau. So L = beta c gamma tau.

Alternatively, since gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), and beta is v/c.

So putting it all together: L = beta gamma c tau.

But tau is (hbar)/(Gamma). So, L = beta gamma c (hbar / Gamma).

Wait, but I can also express beta gamma as (E)/(m c^2). Because, for a relativistic particle, E = gamma m c^2, and the momentum p = gamma beta m c. But another relation is beta gamma = E/(m c^2). Because E = gamma m c^2, so beta gamma = E/(m c^2).

Wait, wait. Let me think about that. E = gamma m c^2. So gamma = E/(m c^2). Also, beta = v/c. So beta gamma = (v/c) * gamma. Alternatively, beta gamma = (E^2 - (pc c)^2 )^(1/2) / (m c^2) ) ? Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute beta and gamma separately. But I don't have the momentum. Alternatively, since E is given, and m is given, maybe I can find beta from (E, m, p). Because, E^2 = (pc c)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4. Then, p = sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) )/(c^2). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, let me see. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So E is much larger than m, which means relativistic. Let's compute beta and gamma.

E = gamma m c^2. So gamma = E / (m c^2). Let's compute that.

But wait, units: E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c²? Because mass energy is E = mc². So, the units need to be handled correctly.

Wait, let's convert E and m to consistent units. Let's use GeV and GeV/c² for mass.

So, E = 8 GeV. m = 1.2 GeV/c².

So gamma = E / (m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV/c² * c²) ) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So approximately 6.6667.

Wait, so gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So 6 and two-thirds.

But then, beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Because gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So 1 - beta^2 = 1/gamma^2 → beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

So gamma is 6.666..., so gamma squared is (6.666...)^2 = 44.444... So 1/gamma² is 1/44.444 = 0.0225. Therefore, 1 - 1/gamma² is 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Wait, let me calculate that. 0.9775 → square root is approximately 0.9887. Because 0.9887^2 is about (0.99)^2 is 0.9801, so 0.9887^2 is 0.9775. Yeah.

So beta is about 0.9887.

So from earlier, L = beta gamma c tau.

Tau is hbar / Gamma.

Gamma is given as 320 MeV. But wait, units: Gamma is in MeV, which is energy. So tau is hbar (in units of GeV s or something) divided by Gamma (in GeV).

Wait, but I need to make sure units are consistent.

Let me think about the constants.

hbar (ħ) is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, and ħ is about 197.33 MeV·fm, but I think I'll just use ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.320 GeV.

So tau = ħ / Gamma = 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.320 GeV = (6.582 / 0.320) * 1e-25 s.

6.582 / 0.320 is approximately 20.56875. So tau ≈ 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582/0.32) * 1e-25 ≈ 20.56875 * 1e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So tau ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

Now, L = beta gamma c tau.

Beta is approximately 0.9887, gamma is 6.66667.

So beta gamma = 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.5913.

c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So L = 6.5913 * 3e8 m/s * tau.

But tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So plugging in: 6.5913 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

Multiply 6.5913 * 3e8 = 6.5913 * 3e8 = 1.97739e9.

Then multiply by 2.056875e-24 s:

1.97739e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 1.97739e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.97739 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

Let me compute 1.97739 * 2.056875.

Approximately: 2 * 2 is 4, but more accurately:

1.97739 * 2.056875.

Let me compute:

1.97739 * 2 = 3.95478.

1.97739 * 0.056875 ≈ approx 0.1123 (because 1.97739 *0.05 is about 0.0988, 0.006875 is about 0.0135. So total about 0.1123.)

So total is approximately 3.95478 + 0.1123 ≈ 4.067.

So 4.067 * 1e-15 meters. So L ≈4.067e-15 meters.

Looking at the options: option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. Option C is 5.02e-15, which is a bit larger.

Wait, perhaps I made an approximation in the earlier steps. Let me recheck the exact calculation.

Wait, let's compute beta gamma more accurately.

Gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666... So exactly 20/3.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))).

Gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.444444.

So 1 - 1/(44.444444) = 1 - 0.0225 ≈ 0.9775.

Wait, but 1/(400/9) =9/400=0.0225. Correct.

So sqrt(0.9775) = let me calculate with more precision.

sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887, but let me see:

0.9887^2 = (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = approx 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0087 + 0.0087^2 = 0.9604 + 0.0172 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.97767569.

But our value is 0.9775, which is a bit less. So maybe beta is approximately 0.9886 or so.

But perhaps it's better to compute 0.9887^2=0.97757, which is 0.97757. The actual target is 0.9775, so it's a tiny bit less. Let's say beta is approx 0.9887 - a small fraction.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775):

We can use the Taylor expansion for sqrt(a) around a=1.

Wait, 0.9775 is 0.0225 below 1. Hmm, maybe use the binomial expansion.

sqrt(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2 - x²/8 - ... for small x.

x is 0.0225.

So sqrt(0.9775) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) ≈ 1 - (0.0225)/2 - (0.0225)^2/(8).

Compute terms:

0.0225/2 = 0.01125.

(0.0225)^2 = 0.00050625. Divided by 8 is 0.00006328125.

So sqrt ≈1 - 0.01125 = 0.98875, minus 0.00006328 → 0.9886867.

So about 0.988687.

So beta ≈0.988687.

Gamma is 6.6666667.

So beta gamma = 0.988687 *6.6666667.

Let me compute that:

0.988687 *6 =5.932122.

0.988687 *0.6666667= approx 0.659124667.

Adding: 5.932122 + 0.659124667 ≈6.59124667.

So beta gamma is approximately 6.59124667.

Now, L = beta gamma * c * tau.

c is 3e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So compute 6.59124667 *3e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Let me compute the factors:

6.59124667 *3e8 = 1.977374e9.

Then, multiply by 2.056875e-24:

1.977374e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.977374 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

1.977374 *2.056875.

Let me compute this accurately.

1.977374 *2 =3.954748.

1.977374 *0.056875.

Let me compute 1.977374 *0.05 = 0.0988687.

1.977374 *0.006875 = ?

0.006875 is 0.006 + 0.000875.

So 1.977374 * 0.006 = 0.011864244.

1.977374 *0.000875 = let's see: 1.977374 *0.0008 =0.0015818992; 1.977374 *0.000075=0.000148303. So total 0.0017302022.

So 0.011864244 + 0.0017302022 = 0.013594446.

So 0.056875 is 0.05 + 0.006875, so the total is 0.0988687 +0.013594446 = 0.112463146.

So total of 1.977374 *2.056875 is 3.954748 +0.112463146 = 4.067211146.

Multiply by 1e-15: 4.067211146e-15 meters.

So L≈4.067e-15 meters.

Looking at the options: option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Hmm, perhaps there was a miscalculation in the exact numbers. Let's double-check the tau calculation.

Tau = ħ / Gamma.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 0.320 GeV (since 320 MeV = 0.320 GeV).

So tau = (6.582e-25) / (0.320) = (6.582 / 0.320) * 1e-25.

6.582 / 0.32 = let's compute that accurately.

0.32 * 20 = 6.4. 6.582 -6.4=0.182.

0.182 /0.32 =0.56875.

So 20 + 0.56875 =20.56875.

So tau=20.56875e-25 s =2.056875e-24 s.

Yes, that was correct.

So the calculation seems correct. The result is approximately 4.067e-15 m. The closest option is B:4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about using the formula L = c * tau * beta gamma.

But perhaps there's a simpler formula that relates all the variables.

Wait, another approach: the mean decay length can be calculated using the formula L = (gamma * beta * c * tau).

Which is the same as before.

Wait, let me make sure all the steps are correct.

E = 8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

So gamma = E/(m c^2) = (8 GeV)/(1.2 GeV) =6.66667. So yes.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) → sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)).

Which is sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64))= sqrt(1-0.0225)=sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887.

So correct.

Tau is hbar / Gamma. So yes, correct.

Thus, the calculation seems solid. So the mean decay distance is approximately 4.067e-15 m, which matches option B:4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but why is the number slightly off? Let me compute the exact value again.

Looking back: 1.977374e9 (from beta gamma * c) multiplied by 2.056875e-24 s (tau).

1.977374e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.977374 *2.056875) * 1e-15.

Compute 1.977374 * 2.056875 precisely.

Let me compute 1.977374 *2.056875:

Break it down:

2.056875 = 2 + 0.05 + 0.006875.

So:

1.977374 *2 = 3.954748.

1.977374 *0.05 = 0.0988687.

1.977374 *0.006875 = ?

Compute 0.006875 = 0.006 + 0.000875.

1.977374 *0.006 = 0.011864244.

1.977374 *0.000875 = let's compute 1.977374 * 0.0008 = 0.0015818992.

1.977374 * 0.000075 = 0.00014830305.

So 0.0015818992 +0.00014830305 = 0.00173020225.

Add to 0.011864244: 0.01359444625.

So 0.05 *1.977374 =0.0988687.

Adding all parts:

3.954748 +0.0988687 =4.0536167.

4.0536167 +0.01359444625 =4.067211146.

So 4.067211146e-15 m.

But the option B is 4.0655e-15. Hmm, that's a slight discrepancy. Perhaps the approximation for beta was a bit off.

Alternatively, maybe using more precise values for beta and gamma could change the outcome. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the tau.

Wait, perhaps the exact value of ħ is different. I used 6.582e-25 GeV s. But to be precise, ħ is approximately 6.582 x10^-25 GeV·s.

Wait, let me check the exact value. The reduced Planck constant is ħ ≈ 197.327 MeV·fm. But converting to GeV and seconds:

1 GeV = 1e3 MeV.

1 fm = 1e-15 m.

So, ħ = 197.327 MeV·fm = 0.197327 GeV · 1e-15 m.

But in terms of seconds, since E = ħ ν → ν = E/ħ. So, 1 GeV corresponds to 1/(0.197327 GeV) =5.05e-3 inverse fm, but perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, in terms of GeV·s, ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. So maybe I should use more precise value, like 6.5823e-25 GeV·s.

Let me recompute tau with that.

Tau = 6.5823e-25 GeV·s / (0.320 GeV) = (6.5823 / 0.320) *1e-25 s.

6.5823 /0.320 = let's compute: 0.320 * 20=6.4, which is 6.5823-6.4=0.1823 left. 0.1823 /0.320 = 0.5696875.

So 20 + 0.5696875=20.5696875.

So tau=2.05696875e-24 seconds.

Now, recompute L = beta gamma * c * tau.

Beta gamma is 6.59124667.

c=3e8 m/s.

So:

6.59124667 *3e8 = 1.977374e9 m/s.

Multiply by tau: 1.977374e9 * 2.05696875e-24.

So, 1.977374e9 * 2.05696875e-24 = (1.977374 *2.05696875) * 1e-15.

Compute 1.977374 *2.05696875.

Let me compute 2.05696875 * 1.977374.

Hmm, perhaps we can compute it as 2 *1.977374 =3.954748.

0.05696875 * 1.977374.

Compute 0.05 *1.977374 = 0.0988687.

0.00696875 *1.977374.

0.006 *1.977374=0.011864244.

0.00096875 *1.977374 ≈0.00096875 *2=0.0019375; but more accurately, 0.00096875 *1.977374≈0.001918.

So 0.011864244 +0.001918≈0.013782244.

So 0.05 part gives 0.0988687 +0.013782244=0.112650944.

So total is 3.954748 (from 2 *1.977374) + 0.112650944=4.067398944.

Thus, 4.067398944e-15 meters.

Which is approximately 4.0674e-15 m.

But the option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Close but not exactly the same. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately the product 1.977374 *2.05696875.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact value of beta is a bit less than I thought. Let me compute beta more accurately.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.144/64) → sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775).

Using a calculator, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.98872654.

Wait, let me compute it precisely.

Compute 0.9887^2=0.97757 (as earlier), but 0.9775 is less.

Let me compute 0.9886^2:

0.9886 *0.9886.

Let me compute 0.98*0.98=0.9604.

0.98 *0.0086 * 2 =0.98 *0.0172=0.016876.

0.0086^2=0.00007396.

So 0.9604 +0.016876=0.977276 + 0.00007396=0.97735.

Which is still above 0.9775.

Wait, wait, no. 0.9886^2 is (0.9886)^2.

Let me compute 0.9886 *0.9886:

Break it down:

= (0.98 + 0.0086) * (0.98 +0.0086)

= 0.98^2 + 2 *0.98 *0.0086 + 0.0086^2.

0.98^2=0.9604.

2 *0.98 *0.0086 = 2 * 0.008428 = 0.016856.

0.0086^2=0.00007396.

Summing: 0.9604 +0.016856=0.977256 + 0.00007396=0.97732996.

Which is about 0.97733, which is less than 0.9775.

So beta is higher than 0.9886. Let's compute for 0.9887.

0.9887^2: let's compute.

= (0.98 + 0.0087)^2.

= 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0087 +0.0087^2.

0.98^2=0.9604.

2*0.98 *0.0087 = 2 * 0.008526=0.017052.

0.0087^2=0.00007569.

Sum: 0.9604 +0.017052=0.977452 +0.00007569=0.97752769.

Which is 0.97752769. But our target is 0.9775.

So 0.9887^2=0.97752769>0.9775. So beta is between 0.9886 and 0.9887.

Let me find x where (0.9886 + x)^2=0.9775.

Let me let x be small.

(0.9886 +x)^2 =0.9775.

We have 0.9886^2=0.97733, as before.

So 0.97733 + 2*0.9886 x +x²=0.9775.

Ignoring x²: 2*0.9886 x ≈0.9775-0.97733=0.00017.

So x≈0.00017/(2*0.9886)=0.00017/(1.9772)= approx 0.000086.

So x≈8.6e-5.

So beta≈0.9886 +0.000086=0.988686.

So beta is approximately 0.988686.

So beta gamma=0.988686 *6.666666667.

Compute this precisely.

0.988686 *6 = 5.932116.

0.988686 * (2/3) = 0.988686 *0.666666667 ≈0.659124.

So total beta gamma =5.932116 +0.659124=6.59124.

So same as before.

So the product beta gamma is 6.59124.

Thus, L =6.59124 *3e8 m/s * 2.05696875e-24 s.

Compute 6.59124 *3e8 =1.977372e9.

Multiply by 2.05696875e-24.

So 1.977372e9 *2.05696875e-24.

Which is (1.977372 *2.05696875) *1e-15.

Compute 1.977372 *2.05696875.

Break it down:

2.05696875=2 +0.05 +0.00696875.

So:

1.977372 *2=3.954744.

1.977372 *0.05=0.0988686.

1.977372 *0.00696875.

Compute 0.00696875 =0.006 + 0.00096875.

1.977372 *0.006 =0.011864232.

1.977372 *0.00096875= approx 0.00191816 (since 2 *0.00096875=0.0019375, but 1.97~ is 0.001918).

So 0.011864232 +0.00191816=0.013782392.

So total:

3.954744 (from 2) +0.0988686 (from 0.05) =4.0536126.

Add 0.013782392 →4.0536126 +0.013782392 =4.067395.

So 4.067395e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.0674e-15 m.

But the option is B:4.0655e-15 m, which is about 4.06e-15. So perhaps a minor discrepancy due to more precise calculations, but the closest is B.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta gamma. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula L = (E c tau )/(m c^2). Because E = gamma m c^2, so gamma= E/(m c^2). So beta gamma = (E^2 - (pc c)^2 )/(m c^2). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another formula for mean decay length is L = (gamma c tau) * beta.

Yes, same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is L = c tau gamma beta.

Yes, same thing.

Hmm. So I think my approach is correct.

So the correct answer should be option B:4.0655e-15 m.


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle,
- \( \Gamma \) is the decay width.

### Step 1: Compute \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is given by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.320 \, \text{GeV} \), we calculate:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.320} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2},
\]

where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). Substituting:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
\]

The velocity fraction \( \beta \) is:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \), we find:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( L \)
The mean decay distance \( L \) is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau.
\]

Substituting \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \), \( \gamma = 6.6667 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = (0.9887)(6.6667)(3 \times 10^8)(2.056875 \times 10^{-24}).
\]

First, compute \( \beta \gamma \):

\[
\beta \gamma = 0.9887 \times 6.6667 \approx 6.5912.
\]

Next, compute \( c \tau \):

\[
c \tau = (3 \times 10^8)(2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16}.
\]

Finally, compute \( L \):

\[
L = (6.5912)(6.170625 \times 10^{-16}) \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated value \( L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B: \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.

ANSWER: B
