Okay, so I have this physics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's think through it.

Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those pesky infinities that pop up in calculations. I remember that when you calculate certain things, like loop diagrams, you end up with integrals that go to infinity. Regularization helps you handle those by introducing a temporary cutoff or some other method to make the math manageable, and then you remove the cutoff in the end.

Looking at the options:

Option A is Superstring Theory. I've heard that string theory is a candidate for a theory of quantum gravity. Wait, quantum gravity usually deals with very high energies, like the Planck scale. String theory incorporates supersymmetry, right? And I think because it's a theory that includes higher dimensions and maybe tames the infinities through the string structure itself. So maybe superstring theory doesn't require regularization because it's inherently finite at high energies. Or does it? I'm not entirely sure. I remember that in string theory, the perturbative expansion doesn't have the same kinds of divergences as in, say, quantum electrodynamics. Or does it?

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that at high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak because of asymptotic freedom. So, at high energies, QCD becomes a perturbative theory. But does it require regularization? Well, in the low-energy regime, QCD is non-perturbative, but when you do calculations, you might still need to regularize loop integrals. Wait, but maybe because it's asymptotically free, the divergences are less severe? Or perhaps it still needs regularization because of the loops. I'm not certain about this. I think QCD does require regularization when doing loop calculations, but perhaps it's more manageable because of the running coupling.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I know that QED is a renormalizable theory. So, it deals with divergences by absorbing them into renormalization constants. But wait, does renormalization require regularization? Yes, because you first regularize the divergent integrals (like using a cutoff, dimensional regularization, etc.), then you absorb the divergences into counterterms. So QED definitely requires regularization. So option C is out because the question is looking for a theory that never requires it.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Classical theories don't have the same issues as quantum ones because they don't involve the same kind of infinities. In classical E&M, you might have things like the self-energy of a charge, which leads to infinities, but those are handled differently. Wait, but in classical theory, you don't do regularization because you don't have the same divergent integrals in the same way as in quantum field theory. Or do you? For instance, in the classical treatment, when calculating the Coulomb potential, you just accept the 1/r potential without worrying about regularization. Or maybe in some formulations, like when dealing with point charges, there are issues, but they aren't treated the same way as in quantum theories. So classical E&M doesn't require regularization because it's a classical theory, not a quantum one.

So putting it all together:

The question is which theory never requires regularization. Regularization is a quantum field theory technique. So any classical theory wouldn't need it. Looking at the options, Option D is the classical version. So the answer is D.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The question is about high energies. So in QED and QCD, at high energies, they're perturbative. But do they require regularization? QED always needs regularization because of loop divergences. QCD might have issues at high energies? No, wait, QCD becomes free at high energies, so maybe the divergences are less. But in practice, when calculating loops, you'd still need to regularize, I think. So even QCD would require regularization.

Superstring theory, being a theory that might not have the same divergences because it's a different framework. Strings have different behavior, maybe they don't have the same loop divergences as point particles. I think in string theory, the higher-order terms don't produce the same kind of divergences because the string has a size (so you don't get things like point-like charges leading to 1/r potentials). Or perhaps, more accurately, superstring theory doesn't require regularization because the theory is finite. Wait, but I'm not sure. Do they have to regularize loops in string theory? Or does it somehow avoid it?

Wait, string theory calculations often use the concept of "perturbative expansion" where you have terms like the sigma model. But in perturbative string theory, the loop expansions involve different structures, so maybe the divergences are tamed. But I'm not certain. I think that in superstring theory, the theory is free from divergences at the perturbative level, or at least, it doesn't require regularization in the same way because the higher dimensions and the string structure make the integrals finite. So maybe superstring theory doesn't require regularization.

Wait, but the question is asking which theory never requires regularization. So if string theory doesn't need it
