Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. I need to find out how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are A through D, with various exponents.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (d) in parsecs, right? So plx = 1/d. That means as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The problem says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So that's N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Wait, wait, wait. So N is inversely proportional to plx to the fifth. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N would be proportional to (d)^5, because 1/( (1/d) )^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So are they asking for the derivative, like the rate of change of N with respect to d?

Oh, right! Because the number of stars per unit distance would be the derivative dN/dr. So if N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr is 5d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (like the density) would increase with the fourth power of distance.

Wait, let me think again. The number of stars is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, N ∝ d^5. So N = k d^5, where k is some constant.

But the question is about the change in number with distance. So per unit distance, like how many more stars you get when you go a little further. That's the derivative—dN/dr.

So taking the derivative of N with respect to d (since r is distance), dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (the density) is proportional to d^4.

Wait, but wait. The question says "how does the number of stars in that region change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So the change in number of stars with distance is the derivative. So if N is proportional to d
