Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. That must mean something about their temperatures? Oh right, because the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law, which is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. Actually, I think I remember that if two stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures are the same. Because Wien's Law is lambda_max * T = constant. So yes, if lambda_max is same, T is same.

Now, the problem says the astronomers calculated the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. The options are various numbers like 2.25, 2.32, etc.

I need to find the ratio of Luminosities, L1/L2.

Luminosity for a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Since both are black bodies, that applies.

So L1/L2 would be (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) because the 4πσ cancels out.

Given R1 = 1.5 R2 and T1 = T2, because the peak wavelengths are same.

So substituting: ( (1.5 R2 )² * (T2)^4 ) / (R2² (T2)^4 ) ) = ( (2.25 R2²) ) / R2² ) = 2.25.

Wait, so that's 2.25. So the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2. So the ratio is 2.25.

But wait, the options have 2.25 as option A, 2.32 as B, 2.35 as C, and 2.23 as D.

But then, the problem says something about radial velocities. Oh wait, Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Oh wait, but how does that affect the calculation?

Hmm. Because the radial velocity is the speed at which the star is moving towards or away from us. But when calculating luminosity, I think it's intrinsic to the star. Unless they are talking about Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelength, but the question already said that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the Doppler shift is accounted for in the observed wavelength, but the intrinsic temperature is the same?

Wait, or maybe the radial velocity affects the measured temperature? Because if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, which would shift the peak wavelength. But in the problem, the measured peak wavelengths are the same. So perhaps the temperature calculated by astronomers is corrected for the Doppler shift.

Wait, another angle: the observed wavelength is lambda_observed = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), but if the stars are moving, this could shift the observed wavelength. But in this problem, the observed peak wavelengths are same. So does that mean their rest wavelengths are same, but their velocities are causing shifts? But that can't be, because if their rest wavelengths are same, their temperatures would be same. Or perhaps the velocities are causing the observed wavelengths to be same, but their intrinsic temperatures are different.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The problem says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed lambda_max is same for both. But if the star is moving, the observed wavelength is different from the rest wavelength. So the calculation of temperature would be affected by the Doppler shift.

So to find the intrinsic temperature, the observed wavelength would be T_obs = T_rest * (1 + v_r/c), assuming non-relativistic speeds. Wait, but wait, the Doppler effect for wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. If the star is moving away, v_r is positive, and lambda_obs is longer. If moving towards, v_r is negative, and lambda_obs is shorter.

But in this problem, the observed lambda_max is same for both stars. So for each star, their lambda_rest would be different, because their velocities are different.

But wait, the problem says that the stars have same observed lambda_max. So, for Star_1, which has radial velocity 0, the observed lambda_max is same as its rest lambda_max. Because v_r is zero. So for Star_1, lambda_max (observed) = lambda_rest1.

For Star_2, which has v_r = 700 km/s, perhaps moving away from us. So its observed lambda_max is longer than its rest lambda_max.

Wait, but in this problem, both stars have same observed lambda_max. So:

lambda_1_obs = lambda_2_obs.

But lambda_1_obs is equal to lambda_1_rest, because v_r1 is zero.

And lambda_2_obs = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v_r2 / c), but wait, no. Let me recall the correct Doppler shift formula.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when moving away is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is positive when moving away.

Wait, but in reality, the exact formula is lambda_obs / lambda_rest = sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ) for relativistic speeds, but for small velocities (v << c), this approximates to 1 + v_r / c.

But in this problem, the velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. Let's calculate if 700 km/s is significant compared to c (speed of light).

The speed of light is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700 km/s is about 0.0023c. So non-relativistic approximation is probably fine.

So for Star_2, which has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, but we don't know the direction. Wait, the problem states that Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s, but it doesn't say the direction. Hmm. But the observed lambda_max is same as Star_1's.

Wait, but Star_1's radial velocity is 0, so lambda_1_obs = lambda_1_rest. So for Star_2, lambda_2_obs must also be equal to lambda_1_rest. So:

lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v_r2 / c).

Wait, but that's only if the star is moving away. If moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter.

Wait, but in the problem, Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s. But we don't know the direction. If it's moving towards us, v_r2 would be negative, but let's see.

But the problem just states radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s. It doesn't specify whether the 700 is moving away or towards. Hmm. This could be a point of confusion.

Wait, the question says "radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively." Radial velocity is the component along the line of sight. So a positive velocity could mean moving away, negative towards. But without knowing the sign, perhaps the problem assumes that Star_2 is moving away? Or perhaps the direction doesn't matter because it's the magnitude that affects the calculation.

Wait, but in any case, the observed lambda_max for both stars is same. So:

For Star_1: lambda1_obs = lambda1_rest.

For Star_2: lambda2_obs = lambda2_rest * (1 + v_r2 / c), assuming v_r2 is positive (moving away).

But since lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs, we have:

lambda1_rest = lambda2_rest * (1 + v_r2 / c )

But for a black body, lambda_rest is inversely proportional to temperature: lambda_rest = b / T.

So:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Simplifying, T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2 / c )

So T1 = T2 * [ 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c ) ].

But wait, v_r2 is 700 km/s. Let me compute v_r2 / c.

v_r2 is 700 km/s, c is 3e5 km/s. So v
