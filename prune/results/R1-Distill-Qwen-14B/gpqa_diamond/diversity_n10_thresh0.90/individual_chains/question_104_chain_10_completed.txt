Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth as the planet orbits it, and we can detect this movement through shifts in the spectral lines.

The question says there are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. So the planets have similar masses, and the stars are identical. The planets are in circular orbits, which probably simplifies the calculations because eccentricity isn't a factor here.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, no, wait. Oh no, actually, the shifts are periodic. So the star's velocity is what's causing the shift. The RV method measures the star's velocity, right? The velocity semi-amplitude, K, is the maximum speed the star moves towards or away from us.

So the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by: 

K = ( (G * (M_p^3) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 * (1 - e^2) ) )^0.5 ) * ( (1 + M_* / M_p ) )^(-1) ) * ( sin i )

Wait, actually, I think the formula might be a bit different. Let me think. Oh right, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (P/(2π)) )^(-1/3) ) ] * [ ( (1 + M_* / M_p )^(-2/3) ) ) ] * ( sin i )

Wait, maybe I should look it up. Oh wait, in my mind I recall that the main formula for K is:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p) ) / (M_*) )^(1/3) * (P/(2π)) )^(-1/3) ) ] * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ) * sin i

But since the orbits are circular, e=0, so the term sqrt(1 - e²) is 1. Also, the inclination i for RV method is usually 90 degrees, so sin i is 1. So actually, the formula simplifies a bit.

Wait, another way: the RV semi-amplitude K can be expressed as:

K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (c) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ) * ( 1 / (P)^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps I should get the formula right. Alternatively, another version I've heard is:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2 * pi * c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_* + M_p )^(2/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²) )

But since e is zero, that last term is 1. Also, if the planet mass is much smaller than the star, M_* >> M_p, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so the formula might simplify.

Wait, but in this problem, both stars have masses similar to the Sun, and the planets have masses similar to Neptune. Let me check: Neptune's mass is about 17 Earth masses. The Sun's mass is about 333,000 Earth masses, so the planet's mass is much smaller than the star. So M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and since both stars are the same mass, we can treat M_* as the same for both.

So, the formula for K can be approximated as:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) c ) ) * ( 1 / (P^(1/3)) )

Wait, actually, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to think about the relation between K, the orbital period, and the mass of the planet.

Wait, another approach: the RV method is measuring the star's velocity. The velocity amplitude K is related to the planet's mass and the orbital period. Let's see, the formula that connects K, the orbital period P, and the masses.

The formula I recall is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G ) / (2 c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But again, with e=0 and i=90 degrees, sin i is 1.

Alternatively, I think the correct formula is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( 2 * pi / P )^(-1/3 ) ) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(1/2) )

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the equation: K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) )^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, wait, another approach. The RV method equation is:

K = [ ( (G * M_p^3 ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 ) ) * (1 / (c^3)) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(P/(2π)))^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's think about the key factors.

The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) )^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, no, because K is related to the velocity, which depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period.

Wait, another approach: Kepler's third law. The orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a and the sum of the masses. But the RV method relates the velocity of the star to the planet's orbit.

The star's velocity K is related to the planet's velocity v, but since the star and planet orbit their mutual center of mass, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So, K = (M_p / (M_* + M_p)) ) * v_p, where v_p is the planet's orbital speed.

But since M_* >> M_p, K ≈ (M_p / M_*) ) * v_p.

But v_p is given by the circular orbit velocity: v_p = sqrt( G (M_* + M_p) / a ), where a is the orbital radius.

But since M_* >> M_p, a ≈ a_p, and v_p ≈ sqrt( G M_* / a_p )

So, K ≈ (M_p / M_*) ) * sqrt( G M_* / a_p )

So, K ≈ M_p / sqrt( M_* a_p )

But wait, from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 π² / G M_*) ) a_p^3.

So, a_p^3 = (G M_* P^2 )/(4 π² )

So, a_p = [ ( G M_* P^2 )/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Substituting back into K:

K ≈ M_p / sqrt( M_* [ ( G M_* P^2 )/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3) )

Simplify the denominator:

sqrt( M_* ) * [ ( G M_* P^2 )/(4 π² ) ]^(1/6 )

Which is [ M_* ]^(1/2) * [ G M_* P^2/(4 π²) ]^(1/6 )

Combine exponents:

[ M_* ]^(1/2 + 1/6 ) * [ G P^2/(4 π²) ]^(1/6 )

1/2 is 3/6, so 3/6 +1/6 =4/6=2/3. So M_*^(2/3 )

Similarly, the other term: [ G P^2/(4 π²) ]^(1/6 )

So,

Denominator: M_*^(2/3) * [ G P^2/(4 π²) ]^(1/6 )

Putting back into K:

K = M_p / [ M_*^(2/3) * ( G P^2 )^(1/6) / (4 π² )^(1/6) ) ]

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too involved. Maybe a better approach is to set up a ratio between the two planets.

We have two planets, 1 and 2, with the same M_p (Neptune mass) and same M_* (Sun mass), but different K1 and K2.

We need to find the ratio of their orbital periods, P2 / P1.

We can write the equation for K for each planet:

K1 = (some constant) * ( M_p )^(1/3) / ( M_* )^(1/3) * ( 1 / P1^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) ≈ ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P)) )^(1/3) ) * ( 2 pi / c )^(1/3) )

Wait, no, maybe it's better to use the formula:

K = [ ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2 pi ) / P )^(1/3) ) ] * (1 / c )

Wait, that might not be right. Another approach: the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (2 pi G) / (c^3) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) ) ) * ( 1 / sqrt(1 - e²) )

Since sin i is 1 and e=0, this simplifies to:

K = ( (2 pi G ) / c^3 )^(1/3) * ( M_p ) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, that seems more accurate. So K is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / P^(1/3) )

But wait, since M_p is the same for both planets, and M_* is the same for both stars, the ratio of K2 to K1 would be (1 / (P2/P1)^(1/3) )

Wait, let me write that as:

K1 = C * ( M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) * ( 1 / P1^(1/3) )

K2 = C * ( M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) * (1 / P2^(1/3) )

So, taking the ratio:

K2 / K1 = (1 / P2^(1/3) ) / (1 / P1^(1/3) ) )

Which is ( P1^(1/3) ) / ( P2^(1/3) ) )

So,

K2 / K1 = ( P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

We can rearrange this to solve for P2 / P1.

Let me take the reciprocal:

( K1 / K2 ) = ( P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Wait, no, wait. Let me recompute.

Wait, from above:

K2 / K1 = ( P1^(1/3) ) / ( P2^(1/3) )

So,

(K2 / K1) = (P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

Taking both sides to the power of 3:

(K2 / K1)^3 = (P1 / P2 )

So,

P2 = P1 * (K2 / K1 )^3 / 1

Wait, wait no, because:

If (K2/K1) = (P1/P2)^(1/3),

then (K2/K1)^3 = P1/P2,

so P2 = P1 * (K1 / K2)^3.

Wait, let me correct this.

Wait, let's re-express.

We have:

K2 / K1 = (P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

So,

( K2 / K1 )^3 = P1 / P2

So,

P2 = P1 * ( K1 / K2 )^3

Because if you move P2 to the other side:

P2 = P1 / ( (K2/K1)^3 )

Which is same as P1 * ( K1 / K2 )^3.

So, P2 is equal to P1 multiplied by ( K1 / K2 )^3.

Wait, but in the question, what do we have?

Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstrom, Planet #2 has 7. So K1 is 5, K2 is7. So K2 is larger than K1.

So,

P2 = P1 * (K1 / K2)^3 = P1 * (5/7)^3.

So, the ratio P2 / P1 is (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

Wait, but wait, no, because the question is: how many times longer is P2 than P1? So the ratio is P2 / P1.

Which is (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So, P2 is about 0.36 times the length of P1, meaning it's shorter. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter.

But the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1? So the ratio is 0.36 times, meaning it's about 0.36 times as long. So P2 is shorter.

So the answer is approximately 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let's think about the relation between K and P.

If K is larger, that would mean the star is moving faster. For a larger K, with the same M_p and M_*, what does that imply about P?

From K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3), so if K increases, P must decrease. So if K2 > K1, then P2 must be less than P1.

So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, so the period of planet #2 is shorter. So the answer is option A, which is ~0.36.


The radial velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift caused by a planet's gravitational pull on its host star. The semi-amplitude of the RV signal, \( K \), is related to the orbital period \( P \) of the planet through the formula:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that both stars have the same mass and both planets have the same mass, the ratio of the orbital periods \( P_2 / P_1 \) can be determined using the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes \( K_2 / K_1 \). From the relationship above:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( P_2 / P_1 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

The problem states that \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it is shorter. The question asks how many times longer \( P_2 \) is than \( P_1 \), so the ratio is approximately 0.36.

**Critical analysis of options:**

- **A) ~0.36**: This matches the calculated ratio and is correct.
- **B) ~1.40**: This is incorrect, as it does not align with the relationship between \( K \) and \( P \).
- **C) ~1.96**: This is incorrect, as it overestimates the ratio.
- **D) ~0.85**: This is incorrect, as it underestimates the ratio.

The correct answer is **A) ~0.36**.
