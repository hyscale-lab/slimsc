Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

So the setup is an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each is 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about any kinetic energy or anything like that.

Out of these 13 charges, 12 are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I'm supposed to find the minimum energy of this system.

Wait, the system's energy—I think it's the electric potential energy. Since the charges are all the same, they'll either all repel each other or attract. But since they're all 2e, which is positive, they'll repel each other. So the potential energy will be positive because you have to do work to bring them together.

But wait, the system is isolated, so energy can't be added or taken away from outside. Hmm, but the question is about the minimum energy. Oh, maybe I need to think about the configuration that gives the lowest possible potential energy.

Wait, potential energy in a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. Since all charges are the same, I can compute the potential energy between each pair and sum them all up.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So let's think about the system. The 13th is at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of those 12 is 2m from P, but what about the distance between the 12 charges themselves?

Hmm, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So their positions are all on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P. But are they all at the same point on that sphere? Probably not. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify their exact arrangement. Oh, but for the minimum energy, what configuration would that be?

Wait, the potential energy between two point charges is (k q1 q2)/r. Since all the charges are the same, the potential energy of each pair will be k*(2e)^2 / r, where r is the distance between the two charges.

But wait, the 12 charges are all at 2m from P, but the distance between any two of them isn't given. Wait, but this is a bit ambiguous. Maybe the 12 are all at the surface of a sphere with radius 2m, but their mutual distances aren't specified. So perhaps the problem assumes that the 12 are all at the same point, but that can't be right because then they'd all be on top of each other, leading to infinite repulsion. No, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the 13th charge is fixed, and the 12 are each at 2m from it, but the distance between any two of the 12 isn't specified. So maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th charge, plus the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

Wait, but without their mutual distances, I can't compute the sum of all their mutual potential energies. Hmm, this is a problem. Maybe the 12 are all at the same point 2m away from P. But that would cause their mutual distance to be zero, which would make their potential energy infinite. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged symmetrically in a way that the distance between any two is something else. Wait, maybe it's a regular dodecahedron or something, but without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to compute their mutual distances. Hmm, perhaps the question is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the other 12, and not their mutual interactions. But that seems unlikely because the system's potential energy would include all pairs.

Wait, the problem says it's the minimum energy. So perhaps the other 12 are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energies are minimized. Oh wait, but since they're all positive charges, the potential energy between any two is positive and would be minimized when the distance between them is as large as possible. But if they're constrained to stay at 2m from P, perhaps their mutual distances can't be controlled here. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is only considering the potential energies between each of the 12 and the 13th charge, not between the 12 themselves. Because without their mutual arrangement, it might be impossible to calculate, unless the mutual distances are considered to be at a minimum, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again. The 13th is fixed at P. The other 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So each of these 12 is at radius 2 m from P. So the distance from each of these 12 to the 13th charge (at P) is 2 m. So the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12 is (k*(2e)*(2e))/2m.

But what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Since each pair among the 12 would contribute some energy. Without knowing their mutual distances, I can't compute that. Hmm. Unless the problem is only asking about the potential energy of the 13th charge with the other 12. But that doesn't make sense because the minimum energy of the entire system would include all possible interactions.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that's impossible because they'd all be overlapping, leading to infinite potential energy. No, that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the 12 are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are such that all are as far as possible, perhaps forming a regular dodecahedron. But without knowing that, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energies between each of the 12 and the 13th, the one at P.

Wait, but the problem says "the minimum energy of this system". So perhaps the system's energy is the sum of the potential energies between each of the 12 and the 13th, plus the potential energies between each pair of the 12. But without knowing the mutual distances, I can't compute the latter part. So perhaps the problem is only considering the 12 and the 13th, and not the mutual energies of the 12.

Alternatively, maybe the 12 are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy is zero, but that's impossible because all charges are positive, so they repel each other, leading to positive potential energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th. Let me see what the options are. The options are all in the order of 1e-26, except D which is 122.330, which seems way too big.

Wait, the charge is 2e each. So each charge is 2 times the elementary charge, which is about 1.6e-19 coulombs. So 2e is 3.2e-19 C.

So for each pair between the 13th and the others, the potential energy is (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2 m), where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Let me compute that. So:

Potential energy per pair (between 13th and each of the 12) is:

U = k * (2e)^2 / r

Where r is 2m.

So k is approximately 8.988e9.

(2e) is 2 * 1.6e-19 C = 3.2e-19 C.

So (2e)^2 = (3.2e-19)^2 = 10.24e-38 C².

So U per pair is (8.988e9) * (10.24e-38) / (2) meters.

Wait, 2 meters is the distance.

So let's compute that:

8.988e9 * 10.24e-38 = approximately 9.224e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.612e-28 J.

But wait, that's per pair. Since there are 12 such pairs, total from the 13th charge would be 12 * 4.612e-28 = let's see: 12 * 4.612e-28 = 5.534e-27 J.

But that's only the potential energy between the 13th and the 12 others. What about the potential energy between the 12 others themselves?

Ah, right, because each of the 12 charges also interact with each other. So for each pair among the 12, we have another potential energy term.

The number of pairs among 12 is (12 * 11)/2 = 66.

Each of these pairs has a potential energy of k*(2e)^2 / r, where r is the distance between them. But wait, the problem didn't specify the distance between any two of the 12. So perhaps this part is missing, but maybe the problem is only considering the potential energies between the 13th charge and the 12 others.

Wait, but that would make the total energy much smaller than the options given. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 5.645 x 10^-26

B) 2.822 x 10^-26

C) 7.056 x 10^-27

D) 122.330

So, my calculation earlier for just the 13th and the 12 others gave about 5.5e-27 J. That's close to option C, which is 7.056e-27, but not exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me redo the calculation more accurately.

Compute U_per_pair = k * (2e)^2 / r.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C²

(2e)^2 = (2 * 1.602e-19 C)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 = approximately 1.026e-37 C².

r is 2 m.

So U_per_pair = (8.988e9) * (1.026e-37) / 2.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 * 1.026e-37 = let's calculate 8.988 * 1.026 = approximately 9.227. So 9.227e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.6135e-28 J per pair.

Number of pairs is 12, so 12 * 4.6135e-28 = 5.536e-27 J.

Hmm, that's about 5.536e-27 J.

But the options don't have that. Wait, option B is about 2.82e-26, which is about 5 times bigger than my value. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 1.27 times my value.

Hmm, maybe I missed something. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th and the 12 others, and not the mutual energy between the 12. If that's the case, then the answer would be around 5.5e-27 J, but that's not one of the options. The closest options are C (7e-27) and B (2.8e-26).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute more precisely.

Compute U_per_pair:

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

(2e) = 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-19 C.

So (2e)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 = (3.204)^2 * 1e-38.

3.204 squared is about 10.265, so 10.265e-38 C².

So U_per_pair = (8.988e9) * (10.265e-38) / 2.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 * 10.265e-38.

8.988 * 10.265 ≈ 92.38 (because 8 *10 is 80, 8*.265≈2.12, 0.988*10≈9.88, 0.988*.265≈0.262. So total approx 80+2.12+9.88+0.262 ≈ 92.26). So 92.26e-29, because 1e9 * 1e-38 is 1e-29.

Wait, no, 8.988e9 * 10.265e-38 = 8.988 *10.265 * 1e9 *1e-38 = (approx 92.26) *1e-29 = 9.226e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.613e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 4.613e-28 *12 = 5.535e-27 J.

So that's about 5.535e-27 J.

Hmm, but that's not any of the options except close to option C, which is 7.056e-27. Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 because of the charges being 2e instead of e.

Wait no, because I already accounted for (2e)^2. So perhaps the problem is considering the mutual energy between the 12 charges as well. Because if I don't include that, the total energy is 5.5e-27, which is not an option, but when including mutual energy, maybe it's higher.

Wait, but without knowing the distances between the 12, I can't compute their mutual potential energy. So perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th and the 12 others. So why isn't that one of the options?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me check the exponents again.

Wait, 1e-19 squared is 1e-38, correct. So 3.2e-19 squared is 10.24e-38, correct. So 8.988e9 * 10.24e-38 = 8.988 *10.24 = approximately 92.29, so 92.29e-29 is 9.229e-28. Divided by 2 is 4.614e-28. Multiply by 12 gives 5.5368e-27 J.

So that's about 5.537e-27 J. But none of the options match that. Wait, the options are:

A) 5.645e-26

B) 2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330

Hmm, 5.5e-27 is roughly between option C (7e-27) and none of the others. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs.

Wait, the 13th charge is fixed. So the 12 others are each interacting with the 13th, and each other. So perhaps the mutual interactions are also present.

Wait, but without their distances, I don't know. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual interactions are zero because they're arranged in a way that their mutual distances are 2m as well. But that's not possible because they're all at 2m from P, but their mutual distances could be more or less than 2m, depending on the arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the mutual distance between any two of the 12 is 2m as well. Like, all 12 are equally spaced on a sphere of radius 2m, and their mutual distances are all the same. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's impossible to calculate. Alternatively, perhaps each pair among the 12 is at 2m apart, which is the same as their distance from P. But that's not possible because for a point on a sphere of radius r, the maximum distance between two points is 2r. Wait, if you have 12 points on a sphere of radius r, their mutual distances can vary, but in the most symmetric arrangement, perhaps the minimal case is that each is as far as possible from each other, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distance is the same as their distance from P. But that doesn't make sense because the distance from P is 2m, but the distance between two points on a sphere of radius 2m would be at least 0 (if they're at the same spot) and up to 4m (diametrically opposite). But without more information, we can't calculate the exact value.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12 others, and not the mutual energy between the 12. If that's the case, the energy would be 5.535e-27 J, which is not exactly an option, but perhaps the answer is option C:7.056e-27. But why?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, (2e)^2 is (2 * 1.602e-19)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 = (3.204)^2 * 1e-38. 3.204^2 is approximately 10.265, so 10.265e-38.

Multiply by k:8.988e9 * 10.265e-38 = 8.988 *10.265 = let's compute that accurately.

8 *10 is 80, 8 *0.265=2.12, 0.988*10=9.88, 0.988*0.265≈0.262. So 80 + 2.12 +9.88 +0.262=92.26.

So 92.26e-29 (since 1e9 * 1e-38=1e-29).

Wait, 92.26e-29 is 9.226e-28.

Divide by 2 m: 9.226e-28 / 2 =4.613e-28 per pair.

Multiply by 12 pairs: 4.613e-28 * 12 =5.5356e-27 J.

So that's about 5.536e-27 J.

But none of the given options match this. Closest is option C at 7.056e-27, but that's higher. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering all possible pairs, including the 13th and the others, but perhaps I missed a factor.

Wait, no, because the 13th is fixed, so each of the 12 charges is at 2m from it, so each pair contributes U = k*(2e)^2 /2m.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the energy as the sum of all pairs, including the 13th with the 12, and all pairs among the 12.

But without knowing the mutual distances between the 12, I can't calculate that part. So perhaps the problem is only considering the 13th and the 12, and the answer is approximately 5.536e-27 J, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of electrons. Wait, the problem says 13 identical particles each with charge 2e. So each has charge 2e, so when computing potential energy between two, it's (2e)^2.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the number of pairs correctly. The 13th charge interacts with each of the 12, so 12 pairs. The 12 others interact among themselves in (12 choose 2) =66 pairs. So the total number of pairs is 12 +66 =78.

Wait, but without knowing the distances for those 66 pairs, I can't compute their contributions. So the problem must be considering only the 12 pairs between the 13th and the others.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question where the mutual energy between the 12 is zero, but that's not possible.

Wait, another thought: maybe the 12 charges are arranged symmetrically around P, such that their mutual potential energies cancel out? No, that's impossible because all are positive, so their mutual potential energies would add up.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th, and that's the total energy. So according to my calculation, that's 5.536e-27 J. But none of the options match that.

Looking at the options again:

Option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 1.27 times my value. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, e is 1.6e-19 C, so 2e is 3.2e-19. Squared is 10.24e-38, correct. So (2e)^2 =10.24e-38 C².

So U per pair is k * (2e)^2 / r. So:

8.988e9 * 10.24e-38 = let's compute this more precisely.

8.988e9 = 8.988 *1e9.

10.24e-38 =1.024 *1e-37.

So 8.988 *1.024 = let's compute:

8 *1.024 =8.192

0.988 *1.024 ≈ 1.011 (since 1*1.024=1.024, minus 0.012 *1.024≈0.012288 → 1.024 -0.012288=1.011712 )

So total is 8.192 +1.011712 ≈9.203712.

So 9.203712e9 *1e-37 =9.203712e-28.

Divide by 2 m: 9.203712e-28 /2 =4.601856e-28 per pair.

Multiply by 12: 4.601856e-28 *12=5.522227e-27 J.

Hmm, still about 5.52e-27 J. So that's my calculation.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th and the 12 others, but the calculation isn't matching any options. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the mutual energy of the 12, but even then, the answer isn't among the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula. The potential energy between two point charges is U = k q1 q2 / r.

But since all are 2e, q1 and q2 are each 2e, so U =k*(2e)*(2e)/(r) =k*(4e²)/r.

Oh wait, wait! I think I made a mistake earlier. I thought (2e)^2 is 4e², but actually, 2e squared is (2e)^2 =4e². But when I computed it earlier, I used 2e as 3.2e-19 C, which is correct. But perhaps I should compute U as k*(2e)^2 * (number of pairs) / r.

Wait, no, because in Coulomb's law, the potential energy between two charges is U =k q1 q2 / r. So for each pair between the 13th and the 12, it's k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) =k*(4e²)/(2m) = 2k e² /m.

Wait, but wait, e is 1.6e-19 C. So let me compute 4e²:

4e² =4*(1.6e-19)^2 =4*(2.56e-38) =1.024e-37 C².

So U per pair is (8.988e9) * (1.024e-37) / (2m).

Wait, but 2m is the distance. So:

8.988e9 * 1.024e-37 = (8.988 *1.024) * 1e-28.

8.988 *1.024 ≈9.216.

So 9.216e-28 divided by 2m is 4.608e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 4.608e-28 *12=5.5296e-27 J.

Same as before, about 5.53e-27 J.

Hmm. So the answer should be approximately 5.53e-27 J. But none of the options match that. Let me look at the options again.

Option B is 2.822e-26, which is ten times larger than 2.8e-26. Wait, 2.822e-26 is 28.22e-27. My calculation is about 5.53e-27, which is about half of option C (7.056e-27).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of charges. Are there 12 pairs or 13? No, because the 13th is fixed, so only 12 pairs.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering each of the 12 charges as being at a distance of 2m from P, but the 13th is at P, and the 12 are arranged in a circle or something. But without knowing the mutual distances, I can't compute their mutual potential energies.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12, and that's the only contribution. So the answer would be approximately 5.5e-27 J, which isn't an option. But maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the problem is using r as 2 meters for all pairs, including the 12 charges themselves. So each of the 12 is 2m from P, and each is 2m from every other charge. But that's impossible because if all 12 are at 2m from P, their mutual distances can't all be 2m. For example, if two are at opposite ends of a diameter, their distance would be 4m, not 2m. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 are arranged in a regular icosahedron or some other shape where each is at 2m from P and the same distance from each other. But without knowing that, it's impossible to compute.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th and the 12 others, and the answer is approximately 5.5e-27 J, but none of the options match. So perhaps the intended solution is different.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for potential energy in a system of charges, considering only the 12 charges and the 13th, but perhaps the 13th is fixed, so only the 12 contribute to the potential energy. No, that doesn't make sense because the 13th is part of the system.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the potential energy of a single charge in an electric field created by others. So the 13th charge is fixed, and the 12 are each in the field of the 13th. So the potential energy would be the sum of each charge's potential energy in the field of the 13th.

Wait, the potential energy of a charge q in an electric potential V is U = q V.

The electric potential at the location of each of the 12 charges due to the 13th charge is V = k (2e) / (2m) = k e / m.

So each of the 12 charges has U = (2e) * V = 2e * (k (2e)/(2m)) ) = (2e) * (k e / m) ) = 2k e² / m.

Wait, let me compute that.

k =8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e=1.6e-19 C.

m=2 meters.

So:

U per charge =2 *8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2 / 2.

Wait, 2 *8.988e9 is 1.7976e10.

Multiply by (1.6e-19)^2: (2.56e-38) → 1.7976e10 *2.56e-38 = 4.598e-28.

Divide by 2 (because m is 2m): 4.598e-28 /2=2.299e-28 J per charge.

Multiply by 12 charges: 2.299e-28 *12=2.7588e-27 J.

Hmm, about 2.76e-27 J, which is close to option B (2.822e-26), but no, it's an order of magnitude smaller.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check again.

The potential at each of the 12 charges due to the 13th charge is V =k (2e) / r, where r is 2m.

So V = (8.988e9) * (3.2e-19 C) / 2 m.

Wait, (8.988e9) * (3.2e-19) = 2.876e-9.

Divide by 2m: 2.876e-9 /2 =1.438e-9 volts.

Then, the potential energy of each charge is U = q V = (2e) * V.

2e is 3.2e-19 C.

So U per charge =3.2e-19 *1.438e-9 =4.6016e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 4.6016e-28 *12=5.5219e-27 J.

Same as before. So about 5.5e-27 J.

But again, none of the options match. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the sum of all possible pairs, but only the 12 and 13th, and the mutual pairs are not considered. But then the answer isn't matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options and see which one matches the calculation if I made a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, my calculation is 5.5e-27 J, which is 5.5 x10^-27 J.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 1.27 times my value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (2e)^2. Let me recheck.

(2e) =3.2e-19 C. So (2e)^2=10.24e-38 C².

Yes, correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for k, like 9e9 instead of 8.988e9. Let me try that.

k=9e9.

So U per pair = (9e9) * (10.24e-38) /2 =9 *10.24e-29 /2=92.16e-29 /2=46.08e-29 =4.608e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by12: 4.608e-28 *12=5.5296e-27 J.

Still same result. So no difference.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be the potential energy between the 13th and the 12 others, which is 5.5e-27 J, but none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer is option B, 2.822e-26, which is ten times larger.

Wait, 5.5e-27 is 0.55e-26, which is about half of option B's 2.8e-26.

Hmm. Perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Wait, 12 pairs, each contributing 4.6e-28, so 5.5e-27.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each pair twice. No, because each pair is counted once.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the 13th charge being at 2m from each, but the other 12 are at a different distance? No, the problem states that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the units.

Wait, 1e-19 C is correct for e. 2e is 3.2e-19 C.

k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

r is 2m.

So the units for U are (N·m²/C²) * (C²) / m → (N·m) → Joules.

Yes, correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Since none of the options match my calculation, perhaps the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27. But why?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent during the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 8.988e9 * 10.24e-38. Let's compute 8.988e9 =8.988 *1e9.

10.24e-38 =1.024 *1e-37.

So 8.988 *1.024 =9.216.

So 9.216 *1e9 *1e-37 =9.216e-28.

Divide by 2:4.608e-28.

Multiply by12:5.5296e-27.

So yes, 5.53e-27.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the problem is expecting us to not consider the 13th charge's potential energy, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy of the system as the work done to bring all the 12 charges to their positions, considering the 13th is fixed. So the energy would be the sum of the potential energies of each charge when placed at 2m from P, considering the existing charges.

Wait, but that's a different approach. Let me think. The first charge (among the 12) brought to 2m from P: since the 13th is fixed, the potential at that point is V =k*(2e)/2m =k e/m.

So the work done to bring the first charge is (2e) * V = (2e) * (k (2e)/(2m)) )= (2e) * (k e/m).

Which is 2k e²/(m).

The second charge: when bringing it, the potential at that point is due to both the 13th charge and the first charge. So V =k*(2e)/2m +k*(2e)/r, where r is the distance between the first and second charge.

But if all the 12 are placed symmetrically, their mutual distances might be the same, but without knowing that, it's impossible to compute. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that all 12 are placed at a distance of 2m from P, but their mutual distances are assumed to be very large, so their mutual potential energies are negligible. But that's unlikely because they're all at the same radius, so their mutual distances can't be that large.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12, and the mutual energies are ignored, leading to the answer being approximately 5.5e-27 J, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option B, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, maybe I should look for any possible miscalculation. Oh! Wait a minute. The problem says each charge is 2e, so the potential energy between two charges is (k * (2e)^2)/(r). But when considering the potential energy of the system, each pair is counted once. So for the 12 charges and the 13th charge, the number of pairs is 12. So the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant, like 9e9, but even then, it doesn't change the order of magnitude.

Hmm. At this point, I think the intended answer is option B, 2.822e-26, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy as 12 times the energy per pair, but using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of U. Let me try using e=1.6e-19 C.

So, (2e)^2= (3.2e-19)^2 =1.024e-37 C².

U per pair = (8.988e9) * (1.024e-37) / 2.

8.988e9 is 8.988 *1e9.

1.024e-37 is 1.024 *1e-37.

Multiply them: 8.988 *1.024 =9.216.

1e9 * 1e-37 =1e-28.

So 9.216e-28.

Divide by 2:4.608e-28.

Multiply by12:5.5296e-27 J.

Still same result.

I think I'm stuck. The correct calculation doesn't match any of the options, but perhaps the intended answer is option B, 2.822e-26. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the 13th charge as being moved into place as well. But no, the 13th is fixed.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the potential energy of a system of charges as (1/2) * sum of U for each pair.

Wait, but in that case, for the 12 charges and the 13th, the total would include the 12 pairs between the 13th and the 12, and the 66 pairs among the 12. But without knowing the mutual distances, I can't compute.

Wait, perhaps the mutual distances are all 2m, but that's impossible as explained earlier. So perhaps the problem is only considering the 12 pairs, leading to 5.5e-27 J, which isn't an option. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Let's think of the system as consisting of the 13th charge and the 12 others. The potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of each of the 12 when placed in the field of the 13th and the other 11.

Wait, but that's a more accurate way to compute it. Let me try.

The first charge: placed at 2m from P. The potential at that point is V =k*(2e)/2m =k e/m.

The work done to bring this charge is U1 = q V =2e * (k e/m) = 2k e²/m.

Second charge: when placing it, the potential at its position is V =k*(2e)/2m +k*(2e)/r, where r is the distance between the first and second charge.

But if all 12 are placed symmetrically, perhaps the mutual distance is 2m as well, but that's impossible as explained earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distance is much larger, making their contributions negligible. But that's not the case.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the energy to be calculated as the sum of the potential energies between each of the 12 and the 13th, which is 12 * U, where U is the potential energy between one pair.

So as before, 5.5e-27 J. But no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the potential energy of a single charge in the field of another, which is U = (k q1 q2)/r. So for each of the 12, it's (k *2e *2e)/2m.

Which is the same as before.

Hmm.

At this point, I think the intended answer is option B, 2.822e-26, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the potential energy as U = (3/2) (k e^2) (n^2 -1)/(n r), where n is the number of charges. But that's a formula I don't recall correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a typo, and the correct answer is option C, 7.056e-27, which is roughly 1.27 times my calculated value. But I'm not sure why.

Wait, let me compute 5.5e-27 is equal to 5.5 x10^-27 J.

Option C is7.056e-27, which is about 28% higher.

Hmm. Perhaps the problem expects using r as 2 meters, but for all pairs, including the mutual ones, but that's impossible without knowing their arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th and the 12 others, but using a different value for e. For example, if e was taken as 1.6e-19 C, but perhaps the problem considers it as 1.6e-19 *2=3.2e-19 C. Wait, no, that's what I did.

Hmm. I think I've exhausted all possibilities. The correct calculation according to my understanding is 5.5e-27 J, but since none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer is option B, 2.822e-26. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges are considered to be zero because they're arranged in a way that their mutual forces cancel out. But that's only possible if they're arranged in a symmetrical pattern, but even then, the potential energy would still be positive because all are positive.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential energies are zero because the charges are arranged in a perfect sphere, but that's not the case.

Hmm.

Well, given the options, I think the intended answer is option B, 2.822e-26 J. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the problem is using the formula for the potential energy of a dipole or something else. But that doesn't make sense here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy as the sum of all possible pairs, including the mutual ones, but assuming they're all at 2m apart. So for the 12 charges, each pair is at 2m, so number of pairs is (12*11)/2 =66.

So total U would be 66 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) +12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) =78 * (k*(4e²))/(2m) =39 * (k*(4e²)/m).

Wait, but wait, no. The 12 charges are each 2m from P, but their mutual distance is not 2m. So this approach is incorrect.

Hmm.

I think I've spent enough time. Based on the calculations, the correct energy should be around 5.5e-27 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 7.056e-27 J, which is close to my calculation if I made a slight error in the number of pairs or the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as twice the value I calculated, leading to option B. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another factor: perhaps the mutual potential energies are being considered as zero because the charges are arranged in a way that their forces cancel, but that's not possible for electric potential energy.

Hmm.

I think I'll go with option B, 2.822e-26, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. The 13th charge interacts with each of the 12, which is 12 pairs. So 12 * U, where U is 4.608e-28 J.

Which gives 5.5296e-27 J.

But option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 1.27 times that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for k, like 9e9 instead of 8.988e9. Let's see:

k=9e9.

So U per pair = (9e9) * (10.24e-38) / 2 =9e9 *5.12e-38 =4.608e-28 J.

Same as before. So no difference.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think the intended answer is option B, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be option C.


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we calculate the total electric potential energy, which includes contributions from the interactions between the 13th charge (fixed at point P) and each of the 12 charges constrained at 2 m from P, as well as the interactions between the 12 charges themselves. However, the problem does not specify the mutual distances between the 12 charges, making it impossible to compute their mutual potential energy directly. Thus, the calculation focuses only on the interactions between the 13th charge and the 12 charges.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Potential Energy Between the 13th Charge and Each of the 12 Charges**:
   - The potential energy between two charges is given by:
     \[
     U = \frac{k \cdot q_1 \cdot q_2}{r}
     \]
     where \(k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2\), \(q_1 = q_2 = 2e\), and \(r = 2 \, \text{m}\).
   - Substituting \(e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\), we find:
     \[
     (2e)^2 = (3.2 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 1.024 \times 10^{-37} \, \text{C}^2
     \]
   - The potential energy for one pair is:
     \[
     U_{\text{pair}} = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (1.024 \times 10^{-37})}{2} = 4.608 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - Since there are 12 such pairs, the total energy contribution from the 13th charge and the 12 charges is:
     \[
     U_{\text{total}} = 12 \cdot 4.608 \times 10^{-28} = 5.5296 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
     \]

2. **Mutual Potential Energy Between the 12 Charges**:
   - The problem does not specify the mutual distances between the 12 charges, so their mutual potential energy cannot be calculated. This leaves ambiguity in the total energy of the system.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (\(5.645 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}\))**: This is significantly larger than the calculated value and is inconsistent with the given data.
- **Option B (\(2.822 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}\))**: This is also much larger than the calculated value and does not match the derived result.
- **Option C (\(7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}\))**: This is closer to the calculated value (\(5.53 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}\)) but about 27% higher, suggesting a possible rounding or approximation in the problem setup.
- **Option D (\(122.330 \, \text{J}\))**: This is orders of magnitude larger than the calculated value and is clearly incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The calculated value for the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12 charges is approximately \(5.53 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}\). While this does not exactly match any of the options, the closest is **Option C (\(7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}\))**, which may account for additional approximations or assumptions in the problem.
