Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. The product is a light yellow solid with an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Hmm, that IR peak is probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone. So what happens when dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH? Oh right, it's an elimination reaction. Since there's two bromines on the adamantane structure, heating with a strong base like KOH would likely lead to dehydrohalogenation. But wait, adamantane is a pretty rigid structure. So maybe it's forming an epoxide or some sort of ring-opening? No, wait, KOH more likely leads to elimination since it's a strong base. So maybe it's forming an alkene via double elimination. Wait, but wait, the product has an IR peak at 1720, which is more indicative of a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, no, when you eliminate two HBr molecules from a dihalide, you can form an alkene. But the IR here doesn't show a peak for C=C (which is around 1650 cm⁻¹). So maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction. But KOH is a base, so substitution might not be the main pathway. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Dieckmann elimination or something else. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a dihalide. Eliminating two equivalents would give a diene? Or maybe an epoxide? Wait, no, because epoxides form from vicinal dihalides, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal; it's 1,3, so maybe elimination to form a triple bond? Hmm, but that's less likely with KOH.

Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an enol, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction leading to a ketone. Wait, if the base abstracts a proton, leading to a bromide leaving, but wait, in KOH, the conditions are for elimination. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination scenario, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think. 1,3-dibromoadamantane: when heated with KOH, perhaps it undergoes a double dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when eliminating two HBr, would form a diene? Or maybe a bridge structure? Wait, the product is a light yellow solid, which is a bit vague, but the IR suggests a carbonyl. So maybe the product is a ketone, not an alkene. So perhaps the reaction is forming a carbonyl via some rearrangement.

Oh! Wait, maybe it's the formation of a diketone. But no, the starting material is a dihalide. Alternatively, perhaps it's a pinacol rearrangement, but that requires a vicinal diol. Hmm, not applicable here.

Wait, another thought: if the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, causing elimination and the formation of a carbonyl group. Oh wait, because in some cases, elimination can lead to formation of a carbonyl if there's a neighboring group. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation with KOH to form an epoxide. But for epoxide formation, the dihalide should be in a vicinal position, like 1,2-dibromo, but here it's 1,3. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction forming an alcohol, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl IR peak. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone formed via some kind of elimination followed by a rearrangement.

Wait, another approach: the product has an IR at 1720, which suggests a carbonyl. The other NMR peaks are at 4.79, 2.41-2.23, and 1.94. So the 4.79 is a doublet of two H, perhaps adjacent to an oxygen. Maybe a CH₂O group. The 2.41-2.23 is a multiplet integrating to 10H, which must be from the adamantane structure, which is known to have multiple equivalent CH₂ groups. The 1.94 is 2H, maybe another set of CH₂ groups, perhaps adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, so putting it together: the product from KOH heating is probably an epoxide? No, because the IR doesn't show the epoxide's C-O-C stretch around 1250 cm⁻¹. Alternatively, perhaps a ketone. So if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH is used, perhaps each Br is replaced by an -OH group, forming 1,3-diol. But then, under certain conditions, especially with heat, maybe the diol can undergo some elimination, like forming a carbonyl.

Wait, but how would that happen? Maybe the diol loses water to form a ketone. But that would require a specific structure. Alternatively, maybe the diol undergoes an oxidation, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent.

Wait, another possibility: the initial reaction is a double elimination to form an alkene, and the IR peak at 1720 is something else, like an ester or a ketone. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination. Hofmann elimination occurs when a quaternary ammonium salt is treated with a strong base, leading to the formation of an amine and an alkene. But that's not applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Fries rearrangement, but that's for aryl esters, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone because of a neighboring group effect. For example, if the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to an E2 mechanism, forming a double bond. But wait, if both Brs are eliminated, perhaps forming a conjugated diene, but I don't see the IR showing that.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone group. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should move on to the next step and see if that helps. The product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But since product 1 has a carbonyl, maybe it's undergoing some kind of acylation.

Wait, but what is product 1? If it's a ketone, then when treated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of enolization or the formation of an enol ether, or maybe it's acting as a nucleophile.

Wait, another thought: product 1 could be a diol. If product 1 is a diol, then heating with Al(OiPr)3 might lead to the formation of a cyclic ether via an acid-catalyzed elimination of water. But that would form an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, but the initial IR suggests a ketone.

Hmm, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. Let me think: if 1,3-dibromoadamantane eliminates HBr, forming an epoxide. Wait, but the positions are 1 and 3, so maybe the epoxide would bridge across, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl group. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when heated with KOH, forms a ketone. How?

Wait, perhaps it's a double dehydrohalogenation. Each Br is eliminated with a proton, forming a double bond. But wait, but two eliminations would lead to two double bonds or a triple bond, which seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to each Br, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. Wait, that's possible. For example, in the case of vicinal dihalides, elimination can form alkenes, but in some cases, especially with more substituted structures, it can form ketones or other carbonyls.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the base induces the formation of a geminal diol, but that's via hydrolysis, not KOH elimination.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR of product 1. The 1H NMR has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 is likely a CH₂ group next to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester. The 2.41-2.23 might be the adamantane rings, which usually have multiple equivalent CH₂ groups integrating to 10H (adamantane has 12 CH₂ groups, but in this case, perhaps some are split). The 1.94 (2H) suggests another CH₂ group, possibly adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, so perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. The IR doesn't show the typical epoxide peak, but maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, it's a ketone. Wait, the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl peak, which makes a ketone or ester likely.

So if product 1 is a ketone, then when it's heated with Al(OiPr)3, which is a Lewis acid, maybe it's undergoing some kind of Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that requires an aromatic ring, which I don't think is present here. Alternatively, maybe it's forming an enol, but that's not clear.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 1 is a diol, and when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes a dehydration to form a carbonyl. But that would require acid conditions, which Al(OiPr)3 provides. But if product 1 is a diol, then heating with Al(OiPr)3 would lead to the formation of an ester or a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps it's forming an ether.

Wait, but earlier the product 1's IR is at 1720, which suggests a carbonyl, so perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something else.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an ester. But without more data, it's hard to say. Maybe I should proceed.

Then, product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide (which is a reductive workup), forming product 3. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups.

So, putting it all together: the initial reaction forms a ketone (product 1). Then, product 1 is treated with Al(OiPr)3 (a Lewis acid) to form product 2, which may have a double bond. Then, ozonolysis cleaves that double bond to form carbonyl groups in product 3.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR.

So, to figure this out, I need to work backward.

Let me start from the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis of a double bond typically cleaves it, and depending on the substituents, forms carbonyl compounds.

But to get the coupling pattern, I need to know the structure. So let's backtrack.

Product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. So product 2 must have a double bond. Ozonolysis would break this into two carbonyl-containing fragments.

So, product 2 has a double bond, and product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

But product 3's NMR is what we're looking at. The most deshielded hydrogen would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl group.

So, let's think about product 2. It was formed by treating product 1 (which has a carbonyl group) with Al(OiPr)3. So perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or something similar that has a double bond adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes an elimination to form an enol ether, which would have a double bond. For example, if product 1 is a cyclic ketone, then elimination could form an enol ether with a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, and with Al(OiPr)3, it forms an acetal or something else. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: product 1's NMR has 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a triplet or a doublet? The question doesn't specify, but it's a singlet? Probably, it's a CH₂ group attached to an oxygen, like an ether.

So, product 1 might have a structure where a CH₂ group is attached to an oxygen, and the rest are adamantane CH₂ groups. So the product 1 could be something like 1,3-diol or 1,3-diketone, but more likely a ketone.

If product 1 is a ketone, then reacting with Al(OiPr)3 could lead to the formation of an enol. But enols are generally less stable and would tautomerize back to the ketone. Alternatively, under strong Lewis acid conditions, maybe an acetal-like structure forms, but without a hemiacetal, that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an ester. If product 1 is an ester, then Al(OiPr)3 could facilitate some kind of acylation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bromide that's converted into a ketone. Wait, but KOH is a base, not a nucleophile in this scenario.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a gem-diol, which upon dehydration forms a ketone. But that doesn't fit the initial reaction conditions.

I'm getting a bit stuck here, so let me try a different approach. Let's assume that product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes some kind of acid-catalyzed rearrangement. For example, perhaps it forms an enol, which then could form a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a diol, and when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it loses water to form an alkene. That would make product 2 an alkene. Then, ozonolysis would break that into two carbonyl groups.

So, if product 2 has a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls. Then, product 3 would have these carbonyl groups, and the most deshielded H would be adjacent to a carbonyl.

But how does the coupling pattern come into play?

In ozonolysis, the cleavage of a double bond can yield carbonyl compounds. The position of the Hs adjacent to the carbonyl will determine their coupling.

Wait, let's imagine product 2 is an alkene. For example, if the double bond is between carbons A and B, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. Depending on the structure, the adjacent Hs might be in a certain environment.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether, which upon ozonolysis would break the double bond, forming a diketone or similar.

Wait, but ozonolysis of an enol ether would break the double bond, leading to two carbonyls, each attached to oxygen.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structures. Let me try to think about the coupling pattern.

The most deshielded H in product 3's NMR would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. In such a case, the Hs near a carbonyl are typically deshielded and appear downfield.

The coupling pattern depends on neighboring Hs. If the H is adjacent to another H that's split into a triplet, for example, then the coupling would be a triplet of triplets or something else.

Alternatively, if the H is next to a CH₂ group, it might show as a triplet.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis has a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl. Then, the Hs on that CH₂ would be split based on neighboring groups.

But if the H is part of a CH₂ adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH₂ is next to another CH₂, each H would split into a triplet. For example, each H in the CH₂ would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but in product 3, after ozonolysis, perhaps each former end of the double bond has a carbonyl group. Let's imagine product 2 has a double bond between two CH₂ groups. Ozonolysis would break this into two carbonyl groups, each attached to a CH₂. So each CH₂ would have two Hs, each coupling with the two Hs on the adjacent CH₂.

Wait, no. Let me think of a specific structure. Suppose product 2 is an alkene: CH₂=CH-... something. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls, say, O=C-CH₂-O and another part. Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond in product 2 is part of a ring. Ozonolysis would break the ring, forming two carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene, but that's less likely.

Wait, another angle: the initial product 1 is an epoxide. Then, product 2 would be an opened epoxide under acid conditions. But that's a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the initial reaction again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane plus KOH gives product 1. If product 1 is a diol, then reacting with Al(OiPr)3, a strong Lewis acid, would promote dehydration, forming an alkene. So product 2 would be an alkene.

Then, product 2 (alkene) undergoes ozonolysis, which cleaves the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

So, for example, if product 2 is an adamantane derivative with a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, each attached to a CH₂ group. So each CH₂ would have two Hs, each coupled with the neighboring CH₂'s Hs.

So, in product 3, each CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl would have Hs that couple with each other and perhaps with others.

Each H on the CH₂ would
