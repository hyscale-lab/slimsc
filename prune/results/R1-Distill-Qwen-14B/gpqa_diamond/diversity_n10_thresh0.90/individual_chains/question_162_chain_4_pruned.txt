Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me think through this step by step.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that's interesting. So the metric is expressed in terms of x and y coordinates. I remember that the metric tensor determines the geometry of the spacetime, and in this case, it's a 2-dimensional metric because there are dx² and dy² terms.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere. Right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, often visualized as something like a saddle shape. In two dimensions, though, the concept of a pseudosphere is a bit tricky because in 2D, negative curvature would mean it's a hyperbolic plane. But the question is probably referring to a 2-dimensional surface embedded in a higher-dimensional space, but maybe that's not too important here.

Looking at the metric, I think I should try to recognize what kind of geometry this represents. The form of the metric looks similar to something I've seen in the context of hyperbolic space. The denominator (4 - x² - y²) suggests that there's a constraint on x² + y². Since the denominator must be positive to keep the metric positive definite, 4 - (x² + y²) > 0. So x² + y² < 4, which defines a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. So the spatial part here is a 2-dimensional surface where x and y are constrained within a circle of radius 2.

Wait, but it's a metric for a 2-dimensional surface. Oh, wait, maybe this is a metric for a 2-dimensional hyperbolic space. Wait, hyperbolic space has a metric where the line element is something like (dx² + dy²)/(1 - k(r)^2) or similar, depending on the coordinates. Alternatively, sometimes people use Poincaré coordinates where the metric looks like (dx² + dy²)/(z²), but this is different.

Alternatively, let me think about the metric. Let me write it down again:

ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²)

So, it's a conformally flat metric because the coefficient is a function multiplied by (dx² + dy²). That suggests that it's conformally equivalent to flat Euclidean space, scaled by a function.

But wait, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. So to find the area, I need to integrate over the region where the metric is defined, multiplied by the square root of the determinant of the metric.

Wait, the metric in 2D can be written as:

g = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx⊗dx + dy⊗dy)

So the determinant of the metric (for a 2D diagonal metric) is just the product of the diagonal components. So determinant g = [32/(4 - x² - y²)]^2. So sqrt(g) would be 32/(4 - x² - y²).

So the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but the region where 4 - x² - y² > 0 is the disk of radius 2 centered at the origin. So the area would be the integral over this disk of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

But wait, that integral might be tricky. Let me think about it. Let me switch to polar coordinates because the problem is symmetric in x and y.

In polar coordinates, x² + y² = r², and dx dy = r dr dθ.

So the integral becomes:

Area = ∫ (from r=0 to 2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute the angular integral first. The θ integral is 2π, so:

Area = 2π * ∫ (0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Hmm, that integral. Let me make a substitution to solve it. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr. When r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So substituting, the integral becomes:

∫ [32 r / u ] dr = 32 ∫ (r dr)/u = 32 ∫ (-du/2) / u

Because r dr = -du/2.

So,

32 * (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du.

Wait, let's compute the integral:

32 * (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du from u=4 to u=
