Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Hmm, the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. Wait, so P is a vector operator, right? So the operator P is actually the vector sum of its components: P = P_x * xhat + P_y * yhat + P_z * zhat. But since the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, I think the operator we're considering is P·n, where n is a unit vector in the x-z plane. Because when you're looking for eigenstates of the component along a specific direction, you have to construct the operator along that direction.

So first, let's figure out the form of the operator. The direction n is in the x-z plane, so it can be written as n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. Right? Because in spherical coordinates, the direction in the x-z plane would have θ, and φ=0 since it's in the x-z plane (so no y-component). Or wait, wait, no— if it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero because φ is the angle from the x-axis in the xy-plane. But maybe I'm mixing up terms here. Alternatively, since n is in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero, so n = (nx, 0, nz), and nx² + nz² = 1.

So the operator P·n would be P_x * nx + P_z * nz. Because the y-component doesn't contribute since n's y is zero.

Each component P_x, P_y, P_z is (ħ/2) multiplied by their respective matrices.

Let me write down each component matrix:

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]].
P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]].
P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]].

So, putting it all together, the operator P·n is (ħ/2) [nx * [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].

Wait, because P·n would be nx*P_x + ny*P_y + nz*P_z. But since ny=0 here, it's just nx*P_x + nz*P_z.

So the matrix for P·n is (ħ/2) times [ nx * [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that. Let's say nx is sinθ and nz is cosθ, because that's the standard polar angle parametrization. So substituting, the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) * [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Which gives:

(ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
            [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, let me compute each element:

Top left: 0 * sinθ (from P_x) plus 1 * cosθ (from P_z) → cosθ.
Top right: 1 * sinθ (from P_x) plus 0 * cosθ → sinθ.
Bottom left: 1 * sinθ (from P_x) plus 0 * cosθ → sinθ.
Bottom right: 0 * sinθ (from P_x) plus (-1)*cosθ (from P_z) → -cosθ.

So the matrix is (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]].

Wait, but wait a second, that can't be right. Because each component (P_x, etc.) is scaled by ħ/2, and we're adding them. So the entire matrix is (ħ/2) multiplied by a matrix which is a combination of the P_x and P_z matrices.

So the operator in question is (ħ/2) times [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].

So the matrix is (ħ/2) times:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, no— wait, the diagonal elements would be:

Top left: (sinθ * 0) + (cosθ * 1) → cosθ.

Top right: (sinθ * 1) + (cosθ * 0) → sinθ.

Bottom left: same as top right, sinθ.

Bottom right: (sinθ * 0) + (cosθ * (-1)) → -cosθ.

So yes, the matrix is correct.

Now, we need to find the eigenvector of this operator with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is:

P·n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

So substituting the matrix expression, we have:

(ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] * [a; b] = (ħ/2)[a; b]

Wait, because |ψ> is a 2-component vector, say [a; b], and the equation is (matrix) * [a; b] = eigenvalue * [a; b].

Wait, but the eigenvalue is (ħ/2), so:

(ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ a + sinθ b ], [ sinθ a - cosθ b ] ] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

So for the components, we have:

(ħ/2) [ cosθ a + sinθ b ] = (ħ/2) a → cosθ a + sinθ b = a

Similarly, (ħ/2) [ sinθ a - cosθ b ] = (ħ/2) b → sinθ a - cosθ b = b

We can divide both sides by (ħ/2), so we have two equations:

1) cosθ a + sinθ b = a
2) sinθ a - cosθ b = b

Let me rearrange equation 1:

cosθ a + sinθ b = a → (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0.

Equation 2:

sinθ a - cosθ b = b → sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b =0.

So we have two equations:

(1): (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0

(2): sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b =0

These are two equations with variables a and b.

We can write this as a homogeneous system. For a non-trivial solution (eigenvector), the determinant of the coefficients must be zero.

Wait, but perhaps we can solve them as a ratio.

Let me consider equation (1):

( cosθ -1 ) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b.

Similarly, equation (2):

sinθ a = (cosθ +1 ) b → a = [ (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ ] b.

So from equation (1), a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b.

Let me simplify that denominator: cosθ -1 = -(1 - cosθ).

So a = [ - sinθ / ( -(1 - cosθ) ) ] b → a = [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ) ] b.

Now, equation (2) gives a = [ (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ ] b.

So equating the two expressions for a:

sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ) = (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ.

Wait, let's set them equal:

sinθ/(1 - cosθ) = (1 + cosθ)/sinθ.

Cross-multiplying:

sin²θ = (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ) → sin²θ = 1 - cos²θ → which is correct, because sin²θ + cos²θ =1.

So no problem— the two equations are consistent, meaning that the system is dependent, and there's a nontrivial solution.

So, the ratio a/b can be taken as [ (1 + cosθ ) / sinθ ].

So let me set a = [ (1 + cosθ ) / sinθ ] * b.

We can write this as a = [ (1 + cosθ ) / sinθ ] b.

Now, we can choose to express the eigenvector in terms of b, or vice versa.

Let me choose to let b =1 (for simplicity; since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple), then a = (1 + cosθ)/ sinθ.

Wait, but wait— that might not be valid when sinθ is zero. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express a in terms of b, and then set b to be some value, say 1, but I have to make sure we can normalize the vector.

Alternatively, another approach is to express the eigenvector in terms of spherical coordinates.

Wait, but perhaps I can find a more general solution.

Wait, when we have the ratio a/b = (1 + cosθ)/sinθ, we can express a as (1 + cosθ) and b as sinθ, up to a scalar.

Wait, but wait: Let me think.

Let me write the eigenvector as [ a, b ].

From equation (1) and (2), we get that a = [ (1 + cosθ) / sinθ ] b.

So let's set b = sinθ, then a = (1 + cosθ).

So the vector is [1 + cosθ, sinθ]^T.

Wait, but let me check this.

If a = 1 + cosθ and b = sinθ, then let's plug into equation (1):

( cosθ -1 ) a + sinθ b = (cosθ -1)(1 + cosθ) + sinθ * sinθ.

Expanding (cosθ -1)(1 + cosθ) → cos^2θ -1.

So the first term is cos²θ -1, and the second term is sin²θ.

So total is (cos²θ -1) + sin²θ = (cos²θ + sin²θ) -1 = 1 -1 =0. So equation (1) is satisfied.

Similarly, check equation (2):

sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b = sinθ (1+cosθ) - (cosθ +1) sinθ = 0.

So yes, this works.

So the eigenvector is [1 + cosθ, sinθ]^T.

Wait, but wait— that's without considering normalization.

Wait, but the eigenvector can be scaled by any non-zero scalar. So perhaps the general solution is a = (1 + cosθ) k, b = sinθ k, where k is a normalization constant.

Wait, but this vector [1+cosθ, sinθ] can be written in another way.

Wait, 1+cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2), and sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So substituting, the vector becomes:

[2 cos²(theta/2), 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ].

Which can be factorized as 2 cos(theta/2) [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So the normalized eigenvector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] multiplied by a normalization factor.

Wait, wait— because the current vector is [2 cos²(theta/2), 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ].

The norm squared is [2 cos²(theta/2)]^2 + [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)]^2.

Which is 4 cos^4(theta/2) +4 sin²(theta/2) cos^2(theta/2).

Factor out 4 cos^2(theta/2):

4 cos^2(theta/2) [ cos^2(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) ] = 4 cos^2(theta/2) [1] =4 cos^2(theta/2).

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(4 cos^2(theta/2)) ) = 1/(2 |cos(theta/2)| ), but since cos(theta/2) is positive for theta between 0 and pi (since theta is between 0 and pi in the x-z plane), we can write it as 1/(2 cos(theta/2)).

So the normalized eigenvector is [2 cos²(theta/2), 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] times 1/(2 cos(theta/2)).

Which simplifies to [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but wait— is that correct? Because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, which relates to spin-up along direction n.

But wait, in the case of spin-1/2 particles, like the muon (which has spin 1/2), the eigenstates of the Pauli matrices (which these operators resemble) are spin-up and spin-down along a given axis.

Wait, the operator P·n is (ħ/2) times the Pauli vector · n, right?

Because the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, and each component of σ is 2 times the operator (since for spin-1/2, the spin component operator is (ħ/2) σ_i).

So the operator P·n is (ħ/2) (σ · n), where σ · n is the Pauli vector dotted with the direction n.

The eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1, so the eigenvalues of P·n are ± ħ/2.

The eigenvectors of σ · n for eigenvalue +1 are [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So that's matching our earlier result.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but let's check the options.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

Option D is (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)), which has hbar factors— but our eigenvectors are dimensionless, so I don't think hbar is part of the eigenvector. Because the eigenvectors are just vectors in the Hilbert space, so their entries are dimensionless.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the options have hbar terms. Like option A has sqrt(2/3) hbar and sqrt(1/3) hbar. But our result doesn't have any hbar terms, so that makes me think I might have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the operator and the eigenvector. The eigenvectors are independent of ħ, because the operator is scaled by ħ/2. Wait, no— the eigenvector is a vector in the Hilbert space, so it's not multiplied by ħ.

Wait the operator P·n is (ħ/2) (σ · n). So when we find eigenvectors, they are the same as those for σ · n, just scaled by a factor. Because for a scalar multiple of an operator, the eigenvectors remain the same, and the eigenvalues are scaled.

So the eigenvectors for P·n are the same as those for σ·n, which are [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So looking back at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which seems like spherical coordinates, but perhaps for a spin-1 state? Or maybe for a different scenario.

Option D has hbar terms, which I don't think are part of the eigenvector.

Wait, but wait. All the options have their elements with units of hbar? No, because the eigenvectors are pure states, so they shouldn't have units. For example, the sum of the squares of the elements should be 1.

Looking at option C: cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) =1, so that's correct.

Options A: [sqrt(2/3) hbar, sqrt(1/3) hbar], but (sqrt(2/3) hbar)^2 + (sqrt(1/3) hbar)^2 = (2/3 +1/3 ) hbar² = hbar², which is not 1. So unless the vectors are not normalized, but the problem says the eigenvector is normalized.

So option A can't be correct because it's not normalized unless hbar is 1, but that's not the case here.

Option D: sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2) and sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2).

Squares would be (2/3 hbar² cos²(theta/2)) + (1/3 hbar² sin^2(theta/2)).

Which is hbar² (2/3 cos²(theta/2) + 1/3 sin^2(theta/2)), which is not 1 unless hbar is 1 and some specific theta, but generally, this isn't normalized. So option D is probably not correct.

Option B: [cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) ].

The square magnitude is cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) =1, so that's normalized. But this looks like the standard spherical harmonics for l=1, m=0 or something, but not for spin-1/2.

Wait, but for spin-1/2, the eigenvectors are like [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So option C is correct.

Wait, but looking at the problem statement again— the question is about the eigenvector of P along n.

So the correct answer must be option C.

But wait, looking at the options again:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Yes, that's exactly what we derived.

So the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is constructed as:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_z n_z,
\]

where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$ since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. Substituting the given components of $\vec{P}$:

\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix},
\]

the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Substituting the matrix, we get the system of equations:

\[
\cos\theta a + \sin\theta b = a, \quad \sin\theta a - \cos\theta b = b.
\]

Rearranging these equations, we find:

\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0, \quad \sin\theta a - (\cos\theta + 1)b = 0.
\]

These equations are consistent, and solving for the ratio $a/b$ gives:

\[
a/b = \frac{1 + \cos\theta}{\sin\theta}.
\]

Choosing $b = \sin\theta$ (for simplicity), we find $a = 1 + \cos\theta$. Thus, the eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 + \cos\theta \\ \sin\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize this vector, we compute the norm:

\[
\sqrt{(1 + \cos\theta)^2 + (\sin\theta)^2} = \sqrt{4\cos^2(\theta/2)} = 2|\cos(\theta/2)|.
\]

Dividing by $2\cos(\theta/2)$, the normalized eigenvector becomes:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches option **C**. The other options are incorrect because:

- **A** and **D** include $\hbar$, which is not part of the eigenvector (eigenvectors are dimensionless).
- **B** corresponds to spherical coordinates for a different scenario, likely involving higher angular momentum states, not spin-1/2.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
