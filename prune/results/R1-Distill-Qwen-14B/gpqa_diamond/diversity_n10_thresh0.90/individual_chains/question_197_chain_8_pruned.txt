Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus with HI is a reagent used in the hydrolysis of certain functional groups, like esters. Wait, no, wait—it’s more about maybe eliminating something else. Oh wait, maybe it's for the hydrolysis of nitriles or other groups. Or wait, wait, I think red phosphorus is used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes, using HCl. Oh wait, no, wait. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl, right? Red phosphorus and HI—is that for the hydrolysis of an ester? Or maybe it's a different type of reaction.

Wait, I think the key is that when you have a carbonyl group, like esters or acid chlorides, reacting with red phosphorus and HI might lead to some kind of substitution or elimination. Or maybe it's about the formation of an acid from an ester? Let me think. Alternatively, maybe it's about the cleavage of a carbonyl group.

But first, let's figure out what Compound X is. The IR and NMR data are given. Let's look at the IR first. The peaks are 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which is a broad peak, likely due to O-H stretching. Then 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl (C=O) group. The 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So putting that together, the compound probably has an aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and an O-H group.

Looking at the NMR data: 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet for 1H. That's probably the O-H proton of a carboxylic acid or maybe an aldehyde, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm but as a singlet. But the broadness suggests it's a carboxylic acid, because those protons are usually broad due to hydrogen bonding. Then at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)—this looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. Each doublet integrates to two protons, so likely two sets of two equivalent aromatic protons, meaning para substitution.

The other signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Hmm, what's that? The triplet at 0.9 ppm with 3H suggests a methyl group at the end of a chain, like a CH2CH2CH3 group. The doublet at 1.4 ppm with 3H suggests a methyl adjacent to a CH group, maybe something like CH(CH3). Wait, the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH group, perhaps connected to the aromatic ring. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be two protons next to that CH, maybe a CH2 group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with substituents. Let's think: the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, which would be a para-substituted benzene, maybe with substituents at the para positions. If one substituent is an acyl group (from the 1720 cm⁻¹ and the O-H at 10.5 ppm), that would make sense.

Wait, the IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's consistent with a carbonyl, like a ketone, ester, or acid. The 3400-2500 broad peak is O-H, so if it's a carboxylic acid, then 1720 might be a bit high because carboxylic acids typically have lower carbonyl peaks, around 1700 cm⁻¹. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester, with a carbonyl around 1720. But if the compound has both a carbonyl and an O-H, perhaps it's an acid derivative. Wait, but the NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5, which is more in line with a carboxylic acid. So maybe it's a benzoic acid derivative.

But wait, let's reconstruct the structure. The aromatic ring has two substituents in the para positions. One is the acid group (COOH), and the other is an alkyl chain. Let's think about the NMR signals: the triplet at 0.9 (t,3H) is probably a methyl adjacent to a CH2, like CH2CH2CH3. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. So maybe the structure is something like benzene with a CH2CH(CH3)2 group or similar. Let's try to map the NMR.

The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is a methylene (CH) group. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) is another CH2. Let's see, perhaps the structure is benzene with a -CH2-CH(CH3)2 substituent. Alternatively, maybe it's a longer chain.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows 1.4 ppm (d,3H), which is a methyl group attached to a CH, which is then attached to another CH2 and then a CH3. So perhaps a structure like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something. Or maybe the substituent is a butyl group. Let me try to think of the substituent chain.

The substituent on the benzene ring is probably a chain that ends in a methyl group. Let's think:

The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) suggests a CH2CH2CH3. So perhaps the substituent is a propyl group? Wait, but the substituent would be attached to the ring. Let me try to imagine the structure: the ring has a substituent which is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group? Wait, no, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group.

Wait, let's think about the substituent. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is a CH group. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) is a CH2. Then, 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. So the substituent might be a CH2-CH(CH3)- group, but with what? Let's see:

- The 2.9 ppm could be a CH attached to another group. It's a multiplet, so probably adjacent to two different groups. The 1.7 ppm is a CH2, which would be next to the CH. The 1.4 ppm is a CH3 attached to the CH.

So perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. But where is that attached? On the benzene ring, so maybe it's a benzyl group attached to a chain. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)2 group?

Wait, the substituent could be a butyl group. Let me try to think of the substituent as a butyl group attached to the ring. For example, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But wait, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet, which would fit a terminal methyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a 4-substituted chain. Let me try to imagine the substituent as a propyl group attached to the benzene. Wait, maybe it's a pentyl group, but that might be too long.

Wait, perhaps it's a 3-pentyl group. No, that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but with a terminal methyl.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, that might not fit. Let me try to count the protons.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (1H), 1.7 ppm (2H), 1.4 ppm (3H), and 0.9 ppm (3H). Let me imagine a chain where the substituent is a propyl group, but with a branching. So substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3?

Wait, that would give a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group attached to the benzene ring. But then the NMR would show peaks for each part. Let me see: the central CH would be the CH in CH(CH3), which would have two adjacent CH2 groups. So the 2.9 ppm would be that central CH. The CH2 next to it (on the benzene side) would have protons at 1.7 ppm, and the CH2CH3 on the other end would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm. The CH(CH3) would have a methyl group at 1.4 ppm.

Wait, that makes sense. So the substituent would be a propyl group with a branch, like -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But wait, that's four carbons. So the substituent is a butyl group, specifically a sec-butyl group. Because a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the ring. Wait, no, wait: sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's not right. Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait. Let's clarify.

Wait, the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the benzene ring. So the structure would be benzene with a substituent that is a butyl group. But wait, let me count the carbons. Benzene ring has a substituent at the para position, which is a chain: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would make it a pentyl group. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the substituent is on the benzene ring. The substituent is something like -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So that's a four-carbon substituent, which would be a butyl group. But the structure is more specifically a 3-methylbutyl group? Or perhaps a sec-butyl group. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. Wait, that would be a propyl group with a branch. Maybe it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. No, that's a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- group.

Alternatively, maybe the group is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH
