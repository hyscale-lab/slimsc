Okay, so I've got this problem about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm. Let me try to figure this out.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, I think that means the number of atoms in that excited state is higher in star_1. So if I remember correctly, this relates to the Boltzmann distribution, which tells us about the population of energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium (LTE here).

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy states is given by (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Here, g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the energy difference is given as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. So the problem is about the ratio of the populations of two energy levels. Let me denote the excited state as level i and the ground state as j. Or wait, maybe the problem refers to the same transition for both stars, so the energy difference is the same for both, ΔE = E_i - E_j.

Wait, but the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So the ratio for star 1 is n1_i / n1_j = 2, perhaps? And for star 2, n2_i / n2_j would be some other value.

Wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, the number of excited atoms (in that level) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So, maybe the ratio n1_i / n_total1 is twice that of n2_i / n_total2. But wait, no, the problem says "twice as excited", which probably refers to the ratio within each star. So for each star, the population ratio of the excited state to another state is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is n1_i / n1_j = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j). But I'm not sure yet. Let's think about the setup again.

The energy difference is the same for both stars, ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. So, for each star, the population ratio depends on their respective temperatures.

Let me denote for star 1: (n1_i)/(n1_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

Similarly, for star 2: (n2_i)/(n2_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But wait, the problem says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. Hmm, perhaps the ratio (n_i)/(n_j) is higher in star_1 than in star_2. But how much higher? The problem states that in star_1, the excitation is twice as much as in star_2. So maybe (n1_i)/(n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i)/(n2_j).

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether it's the ratio of the excited state to the ground state or the ratio of the excited state to the total. Oh wait, if it's the same energy levels, then the statistical weights g_i and g_j are the same for both stars, right? Because for each star, their g_i and g_j are the same, assuming the same transition.

Wait, no, the g values depend on the specific energy levels. If the transition is the same for both stars (same ΔE), then the ratio (g_i/g_j) would be the same for both stars.

So, for star_1: n1_i / n1_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

For star_2: n2_i / n2_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But the problem says that in star_1, the excitation is twice as high as in star_2. So perhaps the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So,

n1_i/n1_j = 2 * (n2_i/n2_j).

But substituting the expressions from above,

(g_i/g_j) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * (g_i/g_j) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

We can cancel out (g_i/g_j) from both sides, so:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Hmm, but wait, maybe the ratio is n1_i / n_total1 = 2 * (n2_i / n_total2), but that's a different approach. I think I need to clarify this.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is measured as the number of atoms in the excited state compared to those in the ground state. So star_1 has twice as many in the excited state compared to star_2. Then, the ratio for star_1 would be higher.

Wait, I think the problem is stating that (n1_i) = 2 * (n2_i). But no, that can't be, because the number of atoms would depend on the number of atoms in each star, which we don't know. So it's more about the ratio within each star.

Wait, perhaps the problem is comparing the excitation of the same transition. So the ratio (n_i/n_j) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, (n1_i/n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i/n2_j).

So, going back to the Boltzmann equation.

We can write for each star:

(n_i/n_j) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Assuming g_i = g_j, which I think is the case for many transitions, like between two states with the same spin, but not always. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps for the purpose of this question, we can assume g_i = g_j, so the ratio is just exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, but in reality, the g factors are important. For example, if the ground state has a lower g (like for a spin state), but the problem doesn't give any information about the statistical weights, so perhaps it's safe to assume that the ratio (g_i/g_j) is the same for both stars, so they cancel out.

So, for star_1 and star_2:

n1_i/n1_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

n2_i/n2_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The problem says that in star_1, the excitation is twice as much as in star_2. So that would mean that (n1_i/n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i/n2_j).

So,

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Taking natural logs on both sides,

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2)).

Rearranging,

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2).

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2).

Alternatively,

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2).

So,

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But wait, looking at the options, the equation has ln(2) equal to some function of T1 and T2.

The options are A to D. Let's look at them again.

Option A: ln(2
