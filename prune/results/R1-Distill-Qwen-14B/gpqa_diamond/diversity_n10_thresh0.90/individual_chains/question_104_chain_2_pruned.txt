Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble.

The problem states that there are two stars with the same mass, both similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. 

So, for planet #1, the spectral line shift is up to 5 milliangstroms. For planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, how does the Doppler shift relate to the planet's orbit? I think the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's gravitational pull. The formula for the RV method involves the mass of the planet and the star, and the orbital period. 

I remember the formula: the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is given by K = (v * sin i) * (M_p / M_s), but wait, maybe there's a more precise formula. Oh right, the formula is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/( (1-e²)^(0.5) )) * ( sin i ) ) / (2π * (a³/(G(M_s + M_p)) ) )^(1/3) ) )

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the RV semi-amplitude K. The formula I think is K = ( (2π G)^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/( (1-e²)^(0.5) )) ) / (P^(1/3) )

But since e is zero (because the orbits are circular), that term goes away. Also, since both planets have similar masses to Neptune, and the stars are similar to the Sun, M_p is much smaller than M_s. So M_s + M_p ≈ M_s. That simplifies things.

So K ≈ ( (2π G)^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / (M_s^(2/3) ) ) / (P^(1/3) )

Wait, but sin i is the same for both planets? The problem doesn't say anything about inclination. Oh, but the RV method is more sensitive when the orbit is edge-on, which gives maximum Doppler shift. But I think the problem assumes that both are edge-on, or that sin i is the same for both. Otherwise, we might not have enough info. So perhaps we can assume sin i is the same for both, or that it's 1 (i=90 degrees).

So for both planets, K1 and K2 are measured. K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_s)^(1/3) * (P^(-1/3)) ), but wait, let me think again.

Wait another approach: The velocity semi-amplitude K formula is given by:

K = (v*sin i) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/1) ) * (1 / (2π))^(1/3) ) * (1/( (1-e²)^(0.5) )) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should look for a more straightforward relationship. Alternatively, maybe I can relate K1 and K2, and find the ratio of P2 to P1.

Given that K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Because K is proportional to (v) which is proportional to (2π a / P ), since v = 2πa/P. 

Wait, but a is the semi-major axis. Using Kepler's third law, P² = (4π²/G(M_s + M_p)) ) a³. Since M_p << M_s, that's approximately P² = (4π²/(G M_s)) a³.

So a³ = (G M_s P²) / (4 π² )

So a is proportional to ( G M_s )^(1/3) P^(2/3) )

Then v = 2π a / P = 2π ( G M_s )^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / P ) = 2π ( G M_s )^(1/3) P^(-1/3 )

So velocity v is proportional to P^(-1/3 )

But the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which is
