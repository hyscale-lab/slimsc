Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance in some way. Let me think back to what I learned in my astronomy class.

Parallax, right, it's the apparent shift in the position of a star when observed from different points in Earth's orbit. The formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So a star that's closer has a larger parallax, and a more distant star has a smaller parallax. 

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform distribution in what sense? Oh, probably uniform in space, like same number per volume in each region. So if you look at a certain volume, the number of stars is the same per unit volume regardless of where you are in that volume.

But wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So higher parallax means closer stars, lower parallax means farther away. So the number of stars in a given parallax range would depend on how the volume relates to parallax.

Let me think about the relationship between distance and parallax. Parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by distance (in parsecs). So d = 1/plx. 

If I consider a thin shell at a distance d, the volume of that shell would be the surface area of a sphere with radius d multiplied by the thickness dr. The surface area of a sphere is 4πd², so the volume element dV would be 4πd² dr. 

But since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density of stars is constant. Let's say the number density is n stars per cubic parsec. So the number of stars in that shell would be n * dV = n * 4πd² dr.

But the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. Oh, right. So I need to express this in terms of parallax instead of distance. Since d = 1/plx, we can substitute. Let me see, d = 1/plx, so plx = 1/d. So when d increases, plx decreases.

Wait, but I'm looking at a change in parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx (a small change). What does that correspond to in terms of distance? Let's think about the relationship between d and plx.

If plx is p, then d = 1/p. So, if I have a small change in plx, say dp, the change in d would be dd. Let's find dp in terms of dd.

Since d = 1/p, then p = 1/d. Taking the derivative with respect to d: dp = - (1/d²) dd. So, dp = - (1/d²) dd → dd = -d² dp.

But since I'm considering a small range in p, say from p to p+dp, the corresponding distance range is from d=1/p to d=1/(p+dp). Wait, but for small dp, this is approximately. Hmm, maybe it's better to express the number of stars in a thin shell with parallax between p and p+dp.

So the volume element in terms of p is dV = 4πd² dr, but dr is related to dp. From earlier, dr = dd = - (1/p²) dp. So the volume element becomes 4π (1/p)^2 * (-1/p² dp) ? Wait, no. Let me re-examine.

Wait, d = 1/p, so when p increases by dp, d decreases by (1/p²) dp, because dp = - (1/d²) dd. So dd = -d² dp. Since d = 1/p, dd = - (1/p²) dp. So the change in distance dr is approximately the same as dd here, because it's a thin shell.

So the volume element dV in terms of p is: dV = 4π d² dr = 4π (1/p)^2 * (- (1/p²) dp) ). But wait, the negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases, so the shell is at a slightly smaller d when p increases. But when considering the number of stars, which is the same as a function of p, perhaps I should take the absolute value or consider the positive change.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about integrating the number of stars as a function of distance, then convert to parallax.

Alternatively, think in terms of how many stars are in a thin parallax slice. For a star at distance d, the number of stars in a thin shell at d with thickness dr is 4πd² n dr. So the number per unit distance is 4πd² n. 

But we need to find the number per unit parallax. Since d = 1/p, and p is a function of d, let's express the number as a function of p.

So, d = 1/p → p = 1/d. The number of stars in a thin shell with parallax between p and p + dp is N = 4π (1/p)^2 n * (dr), but dr is related to dp. 

Wait, from d = 1/p, the derivative is dd = - (1/p²) dp → dr = |dd| = (1/p²) dp. So substituting into N: N = 4π (1/p)^2 n * (1/p²) dp) = 4π n (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars per unit parallax (dp) is N = 4π n / p^4 * dp.

But the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. So it's the number per unit p (like N per dp). Which is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If I have a number of stars per unit volume, which is n, then the number in a volume element dV is n*dV. The volume element for a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr is dV = 4π d² dr. So the number is 4π n d² dr. 

But in terms of parallax, since d = 1/p, the number becomes 4π n (1/p)^2 dr. But dr is related to dp. As before, dr = (1/p²) dp.

Substituting dr into the number: 4π n (1/p^2) * (1/p^2) dp) = 4π n (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1/p^4. That would mean the number decreases with p^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4, option D is 1/plx^3. So answer would be A.

Wait, but wait. Let me think if I made any mistake here. The uniform distribution in space implies that the number of stars is proportional to volume. So for a given distance shell, the number of stars is proportional to the volume of that shell, which is 4π d² dr. Since d = 1/p, substituting gives 4π (1/p)^2 dr. But dr is (1/p^2) dp. So 4π (1/p^2) * (1/p^2) dp = 4π (1/p^4) dp. So the number per unit parallax is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the number of stars per unit range of plx (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. So as plx increases (closer stars), the number per unit plx increases as 1/p^4.

So the correct answer should be option A, which is ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density of stars is constant, and the number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, \( 4\pi d^2 dr \).

To express this in terms of parallax, we substitute \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). The volume element becomes \( dV = 4\pi d^2 dr = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 dr \). The change in distance \( dr \) is related to the change in parallax \( d\text{plx} \) by \( dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Substituting this into the volume element gives:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). This means that as parallax increases (closer stars), the number of stars per unit parallax increases more rapidly.

From the given options:
- **A)** \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \) matches the derived relationship.
- **B)** \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \) is incorrect because it does not account for the \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \) dependence.
- **C)** \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^1} \) is incorrect for the same reason.
- **D)** \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^3} \) is also incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: A
