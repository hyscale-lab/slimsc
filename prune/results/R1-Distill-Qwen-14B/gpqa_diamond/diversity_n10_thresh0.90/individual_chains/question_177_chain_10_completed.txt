Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

Alright, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Then, the radial velocities are given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The question is asking by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies. The options are A to D, with numbers around 2.2 to 2.35.

Wait, so I think the key here is the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Luminosity (L) for a star is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So, L is proportional to R² T⁴.

But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. The peak wavelength (λ_max) for a black body is given by Wien's displacement law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So if their λ_max is the same, then their temperatures T must be the same. Oh, that's a crucial point. So T1 = T2. Because λ_max same implies T same.

Wait, but wait a second. Because they are moving with radial velocities, could that affect the observed wavelength? Oh, but the problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So perhaps that's the rest frame, or perhaps it's after considering the Doppler effect. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think.

The radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 for Star_2. So Star_2 is moving towards or away from us at 700 km/s. But when we observe the star's spectrum, there's a Doppler shift. The observed wavelength would be λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ) , but wait, actually, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r/c), assuming v_r is positive when moving away. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get the Doppler formula right. For a source moving away, the wavelength is longer (redshifted), so the observed wavelength increases. If the source is moving towards us (v_r negative), the observed wavelength is shorter (blueshifted).

But wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So perhaps their observed λ_max is the same. So how does that relate to their actual temperatures?

Wait, let me break it down. Let's denote T1 and T2 as the actual temperatures of the stars (in their rest frames), and T_obs1 and T_obs2 as the observed temperatures due to their velocities. Then, the observed λ_max would be λ1_obs = b / T_obs1, λ2_obs = b / T_obs2. And the problem states that λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But since Star_1 has v_r = 0, its observed temperature is the same as its actual temperature, T1 = T_obs1.

Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s. Let's compute T_obs2 in terms of T2. Hmm, the Doppler effect for temperature? Wait, because the star's emitting at a certain temperature, but due to velocity, the observed wavelength changes, which would affect the observed temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's actual temperature is T, but due to Doppler shift, the observed temperature is different. Let me think: if a star is moving towards us at velocity v, then the observed wavelength is shorter by a factor of (1 + v/c), assuming non-relativistic speeds (v<<c). So λ_obs = λ * (1 - v/c), approximately. But the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature, so the temperature observed would be T_obs = T * (1 + v/c), when v is positive for moving towards us (blue shift).

Wait, let me clarify. Suppose the star emits at λ_rest = b / T. If the star is moving towards us at velocity v, the observed λ is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 - v/c) ≈ λ_rest (1 - v/c) when v is much smaller than c. So λ_obs = (b / T) * (1 - v/c). Therefore, the observed λ_max is smaller (blueshifted), implying a higher observed temperature.

Wait, no. Wait, λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ) for relativistic speeds, but since 700 km/s is much less than the speed of light (which is about 3e5 km/s), so v/c is about 700 / 3e5 ≈ 0.00233, so 0.233% of c. So the Doppler shift can be approximated as (1 + v/c). But wait, for receding, v is positive, so the observed wavelength would be longer (redshifted). If the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer than the rest frame.

Wait, the star's velocity is 700 km/s, but in which direction? The problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. So Star_1's v_r is 0, Star_2's v_r is 700. So Star_2 is moving away, assuming v_r positive is moving away. Because if v_r is positive, it's moving away, leading to a redshift. So for Star_2, λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c).

So for Star_1, λ1_obs = λ1_rest (since v_r=0), and for Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_rest (1 + v_r/c).

But the problem says λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So:

λ1_rest = (b / T1)

λ2_rest = (b / T2)

λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r / c)

So:

λ1_rest = λ2_obs = λ2_rest (1 + v_r/c)

Substituting λ1_rest and λ2_rest:

(b/T1) = (b/(T2)) (1 + v_r/c)

The b's cancel out.

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v_r/c)

Rearranging,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r/c )

Wait, that's because:

1/T1 = (1/T2)(1 + (v_r/c)), so T1 = T2 / (1 + (v_r/c)).

Wait, let me double-check the algebra.

1/T1 = (1/T2)(1 + v_r/c)

Multiply both sides by T1 T2:

T2 = T1 (1 + v_r/c)

So T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r/c)

But wait, wait. Let me think again. For Star_2, which is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. So λ2_obs = λ2_rest (1 + v_r/c). Since λ2_rest is the rest frame wavelength, which is b/T2.

So λ2_obs = (b/T2) (1 + v_r/c)

But λ1_obs = (b/T1)

And λ1_obs = λ2_obs

So:

b/T1 = (b/T2)(1 + v_r/c)

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2)(1 + v_r/c)

Multiply both sides by T1 T2:

T2 = T1 (1 + v_r/c )

So T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r/c )

Hmm, that's important. So the temperature of Star_1 is lower than Star_2's actual temperature? Because (1 + v_r/c) is greater than 1, so T1 is less than T2.

Wait, but wait, because Star_2 is moving away, so its observed wavelength is longer, implying a lower observed temperature. But in this case, we're considering the actual temperatures, not the observed. Because when their observed λ_max is same, but the actual T's could be different based on their velocities.

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me recap.

The stars' actual temperatures are T1 and T2.

Star_1's observed λ_max is λ1_obs = b / T1.

Star_2's actual λ_max is λ2_rest = b / T2.

But Star_2 is moving away, so its observed λ_max is λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r/c) = (b/T2)(1 + v_r/c).

We are told that λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So, b/T1 = (b/T2)(1 + v_r/c )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1 + v_r/c)/T2

Which rearranges to T2 = T1 (1 + v_r/c )

So T2 is larger than T1 by a factor of (1 + v_r/c ). Because (1 + v_r/c ) is greater than 1 (since v_r is positive for moving away), so T2 larger.

So T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r/c )

Hmm.

So now, the luminosity of a star is L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So for each star:

L1 = 4π (R1)² σ T1⁴

L2 = 4π (R2)² σ T2⁴

We can take the ratio L1/L2.

Given R1 = 1.5 R2.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴ )

= ( (1.5 R2 )² / R2² ) * ( T1^4 / T2^4 )

= (2.25) * ( (T1 / T2)^4 )

But from earlier, T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r/c )

So T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c ), where v is 700 km/s.

So,

(T1 / T2) = 1 / (1 + v/c )

So,

(T1 / T2)^4 = 1 / (1 + v/c )^4

Putting it all together:

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + v/c )^4 ]

So now, we need to calculate (1 + v/c )^4.

First, compute v/c.

v = 700 km/s.

c is speed of light: ~3e5 km/s.

So v/c = 700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300,000 = 0.0023333...

So, 1 + v/c = 1.0023333...

Now, compute (1.0023333)^4.

I can approximate this using the binomial expansion for small x.

(1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + n x + (n(n-1)/2) x² + (n(n-1)(n-2)/6) x³ + ... 

Since x is 0.002333, which is about 0.233%, so small.

n=4.

So,

(1 + 0.002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(0.002333) + 6*(0.002333)^2 + 4*(0.002333)^3 + (0.002333)^4

Compute each term:

First term: 1

Second term: 4 * 0.002333 = 0.009332

Third term: 6 * (0.002333)^2 = 6 * (0.00000544) ≈ 0.0000326

Fourth term: 4 * (0.002333)^3 ≈ 4 * (0.0000000126) ≈ 0.00000005

Fifth term: (0.002333)^4 ≈ 3e-11, negligible.

Adding them up:

1 + 0.009332 = 1.009332

Plus 0.0000326: 1.0093646

Plus 0.00000005: 1.00936465

So approximately 1.009365.

So (1 + v/c )^4 ≈ 1.009365.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [1 / 1.009365 ]

Compute 1 / 1.009365.

Well, 1/1.009365 ≈ 0.9907 (since 1/1.01≈0.990099, and 0.009365 is less than 0.01, so the value would be a bit higher than 0.99).

Wait, let's compute it more accurately.

Compute 1 / 1.009365.

We can use the approximation 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x + x² - x³ + ... for small x.

x = 0.009365.

So,

1/(1.009365) ≈ 1 - 0.009365 + (0.009365)^2 - (0.009365)^3 + ... 

Compute each term:

1 - 0.009365 = 0.990635

Plus (0.009365)^2 = approx 0.0000877, so 0.990635 + 0.0000877 ≈ 0.9907227

Minus (0.009365)^3 = approx 0.00000082, so 0.9907227 - 0.00000082 ≈ 0.9907219

So approximately 0.9907219.

So 1/(1.009365) ≈ 0.99072.

Therefore,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99072 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99072 ≈ let's compute that.

2.25 * 0.99 is 2.2275. 2.25 * 0.00072 is 0.00162. So total approx 2.2275 +0.00162=2.22912.

Wait, but wait, 2.25 * 0.99072 = ?

Compute 2 * 0.99072 =1.98144

0.25 *0.99072=0.24768

Total: 1.98144 + 0.24768 = 2.22912.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.229.

Looking at the options:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So approximately 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, but wait a minute. I think I may have made a mistake in the earlier step. Let me double-check.

We have:

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

And T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r/c )

So T1 / T2 = 1/(1 + v_r/c )

So (T1 / T2 )^4 = 1/(1 + v_r/c )^4.

So when I plug in the numbers, (1 + v_r/c ) is approximately 1.0023333.

So (1 + v_r/c )^4 is about 1.009365.

So 1/(1.009365) is about 0.99072.

Then, 2.25 * 0.99072 ≈ 2.229.

Which is approximately 2.23, so option D.

But wait, let me compute (1.0023333)^4 more accurately.

Let me calculate step by step:

1.0023333^1 = 1.0023333

^2: 1.0023333 * 1.0023333.

Compute 1 *1 =1.

0.0023333 *1 = 0.0023333.

1 *0.0023333=0.0023333.

0.0023333 *0.0023333 ≈ 5.44e-6.

So (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b². So:

(1.0023333)^2 = (1 + 0.0023333)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.0023333) + (0.0023333)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.0046666 + 0.00000544 = 1.00467204.

Then, (1.0023333)^3 = (1.00467204) * 1.0023333.

Compute 1 * 1.0023333 = 1.0023333.

0.00467204 *1.0023333 ≈ 0.00467204 *1 =0.00467204; 0.00467204 *0.0023333 ≈ approx 0.00001088.

So total ≈ 1.0023333 + 0.00467204 +0.00001088 ≈ 1.0070162.

Then, (1.0023333)^4 = (1.0070162) * 1.0023333.

Compute 1 *1.0023333 =1.0023333.

0.0070162 *1.0023333 ≈ 0.0070162 + 0.0070162 *0.0023333.

0.0070162 *0.0023333 is approx 0.00001635.

So total ≈1.0023333 + 0.0070162 +0.00001635 ≈1.0093659.

So (1.0023333)^4 ≈1.0093659.

So 1/(1.0093659) ≈?

It's approximately 0.99072 as before.

So L1/L2=2.25 * 0.99072 =2.229, which is about 2.23, option D.

Wait, but wait another thing. The question says that the stars radiate as black bodies, but are we considering their rest wavelengths or observed wavelengths?

Because the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. That would be the observed wavelengths, which for Star_2 is redshifted.

So I think the approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift formula.

Wait, another approach: the Doppler shift formula for the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r/c ), assuming v_r is the radial velocity (positive for moving away). So if Star_2 is moving away with v_r=700 km/s, then λ_obs for Star_2 is longer than its rest wavelength. But Star_1 is at rest, so its λ_obs is the same as its rest wavelength. The problem says that these two observed λ_max are the same.

So, Star_1's rest λ_max is equal to Star_2's observed λ_max.

So:

λ1_rest = λ2_obs.

λ1_rest = b / T1.

λ2_obs = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r/c )

So,

b / T1 = (b/T2) (1 + v_r/c )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2)(1 + v_r/c )

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r/c )

So that part was correct.

So, the rest is correct.

Therefore, the L1/L2 is approximately 2.23, so option D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(L\) is luminosity, \(R\) is radius, \(T\) is temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The ratio of luminosities is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Relating Temperatures
The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (\(\lambda_{\text{max}}\)) are the same. Using Wien's displacement law, \(\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}\), the observed \(\lambda_{\text{max}}\) for Star_2 is affected by its radial velocity (\(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\)) due to the Doppler effect. The observed wavelength for Star_2 is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max, obs, 2}} = \lambda_{\text{max, rest, 2}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

Since \(\lambda_{\text{max, obs, 1}} = \lambda_{\text{max, obs, 2}}\), we equate the rest wavelength of Star_1 (\(\lambda_{\text{max, rest, 1}} = \frac{b}{T_1}\)) to the observed wavelength of Star_2:

\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

Canceling \(b\), we find:

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{T_2} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

Rearranging:

\[
T_1 = \frac{T_2}{1 + \frac{v_r}{c}}
\]

### Step 2: Substituting Values
The radial velocity \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\), and the speed of light \(c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s}\). Thus:

\[
\frac{v_r}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]

\[
1 + \frac{v_r}{c} \approx 1.002333
\]

\[
T_1 = \frac{T_2}{1.002333}
\]

### Step 3: Calculating the Luminosity Ratio
The radii are given as \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\). Substituting into the luminosity ratio:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(R_1)^2 (T_1)^4}{(R_2)^2 (T_2)^4}
\]

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5 R_2)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_2}{1.002333}\right)^4}{(R_2)^2 \cdot T_2^4}
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 1.5^2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{1.002333}\right)^4
\]

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{1.002333}\right)^4
\]

### Step 4: Approximating \((1.002333)^4\)
Using the binomial expansion for small \(x\), \((1 + x)^n \approx 1 + nx + \frac{n(n-1)}{2}x^2 + \cdots\), with \(x = 0.002333\) and \(n = 4\):

\[
(1.002333)^4 \approx 1 + 4(0.002333) + \frac{4(3)}{2}(0.002333)^2 + \cdots
\]

\[
(1.002333)^4 \approx 1 + 0.009332 + 0.0000326 + \cdots \approx 1.009365
\]

Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{1.002333}\right)^4 \approx \frac{1}{1.009365} \approx 0.99072
\]

### Step 5: Final Calculation
Substitute back:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.99072 \approx 2.229
\]

### Step 6: Comparing with Options
The closest option is:

**D) ~2.23**

Answer: D
