Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully.

The question is asking about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubit space. The matrix provided is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). The options are A to D, each with different coordinates.

First, I remember that a density matrix is a way to represent the state of a quantum system, especially when dealing with mixed states. For a qubit, the state can be represented as a point in a 3-dimensional space, I think. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a common representation, and any qubit state can be plotted on it. But wait, this is a density matrix, not a pure state. So how does that work?

I recall that the density matrix for a pure state |ψ⟩ is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. If the state is a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture, like ρ = p|ψ⟩⟨ψ| + (1-p)|φ⟩⟨φ|, where p is a probability.

Looking at the given ρ, it's (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks like the average of the two basis states. So each has a weight of 1/2. That sounds like a maximally mixed state because each basis state is equally probable.

But how does that translate to the qubit space? In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are on the surface. For a mixed state, the point is inside the sphere. The maximally mixed state for a qubit should be at the center of the sphere because there's no preferred direction, so all possible directions are equally likely.

Wait, the Bloch sphere representation uses coordinates (x, y, z), where each corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The state is given by (x, y, z) such that the density matrix is (I + xσx + yσy + zσz)/2. So for a completely mixed state, what's the density matrix?

The identity matrix is (I + 0σx + 0σy + 0σz)/2 = I/2. Because in that case, all coefficients x, y, z are zero. So the point would be at (0,0,0). But wait, wait. Let me check.

The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me expand that. The |0⟩⟨0| term is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]] which is the identity matrix. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, 1/2 times the sum. So 1/2 times (I) because |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| is I. So ρ is (I)/2.

So ρ = I/2. In the Bloch sphere parameterization, any density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector in 3D space with magnitude ≤ 1. The vector r has components x, y, z which are the expectation values of the Pauli matrices scaled by 1/2.

So if ρ is I/2, that would mean r·σ is zero. So r = (0,0,0). Because I/2 = (I + 0)/2. So the vector r is the origin.

So looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). That must be the answer.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a qubit, where the system is an equal mixture of the two basis states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is a vector in 3D space with magnitude \(|\mathbf{r}| \leq 1\). The components \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) correspond to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices scaled by \(1/2\).

For the given \(\rho\), it simplifies to \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), which implies that \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This means the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to a maximally mixed state with no preferred direction.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is:

**A) \(r = (1,1,0)\)**  
**B) \(r = (0,0,1)\)**  
**C) \(r = (0,0,0)\)**  
**D) \(r = (1,1,1)\)**  

The correct answer is **C**, as the maximally mixed state is represented by the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Answer: C
