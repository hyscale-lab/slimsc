Okay, so I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize this compound: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should probably draw the structures to visualize what's happening. Ethynylcyclohexane has a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes a hydroxymethyl group connected to another cyclohexyl group, and a carbaldehyde group.

Wait, target structure: It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main ring is cyclohexane. At position 1, there's a hydroxymethyl group attached, which is also connected to a cyclohexyl group. Also, there's a carbaldehyde group somewhere. Let me think about the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the main chain is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane. And there's an aldehyde group as well. Wait, the name is a bit confusing. Let me parse it.

The parent chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means it's a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde group. The other substituent is at position 1, which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So the substituent is a methyl group connected to a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group.

So the substituent is -(CH2OH)-cyclohexyl. Or wait, no, maybe it's -(CH2O-)cyclohexyl? No, the hydroxy is on the methyl group. So the structure would be a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (since it's an aldehyde) at one position, and at another position (position 1), a CH2-OH group attached to a cyclohexyl ring.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group where one hydrogen is replaced by hydroxyl, and the other is connected to cyclohexyl. So the substituent is CH2(OH)-c
