Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal and finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on crystallography, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that the interplanar distance in crystals is calculated using the formula involving the Miller indices and the lattice parameters. For a general crystal structure, the formula is d_{hkl} = (1/√(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2kl cos β - 2hl cos γ))) multiplied by something, but wait, I think I might be mixing things up.

Wait, no, the general formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal lattice is given by:

d_{hkl} = (a)/(√(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2kl cos β - 2hl cos γ))

Wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, I think the correct formula is d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + kl cos β + hl cos γ) ) ), but wait, that's only for a cubic system. No, no, rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal system, maybe? Or is it a cubic system with all edges equal but angles different? Wait, rhombohedral is a special case of the hexagonal crystal system? Or is it a part of the cubic system? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no, I think rhombohedral is part of the cubic system where the angles are all equal but not 90 degrees. So it's a cube that's been deformed so that all the angles are the same but not right angles. So the lattice parameters a, b, c are all equal in a rhombohedral system, but the angles α, β, γ are all equal but not 90 degrees. So in this problem, a = b = c, and α = β = γ = 30 degrees.

So the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal should be similar to cubic but adjusted for the angles. Let me think, in cubic systems, the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² ). But for a general system, the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2kl cos β - 2hl cos γ ), but wait, in cubic systems, cos α is zero because the angles are 90 degrees, so it simplifies.

Wait, but in this problem, the angles are 30 degrees each, so cos α = cos(30°) which is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So the given problem is for a rhombohedral crystal where a = b = c = 10 Angstroms, and each angle between the axes is 30 degrees. We need to find the interplanar distance d for the (111) plane, which means h=1, k=1, l=1.

So applying the formula:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2kl cos β -
