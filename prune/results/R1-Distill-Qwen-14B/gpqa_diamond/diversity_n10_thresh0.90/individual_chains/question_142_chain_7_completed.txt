Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question about density matrices, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is equal to (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (a statistical mixture) rather than pure. So first, I need to figure out what this particular density matrix represents and then determine its geometrical position in the qubit space.

Hmm, wait. I think the density matrix for a pure state |ψ⟩ is ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. But here, the given ρ is a combination of |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|. Let me write that out more clearly. It's (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Oh, wait, this looks like a mixed state because it's a sum of projectors onto |0⟩ and |1⟩, each multiplied by 1/2. So each of these terms is a pure state, and they're being averaged, so the overall state is a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩ with equal probabilities.

But wait, I think this is actually a special case. Because |0⟩ and |1⟩ form an orthonormal basis, right? So the density matrix is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Oh wait, wait a second. Wait, |0⟩⟨0| is a projector, and when you add them together, you get the identity matrix for a single qubit because |0⟩ and |1⟩ are the standard basis vectors. Let me check that. The identity matrix I for a 2x2 system is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives exactly the identity matrix. So ρ is (1/2) I.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because when you have a single qubit, the identity matrix is 2x2. So ρ is (1/2) times I, which would make it a 2x2 matrix. Let me compute that: I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so (1/2)I is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So the density matrix is diagonal with both diagonal elements equal to 0.5.

Now the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm a bit confused about what that means exactly. Oh wait, I think it refers to the Bloch sphere representation. Because for a single qubit state, the density matrix can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere.

Wait, the general form of a single-qubit density matrix is:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector in 3D space (the Bloch vector). So the state is represented as a point on the unit sphere (since the norm of r must be ≤ 1 for a valid state).

So if I can write the given ρ in that form, I can find out what r is. Let me compute that.

Our ρ is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) which is (I)/2. Because |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| is the identity matrix I, as I thought earlier. So ρ = (I + 0·σ)/2, because there's no contribution from the Pauli matrices. So the vector r would be (0,0,0). Because the expression is (I + 0)/2.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think again. The Bloch vector for a state is given by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. So for a general state ρ, the expectation value of σ_x is Tr(σ_x ρ), same for σ_y and σ_z.

Since ρ is (I/2), let's compute each expectation value.

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]].

Compute Tr(σ_x * ρ):

σ_x * ρ = [[0,1],[1,0]] * [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]] = [[0*0.5 +1*0, 0*0 +1*0.5], [1*0.5 +0*0, 1*0 +0*0.5 ]]

Wait, no, actually, matrix multiplication is done element-wise. So the product σ_x * ρ would be:

(0)(0.5) + (1)(0) for top left? Wait, no, to compute the elements:

Wait, let's correct that. Let me compute each element.

The (i,j) element of σ_x ρ is the sum over k of σ_x[i,k] * ρ[k,j].

So for σ_x ρ:

Element (1,1): (0)(0.5) + (1)(0) = 0.

(1,2): (0)(0) + (1)(0.5) = 0.5.

(2,1): (1)(0.5) + (0)(0) =0.5.

(2,2): (1)(0) + (0)(0.5) =0.

So σ_x ρ = [[0, 0.5], [0.5, 0]].

The trace is 0 (diagonal elements 0 and 0).

Similarly, Tr(σ_y ρ) would be same approach. Let me compute σ_y * ρ.

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So σ_y ρ is:

Element (1,1): (0)(0.5) + (-i)(0) = 0.

(1,2): (0)(0) + (-i)(0.5) = -i 0.5.

(2,1): (i)(0.5) + (0)(0) = i 0.5.

(2,2): (i)(0) + (0)(0.5) = 0.

So σ_y ρ = [[0, -i 0.5], [i 0.5, 0]].

Trace is 0 + 0 = 0.

Now σ_z ρ:

σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So σ_z ρ = [[1*0.5, 0*0], [0*0.5, (-1)*0.5]] = [[0.5, 0], [0, -0.5]].

The trace would be 0.5 + (-0.5) )= 0.

Wait, but wait, the expectation value is Tr(σ_i ρ). So for each Pauli matrix σ_i, the expectation is Tr(σ_i ρ). 

So for σ_x, the Tr is 0. Similarly for σ_y, Tr is 0. For σ_z, Tr is 0. So the expectation values for all three Pauli matrices are zero.

So the Bloch vector r is (⟨σ_x⟩, ⟨σ_y⟩, ⟨σ_z⟩) = (0,0,0). 

So the point is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. That would mean the state is maximally mixed, right? Because when r is zero, the state is (I/2), which is the completely mixed state for a qubit.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again: the completely mixed state for a qubit is indeed (I/2), which is what we have here. And in the Bloch sphere, that's the origin because the Bloch vector is zero.

So looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which would be the origin. So the correct answer should be C.

Another way to think about it is that the given density matrix is the maximally mixed state, which is represented by the point at the center of the Bloch sphere. So r is (0,0,0).


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, specifically the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. The density matrix can be rewritten as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the \(2 \times 2\) identity matrix. In terms of the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r}\) is the Bloch vector. Comparing this to the given \(\rho\), it is clear that \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), as there are no contributions from the Pauli matrices.

To confirm, the expectation values of the Pauli matrices \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\) with respect to \(\rho\) are computed. For any Pauli matrix \(\sigma_i\), the expectation value is:

\[
\langle \sigma_i \rangle = \text{Tr}(\sigma_i \rho).
\]

For \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\), the trace of \(\sigma_i \rho\) is zero for all \(i\), as the identity matrix averages out the contributions of the Pauli matrices. Thus, the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is \((0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the origin of the Bloch sphere.

This represents the maximally mixed state, which is equidistant from all basis states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). Among the given options, the correct geometrical position is:

\[
\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0).
\]
