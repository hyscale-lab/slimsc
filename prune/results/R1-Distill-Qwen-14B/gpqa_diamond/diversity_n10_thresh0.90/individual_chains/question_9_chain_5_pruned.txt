Okay, so I've got this question about molecular symmetry, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that symmetry in molecules involves different types of symmetry elements, like axes, planes, centers, etc. So, C3h symmetry... Wait, what does that mean exactly?

I think C3h is a type of point group. Point groups classify molecules based on their symmetry. The 'C' stands for a rotation axis, right? The number after it indicates the order, so C3 would mean a 120-degree rotation axis. The 'h' probably refers to a horizontal mirror plane. So C3h symmetry would mean the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, and maybe other symmetry elements as well.

Looking at the options, I see four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone, and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. The options are labeled A to D, with each being one of these molecules.

I need to figure out each molecule's structure and their symmetry.

Starting with triisopropyl borate. I think it's [B(CH(CH2CH3)2)3], right? So boron is the central atom with three isopropyl groups attached. Isopropyl groups are symmetric. So the molecule would have a trigonal planar geometry, maybe? Wait, no, boron usually has three bonds, so it's trigonal planar. But in this case, each isopropyl is a bulky group. So does the molecule have any symmetry? Since all three substituents are the same, it should have a high degree of symmetry. It might have a C3 axis because it's symmetric with three identical groups. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm, a horizontal mirror plane would require that there's a plane that cuts through the molecule such that the parts mirror each other. For triisopropyl borate, since all substituents are the same, it's symmetric under 120-degree rotation and also should have a horizontal mirror plane. So maybe it has C3h symmetry.

Next, quinuclidine. I remember that quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound, specifically a norbornane derivative. Its structure is a bridge bicyclic system. The molecule is similar to a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. The symmetry of quinuclidine... Let me think. It has a bridge structure, so the symmetry axis might be through the bridge. I think it has a C2 axis, because if you rotate it 180 degrees, it looks the same. Does it have any mirror planes? I'm not sure. Maybe it does, but I don't think it has a three-fold rotation axis. So C3h symmetry would require a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror. So quinuclidine probably doesn't have C3h.

The third option is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me parse that. It's a trifuran, which has three furan rings. The numbers in the brackets indicate the positions where the rings are fused. So benzo... means a benzene ring fused to the structure. The "trifuran" part suggests three furan rings connected in some way. The positions 1,3,4,6,7,9 are ketone groups (hexaone). Hmm, not sure about the exact structure, but perhaps it's a polycyclic compound with multiple rings fused together. The question is about symmetry. If the molecule has three-fold symmetry, then it must have a three-fold rotation axis. For example, maybe the structure is such that rotating it 120 degrees brings it back. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe this molecule is more symmetric in a way that includes a C3 axis but also a horizontal mirror. I'm not sure; perhaps I can think about it later.

The fourth option is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Triphenylene sounds like a structure with three phenyl groups attached. Wait, the name suggests that it's a trifuran (three furan rings) with triphenylene substituents? Or maybe it's a larger ring system with multiple fusions. The substituents are at certain positions, but again, it's a bit unclear. I think this one is more complex. For symmetry, perhaps it has multiple planes or axes. But does it have a three-fold rotation axis? Maybe if the structure is symmetric in three directions.

So, going back. The question is looking for C3h symmetry, which includes a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule must have both a 120-degree rotation symmetry and a horizontal mirror.

Looking at triisopropyl borate: it's trigonal planar with three identical isopropyl groups. So, rotating 120 degrees would leave it looking the same. It also has a horizontal mirror plane through the boron atom. So yes, that would give it C3h symmetry. So option C is triisopropyl borate and it might be the correct answer.

Wait, but what about the other options? Let me think about quinuclidine again. Quinuclidine has a bridge structure, so it's more likely to have a C2 axis, not C3. So it's out.

Now, the benzo-trifuran and triphenyleno-trifuran structures. Do they have three-fold symmetry? Benzo-trifuran would have a benzene ring attached to a trifuran. If the substituents are placed symmetrically, maybe there's a three-fold axis. For example, if the substituents are arranged in a way that every 120 degrees, the same group appears. But wait, benzo rings are six-membered, so maybe the arrangement doesn't fit a three-fold symmetry. The benzo part is a benzene ring, which is symmetric with six-fold, but the trifuran might have a three-fold. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric in another way.

Wait, the benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran... That notation might indicate how the rings are fused. For example, the 1,2-c part might mean that the benzene is fused to a certain position of the trifuran. If the benzo part is attached in a way that disrupts the three-fold symmetry, then the molecule might not have C3h symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the arrangement leads to a three-fold symmetry.

Alternatively, triphenyleno... I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think of another approach. Let me recall some molecules: which ones are known for having C3h symmetry?

Triisopropyl borane (which is triisopropyl boron) is an example. Because all three substituents are the same, and the molecule is trigonal planar, so it can be rotated 120 degrees and look the same. Also, there is a horizontal mirror plane cutting through the boron and the plane of the molecule. So yeah, the C3h symmetry fits.

What about the other compounds. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic structure, and I think it has a C2 symmetry, not C3. So D isn't the answer.

Now, the third and fourth options are more complex. Let me think about the benzo and triphenyleno compounds. Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran... I'm trying to visualize this. It's a benzene ring fused with a trifuran. The trifuran has three furan rings attached in a way that the numbering is given. Let's say the benzene is fused to the trifuran at positions 1,2-c, etc. If the trifuran has substituents at positions 1,3,4,6,7,9, that's a lot of substituents. I'm not sure if that would allow a three-fold symmetry.

The triphenyleno compound has three phenyl groups attached to a trifuran. The positions 9,10-c'' suggest that the phenyl groups are fused in a certain way. If the structure is symmetric in three directions, perhaps each phenyl is in a position that allows a three-fold axis.

Wait, triphenylene is a molecule with three benzene rings connected in a way that's symmetric. So triphenylene itself is a tricyclic compound with three benzene rings fused together. But in this case, it's attached to a trifuran. So perhaps the entire structure has a three-fold symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe the triphenyleno compound has a higher symmetry, maybe C3v or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzo-trifuran has a three-fold axis. Let me imagine the structure: a benzene ring fused to a trifuran. The benzene is a six-membered ring, so perhaps the fusion is such that the structure has a three-fold symmetry. Alternatively, if the substituents are placed every 120 degrees, then perhaps.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the problem again. The question is which of these has C3h symmetry.

Triisopropyl borate (option C) probably does have C3h, as we discussed earlier.

So, looking at the options, the correct answer would be C. Let me just check the options again:

Option C is triisopropyl borate.

Wait, but the user's options are A, B, C, D, which correspond to the four molecules.

Wait, the options presented are:

A) triphenyleno...
B) benzo...
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

So the options are as follows, so the correct answer is option C.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h symmetry**, we analyze the symmetry elements required for this point group: a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₓ). Each option is evaluated based on its structure and symmetry.

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule consists of a trifuran core fused with a triphenylene group. The triphenylene structure itself is symmetric, but the fusion with the trifuran disrupts the three-fold symmetry. The molecule does not have a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) or a horizontal mirror plane (σₓ). Therefore, it does not exhibit C₃h symmetry.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule is a trifuran fused with a benzene ring. The benzene ring introduces six-fold symmetry, which is incompatible with the three-fold symmetry required for C₃h. Additionally, the arrangement of substituents disrupts the symmetry elements necessary for C₃h. Thus, this molecule does not have C₃h symmetry.

### Option C: Triisopropyl borate  
Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar geometry with three identical isopropyl groups attached to boron. It has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) due to the identical substituents and a horizontal mirror plane (σₓ) through the boron atom. This combination of symmetry elements satisfies the requirements for C₃h symmetry. Therefore, this molecule exhibits C₃h symmetry.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound with a bridge structure. It has a two-fold rotation axis (C₂) but lacks a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a
