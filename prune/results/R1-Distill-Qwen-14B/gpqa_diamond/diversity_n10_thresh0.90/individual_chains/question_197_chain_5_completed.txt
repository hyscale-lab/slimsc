--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of all these spectroscopy concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. So, if X has a ketone group, this reaction would convert it into an alkane. But wait, I should double-check what else reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Oh right, sometimes it's used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction too, but that's more for amides. No, Clemmensen is more likely here because it's about ketones becoming alkanes.

Looking at the IR data: The peaks around 3400–2500 cm-1 suggest the presence of an alkyne (sp-hybridized C-H stretch) or perhaps an alcohol, but also maybe an acid. Wait, another peak at 1720 cm-1 which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That points towards a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid derivative. But wait, the peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1—those are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound probably has a benzene ring.

The NMR data: Let's go through each peak. 

The first peak is at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet (bs) integrating to 1H. That's quite upfield for a proton. Wait, 10ppm is usually either an aldehyde proton or maybe an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. But wait, in the NMR, if it's a broad singlet, maybe it's an aldehyde. But wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but they can be deshielded more. Alternatively, could it be an acidic proton like a phenol? No, phenols are usually around 5-7 ppm. Hmm. Wait, or perhaps an aromatic proton that's part of an acid. Wait, another thought: maybe an alpha proton to a carbonyl. Or maybe it's an aldehyde. Or wait, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids typically have a broad peak around 10-12 ppm, often as a singlet. But wait, the integration is 1H, so maybe the compound has a single -COOH group? Or perhaps an aldehyde with one proton.

Wait, looking at the 1H NMR again. The next peak is at 8.0 ppm, a doublet (d) integrating for 2H. Then 7.2 ppm, another doublet for 2H. That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. So maybe a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. The 8.0 and 7.2 ppm could be the two sets of protons adjacent to substituents.

Looking at the other peaks: 2.9 ppm as a multiplet (m) for 1H, 1.7 ppm as a multiplet for 2H, 1.4 ppm as a doublet (d) for 3H, and 0.9 ppm as a triplet (t) for 3H.

So, the lower field protons (besides the 10.5) are aromatic. The other peaks suggest some sort of alkyl chain. Let me try to think about the structure.

The multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H) could be a CH group attached to something. The 1.7 ppm (2H) suggests maybe a CH2 group, and the 1.4 ppm (3H, d) and 0.9 (3H, t) are indicative of an ethyl group, perhaps. Wait, the 0.9 triplet is likely a CH2CH3 group. So maybe it's a butyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps the compound has a benzene ring with substituents and a side chain attached. Since the IR shows a carbonyl, maybe it's a benzophenone derivative, but the substituents might be an ethyl group or something else.

Wait, the 10.5 ppm could be an aldehyde proton, but an aldehyde would typically not be in a position that's part of a conjugated system. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone adjacent to a benzene ring?

Wait, another thought: the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketone. Then, the peak at 3400–2500 could be an alkyne. Wait, but I don't see any other peaks that would suggest an alkyne. Or perhaps that's an O-H stretch, but O-H in what? Maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Hmm.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the reaction: Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus with HI is typically used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. So, if X is a ketone, the product would have a CH2 group in place of the carbonyl.

So, the product after the reaction would have a CH2- group where the carbonyl was.

But let's think about the structure of X. If the IR shows a carbonyl, and an aromatic ring with substituents, perhaps X is a benzophenone derivative. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Looking at the NMR again. The aromatic protons are two doublets, so para substitution. Let's say, for example, the benzene has a substituent at the para position. Then, perhaps it's a benzene with a CO group attached. Wait, but the 10.5 ppm is a single proton. Let me think: if the benzene is substituted with a group like R-CO- something.

Wait, considering the 1H NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a singlet for 1H. That could be an aldehyde proton, but if X is a ketone, then maybe it's a benzaldehyde. No, wait, benzaldehyde would have a proton around 10 ppm as a singlet. But the multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H) could be adjacent to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an aromatic aldehyde. Let me think: benzaldehyde would have an aldehyde proton around 9.8-10 ppm, and the aromatic protons would be as a doublet. But in the NMR, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, which could make sense for a para-substituted benzaldehyde. Wait, but benzaldehyde's aromatic protons would be a bit upfield, perhaps.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the substituent is a ketone. Let's say the benzene ring has a substituent like COCH2CH(CH3)2 or something. Let me try to fit the NMR data.

The 10.5 ppm is a singlet for 1H, maybe a CH near a carbonyl. For example, a ketone group. Suppose the structure is something like Ar-CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a cinnamaldehyde derivative. Cinnamaldehyde has an aromatic ring with a CH2CH2CHO group. But that might not fit the NMR exactly.

Wait, let me think about the substituents based on the NMR. The aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, each a doublet. So in a para-substituted benzene, if the substituents are electron-withdrawing, the ortho protons would be deshielded and appear downfield. For example, nitro groups or carbonyl groups.

So, if the substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde, the adjacent protons would be deshielded. Let's think: if the benzene has a substituent like -COCH2CH2CH3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is typical for a methyl group attached to a CH2. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests another methyl group attached to a CH, perhaps. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to that.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure includes a CH(CH3)CH2CH2 group or something similar. Wait, maybe a butyl group attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, let's try to imagine the substituents. The aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, suggesting two substituents in the para positions. But wait, in benzene, para substitution would have two substituents opposite each other, each having two protons each. Wait, no. Wait, the NMR has two doublets, each integrating for 2H. So, perhaps the substituents are in the para positions, and each substituent is deactivating, causing the adjacent protons to be split into doublets. So, maybe each substituent is an electron-withdrawing group. For example, substituents like -NO2, -COOH, -COOR, etc.

But the IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group. So, for example, the benzene ring has two substituents, each being a CO group. No, wait, the IR has only one carbonyl peak. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ketone, like -COCH2CH2CH3 or something.

Wait, let's think about the NMR again. The 10.5 ppm could be an aldehyde proton, but if that's the case, then the structure would have a benzaldehyde group. Let's say the benzene has a substituent like CH2CH(CH3)CO. Wait, no, that may not fit.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a ketone, such as Ar-C(O)-R. So, the structure is a benzene ring with a ketone substituent.

Let me think about the structure based on the NMR.

The aromatic protons are at 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). So, the substituent is such that the adjacent protons are split into doublets, which suggests that the substituent is in the para position and has two adjacent protons each. Wait, no, para substitution would have two substituents opposite each other. Wait, perhaps in a para-substituted ring, the substituents are two identical groups, each in the para position? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the substituent is in the para position, and it's a carbonyl group, making the ring para-substituted with a ketone.

Wait, let me try to imagine a benzene ring with a substituent in the para position, which is a carbonyl group connected to a longer chain.

The 10.5 ppm peak could be the proton adjacent to the carbonyl, like in a ketone. Wait, but that's usually not the case. In a ketone, the alpha protons are typically around 2-3 ppm. Hmm, maybe that's the alpha proton from the ketone.

Wait, looking at the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), that could be an alpha proton to a carbonyl. Then, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be adjacent to that, perhaps part of a CH2 group, and the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be a methyl group attached to a CH. So, perhaps it's a -CH(CH3)-CH2- group.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent like -CO-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but the CH2-CH2 would give a triplet at the end. Wait, the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a CH2CH3 group. So, perhaps the substituent is a -CO-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- group, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows several peaks that could correspond to a butyl group. The 0.9 triplet (3H) is a CH2CH3. The 1.4 doublet (3H) is a CH(CH3) group. The 1.7 multiplet (2H) is a CH2. The 2.9 multiplet (1H) is a CH. So, putting this together, it's a CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3 group, but where is the carbonyl?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CO-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, that would be a pentyl group, but the peaks don't match exactly.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the carbonyl. Wait, sec-butyl would be -CH(CH2CH3)CH2-, but I'm not sure.

Wait, if the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached to the carbonyl, perhaps the structure is something like Ar-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group. Wait, let's think: the 2.9 ppm (1H) could be a CH between two CH2 groups. So, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)3-CH3, but that's a pentyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a butyl group. Let's think about the substituent as a butyl group attached via a carbonyl.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH. So, perhaps the substituent is a -CO-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. Then, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the two protons on the next CH2. The 2.9 ppm (1H) would be the CH adjacent to the carbonyl.

So, putting it together: the substituent is a -CO-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group. But wait, the last CH2 would give a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), as it's attached to the CH2CH3. So, the structure would be Ar-CO-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that makes the substituent a pentyl group with a branch.

Wait, but let's count the hydrogens. The 0.9 triplet is 3H (CH2CH3), the 1.4 doublet is 3H (CH(CH3)), the 1.7 is 2H (CH2), and 2.9 is 1H (CH). So, that makes a total of 3+3+2+1 = 9 H in that substituent. But that's just the substituent; the benzene would have other H's.

Wait, maybe it's a butyl group. Let's think about the substituent as a butyl group attached to the carbonyl. So, the substituent would be -CO-(CH2)3-CH3. But that's a straight chain butyl group. But the NMR shows a triplet for the CH2CH3, so that fits. The CH2 groups in the middle would show up as multiplets.

Wait, but the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H. That suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, not a CH2. So, maybe it's a -CH(CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a iso-butyl group. An iso-butyl group would have a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH3? No, wait, iso-butyl is (CH2)2CHCH2-. No, wait, the structure of iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. Hmm, perhaps that's not right. Wait, no, iso-butyl is (CH2)CH(CH2CH3)CH3. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, something like CH(CH3)CH2CH2CO-Ar.

Wait, but let me think again. The substituent would be Ar-CO-R, where R is some alkyl group. The R group, based on the NMR, would have a structure that includes a CH(CH3) group, because of the 1.4 ppm doublet (3H). So, that would imply a CH(CH3) somewhere in the chain.

So, perhaps R is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group. Wait, but the 1H NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is the end of a CH2CH3 group. So, the substituent would be something like -CO-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. That would be a pentyl group with a branch.

Wait, but let me count the peaks. The 2.9 ppm (1H) would be the CH adjacent to the carbonyl. Then, 1.7 ppm (2H) would be the CH2 next, and 1.4 ppm (3H) would be the CH(CH3). The 0.9 ppm triplet would be the terminal CH2CH3.

So, the substituent would be -CO-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. That makes sense. So, the structure would be a benzene ring with a substituent in the para position, which is a pentan-4-one group attached to a CH(CH3), CH2, and CH2CH3.

Wait, but that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a butyl group, but I'm not quite getting it. Let me think about the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Wait, that's a carboxylic acid. But our reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which would reduce a ketone to an alkane, not a carboxylic acid. Unless I'm mistaken.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's a substituted toluene with isobutyl and methyl groups. But that would have a structure without a carbonyl, so the IR wouldn't show the 1720 cm-1 peak.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl substituent. The IR would show a strong carbonyl for the acid, around 1700 cm-1, which matches the 1720 peak. The 10.5 ppm in the NMR could be the COOH proton, which is usually around 10-12 ppm as a broad singlet. But wait, the NMR shows 1H for that peak, which might fit a COOH group. But wait, benzoic acid's COOH proton is usually broad, but when it's deprotonated, it's a carboxylate and wouldn't show up as a proton. Hmm, but in the NMR, it's integrated as 1H, so perhaps it's a -CHO group, an aldehyde proton.

Wait, getting a bit stuck here. Let's think again about the reaction. X reacts with red phosphorus and HI to produce a product. If X is a ketone, the product would be an alkane.

Looking at the options, maybe the product after the reaction is a branched alkane attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, if X is a benzophenone derivative, say, 4-phenylpropanone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde derivative. But the IR would then show a carbonyl around 1720, which fits.

Wait, looking at the NMR again, the 10.5 ppm proton could be a benzaldehyde's aldehyde proton. Then, the substituent would be an aldehyde group. But then the other peaks would come from the rest of the molecule.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (1H) could be a CH group adjacent to the aldehyde. Then, the 1.7 ppm (2H) would be a CH2, the 1.4 ppm (3H) a CH(CH3), and the 0.9 ppm (3H) a CH2CH3.

So, the substituent would be -CHO-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, but that would make the substituent a pentyl group with a branch.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, like -CHO-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, but how does that fit with the NMR? Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. For example, the substituent is -CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But then, the NMR would show the methyl group as a triplet at 0.9, the next CH2 as a multiplet, and the CH(CH3) as a doublet at 1.4 ppm.

Wait, that would fit. So, the substituent would be a pentyl group with a methyl branch at the second carbon.

But then, the IR would show a carbonyl from the ketone, and the reaction would reduce the ketone to an alkane.

So, after the Clemmensen reduction, the product would have a CH2 group where the carbonyl was. So, the product would be an alkylbenzene with a substituent derived from the ketone.

Let me think about the structure of X. Suppose X is 4-(3-methylbutanoyl)benzaldehyde. No, that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps X is 4-(3-methylbutanoyl)benzaldehyde. So, the structure would be benzaldehyde with a substituent that's a ketone group (CO) attached to a 3-methylbutyl chain.

Wait, but that might not fit the NMR. Let me try to draw this.

The benzene ring has two substituents in the para positions. One substituent is an aldehyde group (-CHO), and the other is a ketone group (-CO-R), where R is a 3-methylbutyl group. But that would complicate the IR, showing two carbonyls, but the IR only has one peak around 1720 cm-1. Hmm, that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzene has only one substituent, which is a ketone group with a side chain. Then the aromatic protons would be a singlet, but in the NMR, they are doublets. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe X is a substituted acetophenone. Acetophenone is a benzene ring with a ketone group attached to a methyl group. But in our case, the substituent would be longer.

Wait, going back to the NMR: the aromatic protons are two doublets each for 2H. That suggests that the substituent is such that the adjacent protons are each split into doublets. So, perhaps the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group in the para position, making the ortho protons deshielded and appear as doublets.

Now, considering that, perhaps X is a para-substituted acetophenone. So, the structure would be something like:

Ar = benzene ring with substituents at the para positions.

Wait, but if X is a para-substituted benzophenone, then the IR would show a strong carbonyl. The NMR would show the aromatic protons as a singlet if the substituents are in the para positions and identical. But in our case, the aromatic protons are two doublets, each for 2H. So that suggests perhaps two different substituents in the para positions? No, because if they're in the para positions, the substituents are across from each other, and the ortho protons would be equivalent. Hmmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a nitro group. But then the IR would show a nitro peak, which is not mentioned. The IR only shows peaks around 1720, 1610, 1450, etc. So, the nitro group is probably not present.

Another possibility: the substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, let me think about the structure again. The NMR shows 10.5 ppm (1H, singlet), which could be an aldehyde proton. Then, the substituent is -CHO attached to the benzene ring. The adjacent aromatic protons would be deshielded, appearing as doublets.

So, the benzene ring would have a substituent like -CHO in the para position. But then, the other substituent would be what? Wait, no, perhaps there's only one substituent. If the benzene has only one substituent, which is a ketone group, then the aromatic protons would be in the ortho, meta, and para positions relative to the substituent.

Wait, for a single substituent on a benzene ring, the NMR would show a pattern depending on the substituent's position. For example, a para substituent would split the protons into two sets of doublets. Wait, no, if the substituent is in the para position, the adjacent protons would be in the ortho positions, which would have two protons each. But if the substituent is a strong electron-withdrawing group like a nitro or carbonyl, the ortho protons would be deshielded and appear as doublets.

So, perhaps the benzene has a substituent like -CO-R in the para position, and the aromatic protons are the ortho and meta to that substituent. But in that case, the NMR would show two doublets for 2H each.

Wait, perhaps the benzene has a substituent group in the para position that is a carbonyl group attached to a longer chain. Then, the aromatic protons adjacent (ortho) would be a pair of doublets, each integrating to 2H. That makes sense with the NMR data.

So, the substituent is a carbonyl group connected to a chain. Then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the carbonyl group to a methylene group.

So, the product after the reaction would be a benzene ring with a substituent that's a CH2 group attached to the same chain. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

Wait, if X is a ketone, the product after reduction would be a CH2 group. So, the substituent would be a CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3 group or something like that.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to figure out the structure of X.

If the IR has a carbonyl, and the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, perhaps it's a benzaldehyde with a ketone group elsewhere. But that would require two carbonyl groups, which might not be supported by the IR data.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a cinnamaldehyde derivative. Cinnamaldehyde has a benzene ring with a CH2CH2CHO group. The NMR of cinnamaldehyde would have aromatic protons as doublets, and the aldehyde proton around 10 ppm. That fits with some of the data.

But let's check:

IR: 1720 cm-1 would be a strong carbonyl (aldehyde or ketone). 1610 and 1450 are aromatic C=C. So that fits.

NMR: 10.5 ppm (singlet, 1H) would be the aldehyde. The aromatic protons would be in the 7-8 ppm region as doublets. The rest would be from the substituent.

In cinnamaldehyde, the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2-CHO. The CH2 groups would have their own protons. So, the NMR would show triplets and other splits for the CH2 groups.

But in our case, the NMR shows a multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H), 1.7 ppm (2H), 1.4 ppm (3H), and 0.9 ppm (3H). So, the substituent after the aldehyde would have a more complex structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a branched chain. Let me think: maybe the group after the aldehyde is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group.

So, the structure would be benzaldehyde with a substituent like -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CHO.

Wait, but that would be a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options and see which one is the product after the reaction.

The reaction is Clemmensen reduction: ketone → alkane.

So, if X is a ketone, the product would have a CH2 group where the carbonyl was.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That has a COOH group, which would suggest that X is a benzoyl chloride or something, but the reaction with HI and red phosphorus doesn't fit. Plus, the product would be a carboxylic acid, but Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group. So, the structure would be a benzene ring with two substituents: one methyl and one sec-butyl in the para positions. But that would require X to be something else, perhaps a di-ketone, which is unlikely.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. Similar to D, but with an isobutyl group.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Again, a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the reaction is supposed to produce an alkane from a ketone. So, the product should have an alkyl group.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, the substituents are a methyl and a sec-butyl group in para positions.

If X was a di-ketone, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps X is a mono-ketone with a substituent that after reduction becomes a longer alkyl chain.

Another approach: the substituent in X is a -CO-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group.

Then, after reduction, it becomes -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group.

So, the product would be a benzene ring with a substituent like -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that would be a pentyl group with a branch.

Looking at the options, none exactly match this. Let me check the options again.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. Structure is benzene with isobutyl and methyl groups in para positions.

Isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, isobutyl is (CH2)2CHCH3. Wait, no, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, perhaps I'm getting the substituents wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a mono-substituted benzene with a longer alkyl group.

Wait, but let me think about the product after the reaction. The initial structure X has a ketone, which is converted to a CH2 group. So, if X has a substituent like Ar-CO-R, then the product would be Ar-CH2-R.

Looking at the options, perhaps the product is option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. But that would imply that X had a ketone at the position where the sec-butyl group is now.

Wait, perhaps X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde. But that doesn't fit the IR, as the peak at 3400–2500 could be an alkyne, but I don't see that.

Alternatively, perhaps X has a ketone group attached to a butyl chain, and after reduction, it becomes a longer alkyl group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to match the options with the reaction.

The reaction converts a ketone to an alkane. So, the product would have a CH2 group where the carbonyl was.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, the substituents are a sec-butyl and a methyl group in para positions.

If X was 4-(sec-butyl)benzophenone, but I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps X is 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone. Then, the reduction would convert the ketone (acetophenone) to a CH2 group, making the substituent a propyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent in X is a propanoyl group attached to a sec-butyl group. No, that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps X is 4-(3-oxopentyl)benzaldehyde. But this is getting too speculative.

I think I need to look for another approach. Let's think about the IR and NMR data.

IR: 3400–2500 cm-1 suggests either an alkyne or an alcohol or an amine. Wait, but the 1720 cm-1 is the carbonyl. So, maybe the 3400–2500 is an alkyne. But the NMR doesn't show any peaks that would indicate an alkyne proton (like around 1.7-3 ppm for sp-hybridized C-H). So, perhaps the 3400–2500 is due to an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But the NMR doesn't show a broad peak around 1-3 ppm, which would be expected for an -OH group. Alternatively, perhaps it's an alkyne, but the NMR doesn't show those protons. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, another thought: the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 could be an ester. Esters have carbonyl peaks around there. But the NMR doesn't show any ester oxygen protons, so that might not fit.

Alternatively, the IR could be a conjugated carbonyl, such as a ketone in an aromatic ring (like acetophenone). Acetophenone's carbonyl peak is around 1680-1720 cm-1, which fits.

So, perhaps X is an acetophenone derivative with a substituent that includes a chain leading to the NMR peaks we have.

The NMR has a 10.5 ppm peak, which I'm still not sure about. Let's consider that this is an aldehyde proton. If X is a benzaldehyde with a ketone substituent, then after reduction, the ketone would become CH2.

But I'm not entirely confident about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 ppm peak is a carboxylic acid proton. But then, the IR would need to show a broad peak around 2500-3000 cm-1, which it does (3400–2500). So, the broad IR peak might be the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. Then, the 1720 cm-1 would be the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid. But wait, the 1720 cm-1 is more typical for esters or ketones, while carboxylic acids are a bit lower, around 1700 cm-1. But it could vary.

If X is a benzoic acid derivative, then after the reaction with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen? Red phosphorus and HI are usually used for reducing carbonyl groups, but I'm not sure about their effect on carboxylic acids. Wait, I think carboxylic acids are not reduced under Clemmensen conditions because they are not ketones. So, if X were a carboxylic acid, the reaction would not affect it, which doesn't help.

So, probably, X is not a carboxylic acid but a ketone or aldehyde.

Another angle: the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H). This is typical for a CH2CH3 group at the end of a chain. So, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. Let's think of a butyl chain attached to the benzene ring.

If X is a ketone attached to a butyl group, then after reduction, the ketone becomes a CH2 group. So, the product would have an alkyl chain.

Looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That would have a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in para positions. But where does the methyl come from? Unless X had both substituents as ketones, which seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe X is 4-(propan-2-yl)acetophenone. The structure would be a benzene ring with a methyl ketone (acetophenone) and a isopropyl group in para positions. Upon reduction, the ketone becomes a CH2 group, making the substituent a methyl group. So, the product would be 4-(propan-2-yl)toluene.

But looking at the options, that's not one of them. Hmm.

Another approach: let's count the number of signals in the NMR. The NMR has six signals:

1. 10.5 ppm (1H)
2. 8.0 ppm (2H)
3. 7.2 ppm (2H)
4. 2.9 ppm (1H)
5. 1.7 ppm (2H)
6. 1.4 ppm (3H)
7. 0.9 ppm (3H)

Wait, that's seven signals. But perhaps some are overlapping. Alternatively, perhaps some signals are integrated as the same.

Wait, the substituent in X would be a chain leading to these signals.

Putting it all together, perhaps X is 4-(3-oxopentyl)benzaldehyde. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the options again. The correct answer is likely option C or D.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This would imply that X is a benzoyl chloride or similar, which upon reaction would hydrolyze to the acid. But the reaction conditions don't suggest hydrolysis.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, the product has a sec-butyl and methyl group in para positions. If X was a di-ketone, the reaction would reduce both ketones to CH2 groups, but that's not likely.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mono-ketone with a substituent that upon reduction becomes a longer chain.

Wait, considering the NMR, the substituent chain is:

- 1H at 2.9 ppm (m)
- 2H at 1.7 ppm (m)
- 3H at 1.4 ppm (d)
- 3H at 0.9 ppm (t)

That suggests a chain like -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

So, the substituent would be -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to the benzene via a carbonyl group.

After reduction, the carbonyl becomes a CH2 group, making the substituent -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But looking at the options, none exactly match this. Wait, option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, which is para-xylene with an isobutyl group. Not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with a ketone substituent. The reaction would reduce the ketone to a CH2 group, leaving the aldehyde as is.

But the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is typically for ketones; aldehydes are generally not reduced under those conditions. So, the aldehyde would remain, but that contradicts the product options.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a cyclic ketone, but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

I think I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the data.

The IR suggests a carbonyl, which is reduced. The NMR suggests a chain with a methyl group attached to a CH, then a CH2, then a CH2CH3.

So, the product after reduction would have a CH2 group where the carbonyl was. So, the substituent becomes CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Looking at the options, perhaps option C is the benzoic acid, but that doesn't fit the reaction.

Alternatively, the product is 4-(butyl)toluene, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. But I'm not sure how the reaction would lead to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, the reaction might not affect the benzoic acid if X is a ketone somewhere else.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with a ketone in the substituent, and after reduction, the product is a benzyl alcohol or something else.

Wait, I'm really stuck. Maybe I should try to conclude based on the data and the options.

The reaction is Clemmensen reduction, so a ketone is converted to a CH2 group. The NMR of X suggests a chain with a methyl, CH2, CH, and CH2CH3. So, the substituent in X is a -CO-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3 group.

After reduction, it becomes -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Looking at the options, none directly match this, but perhaps option D is a close match if the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, that's not right. Wait, sec-butyl is (CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-. Hmm, no, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, perhaps the substituent after reduction is a butyl group, making the product 4-butylbenzene. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, looking at option D again: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, the benzene has a methyl group and a sec-butyl group in the para positions. If X had a methyl ketone and a sec-butyl group, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps X is 4-(propan-2-yl)acetophenone. Then, upon reduction, the acetophenone becomes a CH2 group, making the product 4-(propan-2-yl)toluene. But that's not an option.

At this point, I think I've exhausted my options. Based on the NMR data, the substituent in X is a chain with a methyl group attached to a CH, then CH2, then CH2CH3. So, the product after reduction would have a CH2 group where the carbonyl was, leading to a longer alkyl chain.

The only option that seems to involve a longer alkyl chain is option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, I'll go with option D.


The problem involves identifying the final product of a reaction where Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. This reaction is characteristic of the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. The IR and NMR data for Compound X provide critical clues about its structure.

### Key Analysis:
1. **IR Data**:
   - The peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), likely a ketone.
   - The peaks at **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of sp³ C-H bonds, possibly from an alkyl chain.
   - The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are consistent with aromatic C=C stretching, indicating a benzene ring.

2. **NMR Data**:
   - **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: This is a broad singlet, likely corresponding to an aldehyde proton or an acidic proton, though it is unusual for a ketone.
   - **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: These doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene ring, as the ortho protons are deshielded by the substituent.
   - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet integrating to 1H, likely a CH group adjacent to the carbonyl.
   - **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet integrating to 2H, likely a CH₂ group in the chain.
   - **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet integrating to 3H, likely a methyl group attached to a CH.
   - **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H, likely a terminal CH₃ group in an alkyl chain.

3. **Reaction and Product**:
   - The Clemmensen reduction converts the ketone group in Compound X into a CH₂ group, resulting in an alkylated benzene derivative.
   - Based on the NMR data, the substituent in Compound X is a chain with a methyl group, a CH group, and a terminal CH₂CH₃ group. After reduction, this chain becomes a longer alkyl group attached to the benzene ring.

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A (2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid)**: This is a carboxylic acid, which is inconsistent with the reaction conditions (Clemmensen reduction does not produce carboxylic acids).
   - **Option B (1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene)**: This structure involves an isobutyl group and a methyl group in the para positions. However, the NMR data suggests a different chain structure.
   - **Option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid)**: This is also a carboxylic acid, which is inconsistent with the reaction conditions.
   - **Option D (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene)**: This structure involves a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in the para positions. The sec-butyl group matches the chain described in the NMR data after reduction.

### Conclusion:
The reaction reduces the ketone in Compound X to a CH₂ group, resulting in a product with a sec-butyl and methyl group in the para positions on the benzene ring. This matches **Option D**.

**Answer: D**
