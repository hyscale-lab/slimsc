Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I remember that the Sun produces neutrinos through various nuclear reactions, and the question is about what happens if one of these branches stops. Let me think this through.

The question says the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh right, that's the approximate time it takes for light (and neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to the Earth. So, if the pp-III branch stopped, any neutrinos produced by it wouldn't reach us anymore. But since it stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from that process that were on their way would still arrive, but the ones produced now aren't coming.

Wait, but the neutrinos are traveling at nearly the speed of light. So, if the process stopped, the neutrinos from that process would stop being emitted. But since the process was stopped about 8.5 minutes ago, the Earth would stop receiving neutrinos from that process after a little while. So, basically, the flux from the pp-III branch would drop to zero, but other processes would still contribute.

The question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). These bands are probably from different neutrino production processes. Let me recall what neutrino processes happen in the Sun.

I think the main processes are the proton-proton chain (pp), which has a couple of branches. PP-I, PP-II, and PP-III. The PP-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos, like the 400 keV range or so. The PP-II and PP-III produce higher energy neutrinos. Wait, what's the energy of the neutrinos from each branch?

Wait, the pp-III branch is probably the main contributor to the high-energy neutrinos. So if pp-III stops, the high-energy flux would drop. Let me think about the neutrino energies each process emits.

In the Sun, the dominant neutrino processes are the pp chain, which produces neutrinos with energies around 1 MeV. Then there's the CNO cycle, which produces higher energy neutrinos. But wait, the CNO cycle is less significant in the Sun because the Sun is not very massive, so the pp chain dominates.

Wait, but the pp chain has different branches. PP-I and PP-II. I think PP-I produces lower energy neutrinos, and PP-II and PP-III produce higher energy ones. So, if PP-III stops, which neutrinos are affected?

Alternatively, perhaps the pp chain's main branch (like PP-I) produces lower energy neutrinos, and the higher energy ones come from other reactions, like the CNO cycle. Hmm, maybe I should get the details right.

Wait, in the pp chain, the first step is two protons fusing into deuterium, emitting a positron and a neutrino. These are the low-energy neutrinos, around ~500 keV. Then, the deuterium nuclei can fuse with protons in two ways: one leading to helium-3 (PP-I) and others leading to boron-8 (PP-II and PP-III). The PP-I process produces more neutrinos, but lower energy. PP-II and PP-III are higher energy? Or wait, maybe the opposite.

Alternatively, the neutrinos from the main pp process (the first step) are the low-energy ones, about 0.4 MeV (400 keV). The other processes, like PP-II and PP-III, which produce beryllium-7 and then boron-8, lead to higher-energy neutrinos. Because when boron-8 decays, it emits a neutrino with higher energy. So, if the PP-III branch stops, the production of higher-energy neutrinos would drop.

So, the flux in higher energy bands would be affected more.

So, the question is comparing two bands: 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. Let's
