Okay, I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let's try to figure this out. So, the setup is an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that, so 2e.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system. Oh, right, I remember that the potential energy in a system of charges can be calculated by considering each pair of charges and summing up their contributions.

Wait, but wait. The 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from the fixed charge. So the distance between the fixed charge (13th) and each of the 12 is 2 meters.

But also, the 12 charges are all at 2 meters from P. Are they all at the same point, or are they arranged in some way around P? Oh, wait, the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So maybe they are all at the same distance from P but possibly arranged in a symmetrical way, like on a sphere around P. But for potential energy, maybe their mutual distances don't matter because the potential energy between each pair is what counts.

Wait, but the problem is about the system's minimum energy. Hmm. I think I should model this as a system where the 13th charge is fixed, and the other 12 are each at 2 meters from it. But wait, what about the potential energy between the moving charges themselves? Because each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from P, but their distances from each other could vary. But the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but their positions relative to each other might not be fixed. However, since we're looking for the minimum energy, perhaps arranging them so that their mutual repulsion is minimized would involve bringing them as close as possible to each other. But wait, waitâ€”wait, same charges repel each other. So if they're all at 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances could be as small as possible, perhaps.

Wait, no, the problem states that the 1
