Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let's try to unpack it step by step. Hmm, the question is about stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots on the star affect certain atomic ratios in the photosphere. 

So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When the surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but wait, dark spots are cooler, right? Because sunspots are darker and cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So, when the spots cover part of the surface, the overall emission would decrease, hence the effective temperature goes down.

The main question is about the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti (titanium) in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when there are spots, the ratio (n1/n2) is lower than when there are no spots. The question asks by what factor this ratio changes. They give options A to D.

Hmm, the transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. That's in the near ultraviolet range, I think. Since it's LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), we can probably use the Boltzmann equation for this.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energies, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.

So, the ratio depends on temperature. When the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower, so the ratio (n1/n2) would change. Wait, but what changes here? Let me think. The effective temperature of the star's photosphere would be lower when spots are present. So, the photons emitted are from a cooler photosphere, right?

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500K. But wait, the spots themselves are cooler. So, perhaps the star's overall emission is a combination of the hotter (unspotted) and cooler (spotted) regions. But the problem states that the photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. I think that the effective temperature is the average, considering the spots. So, the photosphere as a whole is at a lower temperature when spots are present.

Wait, but wait, when spots are present, part of the surface is cooler, and part is normal. So the overall Teff is a blend. But for the purpose of this problem, the effective temperature of the photosphere is given as 5500 K. So, when the star has spots, the T_eff is 5500 K, and when it doesn't, it's 6000 K.

So, the ratio of n1/n2 is a function of temperature. Let’s denote R = (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1. Since the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, that means that R_spot is less than R_no_spots.

So the ratio is inversely related to temperature. Because as temperature decreases, the exponential term increases, which would make R larger. Wait, wait. Let's think. The exponential term is exp( -ΔE/(kT) ). So higher T makes the exponent less negative, meaning the exponential term gets larger, so R increases if T decreases. Wait, no. Let me compute.

Suppose ΔE is positive (E2 > E1). Then, exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). If T decreases, the denominator kT is smaller, so the exponent becomes more negative, so the exponential term is smaller. So R would decrease when T decreases. Because R is proportional to exp( -x ), where x is positive. So if T goes down, x increases, so exp(-x) decreases. So R decreases when T decreases. Wait, but the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Which aligns because when T decreases, R decreases. So that's correct.

So, the factor by which the ratio changes is (R_no_spots / R_spots). Because the ratio becomes R = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) multiplied by g1/g2, but since g1 and g2 are constants (same for both cases), they will cancel out when taking the ratio.

So, factor = (exp( -ΔE/(k T_no_spots) )) / (exp( -ΔE/(k T_spots) )) ) 

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T_spots) - 1/(T_no_spots)) )

Wait, let me compute that carefully. Let me write it as:

Factor = exp [ (ΔE /k) [1/(T_spots) - 1/(T_no_spots) ] ]

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. Let me compute the exponent:

-ΔE/(k T_no_spots) + ΔE/(k T_spots) 

Which is ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T_spots) - 1/(T_no_spots) ]

Yes, correct.

So, we need to compute this exponent and then take the exponential to find the factor.

We can compute the exponent numerically. Let me note the temperatures:

T_no_spots = 6000 K

T_spots = 5500 K

So, the difference is 500 K. Let's compute 1/5500 - 1/6000.

Compute 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4

1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4

So the difference is 1.818e-4 - 1.6667e-4 = 0.1513e-4 = 1.513e-5

So, 1/(T_spots) - 1/(T_no_spots) ≈ 1.513e-5 1/K.

Now, the energy is related to the wavelength via ΔE = hc/λ. Since the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So, h is Planck's constant 6.626e-34 J.s, c is 3e8 m/s.

ΔE = hc/(lambda) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) 

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J.m

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m

So ΔE ≈ 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.373e-18 J per photon.

But wait, that's per photon. So per atom, the energy is that. But wait, for the Boltzmann equation, we'll be using energy in terms of k*T.

We need to compute ΔE/(k), where k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38e-23 J/K.

So, ΔE/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ 9.95e4 K ≈ 99,500 K.

Wait, that's a very high value. Let me verify the calculations.

Hmm, 1448 Å is 1.448e-7 meters. So hc/(lambda) = (6.626e-34 Js)(3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m) 

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.373e-18 J.

Yes, that's correct. Now, k=1.38e-23 J/K, so:

ΔE/(k) = (1.373e-18) / (1.38e-23) ≈ (1.373/1.38) * 1e5

1.373 / 1.38 ≈ 0.995. So, approximately 9.95e4 K.

So, ΔE/(k) ≈ 99,500 K.

So, putting it back into the exponent:

Exponent = (99,500 K) * (1.513e-5 1/K) 

Wait, 99,500 * 1.513e-5 = let's calculate that.

99,500 = 9.95e4

Multiply by 1.513e-5:

9.95e4 * 1.513e-5 = 9.95 * 1.513 * 1e-1 

9.95 * 1.513 ≈ 15.05 → 15.05 * 0.1 = 1.505.

So the exponent is approximately 1.505.

So the factor is exp(1.505) ≈ e^1.505.

We know that e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817. Let me compute e^1.505.

Using a calculator approximation:

e^1.5 = 4.481689

e^0.005 = approx 1.0050125.

So e^1.505 ≈ e^1.5 * e^0.005 ≈ 4.4817
