Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. Titrations can be a bit tricky, but let me think through this step by step.

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, when they say 25% titration, that's 25% of the equivalence point volume, right? Or perhaps 25% of the initial amount of acetic acid? I think it's the former—so we're looking for the pH when 25% of the required NaOH has been added.

Let me break this down.

First, I need to calculate the initial moles of acetic acid before dilution. The volume is 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) and the concentration is 0.05 M.

Moles of CH3COOH = Molarity × Volume (in L) = 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

Then, we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration of acetic acid after dilution would be (0.001 moles) / 0.04 L = 0.025 M.

Wait, that's correct? Because when you dilute, the moles stay the same, but volume increases, so concentration decreases. Yep, 0.025 M is right.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equal moles of CH3COOH. So the moles of NaOH needed would be 0.001 moles.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is (moles) / (concentration) = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. Wait, but that's the volume at equivalence. Oh wait, wait, no. Because the solution is diluted to 40 cm³, but the equivalence volume is based on the moles of acid.

So, the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH has been added. Because 10 cm³ × 0.1 M = 0.001 mol NaOH, which matches the 0.001 mol of CH3COOH.

Now, the first part is the pH at 25% titration. That would be when 25% of the NaOH required is added. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is 0.0025 L × 0.1 M = 0.00025 mol NaOH added.

Wait no, wait: 2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 L. 0.0025 L × 0.1 M = 0.00025 mol NaOH. So, moles of NaOH added are 0.00025 mol.

The reaction consumes CH3COOH and produces CH3COO^- Na^+. So, initial moles of CH3COOH is 0.001 mol.

After adding NaOH (0.00025 mol), moles of CH3COOH will be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed will be 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total volume during the titration changes. Initially, the diluted solution is 40 cm³, and when we add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume is 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So, the concentrations will be:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Now, since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa is -log(Ka), Ka = 1.85e-5.

Let me calculate pKa: log(1.85e-5) ≈ 4.73 (since log(1.85)=0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733, so pKa is 4.733, approximately 4.73).

So pH = 4.73 + log( (0.005882) / (0.017647) )

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253, which is about 4.25. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value, so that's close.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution will be basic.

Wait, when you reach the equivalence point, all the CH3COOH is converted to CH3COO^- Na^+.

The moles of CH3COO^- is 0.001 mol, and the total volume is initial 40 cm³ plus 10 cm³ (equivalence point volume) → 50 cm³ or 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate ions is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Since acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate can be calculated from Ka of acetic acid. Kb = Kw / Ka.

Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

Using the approximation for weak base:

[OH^-] = sqrt(Kb × C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 × 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98.

pH is 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Let's see, the options for equivalence points are 8.52, 6.73, 7.00, 6.92.

Hmm, none of them are around 9. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check.

Wait, wait, wait. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. The solution is Na acetate, which is a weak base. So, the pH should be above 7. But the options don't have equivalence points above 7 except option A (8.52) and D (6.92 no, that's lower than 7). Wait, no, option A's equivalence is 8.52, which is higher than 7.

But according to my calculation, it should be around 9.02, which isn't any option. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let's recheck.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approx 5.405e-10. Correct.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

So, for the hydrolysis: Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is [OH^-], then Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So pOH is about log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04)=0.017, so 4.983. pH is 14 -4.983=9.017. So approximately 9.02.

But none of the options have 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is 0.02 M acetate, but maybe considering activity coefficients or something else, but that's beyond the basic assumption.

Wait, maybe the initial approach is incorrect. Another way to approach the equivalence point is to calculate the pH using the hydrolysis of acetate.

Another approach: Using the formula for weak base pH.

The formula is pH = pKa + pKb + log(...) Wait, no. Wait, the formula for a base is:

pOH = pKb + log(sqrt(C/(1 + sqrt(Kb/C))))) No, perhaps it's better to use the approximation.

But let's try using the exact expression. Let's set up the equation:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ (x)(x)/(0.02 - x) ≈ x²/(0.02) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, which it is since Kb is small.

So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5 → pOH is about 4.98 → pH is 9.02.

Hmm, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I did something wrong earlier.

Wait, maybe the equivalence point isn't 10 cm³ because the initial moles are 0.001, and NaOH is 0.1 M. Yes, that's correct. So 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L → 10 cm³. So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the initial moles were miscalculated. Let me double-check:

Initial volume of acetic acid: 20 cm³ → 0.02 L. Concentration 0.05 M.

Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Correct.

After adding 20 cm³ water, total volume is 40 cm³. Correct.

Wait, perhaps when calculating the concentration after adding NaOH, I forgot to account for the added volume?

Wait, at 25% titration, the NaOH added is 2.5 cm³, so total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³. So the concentrations I calculated earlier should be correct.

Wait, but maybe the Henderson-Hasselbalch approach was correct, giving a pH around 4.25, and the equivalence point I'm getting doesn't match any options. So maybe the error is elsewhere.

Wait, wait, the options have equivalence points as 8.52 (option A), 6.73 (B), 7.00 (C), 6.92 (D). So perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Maybe I should have considered that the solution is a buffer, but no, at equivalence, all the acid is neutralized.

Another thought: Maybe the solution isn't just the acetate ion. Wait, no, at equivalence, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form acetate and water.

So why am I getting a pH of ~9.02, which isn't in any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution. Let's re-examine that.

We have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, we add 20 cm³ of water, so total volume 40 cm³. So the concentration becomes 0.025 M, as I calculated before.

So when titrating, the initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001, and the initial concentration is 0.025 M. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the equivalence point with the point where all the acid is neutralized, but maybe the solution is not as simple as that. Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the volume calculation.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Since both solutions are in the same volume, perhaps?

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The initial solution is 0.001 moles of acetic acid. To neutralize that, you need 0.001 moles of NaOH, which is 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. So that's correct.

So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH has been added. So total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³. So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 /0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Hmm, so same as before. So why doesn't the pH match any options?

Wait, perhaps the Kb is miscalculated. Let me re-calculate Kb.

Ka =1.85e-5. Kw is 1e-14, so Kb= (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10.

So, Kb=5.405e-10.

Wait, another approach: Use the formula for pH of a salt solution.

pH = 1/2 (pKa + pKw) - log sqrt(C*Kb)

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, using the formula for a weak base:

[OH^-] = sqrt( C * Kb )

Which is what I did, giving [OH^-]≈1.04e-5, so pOH≈4.98, pH≈9.02.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption about the equivalence point is wrong. Let me think about the actual reaction again. Wait, NaOH is a strong base, so it will deprotonate all the acetic acid. So yes, all the acetic acid becomes acetate, and the solution is just the sodium acetate.

Hmm, but the options don't have a pH near 9. So maybe I made a mistake in the initial moles.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the initial moles. Let me check again.

Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Correct.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe during the titration, the initial solution is more diluted. Because when you add 20 cm³ of water, the concentration is 0.025 M, but perhaps when you add the NaOH, the volume changes. Wait, but in the calculation for the 25% titration, I accounted for the added NaOH volume, so the concentrations are correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is with the assumption that the solution is a strong base? No, NaOH is strong, but the acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact expression for Kb.

The exact expression for Kb is x²/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So the approximation holds. So x ≈ sqrt(0.02 *5.405e-10) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

pH is 14 - 4.98 =9.02. So this is correct, but doesn't match any options.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the equivalence point. Maybe I should think about the pH at equivalence point differently. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about the equivalence point but the midpoint? No, equivalence point is when all acid is neutralized.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the initial solution after dilution isn't 0.025 M. Let's recalculate:

Original solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid → 0.001 mol.

Add 20 cm³ water → total volume 40 cm³.

0.001 mol /0.04 L = 0.025 M. Correct.

So, yes, 0.025 M.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that when titrating, the solution's volume changes, and I should account for that.

Hmm, but in the 25% titration, I added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, so the total volume is 42.5 cm³, which I accounted for.

So, if my calculation for the equivalence point gives pH ~9.02, but the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about the equivalence point but about the halfway point. No, the question is about equivalence point.

Wait, looking at the options, the equivalence point is in option D as 6.92, which is below 7. That would imply that the solution is acidic, which doesn't make sense because the solution is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So it should be basic, pH>7.

Only option A has equivalence point pH higher than 7. Option A's equivalence point is 8.52.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Kb.

Wait, let's compute Kb again.

Ka =1.85e-5.

Kb = Kw/Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10. Correct.

Thus, my initial calculation of pH ~9.02 is correct, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I used the Kb of acetate. Another approach: Maybe I should calculate the pH using the concentration of CH3COO^- and the Kb.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the solution is not just the acetate ion but also considering the sodium hydroxide. No, at equivalence, all the acid has been neutralized, so the solution is only sodium acetate, a salt.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a salt solution correctly.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the solution is a buffer at some point, but at equivalence, it's only acetate.

Hmm, perhaps I should check the options again.

The options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Wait, the first part is the pH at 25% titration. I got pH≈4.25, which is close to option A's first value (4.26). So that part aligns with option A. But the equivalence point is 8.52 in option A, which is higher than my calculation of 9.02. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation for the equivalence point. Let me recalculate.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the concentration of acetate correctly.

At equivalence, moles of acetate is 0.001 mol, and the total volume is 50 cm³ (40 +10). So [CH3COO^-] =0.001 /0.05 =0.02 M. Correct.

So Kb=5.405e-10.

So [OH^-] = sqrt(0.02 *5.405e-10) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈1.04e-5.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈4.98 → pH=9.02.

Hmm, perhaps the question has a typo, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, another thought: Wait, maybe the initial solution isn't 0.025 M. Let me think again.

Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So that's 0.001 mol.

Then we add 20 cm³ of water, making total volume 40 cm³. So concentration becomes 0.001/0.04 =0.025 M. Correct.

So, when titrating, the moles of NaOH needed is 0.001, requiring 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

So, the equivalence point is at pH 9.02, which isn't in the options.

But according to the options, the only one where the first pH is around 4.25 is option A, which has 4.26 as first pH.

So perhaps the equivalence point in option A is 8.52. How?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the problem isn't at equivalence point but the midpoint? No, the equivalence point is when moles of base equal moles of acid.

Wait, perhaps using the Henderson equation for the equivalence point isn't correct because, beyond equivalence, we have excess OH-.

Wait, no, at equivalence, no excess. But the solution is just acetate.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial problem is the 25% titration. Let me recheck.

At 25% titration, 25% of the required NaOH has been added.

So, 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. Moles of NaOH added: 0.0025 L ×0.1 M=0.00025 mol.

So, moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 -0.00025=0.00075.

Moles of CH3COO^-:0.00025.

Total volume:40 +2.5=42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

So [CH3COOH] =0.00075 /0.0425= approx 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-]=0.00025 /0.0425≈0.005882 M.

Henderson: pH= pKa + log ( [A-]/[HA] )

pKa is 4.73.

log (0.005882/0.017647)= log(0.333)= -0.477.

So pH=4.73-0.477≈4.253, which is about 4.25.

So the first pH is around 4.25, matching option A's first value of 4.26. But then the equivalence point is not matching.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the equivalence point pH is not using the correct calculation. Let me try using the formula for a weak base again.

Wait, another approach: Using the exact expression.

At equivalence, [CH3COO^-]=0.02 M.

The Kb is 5.405e-10.

So, Kb = x² / (0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 -x≈0.02.

Thus, x²=5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5.

pH=14 -4.98=9.02.

Hmm, same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the Ka given is 1.85e-5, but perhaps it's actually the Ka for the acetate ion? No, no, Ka is for the acid.

Wait, perhaps I should use the correct formula for the equivalence point. Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH using the concentration and Kb, but perhaps I should have considered the hydrolysis correctly.

Another approach: Let's calculate the pH using the exact quadratic equation.

The equation is:

x² = (5.405e-10)(0.02)

So x= sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

So same result.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is elsewhere. Let me look at the options again. Option D has pH at equivalence point as 6.92, which is far below 7, which would mean the solution is acidic. That doesn't make sense for a salt of a weak acid and strong base.

So, perhaps option A is the correct one, with pH at 25% being ~4.26 and equivalence point ~8.52. But according to my calculations, equivalence is ~9.02.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb. Let me recalculate Kb:

Ka of acetic acid =1.85e-5.

So, Kb of acetate = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, another idea: Perhaps the solution isn't acetate but includes some excess OH- from the strong base. No, at equivalence, all the NaOH has reacted, so no excess.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The 25% titration pH is around 4.25, which matches option A. But the equivalence pH doesn't match any option. But perhaps in the options, the closest is A, which has 8.52.

Alternatively, perhaps the equivalence point is calculated using a different approach. Let me think differently: perhaps the solution after equivalence uses the excess OH-.

Wait, no, at equivalence, all the acid is neutralized, so no excess base.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the total volume. Let me think: Initial volume after dilution is 40 cm³. Adding 10 cm³ NaOH at equivalence gives total volume 50 cm³.

So, 0.001 mol acetate in 0.05 L → 0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm, maybe I should compute the pH using the exact expression.

Another approach: Maybe using the formula for a weak base in solution.

The formula for [OH^-] is:

√( Kb * C )

Which is what I did. So same result.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the initial moles of acetic acid are different. Let me recheck.

20 cm³ of 0.05 M: 0.05 M * 0.02 L =0.001 mol. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the solution is not acetate but another species. No.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should calculate the pH at the equivalence point using the formula for a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. Maybe I should use the formula:

pH = pKa + log ( (C_acid) / (C_base) )

Wait, no, that formula is for buffer solutions. At equivalence, it's just the conjugate base.

So, perhaps I'm correct in my initial approach.

In that case, the correct pH at equivalence would be about 9.02, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps none of the options are correct, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem setup. Wait, the problem says "25% titration"—does that mean 25% of the acid has been neutralized, or 25% of the NaOH needed has been added?

Wait, in titration, the percentage titration usually refers to the fraction of the acid that has been neutralized. So 25% titration means 25% of the moles of acid have been neutralized.

So in that case, moles of NaOH added would be 0.25 ×0.001 =0.00025 mol. Which is the same as what I calculated before. So that part is correct.

So, perhaps the problem lies elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the calculations in the options are approximated.

Wait, another idea: Perhaps the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution is 0.025 M, but during the titration, the solution's concentration changes.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different approach for the equivalence point. For example, perhaps the solution is a buffer solution, but no, at equivalence, it's just acetate.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of an ICE table for the equivalence point.

Wait, perhaps I should make an ICE table for the solution at equivalence point.

At equivalence, the solution is 0.02 M CH3COO^-.

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

Initial concentration: 0.02 M, 0, 0.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

So, at equilibrium:

[CH3COO^-] =0.02 -x ≈0.02.

[CH3COOH] =x.

[OH^-]=x.

So, Kb = (x^2)/(0.02) =5.405e-10.

Solving for x: x = sqrt(0.02 *5.405e-10)=sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

pOH: -log(1.04e-5)≈4.98 → pH:9.02.

Same as before.

Hmm.

If none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial problem setup. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask for the pH at the halfway point, which would be pKa, 4.73. But that's not what the question says.

Wait, the options:

A) 4.26;8.52

B)3.17;6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Option A's equivalence point is 8.52. How could that be?

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is that I'm using the Kb for acetate, but perhaps the solution includes some NaOH in excess. Wait, at equivalence, no excess. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps when adding 25% of the NaOH, I should consider the total volume correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact calculation for the 25% titration. Let's do that.

Moles of CH3COOH:0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^-:0.00025 mol.

Total volume:0.0425 L.

So,

[CH3COOH]=0.00075 /0.0425=approx 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-]=0.00025 /0.0425=0.005882 M.

pH = pKa + log ( (0.005882)/(0.017647) )

pKa=4.73.

(0.005882)/(0.017647)=0.3333.

log(0.3333)= -0.477.

pH=4.73 - 0.477=4.253.

Which is 4.25. Closest to option A's 4.26.

So, the first pH is 4.26, as in option A, but the equivalence point doesn't match.

Perhaps I should consider that the solution might be using a different value for pKa.

Wait, let's re-calculate pKa.

Ka=1.85e-5.

pKa= -log(1.85e-5).

Log(1.85)=0.267.

So, pKa=4.733, which is approximately 4.73. Correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the pH at equivalence point is 8.52 because the solution is a buffer, but no, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the solution uses the Henderson equation incorrectly.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the equivalence point is when the moles of NaOH equal the moles of acetic acid, but perhaps the concentration isn't considered.

Wait, perhaps the solution assumes that the pH at equivalence is calculated using the concentration of the sodium acetate solution, but with a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that the equivalence point is when the moles of NaOH equal half the moles of acetic acid. No, that would be the midpoint, which is when pH=pKa.

Wait, the midpoint is when half the acid is neutralized, which is when pH=pKa=4.73. That's the point where 50% of the acid is titrated. So in that case, the pH is 4.73. But in our case, the 25% titration is earlier than the midpoint.

Hmm, perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's unlikely. Perhaps I made a mistake in another part.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH at equivalence point using the exact formula without approximation.

So Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So x²=5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5.

pH=9.02.

Hmm, same result.

So, given this, the only option that has the 25% pH correct is option A (4.26) and equivalence point 8.52. But according to my calculations, the equivalence point is 9.02, which isn't any option. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should check for calculation errors again.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial moles of acetic acid.

Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. 0.05 M ×0.02 L=0.001 mol. Correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution's volume is not 50 cm³ but 10 cm³? No, because at equivalence, you add 10 cm³ to 40 cm³, making 50 cm³.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the solution uses the formula for a weak acid at equivalence, but no, at equivalence, it's the conjugate base.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I should consider that the solution is at 25% titration, which is 25% of the way to equivalence, not 25% of the equivalence volume.

Wait, but that's the same thing. 25% of the equivalence volume is 2.5 cm³. So same calculation.

Hmm.

Another approach: Perhaps the problem uses the same concentration after adding NaOH, not considering the dilution. That would be incorrect, but let me try.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that I should not have considered the dilution when adding NaOH, but that's wrong because the volumes do add up.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I should consider the initial concentration is 0.05 M, and the volume is 40 cm³, but when adding NaOH, the total volume is 40 +2.5=42.5 cm³. So I did that correctly.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects to approximate the pH at equivalence point using the formula pH= pKa + log ( (C_acid) / (C_base) ) ), but that's the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which applies to buffer solutions, not at equivalence.

Wait, no, at equivalence, it's not a buffer. So that approach wouldn't apply.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should have used the initial concentration of acetic acid before dilution. Let me think.

No, because the solution is diluted before titration. So the initial concentration is 0.025 M.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that during the titration, the volume of the solution increases, but the moles of CH3COOH and CH3COO^- change accordingly.

But I think I accounted for that in the 25% titration calculation.

Hmm.

Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the pH at equivalence point. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants the pH at 25% of the equivalence volume, but I'm not sure how that affects the calculation.

Wait, no, 25% titration refers to 25% of the equivalence point in terms of moles, which is what I've done.

Well, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let me calculate the pH at equivalence point using a different method.

We have 0.001 mol of CH3COO^- in 0.05 L → 0.02 M.

The reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb is 5.405e-10.

So, Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-] = x²/(0.02 -x).

We can approximate x as much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02-x ≈0.02.

x²=5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5.

pH=14 -4.98=9.02.

Same result.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the initial volume after dilution is 40 cm³, and when you add 2.5 cm³, the total is 42.5 cm³. But perhaps the solution should be considered as 42.5 cm³ for the 25% titration.

Which I did.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M, but during the titration, the solution's concentration changes. But I accounted for that.

I think I've tried all possible avenues, and the only option that has the correct 25% pH is option A, despite the equivalence point not matching. But I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the equivalence point to be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which would be incorrect. Let's see:

At equivalence, all acid is converted to acetate. So, no HA, only A^-.

So, the ratio [A^-]/[HA] would be infinite, making pH = pKa + log (infinite) → pH approaches pKa + something large, which would be very high, but in reality, the solution is basic.

Hmm.

Well, given that the 25% pH is approximately 4.25 and the options are limited, I'll have to choose option A, which has 4.26 and 8.52 as the pH values. But according to my calculations, the equivalence point is around 9.02, which is not in the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Kb. Let me check again.

Ka=1.85e-5 → pKa=4.73.

Kw=1e-14 → Kb=1e-14/1.85e-5=5.405e-10. Correct.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem uses the approximation where Kb is taken as (1e-14)/(1e-5)=1e-9, which would give Kb=1e-9.

Then, [OH^-]=sqrt(0.02 *1e-9)=sqrt(2e-11)=~4.47e-6 → pOH=5.35 → pH=8.65. Close to option A's 8.52.

But that's a rough approximation, and the actual Kb is 5.4e-10, not 1e-9.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that I should have used the exact value of pKa considering the dilution.

Wait, no, pKa is the same regardless of concentration.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the formula for the pH at 25% titration differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the 25% titration refers to adding 25% of the NaOH solution's volume, regardless of the moles. But that would be incorrect, as titration is based on moles, not volume.

Hmm.

Well, perhaps I should settle on option A, given that the 25% pH matches, even though the equivalence point doesn't. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation for the equivalence point. Let me try to compute it again.

At equivalence,

[CH3COO^-] =0.02 M.

Kb=5.405e-10.

So,

[OH^-] = sqrt(0.02 *5.405e-10) = sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

pH=14 -4.98=9.02.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I should have considered the activity coefficients or some other factor, but that's beyond the scope.

Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to go with option A: 4.26 and 8.52.


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH) with 20.00 cm³ of water, followed by titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The goal is to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

---

### **Step 1: Initial moles of acetic acid**
The initial moles of acetic acid are calculated as:

\[
\text{Moles of CH₃COOH} = \text{Molarity} \times \text{Volume (L)} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
\text{Concentration after dilution} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume (L)}} = \frac{0.001}{0.04} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

---

### **Step 2: Titration at 25% completion**
At 25% titration, 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized by NaOH. Since 0.001 mol of acetic acid requires 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH for complete neutralization, 25% of this volume is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH added} = 0.25 \times 10 \, \text{cm³} = 2.5 \, \text{cm³}.
\]

The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = \text{Molarity} \times \text{Volume (L)} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetic acid remaining are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH₃COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH₃COO⁻} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is now:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 2.5 \, \text{cm³} = 42.50 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH₃COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH₃COO⁻}]}{[\text{CH₃COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) = 4.73 - 0.477 \approx 4.25.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.25**, which matches closely with the first value in **Option A (4.26)**.

---

### **Step 3: pH at the equivalence point**
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form acetate ions. The moles of acetate ion are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH₃COO⁻} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 10.00 \, \text{cm³} = 50.00 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0500 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.001}{0.0500} = 0.0200 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion acts as a weak base in water, undergoing hydrolysis:

\[
\text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻}.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \( K_b \), where:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation for weak bases:

\[
[\text{OH⁻}] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot [\text{CH₃COO⁻}]} = \sqrt{(5.41 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot (0.0200)} = \sqrt{1.082 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, none of the options provide a pH of approximately 9.02 at the equivalence point. The closest match is **Option A (8.52)**, but this value is lower than the calculated pH, suggesting either an approximation or an error in the problem setup.

---

### **Final Answer**
Based on the calculations, the pH at 25% titration matches **Option A (4.26)**. While the equivalence point calculation does not perfectly align with any option, **Option A (8.52)** is the closest among the given choices.

**Answer: A**
