Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem gives me some details about their sizes, masses, and other properties, and I need to find out by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. The options are A to D, all around 2.2 to 2.35, so the factor isn't super large, but I need to compute it accurately.

Let's list the given data:

- Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2.
- The mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. M1 = 1.5 M2.
- Their peak wavelengths are the same. So, λ1 = λ2. Hmm, that's interesting.
- The radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Wait, radial velocity is the speed at which the star is moving away or towards us. But I'm not sure how that affects luminosity... Wait, but the problem says the stars "appear brightest" at the same wavelengths. So perhaps redshift or blueshift comes into play here? Because if a star is moving towards us (negative radial velocity), its light would be blueshifted, so the peak wavelength would be shorter. Conversely, if it's moving away, the light is redshifted, peak wavelength longer.

Wait, but in the problem, the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. So Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. So Star_2 is moving away from us at 700 km/s. Wait, but wait, radial velocity is 700 km/s—so that's moving away. So Star_2's light is redshifted. But the problem states that the peak wavelengths are the same. So does that mean that their intrinsic emission peaks are different, but because of the Doppler effect, they appear at the same wavelength? Or is there another way to interpret this?

Wait, let's recall Wien's Law. The peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature of the black body. So λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.9 x 10^-3 m·K). So if two stars have the same observed λ_max, but one is moving towards us and the other moving away (or not moving), their actual temperatures would be different. 

So let's consider that. Star_1 has radial velocity v1 = 0, Star_2 has v2 = 700 km/s away (positive). So Star_2 is moving away, causing a redshift. So the observed wavelength for Star_2 is longer than its emitted wavelength. Meanwhile, Star_1's observed wavelength is the same as its emitted because v1 is zero.

So the observed λ for Star_2 is λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c) )? Wait, no, I think the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) when moving away, where v is positive for moving away.

Wait, but wait, another version is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z), where z is the redshift. And for non-relativistic speeds, z ≈ v/c. So for small v, λ_obs ≈ λ_emit (1 + v/c).

Wait, but since the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same, λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. Because both stars' spectra peak at the same wavelength.

So λ_emit1 = λ_obs1, since Star_1 isn't moving. For Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c), because it's moving away, causing redshift.

But we're told that λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. So λ_emit1 = λ_obs1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v2/c).

From Wien's Law, λ_emit is inversely proportional to temperature. So λ_emit = b / T.

So substituting, (b / T1) = (b / T2) * (1 + v2 / c )

Simplify: (1 / T1) = (1 / T2) * (1 + v2/c )

So T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c )

But v2 is 700 km/s. Let's compute v2/c.

c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300000 = 0.002333... So approximately 0.002333. So 1 + v2/c is about 1.002333.

So T1 is approximately T2 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.99767 T2. So T1 is slightly less than T2.

But wait, let me think again. Star_1's λ_emit is λ_obs1. Star_2's λ_emit is shorter because it's redshifted to λ_obs2. So λ_emit2 = λ_obs2 / (1 + v2/c) = λ_obs1 / (1 + v2/c), since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So for the temperatures, since λ_emit1 = b / T1, and λ_emit2 = b / T2, and λ_emit1 = (
