Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay, which is given as c multiplied by the matrix S. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). The constant c is h over 4π, so c = h/(4π).

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are often involved in spin operators. Oh right, the Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz. Let me think about what S looks like. The given matrix S is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Hmm, that's similar to the Pauli Y matrix. I think the Pauli Y matrix is actually:

σy = 
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Yes, that's right. So S is the Pauli Y matrix. So Ay is c times σy. Oh wait, but the Pauli matrices usually have eigenvalues ±ħ/2, but since c is h/(4π), let me see. Wait, h is Planck's constant, which is 2πħ. So let me substitute h with 2πħ to see if that helps.

So c = (2πħ) / (4π) ) = ħ/(2). So c = ħ/2. Oh wait, wait: wait h is Planck's constant, which is 6.626e-34 J·s, but in quantum mechanics, ħ is h/(2π), right? So h = 2πħ. So substituting, c = h/(4π) becomes (2πħ)/(4π) = ħ/2. So c is ħ/2.

So now, Ay = (ħ/2) * σy. Now, the eigenvalues of σy are ±1, I think. Because for Pauli matrices, each has eigenvalues ±1. So when multiplied by a scalar, the eigenvalues get scaled accordingly. So the eigenvalues of Ay would be (ħ/2) * (±1) = ± ħ/2. Wait, but wait a second, let me think again. No, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1 because they're traceless and their squares are identity. So σy^2 = I, so the eigenvalues are ±1. So Ay = c σy, so eigenvalues are c * 1 and c * (-1). So they are ± c. Since c is ħ/(2), the eigenvalues would be ± ħ/(2). Wait, but h is 2πħ, so substituting back, maybe I should express it in terms of h instead of ħ.

Wait, wait, the question says the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, and a is the eigenvalue. So the eigenvalues a would be c multiplied by the eigenvalues of σy, which are ±1. So a = c * (±1) = (h/(4π)) * (±1). So a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but let me make sure. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, so Ay has eigenvalues ±c. So c is h/(4π), so a is ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). Hmm, looking at the options, let's see.

Option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2πh or something. Wait, but the eigenvalues a are ±h/(4π), which are real numbers. Because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, right? So σy is Hermitian, so Ay should be Hermitian too. So the eigenvalues should be real. So all the options that talk about the imaginary parts being non-zero must be wrong. So looking at the options:

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh or something. Oh wait, that can't be right because eigenvalues are real. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Again, this implies eigenvalues have both real and imaginary parts, but since eigenvalues are real, B is wrong.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. Hmm, well, A is the angular momentum operator. So A^2 is the square of the angular momentum, which commutes with Az and Ay? Wait, but in general, for angular momentum, [A^2, Ay] = 0, but [Ay, Az] = iħ A_x (maybe?), so they don't commute. So eigenvectors of Ay and A^2 would be the same, but not of Az. So this statement would be correct because if a function is an eigenfunction of A^2 and Ay, then it must be an eigenfunction of all three, but in reality, A^2, Ax, Ay, Az commute. Wait, no, wait, I think A^2 commutes with each component, but the components don't commute with each other. So eigenfunctions of A^2 and Ay are a subset of all possible eigenfunctions, but since A^2 and Ay commute, their eigenfunctions are the same. So any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A^2. But eigenfunctions of Ay won't be eigenfunctions of Az, because Ay and Az don't commute. So option C is correct. Hmm, but let me think more.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, not sure what that means. The basis functions for a 2x2 matrix would typically be a basis for the vector space, like the standard basis vectors. So eigenfunctions of Ay form a basis for the space if they are linearly independent. Since Ay is 2x2, it has two eigenfunctions (assuming they're distinct), so together they form a basis. So D's statement would be correct because the eigenvectors would form an orthonormal basis for the space. Wait, but the question is about whether the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about that, but perhaps the statement is correct. But I'm not certain, so I'll come back to that.

Wait, going back to the options. Let me think about each one.

Option A: Eigenvalues have imaginary parts, which they don't. So A is wrong.

Option B: Same issue as A. So B is wrong.

Option C: Correct in that eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. I think that the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so D is correct as well?

Wait, but perhaps D is making a statement about the eigenfunctions being the basis for the operator. Wait, the operator's matrix is 2x2, so its eigenvectors, if distinct, should form a basis for the 2D space. So their eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. So D's statement would be correct.

Wait, but I'm now confused because both C and D could be correct. But looking back at the options, the question asks which statement is correct, and it's a multiple-choice with single correct answer.

Wait, let's reevaluate the options. Let me read them again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So for option C, since A² and Ay commute, their eigenvectors are the same. So any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So the statement in C that they can also be eigenfunctions of A² is correct. And since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenfunctions are different, so the eigenfunctions of Ay won't be eigenfunctions of Az. So option C is correct.

Now, for option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Since the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis, so yes, they are the basis functions. But the option says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That might be a correct statement. For example, if the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors, then they form the basis. But I'm not sure if the statement is necessarily correct. Because the eigenfunctions could be any orthonormal basis, not necessarily the standard basis. So the statement in D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis, but I'm not sure if the statement is about whether they are the basis functions, which could depend on normalization or choice of basis.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the eigenstates of an observable form an orthonormal basis for the space if they're distinct. So for a 2x2 matrix, two eigenfunctions would form a basis. So option D is correct in that sense.

But wait, the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct? Or maybe only one is correct.

Wait, but the problem is to choose the correct statement. So perhaps I should analyze each option.

Wait, but let's compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors to be thorough.

So Ay = c * S = [ c*0   c*(-i) ]
              [ c*i    c*0 ]

Which is:

[ 0    -i c ]
[ i c   0  ]

Since c = h/(4π), let's plug that in:

[ 0    -i (h/(4π)) ]
[ i (h/(4π))   0 ]

So the matrix is:

( h/(4π) ) * [ 0   -i ]
             [ i   0 ]

Wait, but I think I messed up the substitution. Let me recheck.

Wait, S is given as:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So when multiplied by c, which is h/(4π), then each element becomes c multiplied by the corresponding element in S.

So the (1,2) element is (-i) * c = -i*(h/(4π)).

The (2,1) element is i * c = i*(h/(4π)).

So the matrix Ay is:

[ 0, -i * c ]
[ i * c, 0 ]

Which is:

0   -i (h/(4π))
i (h/(4π))  0

So to find the eigenvalues of Ay, I can compute the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So the matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a , -i c ]
[ i c, -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - ( (-i c)(i c) )

Calculating (-i c)(i c): multiply the two. (-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So ( -i c * i c ) = c^2 * ( -i * i ) = c^2 * ( (-i^2) ) = c^2 * (1) = c^2.

So the determinant is a² - c^2 = 0 → a² = c² → a = ± c.

Since c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4π), which are real numbers. So the eigenvalues are real, so any options referring to imaginary parts are incorrect. So options A and B are incorrect.

Now, looking at option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2. Since A^2 is the square of the angular momentum operator, which in this case is a 2x2 matrix. Wait, but wait, for a spin-1/2 particle, A² would be (ħ/2)^2 * 3 I, because S² = (s(s+1))ħ², where s=1/2. So S² = (3/4)ħ² I. So A² would be (c S)^2 = c² S² = ( (h/(4π))^2 ) * (3/4 ħ² ) I. But perhaps I'm complicating things here.

Wait, but more simply, since Ay and A² commute, they have the same eigenfunctions. Because A² is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix when you're in an eigenstate of Ay. So any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². So option C is correct in that part. The latter part says that they are not eigenfunctions of Az. That's correct because Ay and Az don't commute, so their eigenfunctions are different. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions form the basis functions of the operator. The matrix is 2x2, so the two eigenfunctions (if they are distinct) will form a basis for the space. So the statement in D is correct. But maybe the statement is not accurately worded. Because the eigenfunctions are a basis for the vector space, not necessarily the 'basis functions of the matrix operator.' Hmm, perhaps the wording is a bit off. But in any case, the question is about which of the four options is correct.

So both options C and D seem correct. But let me check the options again.

Wait, option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct. And they are not eigenfunctions of Az, which is also correct.

Option D: Are the eigenfunctions the basis functions of the operator? Hmm, perhaps. Because the operator's matrix in the eigenbasis would be diagonal, so the eigenfunctions form the basis.

Wait, but the matrix operator is 2x2, so any two orthonormal eigenvectors would form a basis. So D is correct.

But wait, the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps C and D are correct, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

Wait, perhaps both are correct, but looking back at the problem statement, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

But perhaps only one of them is correct. Let me think more carefully.

Wait, another approach: compute the eigenvectors.

The matrix Ay has eigenvalues a = ± c. So for each a, the eigenvector satisfies (Ay - a I) φ = 0.

Let's take a = c. Then the matrix becomes:

[ -c, -i c ]
[ i c, -c ]

So the equations are:

- c φ1 - i c φ2 = 0 → -φ1 -i φ2 = 0 → φ1 = -i φ2.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ -i, 1 ]^T. So let me write it as ( -i, 1 ). Similarly, for a = -c, the matrix is:

[ c, -i c ]
[ i c, c ]

So the equations are:

c φ1 - i c φ2 = 0 → φ1 = i φ2.

So eigenvectors proportional to (i, 1)^T.

Now, the two eigenvectors are ( -i, 1 ) and (i, 1 ). They form a basis for the space. So they are the basis functions, making option D correct.

So both C and D are correct statements? Or perhaps not.

Wait, but let me look at the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A². Since A² commutes with Ay, any eigenfunction of Ay is an eigenfunction of A². So this is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the matrix is 2x2, and each eigenvector is a 2-component vector, their combination forms a basis. So D is correct.

But the multiple-choice question probably has only one correct option. So maybe I made a mistake in considering option C.

Wait, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A² because A² commutes with Ay. So C is correct.

But option D is also correct, but perhaps in the context of the question, only one is correct.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps option D is not correct. Because the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the Hilbert space, but not necessarily the basis functions of the operator. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the actual question again. The question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, perhaps option D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, which is the same as the operator's matrix space. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

In that case, both C and D would be correct, but looking at the options, the correct answer must be one of them.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible options again.

Let me go back to the problem. The question is about Ay, which is a 2x2 matrix. Its eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. So yes, because the operator acts on a 2D space, and the eigenvectors form a basis for that space. So option D is correct.

But then, in the options, both C and D could be correct, but I'm probably supposed to pick the correct one.

Wait, perhaps the question is about whether the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct, and whether they form the basis of the operator.

Wait, but let me think about the eigenfunctions of Ay. Since the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors are two orthogonal vectors, so they form a basis for the space. So the eigenfunctions are indeed the basis functions of the matrix operator. So option D is correct.

But looking back at the options, option C and D seem correct, but perhaps only one is correct among the four options.

Wait, perhaps the question is designed so that only one option is correct. So I'll have to choose between them.

Wait, the question says, which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps during the calculation, the student might make a mistake, and the correct statement is one of the options.

Wait, but the eigenvalues are ± c, which are real, so options A and B are incorrect. So the correct statements are among C and D.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the properties of the angular momentum operators. The eigenfunctions of Ay (eigenstates of Ay) are not eigenfunctions of Az because they don't commute. So option C is correct.

Alternatively, the eigenfunctions of Ay do form a basis, so option D is correct.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the eigenfunctions of an observable form a basis for the space, provided they are non-degenerate. Since Ay has two distinct eigenvalues, their eigenfunctions are orthogonal and form a basis. So option D is correct in that sense.

So perhaps both C and D are correct. But the options are presented as four, and only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps looking at the options again. Let me read the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That's correct, because A² commutes with Ay, so they share eigenfunctions, but Az doesn't commute with Ay, so eigenfunctions are different.

Option D: The eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That's correct because they form a basis for the 2D space.

But if the options are mutually exclusive, perhaps only one is correct. Let me consider the wording of the options.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. That might be correct in that they form a basis for the space on which the operator acts, which is a 2D space. So D is correct.

But then, perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options don't allow for that. So perhaps only one is correct, and the other is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C because D is not necessarily correct.

Wait, another angle: the basis functions of the operator might refer to the standard basis vectors. But the eigenvectors are not the standard basis vectors unless the matrix is diagonal. So perhaps the statement in D is not correct because the eigenfunctions are not the standard basis functions unless the operator is diagonal in that basis. But the operator is not necessarily diagonal in the standard basis. Wait, but in the eigenbasis, the operator is diagonal, so the eigenfunctions form the basis in which the operator is diagonal. So perhaps the statement in D is correct.

But I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should look for the correct answer based on the options.

Wait, let me consider each option again.

Option A: The eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh or –2πh. No, because eigenvalues are real, so A is wrong.

Option B: Similarly, eigenvalues have real and imaginary parts. No, B is wrong.

Option C: Correct about eigenfunctions of A² and not Az.

Option D: Correct about the eigenfunctions being a basis.

So both C and D are correct statements. But the options are presented as four, and only one is correct. Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix operator Ay has eigenfunctions that form a basis, so D is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about whether the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. The term "basis functions of the matrix operator" is a bit unclear. Typically, the matrix is represented in a certain basis, and the eigenfunctions form a basis in which the matrix is diagonal. So the statement in D is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the correct answer is option C because the other options are incorrect, and among the four, option C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck, but given the time I've spent, I think option C is the correct choice because it correctly states that the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. So the correct answer would be option C.


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is defined as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix:

\[
S = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvalues of the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix \( S \) are \( \pm 1 \). Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are scaled by \( c \), giving \( \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). These eigenvalues are real, as \( S \) (and hence \( A_y \)) is Hermitian.

2. **Imaginary Parts of Eigenvalues:**
   - The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are real, so any option suggesting nonzero imaginary parts is incorrect. This eliminates **Option A** and **Option B**.

3. **Eigenfunctions and Commutativity:**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) because \( A_y \) and \( A^2 \) commute. However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) (the \( Z \)-component of angular momentum) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \). This makes **Option C** correct.

4. **Basis Functions of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2D vector space on which \( A_y \) acts. This is true because \( A_y \) is a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix with two distinct eigenvalues, ensuring that its eigenfunctions are linearly independent and span the space. Thus, **Option D** is also correct.

5. **Final Decision:**
   - Both **Option C** and **Option D** are correct statements. However, since the question asks for a single correct statement during the calculation, **Option C** is chosen as it directly addresses the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), which is central to the problem.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), while **Option D** is also correct but less directly relevant to the specific question.

**Answer: C**
