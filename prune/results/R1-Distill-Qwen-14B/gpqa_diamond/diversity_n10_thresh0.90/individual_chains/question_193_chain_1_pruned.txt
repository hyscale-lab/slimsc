Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about how the number of stars changes with distance. Hmm, let me try to think through it.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, the formula given is number ~ 1 / plx^5. I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1 / distance (in parsecs, right?), so distance r = 1 / plx.

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So we have number N ~ 1 / plx^5. Let me express N in terms of r.

Since plx = 1/r, substituting that into the equation gives N ~ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's compute that exponent: (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5. So 1 divided by that would be r^5. So N ~ r^5.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. So N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/r. So 1/(plx^5) equals 1/( (1/r)^5 ) = r^5. So yeah, N is proportional to r^5.

But wait, that's the trend for N, but the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. Oh, right, the question is about the change in the number per unit distance. So does that mean we're looking for the derivative of N with respect to r?

Hmm, that's a good point. Because if N is proportional to r^5, then the change in N with respect to r (like dN/dr) would be proportional to 5 r^4. So per unit distance, the number of stars increases by a factor of r^4. So the answer would be r^4, which is option C.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me make sure. The question says, "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)"? So maybe they're asking for the differential, the rate of change. So dN/dr is proportional to r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is increasing as r^4.

So looking at the options, option C is ~ r^4. So the answer should be option C.

Oh wait, noâ€”hold on. Let me think again. The initial relation is N ~ 1/plx^5. And since plx = 1/r, N = kr^5, where k is a constant. So the number of stars increases as r^5. But the question is about how the number changes with distance in terms of per unit range. Hmm, perhaps they're asking for the density, which would involve the derivative. So, for each additional unit of distance, how much does the number increase?

So if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr is 5 kr^4. So the change per unit distance is proportional to r^4, which is option C.

Alternatively, if the question was about the number per unit volume, that would be a different consideration. But since the region is in the sky, perhaps we're assuming a thin slice, so the volume is proportional to area times distance. Wait, but that might complicate things. Or maybe not, because the question doesn't specify any such constraints.

Let me think: The number of stars in a volume is usually proportional to the volume, but here it's different. But wait, in this problem, the number varies as 1/plx^5, which is a different relation than the typical 1/plx^3 (since volume is proportional to 1/plx^3). So I'm probably on the right track.

So putting it all together, since N ~ r^5, the rate of change with respect to r is r^4. So the correct answer is option C.


The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), such that \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \) into the given relation, we find:

\[
N \sim \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5.
\]

This shows that the number of stars increases as \( r^5 \). However, the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, which corresponds to the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Taking the derivative of \( N \sim r^5 \), we get:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \sim 5r^4.
\]

Thus, the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).

From the options provided:
- **A)** \( \sim r^3 \): Incorrect, as the derivative is proportional to \( r^4 \), not \( r^3 \).
- **B)** \( \sim r^5 \): Incorrect, as this represents the total number of stars, not the change per unit distance.
- **C)** \( \sim r^4 \): Correct, as the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \) is proportional to \( r^4 \).
- **D)** \( \sim r^2 \): Incorrect, as there is no basis for this relation in the given problem.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
