Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem is about a star with certain parameters—1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. They want to know the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels is at 1448 Å, and we can assume LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) applies.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms between energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight (like the degeneracy), E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this case, the star isn't uniform—parts are hotter or cooler because of the spots. So when spots are present, part of the surface is cooler than 5500 K, but wait, no. Wait, the star's overall effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% is covered. But I need to clarify: Are the spots hotter or cooler than the surrounding? Generally, sunspots are cooler, right? So when the star has spots covering 40% of the surface, the overall Teff is lower. 

But wait, the question says that when the spots are present, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. But does that mean that the rest of the surface is at a higher temperature? Or is the entire photosphere now at 5500 K? Wait, no, because spots are cooler regions. So the star's photosphere is a mix of hotter and cooler regions. But I'm not sure if the problem is considering that or if it's assuming uniformity.

Wait, the problem says when the star's surface isn't covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K. So I think the star's photosphere is now a combination of two regions: the spotted and the non-spotted. But how does that affect the observed spectrum? Because when we observe the star, the light we see is a combination from both regions.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So if the photosphere isn't at a uniform temperature, how does that affect the population ratio?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying it by considering that without spots, the entire photosphere is at 6000 K, and with spots, it's at 5500 K. But that can't be right because when 40% is covered, the Teff drops to 5500. So that would imply that the average is lower, but the individual regions might have different temperatures.

Wait, but the question states that when the surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the star's photosphere is now a mix, and the observed emission is the sum of the two regions. So the total luminosity would be L = L1 + L2, where L1 is from the 60% of the area at 6000 K and L2 from the 40% at a lower temperature.

Wait, maybe I should calculate what the temperature of the spotted regions is. Because the overall effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% is covered.

Wait, the star's luminosity when unspotted is L1 =4πR²σTeff^4 =4πR²σ*(6000)^4. When 40% is covered, 60% is at 6000 K and 40% is at a lower T_spot. The overall Teff is 5500 K. But Teff is the average over the whole surface, so the total luminosity when spotted would be 4π R² σ (5500)^4 = 0.6 *4π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 *4π R² σ (T_spot)^4.

So, cancel out 4π R² sigma:

(5500)^4 = 0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(T_spot)^4.

Let me compute that.

First, compute each term.

Compute (6000)^4: 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12? Wait, 6^4 is 1296. 6000^4 is 6000*6000*6000*6000 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 *1e12 = 1296e12.

Similarly, 5500^4: 55^4 is 55 *55=3025, 3025 *55=166375, 166375 *55=9150625. So 5500^4 is 9150625e12.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the ratio.

Let me compute (5500/6000)^4 ≈ (11/12)^4 ≈ (0.9167)^4 ≈ approximately 0.9167^2 is about 0.84, so squared again is about 0.705.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the equation:

(5500)^4 = 0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(T_spot)^4.

Let me compute each term.

Compute 5500^4 = (5.5e3)^4 = (5.5)^4 *1e12. 5.5^2 is 30.25. 5.5^4 is (30.25)^2 = 915.0625. So 5500^4=915.0625e12.

Similarly, 6000^4 is 1296e12.

So equation becomes:

915.0625e12 = 0.6 *1296e12 + 0.4*(T_spot)^4.

Compute 0.6 *1296e12 = 777.6e12.

So 915.0625e12 = 777.6e12 + 0.4*(T_spot)^4.

Subtract: 915.0625 -777.6 = 137.4625e12 = 0.4 (T_spot)^4.

So (T_spot)^4 = 137.4625e12 / 0.4 = 343.65625e12.

So T_spot^4 = 343.65625e12.

Take the fourth root: T_spot = (343.65625e12)^(1/4).

Compute 343.65625e12 = 3.4365625e14.

Fourth root of 3.4365625e14.

Wait, 1e14 is (1e3.5)^4 = 3.16e3^4. Hmm, but maybe it's easier to compute as:

3.4365625e14 = 3.4365625 ×10^14.

So the fourth root of 10^14 is 10^(14/4)=10^3.5 ≈3162.27766.

The fourth root of 3.4365625 is approximately 1.36, since 1.3^4 is about 2.8561, 1.36^4: (1.36^2)=1.8496, then squared is approx 3.418. So 3.43656 is close.

So T_spot ≈1.36 * 3162.27766 ≈4300 K.

Wait, that seems very low. Spots are cooler, but 4300 K is a bit extreme for a star spot. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the math.

Wait, equation: (5500)^4 =0.6*(6000)^4 +0.4*(T_spot)^4.

Compute each term numerically.

Calculate (5500)^4: 5500^4 = 5500*5500*5500*5500.

Compute 5500^2=30,250,000.

Then 30,250,000^2 = (3.025e7)^2 = 9.150625e14.

Similarly, 6000^4= (6e3)^4 = 1.296e16? Wait, no: 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 *1e12 = 1296 *1e12 = 1.296e15.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents earlier.

Wait, 1e3 is 10^3. So 6e3 is 6*10^3.

(6e3)^4 =6^4 * (10^3)^4 =1296 *1e12 =1.296e15.

Similarly, 5500^4=5.5e3)^4=5.5^4 *1e12 =915.0625 *1e12=9.150625e14.

So equation:

9.150625e14 = 0.6*(1.296e15) + 0.4*(T_spot)^4.

Compute 0.6 *1.296e15 =7.776e14.

So 9.150625e14 =7.776e14 + 0.4 (T_spot)^4.

Subtract: 9.150625e14 -7.776e14 =1.374625e14 =0.4*(T_spot)^4.

So (T_spot)^4 =1.374625e14 / 0.4 =3.4365625e14.

Take fourth root: (3.4365625e14)^(1/4).

3.4365625e14 =3.4365625 ×10^14.

The fourth root of 10^14 is (10^14)^(0.25)=10^(3.5)=3.16227766e3.

Now, the fourth root of 3.4365625 is approximately:

Because 1.3^4=2.8561, 1.4^4=3.8416. Our value is ~3.43656.

So between 1.3 and 1.4.

Let me compute 1.35^4: 1.35^2=1.8225, then squared again: ~3.3208. Hmm, 3.32 is less than 3.436.

1.36^2=1.8496, squared again: ≈3.420, which is still less than 3.436.

1.365^2=1.863225, squared: approx 3.470. Hmm, wait, 3.47 is higher than 3.436.

Wait, maybe I should calculate 1.36^4: 1.36^2=1.8496. 1.8496^2 = (approx 3.420). So 1.36^4≈3.42.

Our value is 3.43656. So perhaps 1.364.

But let's proceed. So (3.43656)^(0.25) ≈1.364.

So T_spot =1.364 * 3.16227766e3 ≈1.364 *3162.27766≈4313 K.

Hmmm, that's quite low. That would be a very cool spot, which is plausible? I'm not sure, but perhaps acceptable for the sake of the problem.

So the spotted regions have a temperature of about 4313 K, and the rest is at 6000 K.

But wait, the problem says that when the star's surface isn't covered by spots, the Teff is 6000 K. So when 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the photosphere is a mix of 60% at 6000 K and 40% at ~4300 K.

Now, the problem is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So we need to find how the ratio (n1/n2) changes when going from no spots (T=6000 K) to spots (T=5500 K).

Wait, but wait. The ratio is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Because the ratio is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, when T decreases, the exponent increases because (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes larger as T decreases. So at
