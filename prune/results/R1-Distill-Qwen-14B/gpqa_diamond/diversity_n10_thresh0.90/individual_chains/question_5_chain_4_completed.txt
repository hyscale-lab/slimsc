Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let's see what the question says. 

Alright, the operator is denoted as P, and we're looking for its eigenvector when the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The direction is along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. Oh wait, the x-z plane means the direction vector has components in x and z, but not y. So the direction is something like (a, 0, c), but normalized of course. 

The operator components are given as P_x, P_y, P_z. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. I think these are the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. So let me write them down.

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]. That's the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. And P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

Wait, but the operator in question is P, which is along the direction n. So the operator P is the component in the direction of n. Oh right, because for a vector operator, the component along a direction n is P · n, which would be P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z.

Since n is in the x-z plane, n has components (n_x, 0, n_z). But since it's a direction, n_x² + n_z² =1. So n_x = cosθ and n_z = sinθ, perhaps? Wait, wait, usually, in spherical coordinates, n_x is cosθ and n_z is sinθ, but depending on the convention. Wait, θ is the angle from the z-axis, so n_x = sinθ cosφ, and n_z = cosθ. Oh wait, no, if the direction is in the x-z plane, then φ is zero, so n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ. Right, because in spherical coordinates, if the direction is in x-z plane, the azimuthal angle φ is 0, so yeah, n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ.

So the operator P is P · n = (n_x P_x) + (n_z P_z) because the y-component of n is zero. So substituting, P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Let me compute that. Let's write each term.

n_x is cosθ, so n_x P_x would be (ħ/2) cosθ times the X matrix [[0,1],[1,0]].

Similarly, n_z is sinθ, so n_z P_z would be (ħ/2) sinθ times the Z matrix [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So combining, P = (ħ/2) [ cosθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + sinθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].

Let's compute the matrix elements:

First element (1,1): (ħ/2)( sinθ * 1 )
Element (1,2): (ħ/2)( cosθ * 1 )
Element (2,1): same as (1,2), which is (ħ/2)( cosθ )
Element (2,2): (ħ/2)( - sinθ )

So the matrix form of P is:

[[ (ħ/2) sinθ, (ħ/2) cosθ ],
 [ (ħ/2) cosθ, -(ħ/2) sinθ ] ]

Now, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So we have to solve (P - λ I) v = 0, where λ is +ħ/2.

Let me write λ as ħ/2. So the matrix P - λ I would be:

[ (ħ/2 sinθ) - (ħ/2), (ħ/2 cosθ) ]
[ (ħ/2 cosθ), -(ħ/2 sinθ) - ħ/2 ]

Factor out (ħ/2) from each element:

(ħ/2) [ [ sinθ -1, cosθ ],
          [ cosθ, - (sinθ + 1) ] ]

So the equation is this matrix multiplied by the vector [v1, v2] equals zero.

So the equations are:

( sinθ -1 ) v1 + cosθ v2 = 0
cosθ v1 + ( - (sinθ +1 )) v2 = 0

Let me write these equations:

Equation 1: (sinθ -1) v1 + cosθ v2 = 0
Equation 2: cosθ v1 - (sinθ +1) v2 = 0

These are two equations. Let me see if they're consistent.

Let's take equation 1:

(sinθ -1) v1 + cosθ v2 =0 → equation 1.

From equation 1, solve for v2:

v2 = [ (1 - sinθ) v1 ] / cosθ.

Similarly, from equation 2:

cosθ v1 = (sinθ +1) v2 → v2 = [ cosθ / (sinθ +1) ] v1.

Wait, so from equation 1: v2 = (1 - sinθ)/(cosθ) v1.

From equation 2: v2 = [ cosθ/( sinθ +1 ) ] v1.

So for both to be true:

(1 - sinθ)/cosθ = cosθ/(1 + sinθ )

Let me compute the left side: (1 - sinθ)/cosθ.

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + sinθ):

[(1 - sinθ)(1 + sinθ)] / [ cosθ (1 + sinθ) ) ] → [1 - sin²θ]/[ cosθ (1 + sinθ) ) ] → [cos²θ ]/[ cosθ (1 + sinθ) ) ] → cosθ / (1+sinθ ), which equals the right side.

So the equations are consistent. So we can take either expression for v2.

So v2 = [ (1 - sinθ)/cosθ ] v1.

Wait, but (1 - sinθ) = (1 - sinθ), so let me write this as v2 = [ (1 - sinθ)/cosθ ] v1.

Alternatively, using equation 2, v2 = [ cosθ / (1 + sinθ) ] v1.

Either way, the ratio of v2 to v1 is (1 - sinθ)/cosθ, or cosθ/(1 + sinθ).

Wait, let me compute (1 - sinθ)/cosθ.

Hmm, 1 - sinθ over cosθ. Let me see if that's equal to tan(θ/2) or something.

Wait, I remember that (1 - sinθ) = 2 sin(π/4 - θ/2)^2 or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps we can use trigonometric identities.

Let me compute (1 - sinθ)/cosθ:

We know that:

1 - sinθ = (sin(π/2) - sinθ) = 2 cos( (π/4 + θ/2) ) sin( (π/4 - θ/2) )

But perhaps a better approach is to consider using the identity 1 - sinθ = [ sin(θ/2) - cos(θ/2) ]^2 ?

Wait, perhaps that's not the right way. Alternatively, 1 - sinθ = (sin(θ/2) - cos(θ/2))^2 = sin^2(theta/2) + cos^2(theta/2) - 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) )= 1 - sin theta. So yeah, that's correct.

But perhaps that's not helpful here. Alternatively, (1 - sinθ)/cosθ = [ (1 - sinθ) ] / cosθ.

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + sinθ):

[ (1 - sinθ)(1+sinθ) ] / [ cosθ (1 + sinθ) ) ] → [1 - sin²θ ] / [ cosθ (1 + sinθ) ) ] → [cos²θ]/[ cosθ (1 + sinθ) ) ] → [cosθ]/(1 + sinθ ).

So (1 - sinθ)/cosθ = cosθ/(1+ sinθ ). So both expressions for v2 are consistent.

So, the eigenvector can be written as [ v1, v2 ] = v1 [1, (1 - sinθ)/cosθ ].

Alternatively, it's [ 1, (1 - sinθ)/cosθ ] multiplied by v1.

But let me see what the problem is asking. The question is about the eigenvector, and the options are given in terms of components. So perhaps I can find the components in terms of theta.

Wait, but perhaps the direction n is given as an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, so maybe the angle theta is 2θ, or perhaps the angle is something else. Wait, no, the direction is along some arbitrary theta in the x-z plane, which is the same as theta in spherical coordinates, because in the x-z plane, phi is zero.

Wait, but in any case, the eigenvector components are proportional to [1, (1 - sinθ)/cosθ ].

But perhaps it's better to write it as a vector in terms of sin and cos. Let me think: another approach. Let the eigenvector be [a, b].

Then from equation 1: (sinθ -1) a + cosθ b = 0.

Equation 2: cosθ a - (sinθ +1 ) b = 0.

Let me try to find a ratio between a and b.

From equation 1: (sinθ -1) a = - cosθ b → b = [ (1 - sinθ) / cosθ ] a.

So the vector is [ a,  (1 - sinθ)/cosθ a ].

So the vector can be written as a [ 1, (1 - sinθ)/cosθ ].

Now, to normalize this vector, compute the norm squared: |a|^2 [ 1 + ( (1 - sinθ)^2 )/(cosθ)^2 ) ].

Which is |a|^2 [ ( cos^2θ + (1 - sinθ)^2 ) / cos^2θ ].

Compute the numerator: cos^2θ + 1 - 2 sinθ + sin^2θ = (cos^2θ + sin^2θ) +1 - 2 sinθ = 1 +1 - 2 sinθ = 2 (1 - sinθ).

So the norm squared is |a|^2 [ 2(1 - sinθ) / cos^2θ ].

Wait, but wait, that expression is 2(1 - sinθ) divided by cos^2 theta.

Wait, cos^2 theta is 1 - sin^2 theta, but perhaps I can write it in terms of 1 - sin theta.

Wait, 1 - sin^2 theta = (1 - sin theta)(1 + sin theta).

So cos^2 theta = (1 - sin theta)(1 + sin theta).

So the norm squared is |a|^2 [ 2 (1 - sin theta) ] / [ (1 - sin theta)(1 + sin theta) ) ].

The (1 - sin theta) terms cancel, so we have |a|^2 [ 2 ] / (1 + sin theta).

So to normalize, we set the norm equal to 1:

|a|^2 [ 2 / (1 + sin theta) ] = 1 → |a|^2 = (1 + sin theta)/2 → a = sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ) times some phase factor.

So, the normalized vector is:

[ sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin theta)/2 ) ]

Wait, because the second component is (1 - sin theta)/cos theta times a, which is (1 - sin theta)/cos theta * sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ).

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra earlier.

Wait, no, let me think again. The second component is (1 - sin theta)/cos theta * a.

So, substituting a = sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ), then the second component is (1 - sin theta)/cos theta * sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ).

Hmm, perhaps I can express this differently.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write the vector components in terms of cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), given that sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ) is sin( (theta + pi/2)/2 ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of theta/2.

Wait, using the identity:

sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )

And 1 + sin theta = (sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2))^2.

Similarly, 1 - sin theta = (sin(theta/2) - cos(theta/2))^2.

Wait, let's try that.

1 + sin theta = sin^2(theta/2) + 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) + cos^2(theta/2) ) = (sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2))^2.

Similarly, 1 - sin theta = (sin(theta/2) - cos(theta/2))^2.

So sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ) = [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ] / sqrt(2).

Which is equal to sqrt(1/2) [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ].

Hmm, perhaps this can be written as cos(theta/2) + sin(theta/2), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can write this as sqrt(2) cos(theta/2 - 45 degrees), perhaps.

But perhaps a better approach is to write each component in terms of cos and sin.

Wait, another approach: since the problem is about a spin-1/2 particle in an arbitrary direction, the eigenvectors are the spin-up and spin-down states along that direction. The standard form for the spin-up state along direction n is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T, but since our direction n is in the x-z plane, phi is zero. So phi=0, so the state becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let's think: the standard spin state along a direction (theta, phi) is:

|+> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Since here, the direction is in the x-z plane, phi=0, so sin(theta/2) is real. So the state is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But wait, in our earlier calculation, the normalized vector was [ sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin theta)/2 ) ].

Let me compute those terms. Let's see what's sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ).

Using the identity: sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ) = sin( (theta + pi/2)/2 ), but maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, let's take theta as the polar angle from the z-axis. So for a spin pointing in the direction (theta, 0), the spin-up state is indeed [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but in our problem, the direction n is given as being in the x-z plane. So the angle theta here is the polar angle from the z-axis. So if the operator is along n, then the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But wait, in our earlier calculation, the normalized vector came out to be [ sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin theta)/2 ) ].

Let me compute for a specific theta to see if these are the same. Let me pick theta=0. Then the direction is along the z-axis.

Then, the normalized vector from our earlier calculation would be [ sqrt( (1 + 0)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - 0)/2 ) ] = [ sqrt(1/2), sqrt(1/2) ] = [1/√2, 1/√2 ].

But the spin-up along z is [1,0]^T. Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, that's a problem. So my earlier approach must have a mistake because when theta is 0, the eigenstate should be [1, 0], but according to my calculation, it's [1/√2, 1/√2 ].

Which suggests that I made an error in the calculation.

Wait, let's go back.

Ah, perhaps I messed up the initial setup. Because the operator P is given as a vector operator, and the direction is n.

Wait, the operator for spin in the direction n is (P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z). But in our case, n_y is zero since n is in x-z.

So the operator is P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it as the spin operator S·n, which for spin-1/2 has eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, and the eigenvectors are the spin-up and spin-down states along n.

So the spin-up state is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, as per the standard representation, where theta is the angle from the z-axis.

Wait, but in our problem, when n is along z (theta=0), the state should be [1,0], which is indeed [ cos(0/2), sin(0/2) ] = [1, 0].

But when I computed earlier, when theta=0, I got [1/√2, 1/√2], which is inconsistent. So probably I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

Wait, so where did I go wrong? Let me go back.

Earlier, I wrote the eigenvector as [a, b], with a = sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ), and b = sqrt( (1 - sin theta)/2 ), assuming the direction leads to that.

Wait, but perhaps I should think in terms of the standard spin state. So spin-up along direction n is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

In our case, phi=0, so the state is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

Wait, but in our problem, the eigenvector found earlier is [ sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - sin theta)/2 ) ].

Let me compute if these are equal to cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

Compute (1 + sin theta)/2:

Using the identity, 1 + sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4)^2, but perhaps better to use:

1 + sin theta = [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ]^2.

Similarly, 1 - sin theta = [ sin(theta/2) - cos(theta/2) ]^2.

Wait, let's compute (1 + sin theta)/2:

(1 + sin theta)/2 = [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ]^2 / 2.

So sqrt( (1 + sin theta)/2 ) = [ sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ] / sqrt(2).

Which is equal to [ sqrt(2)/2 (sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2) ) ].

Hmm, that's not equal to cos(theta/2). So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should parameterize the eigenstate differently.

Wait, another approach: Let me take the eigenvector as [ a, b ].

The equation is (P - (ħ/2) I ) [a, b]^T = 0.

So the matrix P is [[ (ħ/2 sinθ), (ħ/2 cosθ) ],
[ (ħ/2 cosθ), -(ħ/2 sinθ) ] ]

Subtracting (ħ/2) I gives:

[ (ħ/2 sinθ - ħ/2 ), (ħ/2 cosθ) ] 
[ (ħ/2 cosθ ), -(ħ/2 sinθ) - ħ/2 ) ]

Factor out ħ/2:

[ (sinθ -1), cosθ ]
[ cosθ, -(sinθ +1) ]

So the equations are:

(sinθ -1) a + cosθ b = 0 → equation 1.

cosθ a - (sinθ +1) b = 0 → equation 2.

Let me take equation 1: (sinθ -1) a + cosθ b = 0.

Rearrange: cosθ b = (1 - sinθ) a → b = [ (1 - sinθ) / cosθ ] a.

Similarly, equation 2: cosθ a = (sinθ +1) b → b = [ cosθ/(sinθ +1) ] a.

So setting the two expressions for b equal: [ (1 - sinθ)/cosθ ] a = [ cosθ/(sinθ +1) ] a.

Assuming a isn't zero (which it can't be because eigenvectors can't be zero), we get:

(1 - sinθ)/cosθ = cosθ/(1 + sinθ).

Cross-multiplying: (1 - sinθ)(1 + sinθ) = cos^2 theta.

Which is 1 - sin^2 theta = cos^2 theta → which holds true, since cos^2 theta = 1 - sin^2 theta.

So the two equations are consistent.

So, the ratio of b to a is [ (1 - sinθ) / cosθ ].

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ 1, (1 - sinθ)/cosθ ].

But to normalize, let's compute:

The vector is [ a, b ] = a [1, (1 - sinθ)/cosθ ].

The norm squared is a^2 [ 1 + ( (1 - sinθ)^2 ) / cos^2 theta ].

Compute the term in the brackets:

= [ cos^2 theta + (1 - 2 sin theta + sin^2 theta ) ] / cos^2 theta 

= [ (cos^2 theta + sin^2 theta ) +1 - 2 sin theta ] / cos^2 theta

= [ 1 + 1 - 2 sin theta ] / cos^2 theta.

= [ 2(1 - sin theta) ] / cos^2 theta.

So the norm squared is a^2 * [2 (1 - sin theta)] / cos^2 theta.

We can set this equal to 1 to find a.

a^2 = [ cos^2 theta ] / [2 (1 - sin theta) ]

So a = cos theta / sqrt( 2 (1 - sin theta) )

But 1 - sin theta = (1 - sin theta), so perhaps we can rationalize the denominator.

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + sin theta):

cos theta * (1 + sin theta) / [ sqrt( 2 (1 - sin theta)(1 + sin theta) ) ) ]

But (1 - sin theta)(1 + sin theta) = 1 - sin^2 theta = cos^2 theta.

So denominator becomes sqrt( 2 * cos^2 theta ) = sqrt(2) |cos theta|.

Assuming cos theta is positive (since theta is between 0 and pi/2 in the x-z plane?), so denominator is sqrt(2) cos theta.

So a becomes [ cos theta (1 + sin theta) ] / [ sqrt(2) cos theta ] ) = (1 + sin theta)/sqrt(2).

Thus, a = (1 + sin theta)/sqrt(2).

Then, b = [ (1 - sin theta)/cos theta ] * a.

Substituting a:

b = [ (1 - sin theta)/cos theta ] * (1 + sin theta)/sqrt(2).

Multiply numerator:

(1 - sin theta)(1 + sin theta) = 1 - sin^2 theta = cos^2 theta.

So b = [ cos^2 theta / cos theta ] / sqrt(2) ) = cos theta / sqrt(2).

Wait, so a is (1 + sin theta)/sqrt(2), and b is cos theta/sqrt(2).

So the normalized eigenvector is:

[ (1 + sin theta)/sqrt(2), cos theta / sqrt(2) ].

Hmm, but I thought earlier that [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] would be the case.

Wait, but let's compute for theta=0:

a = (1 + 0)/sqrt(2) = 1/sqrt(2).

b = cos 0 / sqrt(2) = 1/sqrt(2).

So the vector is [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)], but that's not the same as the spin-up state along z, which is [1,0].

Hmm, so something's wrong here. Because when theta is zero, the direction is along z, and the eigenstate should be [1,0].

But according to this, it's [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)], which is the eigenstate for the X operator.

So I must have made a mistake somewhere in the process.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the direction. Because in the standard spin state, theta is the angle from the z-axis, but in our problem, the direction is in the x-z plane, which would have phi=0. But maybe I should consider that the direction is n = (n_x, 0, n_z) with n_x = cos(theta), n_z = sin(theta), but perhaps the angle theta is defined differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup of the operator P.

Wait, perhaps the operator P is defined as the spin component along n, which is given by (P · n) = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z.

But in our case, n is in x-z plane, so n_y=0. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Hmm, but let me think about the eigenvalues.

The eigenvalues of a spin component along any direction are ± ħ/2.

So for the spin-up state along n, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

So the eigenvector should be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] as per the standard, assuming theta is from the z-axis.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the way I set up the equations.

Let me recast the problem: The operator is P = (n_x P_x + n_z P_z), and we seek the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the matrix is [[ (n_x * 0 + n_z * 1) * ħ/2, n_x * ħ/2 ],
                [n_x * ħ/2, (n_x * 0 + n_z * (-1)) * ħ/2 ] ]

Wait, no, wait: P_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so n_x P_x is [[0, n_x],[n_x, 0]], multiplied by ħ/2.

Similarly, P_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so n_z P_z is [[n_z, 0],[0,-n_z]], multiplied by ħ/2.

So adding them together, P is:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Because P_x contributes 0 and n_x in the off-diagonal terms, and P_z contributes n_z and -n_z on the diagonal.

So the matrix is:

[ [ (ħ/2) n_z, (ħ/2) n_x ],
  [ (ħ/2) n_x, -(ħ/2) n_z ] ]

So when we subtract (ħ/2) I for the eigenvalue equation:

P - (ħ/2) I = (ħ/2) [ [n_z -1, n_x ], [n_x, -n_z -1 ] ]

Wait, no: (P - lambda I) is:

( (ħ/2) n_z - ħ/2 )  (ħ/2) n_x
(ħ/2) n_x              ( - (ħ/2) n_z - ħ/2 )

So factor out ħ/2:

[ (n_z -1) , n_x ]
[ n_x, -(n_z +1) ]

So the equations are:

(n_z -1 ) a + n_x b = 0 → equation 1.

n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0 → equation 2.

So from equation 1: n_z a - a + n_x b = 0 → n_x b = a (1 - n_z )

So b = [ (1 - n_z ) / n_x ] a.

From equation 2: n_x a = (n_z +1 ) b.

Substituting b from equation 1 into equation 2:

n_x a = (n_z +1 ) [ (1 - n_z ) / n_x ] a.

Assuming a ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by a:

n_x^2 = (n_z +1)(1 - n_z )

n_x^2 = (1 - n_z^2 )

But since n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1, this holds true.

So the ratio b = [ (1 - n_z ) / n_x ] a.

Now, the eigenvector is [a, [ (1 - n_z ) / n_x ] a ].

To normalize, compute the norm squared:

a^2 [ 1 + ( (1 - n_z )^2 ) / n_x^2 ]

= a^2 [ (n_x^2 + (1 - n_z )^2 ) / n_x^2 ]

But n_x^2 + (1 - n_z )^2 = n_x^2 + 1 - 2 n_z + n_z^2.

But n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, so it's 1 + 1 - 2 n_z = 2 (1 - n_z )

So the norm squared is a^2 [ 2 (1 - n_z ) / n_x^2 ].

Set equal to 1:

a^2 = n_x^2 / [ 2 (1 - n_z ) ]

So a = n_x / sqrt( 2 (1 - n_z ) )

Now, considering that n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, n_z = sin theta, and n_x = cos theta.

Wait, yes: because if theta is the angle from the z-axis, then n_x = sin theta * cos phi, but since phi=0, n_x = sin theta. Wait no, wait: when theta is the angle from the z-axis, in spherical coordinates, n_x = sin theta cos phi, n_z = cos theta.

Wait, no, wait: I think I got it mixed up. Let me clarify: in spherical coordinates, a point is given by r, theta, phi, where theta is the polar angle from the positive z-axis, and phi is the azimuthal angle in the xy-plane.

So, the components in Cartesian coordinates are:

x = r sin theta cos phi,

y = r sin theta sin phi,

z = r cos theta.

But in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi=0. So x = r sin theta, z = r cos theta.

But since it's a unit vector, r=1, so n_x = sin theta,

n_z = cos theta.

Wait, but earlier I thought n_x = cos theta. Hmm, maybe that's where I went wrong.

Wait, if the direction is in the x-z plane, then the polar angle theta is measured from the z-axis, so n_z = cos theta, and n_x = sin theta.

Wait, that makes more sense. So for theta=0, the vector is along z: n_x=0, n_z=1.

At theta=pi/2, it's along x: n_x=1, n_z=0.

So earlier, I think I got the parametrization wrong. So n_x = sin theta, n_z = cos theta.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier.

So substituting n_x = sin theta, n_z = cos theta.

So the ratio b = [ (1 - n_z ) / n_x ] a = [ (1 - cos theta ) / sin theta ] a.

Now, the normalized vector requires a^2 = (n_x)^2 / [2 (1 - n_z ) ].

Since n_x = sin theta, and 1 - n_z =1 - cos theta.

So a^2 = sin^2 theta / [ 2 (1 - cos theta) ].

But 1 - cos theta = 2 sin^2(theta/2),

and sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So sin^2 theta = 4 sin^2(theta/2) cos^2(theta/2).

Substituting:

a^2 = [4 sin^2(theta/2) cos^2(theta/2) ] / [ 2 * 2 sin^2(theta/2) ) ]

Wait, denominator is 2*(2 sin^2(theta/2 )) )=4 sin^2(theta/2).

Wait, no: 2*(1 - cos theta) = 2*(2 sin^2(theta/2)) )=4 sin^2(theta/2).

Wait, but the denominator in a^2 is 2*(1 - cos theta) = 2*(2 sin^2(theta/2)) )= 4 sin^2(theta/2).

So:

a^2 = [4 sin^2(theta/2) cos^2(theta/2) ] / [4 sin^2(theta/2) ) ] )= cos^2(theta/2).

So a = cos(theta/2).

Then, since a is positive (we can choose the positive root), a=cos(theta/2).

Then b = [ (1 - cos theta ) / sin theta ] * a.

Compute (1 - cos theta ) / sin theta:

= (2 sin^2(theta/2)) ) / ( 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) )) )= [ sin(theta/2) ] / [ cos(theta/2) ] )= tan(theta/2).

So b = tan(theta/2) * a = tan(theta/2) * cos(theta/2) = sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Ah, that makes sense now. So when theta=0, the vector is [1,0], which is correct.

So, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So looking at the options:

Option C is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which matches our result.

But wait, the problem statement says "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane" so the eigenvector should have components that depend on theta, which is the angle from the z-axis.

So the correct answer should be option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A) (√(2/3) ħ, √(1/3) ħ )

B) (cosθ, e^{iϕ} sinθ )

C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

D) ( sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) )

So option C matches our result. So the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is defined as $\vec{P} = \vec{n} \cdot \vec{P}$, where $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$,
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$,
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$.

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis. The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is then:

\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \sin\theta P_x + \cos\theta P_z.
\]

Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the resulting matrix for $\vec{P}$ is:

\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, we solve the eigenvalue equation:

\[
(\vec{P} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I) \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = 0,
\]

where $I$ is the identity matrix. Subtracting $\frac{\hbar}{2} I$ from $\vec{P}$ gives:

\[
\vec{P} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

1. $(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0$,
2. $\sin\theta a - (\cos\theta + 1)b = 0$.

From the first equation, solving for $b$ gives:

\[
b = \frac{(1 - \cos\theta)}{\sin\theta} a.
\]

Substituting this into the second equation confirms consistency. The eigenvector is therefore proportional to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = a \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \frac{(1 - \cos\theta)}{\sin\theta} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we compute the norm:

\[
\| \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} \|^2 = a^2 \left( 1 + \left( \frac{(1 - \cos\theta)}{\sin\theta} \right)^2 \right).
\]

Using trigonometric identities, $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, the normalization simplifies to:

\[
a = \cos(\theta/2), \quad b = \sin(\theta/2).
\]

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$**.
