Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it carefully.

The question says X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given values are E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances, all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. 

Hmm, okay. I remember that the mean decay length of a particle is related to its lifetime and speed. The formula I recall is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ) multiplied by the velocity (βc), but wait, let me think.

Wait, the mean decay distance (L) is given by L = c * τ * β. Because β is v/c, so that makes sense. Because τ is the lifetime, and the distance is how far it travels before decaying. So, yes, L = c * τ * β.

But first, I need to find the lifetime τ of the meson. The lifetime is related to the width Γ through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So, Γ is the width, which is the uncertainty in energy, and τ is the uncertainty in time, which is the lifetime. So,

τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact relation. Let me think. The resonance width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ ≈ ħ / τ. So, τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Right.

So first, calculate τ using ħ divided by Γ.

Then, find β, the velocity of the meson. Since the meson is moving at some speed, which is determined by its energy and mass.

The energy of the meson is given as E = 8 GeV. The mass is m = 1.2 GeV. So, the total energy E is related to the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy.

The relativistic energy relation is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So, p² c² = E² - (m c²)².

So, p = sqrt( (E² - (m c²)² ) ) / c.

Wait, but we can compute the momentum and then find the velocity β.

Alternatively, the velocity
