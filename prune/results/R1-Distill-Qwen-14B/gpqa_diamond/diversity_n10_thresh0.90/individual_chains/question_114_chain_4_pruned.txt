Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it through again.

The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with something called 'A' to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and uses reagent B (which is H2O) to become 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options for A and B are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm. So I think I need to work out what each reagent does in each step.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures to visualize.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So it's a ketone, right? NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that when a ketone reacts with a nucleophile like CN-, it can undergo a nucleophilic addition. But wait, usually in ketones, the alpha position is where the nucleophilic attack happens. Wait, but butan-2-one has two methyl groups attached to the carbonyl. So adding CN- would add to the carbonyl carbon. But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure.

The product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait. Wait, butanenitrile is four carbons with a nitrile. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would be:

The nitrile group is on the fourth carbon. So, structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, maybe I should count the carbons. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, no, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but wait, butane has four carbons. So butanenitrile would be CH3CH
