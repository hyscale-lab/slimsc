Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a meson resonance, X, and we're supposed to find the mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, like hadrons, and they can decay into other particles. The decay distance probably has something to do with how far the particle travels before it decays. 

The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. Wait, GeV and MeV are units of energy, right? And Γ is the decay width, which relates to the particle's lifetime. Oh, right, the decay width is connected to the mean lifetime via the uncertainty principle. 

I think the formula for the mean lifetime τ is τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, isn't that only when the width is the total decay width? I think that's the case here. So once I find the lifetime, I can find the mean decay distance by calculating the speed of the particle multiplied by the lifetime. 

But wait, the speed of the meson depends on its energy and mass. Since the production energy is given, which is higher than the rest mass energy (1.2 GeV), the meson is moving relativistically. So I should probably calculate its velocity using relativistic equations. 

Let me lay out the steps:

1. Calculate the total decay width Γ. Wait, Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ_X = 0.32 GeV.

2. Find the mean lifetime τ = ħ / Γ. Remember to convert units properly. The Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So, τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me compute that: 6.582 divided by 0.32 is around 20.56875. So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, wait, no, because 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 would be (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. Let me calculate 6.582 / 0.32. 0.32 * 20 = 6.4, so 6.582 is 6.4 + 0.182, so 20.56875. So 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. That seems really short, but particles with high energy decay quickly? Or is this correct?

Wait, wait. The mean lifetime is inversely proportional to the decay width. A larger Γ means a shorter lifetime, which makes sense. So for a width of 0.32 GeV, the lifetime is about 2e-24 seconds. That seems correct. 

3. Next, find the velocity of the meson. Since the production energy is 8 GeV, which is much higher than the rest mass energy (1.2 GeV), the meson is moving at a speed close to the speed of light. So relativistic effects are important here.

The total energy E is given by E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. So, E_X = γ m_X c². We can solve for γ: γ = E_X / (m_X c²). 

Wait, but E and m are both in GeV, so perhaps we can calculate γ as E / m, since m_X c² is 1.2 GeV. So γ = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

So γ is approximately 6.6667. Then the velocity v is given by v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Let me compute that.

Compute 1/γ²: 1/( (8/1.2)^2 ) = (1.2/8 )² = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ c * 0.9887. 

But wait, let me compute it more accurately. Let me see, 8 divided by 1.2 is 6.666666..., so γ is 6.6666667. Then γ squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.4444. So 1/γ^2 is 9/400 = 0.0225. Then 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887, as I thought. So v ≈ 0.9887c.

4. Now, the mean decay distance
