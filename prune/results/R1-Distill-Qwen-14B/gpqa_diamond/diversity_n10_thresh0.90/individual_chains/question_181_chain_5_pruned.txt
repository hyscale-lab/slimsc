Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, like the proton-proton chain, and neutrinos are a byproduct. The question is about what happens if the pp-III branch suddenly stops.

Wait, let me think. The Sun's core is mainly doing the proton-proton (pp) reactions. There are different branches of the pp chain. The pp-I branch is the main one, right? It produces helium-4. Then there's the pp-II branch, which I think produces boron-8, and the pp-III branch maybe contributes a little bit.

Oh, right! The pp-III branch is one of the minor branches in the proton-proton chain. So if it suddenly stops, the main neutrino flux from that source would decrease. But neutrinos are also produced in other processes, like the boron-8 neutrinos from the pp-II branch.

But the question is about the ratio of fluxes between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to figure out how the pp-III branch affects these bands.

I think neutrinos from each reaction have characteristic energies. For example, the electron neutrinos from the main pp chain (pp-I) have lower energies, while the pp-III might produce higher-energy neutrinos, maybe around 800-900 keV? Or wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are in the lower band.

Wait, I remember that the main source of high-energy neutrinos (like above 500 keV) in the Sun comes from the boron-8 production in the pp-II branch. The pp-I produces lower-energy neutrinos, around 200-400 keV, I think. So if the pp-III branch stops, which neutrinos are affected?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The pp chain has three main branches. The majority is the pp-I, which produces helium-4 and emits lower-energy neutrinos. The pp-II branch leads to boron-8, which emits higher-energy neutrinos, around 15-20 MeV, so those are the ones that contribute to the higher energy neutrinos, like in the 800 keV range.

Wait no, wait. Boron-8 decays into Be-8 and emits a positron and a neutrino. The neutrino from that decay has an energy of about 15-20 MeV, which is way higher than the keV range. So that's not in the bands we're considering. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps the neutrinos from the pep (proton-electron-proton) branch, which is part of the pp chain, emit neutrinos with higher energies. The pep reaction produces neutrinos around 1-2 MeV, which is still higher than the keV range. But the question is dealing with 700-800 and 800-900 keV. That's lower than a MeV, so maybe these are from other processes?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recall. Oh, right! The neutrinos emitted during the CNO cycle (which occurs in the Sun's shell, not the core) produce neutrinos, but their energies are also lower, maybe around 0.5 MeV or so. But wait, I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the main neutrino sources are:

1. The main pp-I branch: emits lower-energy neutrinos, about 0.4 MeV on average.

2. The pp-II branch: produces boron-8, which later decays into Be-8 and emits a neutrino of about 15-20 MeV.

3. The pp-III branch: I'm not as familiar, but maybe it's a minor contributor. Perhaps it produces higher-energy neutrinos than pp-I but lower than pp-II.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, the flux of neutrinos from that branch is gone.

Now, the question is about the flux ratio between band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV). So which neutrino sources contribute to these bands?

If the pp-III neutrinos are in band 2, then stopping pp-III would reduce the flux in band 2. But if they're in band 1, it would affect band 1.

Wait, I think the main neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range are from the pp-I branch, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III produces neutrinos in the 800-900 keV range.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos from the other branches (like pp-II, which is the boron-8 branch) have higher energies, while pp-III is a mid-energy contributor.

Wait, I should think about the typical energies. The main pp-I neutrinos are around 0.4 MeV (400 keV). The pp-III, maybe around 1 MeV (1000 keV), which is above the 900 keV band. Hmm, but that would mean the pp-III neutrinos are in the 800-900 keV band and above. So if pp-III stops, the neutrinos in band 2 (800-900 keV) would be affected more.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped. So the neutrinos from that branch are no longer emitted.

If the pp-III neutrinos are in band 2 (800-900 keV), then the flux in band 2 would decrease significantly if pp-III stops. But if the pp-III neutrinos are in band 1 (700-800 keV), then stopping pp-III would affect band 1 more.

Alternatively, maybe the neutrinos from pp-III are spread across multiple energy bands, but I think each branch has a characteristic energy.

Wait, perhaps I should look for some data. From what I remember, the main pp-I neutrinos are about 0.4 MeV, pp-II (B-8) produce higher-energy neutrinos, like around 15 MeV. So maybe the pp-III neutrinos are in the 1-2 MeV range, so in the 1000 keV and up. So if pp-III stops, the neutrino flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) wouldn't be affected as much, because 1 MeV is 1000 keV, which is outside band 2.

Wait, band 2 is 800-900 keV. So 1 MeV is 1000 keV, which is just above band 2. So the pp-III neutrinos are in the 1 MeV range, which is above band 2. So if pp-III stops, that would reduce the number of neutrinos in band 2, but perhaps not entirely. Wait, but if the pp-III neutrinos are in the 1 MeV range, then they don't contribute to bands below that. So the 800-900 keV band is lower than that.
