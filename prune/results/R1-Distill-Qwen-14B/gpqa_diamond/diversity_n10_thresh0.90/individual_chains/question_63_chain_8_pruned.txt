Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember from my notes that diatomic molecules can be modeled as a rigid rotor and a harmonic oscillator. But wait, this question says it's the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, the non-rigid model accounts for bond length changes during vibration, but I'm not sure how that affects the energy levels.

The question is about a molecule in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So it's the state where both the rotation and vibration are in their lowest possible energy levels. Now, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I think the next state would be the first excited state, which could involve either a change in rotation, vibration, or both. But the question is about the momentum of the photon needed for this transition.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the energy levels in the rotation-vibration model. In the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized. For a rigid rotor, the energy levels are given by something like E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But for a non-rigid rotor, the bond length changes, so the moment of inertia isn't constant. So the rotational energy might depend on vibrational state as well.

But I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here. The problem gives the angular frequency of vibration, w. Oh, right, the vibration energy levels are given by the quantum harmonic oscillator model. The energy levels for vibration are E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħw, where v is the vibrational quantum number. The fundamental state is v=0, so the lowest energy.

When a photon is absorbed, the molecule can either increase its vibrational state or change its rotational state, or both. But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy, so I think that's the first possible transition when absorbing a photon. So the photon's energy should be equal to the difference between the energy of the next state and the current state.

Wait, but in the non-rigid model, the rotational energy depends on the vibrational state. So the energy levels are split into rotational and vibrational parts. So maybe the energy levels are a combination of both. But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible transitions.

The molecule is in the fundamental state, which I believe is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So E_initial = E_vib(0) + E_rot(0,0). The next state with the lowest energy could be either increasing the vibrational state to v=1, or increasing the rotational state to J=1, whichever requires a lower energy photon. Or perhaps the molecule can change both, but that would require more energy.

Wait, the energy required for a vibrational transition is E_vib = ħw. Because when v increases by 1, the energy increases by ħw. For rotational transitions, the energy change depends on the rotational constants. In rigid rotor, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1). So the difference between J=0 and J=1 would be B*(1)(2) - 0 = 2B. So the photon's energy would be 2B. But wait, in the non-rigid rotor model, B is dependent on the bond length, which changes with vibrational state. Hmm, but in the fundamental state, since v=0, the bond length is at its equilibrium length R.

Wait, but I'm not sure how the non-rigid rotor affects the rotational energy levels in this context. Maybe the question simplifies things and treats the molecule as a rigid rotor for the rotational part, given that the bond length R is provided. Because, otherwise, I don't have enough information about the vibrational impact on the rotational constants.

So perhaps the problem is combining the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator models. So the total energy would be E = E_vib + E_rot. The molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0.

The next state would be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. Which transition requires lower energy? Let's compute both Delta E.

Energy for vibrational transition: E_vib = (1 + 1/2) ħw - (0 + 1/2) ħw = ħw.

Energy for rotational transition: E_rot = B(2) - B(0) = 2B.

Which is smaller between ħw and 2B?

The given w is 4e14 rad/s. Let me compute ħw. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So ħw = 1.05457e-34 * 4e14 = approx 4.218e-20 J.

Now, what's B? B is the rotational constant, which is h/(8 pi^2 c I), where c is speed of light and I is moment of inertia. Wait, no, B is ħ/(2 I) for a rotor. Alternatively, B is given by (h/(8 pi^2 I c)), but I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. Let me think again.

The rotational constant B is given by B = ħ/(2 I), where I is the moment of inertia. I is μ R², with μ being the reduced mass.

So first, compute the reduced mass μ.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) = (40) / (22) amu. Let me compute that: 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but atomic mass units (amu) need to be converted into kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.021e-27 kg.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 m, so R = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ R² = 3.021e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.021e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg m².

Then B = ħ/(2 I) = (1.05457e-34 J s) / (2 * 1.208e-46 kg m²) ) = (1.05457e-34) / (2.416e-46) ) ≈ 4.364e11 s^-1.

Wait, because B has units of s^-1. So B is 4.364e11 1/s.

The energy for rotation is E_rot = B J (J+1). For J=0 to J=1, E_rot increases by 2B. So the energy difference is 2B = 2 * 4.364e11 = 8.728e11 s^-1. But wait, energy is in Joules, so we need to convert B from s^-1 to energy. Since E = ħ B, because E_rot = ħ B J (J+1). No, wait, E_rot = h c B J (J+1). Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, the energy levels for a rigid rotor are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1, but that's when using wavenumbers. But in terms of actual energy, perhaps I should think in terms of ħ. Because the quantum mechanical expression for energy is E = ħ ω_rot, where ω_rot is the rotational angular frequency.

But I'm getting myself stuck. Let me try a different approach. Let's compute the rotational energy difference from J=0 to J=1.

The rotational energy transition is ΔE_rot = E(J=1) - E(J=0) = B*(1)(2) - B*(0)(1) )= 2B.

But B is ħ/(2 I), so 2B = ħ/(I). Since I = μ R².

So ΔE_rot = ħ/(μ R²) * (2 I) ? Not sure. Alternatively, since B is ħ/(2 I), then 2B = ħ/(I). So ΔE_rot = ħ/(I).

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me compute the actual energy value.

We have:

I = μ R² = 3.021e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.021e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2084e-46 kg m².

B = ħ/(2 I) = (1.05457e-34 J s) / (2 * 1.2084e-46 kg m²) ) = approximately 4.364e11 1/s.

So ΔE_rot = 2B = 8.728e11 1/s.

But to get energy in J, since E = ħ ω, where ω is in rad/s, so E_rot = ħ * Ω, where Ω is the angular frequency for rotation.

Wait, perhaps B is Ω/(something). Alternatively, the energy E_rot = (ħ^2 / (2 I)) J (J+1). Because the rotational energy is (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I).

Wait, the formula for the rotational energy levels is E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I), yes. So the difference between J=0 and J=1 is:

ΔE_rot = (ħ² (2)(2)) / (2 I) - 0 = (4 ħ²) / (2 I) = (2 ħ²) / I.

So ΔE_rot = 2 ħ² / (I).

So let me compute that.

I is 1.2084e-46 kg m².

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ΔE_rot = 2 * 1.112e-68 J² s² / 1.2084e-46 kg m².

Wait, let me compute that:

2 * 1.112e-68 = 2.224e-68.

Divide by 1.2084e-46: 2.224e-68 / 1.2084e-46 ≈ 1.844e-22 J.

Wait, that's the energy difference for the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1.

What about the vibrational transition? The vibrational energy difference is ΔE_vib = ħ w.

Given w is 4e14 rad/s.

So ΔE_vib = 1.05457e-34 J s * 4e14 rad/s ≈ 4.218e-20 J.

Now, comparing the two energy differences: 1.844e-22 J (rotational) vs 4.218e-20 J (vibrational). So the rotational transition requires less energy. Therefore, the photon needed would be the one that causes the rotational transition, because it's lower energy.

Wait, but wait a minute—the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is both v=0 and J=0. When you absorb a photon, you can promote to the next higher energy state. The next higher state would be the one with the lowest possible energy, which would be the one with the smallest ΔE. So the rotational transition (ΔE_rot = 1.844e-22 J) is much smaller than the vibrational transition. So the photon should be the one that allows the rotational transition.

But wait, I'm not entirely certain. Because in some cases, the first transition might involve a change in both vibrational and rotational states. But I think that requires higher energy. So the minimal photon energy would be the rotational one.

So the photon's energy is ΔE_rot = 1.844e-22 J.

But wait, the question isn't asking about the energy of the photon but the momentum. Oh right, the question asks for the momentum of the photon. Hmm, so I need to find the momentum associated with the photon that has energy E = 1.844e-22 J.

Wait, photons have energy E = pc, where p is momentum, and c is speed of light. So p = E / c.

So p = 1.844e-22 J / (3e8 m/s) = approximately 6.146e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, this doesn't match any of the given options. The options are on the order of 1e-27 N·s. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake
