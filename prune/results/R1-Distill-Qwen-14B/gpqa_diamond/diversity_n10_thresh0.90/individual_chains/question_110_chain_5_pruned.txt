Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out.

Let me read the question again. It says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, brighter means lower magnitude number, right? So anything with V mag ≤17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so V mag ≤16. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16, because HIRES can't go beyond that. But wait, the question is which stars can be observed by both, so both conditions have to be satisfied. So the apparent V mag must be ≤16 for HIRES and ≤17 for ESPRESSO. The stricter condition is ≤16, so the star's apparent magnitude must be ≤16.

Now I look at the stars. Let's go through each one.

Star1: Absolute magnitude (M) is 15.5. Distance is 10 pc. Oh wait, absolute magnitude is how bright it would appear at 10 pc. So since it's at 10 pc, its apparent magnitude (m) is the same as M. So m=15.5. Both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it because 15.5 is less than 16 and 17. So Star1 is detectable by both.

Star2: Apparent V mag is 16.5. Wait, because the question says HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. Since 16.5 is greater than 16, that's fainter than what HIRES can see. So HIRES can't observe it. ESPRESSO can, because 16.5 ≤17. But since only one of them can see it, Star2 isn't a candidate for both.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5. But wait, there's extinction. E(B-V) is 0.6 mag. The formula for extinction (Av) is Av = 3.1 * E(B-V). So that's 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. So the
