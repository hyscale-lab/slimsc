Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the HI acid-catalyzed cleavage of alkenes, right? So probably, Compound X has a double bond that will undergo some reaction here.

But wait, before that, I need to find out what Compound X is. The question gives IR and NMR data, so I'll have to analyze those.

Starting with the IR data: the peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But since there's no mention of amines, maybe it's an O-H group. The other peaks: 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl group like a ketone or ester or maybe an acid. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are around the range for aromatic C=C stretches. So, Compound X probably has an aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and maybe an O-H group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, likely an O-H proton, like from a phenolic group or a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids typically have around 10-12 ppm. But a phenol is usually a bit lower, around 5 ppm. Hmm, but maybe it's an exchange broadened peak, so could be either. Wait, in the IR, if there's a carbonyl, could it be a carboxylic acid? Because a carboxylic acid would have both O-H (broad) and a carbonyl (around 1700). Let's think.

Wait, the IR has 1720 cm-1, which is a bit higher than a typical carboxylic acid (around 1700). Maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's the conjugated carbonyl in a benzoic acid derivative. But let's look at the NMR.

The 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. The two doublets each integrating to 2H—so perhaps two substituents on the benzene ring, one at para positions. Wait, no, if it's para, you get two sets of doublets, each with 2H. So that fits a para-substituted benzene, like in para-xylene or para-substituted benzene with two substituents.

But wait, the integration is 2H each. Wait, no, maybe it's a single substituent with two protons adjacent? No, probably not. So maybe it's a monosubstituted benzene but with coupling in the NMR. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent that's de-shielded and causing splitting.

Wait, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with substituents causing the two doublets. For example, in a para-disubstituted benzene, each set of protons is a pair, leading to two doublets. So that fits, like if you have a substituent at para position, and the protons are split into two doublets due to coupling with adjacent protons.

So the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene, maybe with another group attached that's causing the chemical shifts. The substituents could be something like a methyl group or an ethyl group.

Looking at the other NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating to 1H. That could be a CH group adjacent to something else, maybe near an electronegative atom or part of a branch.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, integrating to 2H. Maybe a -CH2- group next to something, like a branching point or near an oxygen.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet or doublet of 3H, which is likely a methyl group attached to something like a CH2 or a branching point. The 'd' indicates a doublet, so maybe it's attached to a CH with neighboring protons.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, integrating to 3H. This is probably a terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl or longer chain.

Putting this together: The aromatic ring is para-substituted. There's a substituent that includes a chain with a methyl group at the end (the 0.9 ppm triplet). The 1.4 ppm doublet suggests a methyl attached to a CH, perhaps a branching point. The 2.9 ppm multiplet could be that CH group.

So maybe the substituent is a group like CH2CH(CH2CH3) or something similar.

Wait, let me think about the structure. The NMR signals suggest a chain attached to the benzene. Let's see:

The 1.7 ppm (2H, m) could be adjacent to the benzene, perhaps a CH2 group. The 2.9 ppm (1H, m) could be a CH between two CH2 groups or part of a branching.

Wait, maybe an ethyl group attached to a CH, which is attached to the benzene. For example, if the substituent is a propyl group, but with branching.

Wait, the substituent could be a group like -CH2CH(CH2CH3)2? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent like -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but I'm not quite getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group connected to a CH(CH3)2 or something like that. Hmm.

Wait, considering the splitting, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which is attached to a CH group. So perhaps the structure is something like CH2-CH(CH3)-something. The 2.9 ppm is the CH, and the 1.7 is the adjacent CH2.

Let me try to draw it out. The benzene ring has a substituent which is a longer chain. The chain could be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- or similar.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branching. Let's see:

The substituent could be a butyl group, but with branching. For example, a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So that would be a sec-butyl group.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Let me see: in that case, the central CH would be attached to two CH2 groups. The NMR of the central CH (2.9 ppm, m) would be a multiplet because it's next to two CH2 groups. The CH2 next to the benzene would be at around 1.7 ppm, and the next CH2 would be at 0.9 ppm as a triplet? Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the structure. For a sec-butyl group, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So the CH2 next to the benzene would be a -CH2- group, which would have two protons. The CH in the middle would have two CH2 groups attached. The terminal CH2CH3 would be at the end.

So, in terms of NMR:

The CH2 next to the benzene (let's say position 1) would have protons that are split into a triplet if next to another CH2. Wait, but in the NMR data, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H. So maybe that's the CH2 connected to the benzene, and the next group is a CH (2.9 ppm, m, 1H). Then, the CH is connected to another CH2 (which would be the 1.4 ppm, d, 3H). Wait, 1.4 ppm is a doublet of 3H. That would suggest that the CH is connected to a CH3 group. Wait, no, a CH2-CH(CH3)- group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-2. So, the benzene is attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH that has two CH2 groups: one leading to another CH2CH3 and another leading back to the CH2 connected to the benzene. Hmm, that's getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. An isobutyl group would have a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3)2. Wait, no, an isobutyl group is (CH2)2CHCH2-? No, wait. Isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: the isobutyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)2. So, the structure is CH2- attached to a CH that's attached to two methyl groups.

Wait, but in that case, the CH would have two methyl groups attached, which would make it a tertiary carbon. The NMR would show the CH as a multiplet, and the adjacent CH2 as another multiplet.

Looking back at the NMR:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) → maybe a CH with two substituents, each with their own protons. But a tertiary CH would typically be a singlet or a multiplet depending on coupling. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the substituent could be a propyl group attached to a methyl group. So, perhaps it's an ethyl group attached via a CH, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. Let me think about the substituents on the benzene. If the substituent is a (CH2)2CHCH3 group, but that might not quite fit the NMR.

Wait, another approach. The IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a carbonyl. So, Compound X has a carbonyl group. So, perhaps it's an ester, ketone, or acid. But wait, the NMR at 10.5 ppm: if it's an acid, that's a broad peak. If it's an ester, there's no O-H, so that peak would be from something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a phenol.

Wait, but the 10.5 ppm is a singlet, but if it's a phenol, the aromatic protons would be more around 6.5-7.5 ppm. But in the NMR, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. That suggests that the substituent is electron-withdrawing, as the aromatic protons are deshielded. For example, a nitro group would cause the aromatic protons to shift downfield, but in this case, they're around 7.2-8 ppm, which is a bit lower than nitro but maybe due to another substituent, like a carbonyl.

Wait, if the substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an acid, then the aromatic protons would be more deshielded. So, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to the benzene ring.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group and a chain. From the NMR, the substituent chain has a CH, a CH2, a CH3, and a terminal CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a benzophenone derivative. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzaldehyde or something else. But then, the chain would have to be connected to the carbonyl.

Wait, another angle: the IR has 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. Let's think about possible functional groups. If it's a ketone, the carbonyl is usually around 1700-1750. An ester is similar. A carboxylic acid is around 1700 but can be lower. However, the O-H in the IR is 3400-2500, which is broad. So, if it's a carboxylic acid, that would explain the O-H. But the 10.5 ppm NMR is a singlet, which could be a carboxylic acid's O-H, but that's a bit high. Alternatively, it could be a phenol, but phenols usually have O-H around 5-7 ppm.

Wait, maybe the compound isn't a simple acid or phenol. Let me think of another possibility. What about an acyloxy group? No, that's an ester. Or maybe a conjugated ester, like an aromatic ester.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzoyl group attached with a chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a benzoyl group attached via a chain? But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me go back to the NMR. The aromatic region is two doublets, 8.0 and 7.2, each 2H. So, substituents are in the para position. So the substituent on the benzene is in the para position. So, the substituent is a group that's causing the ring to have two sets of doublets. So, it's a para-substituted benzene.

Wait, another thought: this could be a benzene ring where one substituent is a carbonyl group, and another substituent is a chain group. But in that case, the aromatic protons would be more downfield. Alternatively, the substituent itself could be a carbonyl-containing group, like a ketone or aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to the ring. For example, a benzophenone-like structure. But the NMR also shows a chain, so perhaps it's a substituent like a CH2COCH3 group.

Wait, no, maybe it's something else. Let's think about the substituent. The substituent's chain has a CH (2.9 ppm, m, 1H), a CH2 (1.7, m, 2H), a CH3 (1.4, d, 3H), and a terminal CH2CH3 (0.9, t, 3H). So, the chain is probably like -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3. Hmm, no, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-... Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the ring. Then, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So, the substituent is a propyl group with a branching.

In that case, the protons would be as follows:

The CH2 adjacent to the ring (let's say position 1) would have two protons. These would be next to a CH (position 2), which has a branching to a CH2CH3 (position 3). 

So, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 (position 1) as a triplet or some multiplet. In the data, 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H, which could be this CH2.

- The CH (position 2) would have a neighboring CH2 and a branching to CH2CH3. So, the CH would be split into a multiplet. In the data, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) matches this.

- The CH2 (position 3) attached to the CH would be split by the CH and the terminal CH2CH3. The position 3 CH2 would be at 1.4 ppm as a doublet. Wait, but 1.4 is a doublet (d) of 3H. Hmm, that doesn't fit a CH2 (should be 2H). So perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a longer chain. Let me think in terms of the substituent being a (CH2)2CHCH2CH3 group, but that seems like a pentyl group. Wait, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet, which usually comes from a CH2CH2CH3 group. So that's a terminal CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. So, the substituent is a CH2CH2CH2CH3 group attached to the benzene. But then, the NMR would have a triplet for the CH2CH2CH3, but in the data, the triplet is at 0.9 ppm, which is correct for a terminal CH3. The adjacent CH2 (to the CH2CH3) would be a quartet around 1.6 ppm, but in the data, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H. Hmm, but that would be a quartet, not a multiplet. So that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). So, the structure is benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). Let's see:

- The CH2 attached to the ring (position 1) has two protons. The next CH (position 2) has two substituents: one CH2CH3 and one CH2 (from the ring). So, the CH (position 2) would have two adjacent groups, each with two protons. So, the CH would be a triplet or a more complex multiplet.

In the NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet of 1H, which could be this CH.

The CH2 (position 1) would be next to the CH, so it would be a triplet. But in the data, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H, which could fit a triplet or more. Alternatively, maybe the CH2 is split into a more complex pattern.

The CH2CH3 (position 3) would be a triplet, but in the data, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet of 3H, which fits the CH2CH3.

So, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, then the benzene would be attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH that has two CH2 groups (one leading to the benzene, the other leading to CH2CH3). Wait, no, a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's only two carbons beyond the benzene. So, the substituent would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

Wait, but the substituent is on the benzene ring, so the structure is:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)

So, let's see the NMR signals:

- The aromatic protons are at 8.0 (d) and 7.2 (d), as expected for a para-substituted benzene. But wait, no, in this structure, the substituent is only on one position, so it's a monosubstituted benzene. But the NMR shows two doublets, which could be from a para-substituted ring with substituents in positions 4 and something else. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is at position 4, and there's another group. But the aromatic data shows integration of 4 protons (2H each). That suggests two substituents on the benzene ring, each in the para positions. But the IR and NMR data don't support that yet. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group that causes the aromatic protons to split into two doublets.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group with two substituents in the para positions, but that's complicating things. Let me think again.

Wait, if the substituent is a group like -COOR, which is an ester, then the aromatic protons would be deshielded. But I don't see an ester in the NMR data. The 10.5 ppm could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But then, the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl at 1720, because an aldehyde's carbonyl is around 1720. Wait, that's possible.

Wait, if the substituent is a benzaldehyde group, then the aldehyde proton would be around 9.8-10.5 ppm as a singlet. In the NMR, that's exactly what's observed at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H). So maybe it's a benzaldehyde derivative.

So, the structure would be benzene with a substituent that's an aldehyde group, plus a chain.

Wait, but then the chain would have to be attached to the aldehyde. But that seems a bit unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ketone group, but that wouldn't have an O-H.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a phenyl ketone. Wait, but I'm not making progress here.

Let me think again about the reaction. The problem states that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. As per my earlier thought, this is an acid-catalyzed cleavage of a double bond, which typically breaks alkenes into diols or other products depending on conditions
