Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without any spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question deals with the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. When the star doesn't have spots, this ratio is observed to decrease when the star does have spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes—specifically, the factor when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots. 

So, the transition between these two levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Ångströms. The problem also mentions that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which is a common assumption in stellar spectroscopy.

I need to find the ratio N1/N2 (where N1 is the number of atoms in level 1 and N2 in level 2) under both scenarios: no spots and with spots. Then, find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So, the factor is (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_spots.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So the ratio when no spots is higher than when spots are present. So the factor would be (no spots ratio) divided by (spots ratio). That would be a number greater than 1, which is one of the options, I think.

In LTE, the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is:

N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k*T) )

Where:
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of levels 2 and 1, respectively.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels.
- k is Boltzmann's constant.
- T is the temperature.

But wait, the ratio in the question is N1/N2, so that would be the inverse of N2/N1. So the ratio N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Alternatively, since E2 > E1, the exponent is positive, and the ratio would decrease as T decreases because exp( positive number ) gets smaller when T decreases.

So, when the star has spots, the overall Teff drops from 6000 K to 5500 K. But wait, wait. Wait a second—does the spot coverage directly affect the temperature of the photosphere, or is the star's photosphere the same except where the spots are? Hmm, the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff decreases. So the average Teff of the whole photosphere is lower.

But for the purposes of this problem, we're considering the photosphere as a blackbody radiator. So the observed Teff is the effective temperature of the star as a whole. But when the question talks about the photosphere, it's probably referring to the unspotted regions because spots are cooler and might not emit much, but the rest of the surface is at 6000 K. Wait no, the problem says when the spots are present, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the entire photosphere (including spots) is at 5500 K on average. Or wait, no. Maybe the spots are cooler regions, and the rest is at 6000 K. So the star emits as a combination of 60% of its surface at 6000 K and 40% at a lower temperature. But then, the Teff would be a weighted average based on the areas. So I think the star's overall Teff is a combination of the unspotted and spotted regions.

Wait, but the question says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. Hmm, perhaps the photosphere is considered as being at 5500 K. So the effective temperature of the star as a whole is 5500 K. But wait, the spots themselves would have a lower Teff than the surrounding photosphere. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that when the spots are present, the effective temperature of the entire star (as observed) drops to 5500 K. So the overall photosphere's average T is
