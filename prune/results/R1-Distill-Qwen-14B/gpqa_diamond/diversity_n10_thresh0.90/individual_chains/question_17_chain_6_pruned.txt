Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think about it. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions when they're in a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about other factors affecting EDTA's form.

Wait, what do I remember about EDTA and complex ions? EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like Ca²+ and forms a complex. The formation constant, Kf, is a measure of the stability of the complex. A higher Kf means a more stable complex.

The problem gives K_Ca-EDTA as 5e10. Oh wait, I think Kf is often given for the formation of the complex from the ions. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. But wait, EDTA has multiple protons, so its form depends on the pH. Oh, but the problem says the pH is ideal, so I don’t need to consider the different species. Maybe in this case, the EDTA is fully deprotonated as Y^4-.

So, the formation constant K for the complex is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Right.

But wait, in this problem, the solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex at 0.02 M. So the concentration of the complex, [CaEDTA^2-], is 0.02 M. We need to find [Ca²+], the concentration of free calcium ions.

We can rearrange the K expression to solve for [Ca²+]. So K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the concentration of EDTA. Hmm. Oh wait, because the complex is formed 1:1 between Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, the total concentration of EDTA comes from the complex and any free EDTA. But if the solution is stochiometric, does that mean that the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA were just right to form the complex without excess? Or perhaps, the solution is such that the EDTA is all tied up in the complex
