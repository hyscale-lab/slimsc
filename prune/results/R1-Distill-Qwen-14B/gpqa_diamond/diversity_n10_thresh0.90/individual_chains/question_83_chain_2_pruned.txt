Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's see what the question says.

We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A to D, each with two pH values.

Hmm, okay, so first, I think I need to figure out the concentrations after dilution. Then, for the titration, I need to find out what happens at 25% and at equivalence.

Let me start by calculating the initial concentration after mixing. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The amount of acetic acid remains the same since we're only adding water.

The moles of acetic acid before dilution: Molarity is moles per liter. So 0.05 M is 0.05 mol/L. The volume is 20 cm³, which is 0.02 liters. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

After dilution to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the new concentration is moles / volume. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, what's the equivalence point?

At equivalence, moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So moles of acetic acid is 0.001, as calculated earlier. Moles of NaOH needed is also 0.001. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume = moles / M = 0.001 /0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake. The acetic acid after dilution is 0.025 M in 40 cm³. So when titrating, the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence is 10 cm³.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The initial solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. So moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume V = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 mL. So yes, 10 cm³.

So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Now, the first part is the pH at 25% titration. 25% of what? 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Wait, no, wait. No, that's not correct. Wait, 25% of the equivalence point volume is correct, but let me think again. Alternatively, sometimes the 25% refers to the amount of acid neutralized. So wait, moles of NaOH added is 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since the acetic acid is 0.001 moles, 0.00025 is 25% of it. So yes, at 25% of the equivalence point.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to approach it as the solution before any NaOH is added, then after adding 25% of the required NaOH.

Wait, the initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid. Then, when we add some NaOH, we're converting some of the acetic acid into acetate ions.

So, for the 25% titration point:

At 25% of the equivalence point, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the moles of NaOH added is 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 moles.

Since acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacts with NaOH (which gives Na+ and OH-) as CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, after adding NaOH, some of the CH3COOH is converted to CH3COO^-.

So moles of CH3COOH initially: 0.001 moles. Moles of NaOH added: 0.00025. So moles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075. Moles of CH3COO^- produced: 0.00025.

The total volume is the initial 40 cm³ plus the NaOH added. So 40 cm³ is 0.04 L, and 2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 L. So total volume is 0.0425 L.

So concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.0058824 M.

Now, since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa is -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that.

Log(1.85) is approx 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log( (0.0058824)/(0.017647) )

Calculate the ratio: 0.0058824 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is approx -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.

Looking at the options, option D has 4.57 and 6.92; option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So 4.26 is close to 4.256, so maybe option A.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations for the ratio.

Wait, [A^-] is 0.00025 moles in 0.0425 L: 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.0058824 M.

[HA] is 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

The ratio is 0.0058824 / 0.017647
