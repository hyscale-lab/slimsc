Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again and break it down.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature (Teff) is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler, I think. When the star rotates, these spots come into view, causing brightness variations. The question says this situation could mimic an exoplanet's effect on the star's light curve. But if the star wasn't spotted, what size exoplanet would produce the same brightness variation?

Hmm. So I need to find the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star's radius (Rpl/Rstar) that would cause the same amplitude in the light curve.

First, I remember that the brightness change when a planet transits a star is given by the formula (Rp/Rstar)^2. Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio.

But wait, this scenario is about spots on the star, not a planet transiting. So the brightness variation due to spots would be a bit different. Let me think about how star spots affect the light curve.

Star spots are cooler regions. So when they rotate into view, the star's observed brightness decreases. The amplitude of this dip depends on the area of the spots and how much cooler they are compared to the rest of the star.

The problem gives a filling factor of 20%. Filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots, right? So F = 0.2 (20%) of the star's surface is spots.

Each spot has a temperature difference of 1000K. So the spots are at 6000K - 1000K = 5000K.

But wait, the effective temperature of the star is 6000K. So the flux from the spots is lower. The total flux from the star without spots would be based on the star's Teff, but when spots are present, part of it is dimmer.

So the total flux from the star when spots are visible is F_total = (1 - F) * L_star + F * L_spot.

Where L_star is the star's luminosity without spots, and L_spot is the luminosity of the spotted regions.

Wait, but the star's total luminosity is based on its surface area and temperature. L = 4πR²σTeff^4.

The spots have a lower temperature, so their luminosity per unit area is less. So each spot emits less.

So the flux from the spotted areas is (R_spot / R_star)^2 * (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) per unit area. But wait, maybe I should think in terms of the entire star.

Wait, the filling factor F is 0.2, so the area of the spots is F * 4πR².

But we can model the star's flux as normal (without spots) times (1 - (F * (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ))).

Wait, no. Because each spot emits less flux. So the total flux when spots are
