Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Hmm, I remember that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs used for things like radial velocity measurements. But the key here is figuring out which stars meet the brightness criteria for both observatories.

Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, and HIRES can go down to 16. So any star that's brighter than 17 (lower magnitude numbers are brighter) can be seen by ESPRESSO, but for HIRES, the stars need to be brighter than 16. So the stars need to have apparent V magnitudes ≤16 for HIRES and ≤17 for ESPRESSO. Wait, no, wait, no—because the instruments can observe stars brighter than those magnitudes. So if a star is brighter than 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, for HIRES, if a star is brighter than 16. So the star's apparent magnitude needs to be less than or equal to 16 to be detected by HIRES, and less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO. So the stars that can be detected by both would need to have apparent V magnitudes ≤16 because 16 is the stricter condition.

Wait, no, wait. The question says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 can be observed. So if a star is V=17, it's at the limit. Wait, magnitudes are a bit counterintuitive. So lower magnitude means brighter. So a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17. So, for a star to be detectable by HIRES, its apparent magnitude must be ≤16. For ESPRESSO, it's ≤17. So the overlapping condition is that the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16, because that's the brighter limit for HIRES. So a star that is 16 or brighter would be detectable by both.

But wait, looking at the stars, some of them have absolute magnitudes and distances, so I need to calculate their apparent magnitudes. Others have given apparent magnitudes directly. Let's go through each star.

Star1: RA 15, DEC -75, absolute mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. So apparent magnitude can be calculated using the distance modulus. The formula is m = M + 5 log10(d/10). So d is 10 pc, so log(10/10)=0, so m=15.5. So apparent magnitude is 15.5. That's brighter than 16, so it's detectable by HIRES (since 15.5 ≤16) and by ESPRESSO (15.5 ≤17). So Star1 can be detected by both.

Star2: RA 30, DEC 55, apparent V mag 16.5, distance 5 pc. Wait, but if it's already given the apparent magnitude as 16.5, then that's what we use. So 16.5 is larger than 16, which is the limit for
