Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's read through it again. Alright, we've got an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so maybe we don't have to worry about mass in any calculations here.

So, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. Oh, and the 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, and the options are given.

Wait, energy in an electrostatic system usually refers to the electric potential energy. Right, because when you have charged particles, their configuration leads to potential energy. So I think I need to calculate the potential energy of this setup.

Let me think: in a system of charges, the electric potential energy is the work done to assemble them. Since we're dealing with identical charges, each one would contribute to the potential energy of the others.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed at point P. So the 12 charges are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of those 12 charges is 2 meters away from the 13th charge. But what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves?

Wait, the 12 charges are each 2 meters from P, but are they interacting with each other? If they are all at the same distance from P, but not fixed relative to each other, do they form a spherical shell or something? Or are they each at a fixed position 2m from P, but not necessarily all the same distance from each other?

Hmm, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from point P. So they're all located on a sphere of radius 2m around P. But their exact positions relative to each other might vary. But perhaps, for the minimal energy, they arrange themselves in a way that minimizes the potential energy.

Wait, but in a system of identical charges, the potential energy is the sum of the potential energies between each pair. So to find the total potential energy, I need to sum all the pairwise interactions.

Wait, but which charges are we considering? The 12 charges are each at 2m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So
