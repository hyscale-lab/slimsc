Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator. Let me try to think through this step by step. 

First, the problem is about a muon, but I think the particle type doesn't matter here—it's more about the operator. The operator in question is P, which has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. The problem states that P acts along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So, the direction is in the x-z plane, which means the angle theta is probably measured from the z-axis, and there's no y-component in the direction, right? Because if it's in the x-z plane, the direction vector would be something like (sinθ, 0, cosθ), I think.

The goal is to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Wait, no, wait. The operator is P, and the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So I need to find the eigenvector |ψ> such that P|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>.

Wait, but P is a vector operator, so it's along the direction n. So the operator we're considering is P · n, right? Because the operator in the direction of n would be the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding direction cosine.

So, the operator is P·n. Let me write that down. So n is in the x-z plane, so it must be something like (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So P·n would be P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, P is a vector operator. Each P component is an operator. So P·n would be sum over i of n_i P_i. Since n is in x-z, the y-component of n is zero, so P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. But wait, n is a unit vector, so n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ, and n_y is zero.

So the operator we're interested in is P·n = sinθ P_x + cosθ P_z.

Now, I need to find the eigenvector of this operator corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The eigenvector should be normalized.

But wait, I have the matrices for each component. Let me write them down:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So that's the Pauli X matrix times ħ/2.

Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix scaled by ħ/2.

P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]], which is the Pauli Z matrix scaled by ħ/2.

So each of these is a 2x2 matrix, and each is (ħ/2) multiplied by the respective Pauli matrix.

So, the operator P·n is equal to (ħ/2) [ sinθ (X) + cosθ (Z) ].

Wait, no, because P_x is (ħ/2) X, so sinθ P_x is (ħ/2) sinθ X. Similarly, cosθ P_z is (ħ/2) cosθ Z. So when we add them, it's (ħ/2) (sinθ X + cosθ Z).

So the operator becomes:

(ħ/2) [ sinθ X + cosθ Z ]

But X is [[0,1],[1,0]], and Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So let's compute sinθ X + cosθ Z.

So, sinθ X is:
[[0, sinθ],
 [sinθ, 0]]

cosθ Z is:
[[cosθ, 0],
 [0, -cosθ]]

Adding them together:

[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Then, the operator P·n is (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix.

So, the matrix we're working with is (ħ/2) times [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]].

We need to find the eigenvector of this matrix with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So the equation is:

( P·n ) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

So, substituting the matrix, we have:

(ħ/2) [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Wait, but since (ħ/2) is a scalar factor, we can multiply both sides by 2/ħ, giving:

[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]] * [a; b] = [a; b]

So now the problem reduces to solving the eigenvalue equation for the matrix M = [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]], where the eigenvalue is 1 (since we're looking for eigenvalues of 1 when scaled by 2/ħ).

So, the equation is M |v> = 1 * |v>, where |v> is [a; b].

Let me write out the equations.

Equation 1: cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a

Equation 2: sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

So, let's rearrange these equations.

From equation 1: (cosθ - 1)a + sinθ b = 0

From equation 2: sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Hmm, I have two equations to solve. Let me write them as:

( cosθ - 1 ) a + sinθ b = 0 --> equation (1)

sinθ a + ( -cosθ - 1 ) b = 0 --> equation (2)

Now, for non-trivial solutions (a and b not both zero), the determinant of the coefficients must be zero. But wait, since both equations are for the same eigenvector, we can solve the equations.

Alternatively, because it's a 2x2 matrix, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors directly.

Wait, but I know that the eigenvalues of M should be ±1, because the original operator (P·n) has eigenvalues ±ħ/2, and the equation
