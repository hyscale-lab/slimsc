Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this quantum mechanics question about matrices and their properties. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question presents four matrices: W, X, Y, and Z. Each is a 3x3 matrix. The options A to D make statements about these matrices, and I need to figure out which statement is correct.

First, I'll list out what each option is saying.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.
Hmm. So it's about the matrix exponential of X. I remember that for a matrix to preserve the norm (i.e., be unitary), e^X must also be unitary if X is skew-Hermitian. Wait, but what's the condition for X? Oh right, a matrix exponential e^A is unitary if A is skew-Hermitian. So I need to check if X is skew-Hermitian.

Skew-Hermitian matrices satisfy X† = -X, where † is the conjugate transpose. Let's look at matrix X.

X is:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

Let me compute X†. The conjugate transpose would swap rows and columns, and take the complex conjugate of each element.

Original X:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So X† would be:

Column 1 becomes row 1: [i, 1, -2i]
Column 2 becomes row 2: [-1,0,-1]
Column 3 becomes row 3: [-2i, 1, i]

Wait, let me write it out:

X† is:

i   1      -2i
-1  0      -1
2i  1      i

Wait, wait, no. Let me be precise. Each element (i,j) in X is complex, and X†(j,i) is the conjugate of X(i,j).

So X's first row is [i, -1, 2i]. So the first column of X† is [i*, 1*, 2i*] which is [-i, 1, -2i] because the conjugate of i is -i, 1's conjugate is 1, and 2i's conjugate is -2i.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the first row of X is row 1, so the first column of X† is the first row of X's conjugate.

Wait, let me do it step by step.

X is:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So X† is the conjugate transpose, so columns become rows, and each element's conjugate.

So:

Element (1,1) of X is i → (1,1) of X† is i* = -i.

(1,2) of X is -1 → (2,1) of X† is (-1)* = -1.

(1,3) of X is 2i → (3,1) of X† is 2i^* = -2i.

Second row of X:

(2,1)=1 → (1,2) of X† is 1* =1.

(2,2)=0 → (2,2) of X†= 0.

(2,3)=1 → (3,2) of X†=1.

Third row of X:

(3,1)=2i → (1,3) of X†= (2i)* = -2i.

(3,2)=-1 → (2,3) of X†= (-1)* =-1.

(3,3)=-i → (3,3) of X†= (-i)* =i.

So putting it all together, X† is:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Now, if X is skew-Hermitian, then X† should equal -X.

Let's compute -X. X is:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So -X is:

Row 1
