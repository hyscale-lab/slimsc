Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question carefully.

The first part says butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second part involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to produce 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. And I have four options to choose from for A and B.

Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's often a nucleophilic addition. So butan-2-one is a ketone with the structure (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, I think it's undergoing a substitution or addition reaction. Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- ions. For ketones, the typical reaction would be a nucleophilic addition, where the CN- adds to the carbonyl carbon. But then what's the role of reagent A?

Wait, in nucleophilic additions to ketones, the initial product is a cyanohydrin. The cyanohydrin formation, which involves the addition of a nitrile group and a hydroxyl group across the carbonyl. So the product would have both groups attached to the same carbon. But the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would form (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Let's count the carbons. Butan-2-one has four carbons with the ketone on C2. The product has hydroxyl and nitrile both on C2, so the structure would be CH2(C(OH)CN)CH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When you add HCN, you get (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the product would have the CN and OH groups on the same carbon, which is the former carbonyl carbon. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, but butanenitrile would have four carbons, right? So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or am I getting that wrong.

Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Upon addition of HCN, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. That would give 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, I think. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the numbering.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagent isn't HCN but NaCN. Wait, but in the presence of acid, maybe? Or another reagent. Oh wait, sometimes the addition of
