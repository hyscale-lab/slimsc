Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about molecular symmetry, specifically about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that C3h is a point group in molecular symmetry. C3h has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Oh right, so it's a combination of a rotation and a reflection.

The options are four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, a benzo-fused trifuran hexaone, and another triphenyleno-fused trifuran hexaone.

Let me think about each option. 

First, triisopropyl borate. I think its structure is like a boron atom with three isopropyl groups attached. Each isopropyl group has two methyl groups on a central carbon. So the molecule is symmetric because all three substituents are the same. Wait, the point group for a trigonal planar molecule with identical groups would be D3h. But wait, if all three substituents are the same and arranged symmetrically, the molecule should have a three-fold rotation axis. But what about the mirror planes? If there are mirror planes perpendicular to the rotation axis, then it would have D3h symmetry. But if there's a horizontal mirror plane, maybe it's C3h. Wait, no, I think triisopropyl borate is trigonal planar but not necessarily with a horizontal mirror. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, I think it's more likely to have D3h symmetry, but I'm not entirely sure.

Next, quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound, I think it's a norbornane-like structure but with an amine. Its structure has a bridge, so it's a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane derivative. I remember that quinuclidine has a plane of symmetry. Wait, does it have a three-fold axis? Let me visualize it. The molecule has a bridge that connects two carbons, and there's a central nitrogen. Oh, I think quinuclidine has a three-fold rotation axis because the bridge allows for 120-degree rotation. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If it's a rigid structure, maybe. Alternatively, I'm not certain about the mirror plane. I think quinuclidine might have C3v symmetry, but I'm not really sure.

Then there are the two complex fused furan systems. Let me consider the third option: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. So, this is a benzo ring fused to a trifuran system. Trifuran is three furan rings connected in a row, perhaps. The benzo is fused in specific positions. Ok, but what's the symmetry here? If the molecule has a three-fold axis, perhaps. Alternatively, since it's a fused ring system, maybe it's more complex.

The fourth option is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. So this is similar but with triphenylene groups attached. Triphenylene is a tricyclic aromatic system. So if the trifuran is connected to triphenylene, would that create a molecule with a three-fold axis? Hmm, maybe if the substituents are arranged symmetrically.

Wait, what's C3h symmetry again? C3h has a three-fold rotation (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So the molecule must have a three-fold axis perpendicular to a mirror plane that bisects the molecule.

Let me think about each molecule.

Triisopropyl borate: Boron with three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is same. So a trigonal planar molecule. Wait, trigonal planar is typically D3h symmetry because there's a C3 axis and three mirror planes. Oh, but if it's D3h, then it would have more symmetry than C3h. So triisopropyl borate probably doesn't have C3h symmetry, but maybe D3h.

Quinuclidine: I'm recalling that quinuclidine has a three-fold axis. The structure is like a crown, so rotating the molecule 120 degrees would map onto itself. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? I'm not sure. If it does, then it would fit C3h. Alternatively, maybe it's C3v symmetry, but I'm not certain.

The two fused furan systems: Let's look at the third option first. Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran hexaone. So it's a benzo ring fused to a trifuran. How is it connected? The way it's written, the benzo is fused to positions 1 and 2 of one furan, 3 and 4 of another, and 5 and 6 of the third. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. But if each of the three furans has a benzo ring attached, maybe it's symmetric. Or perhaps the benzo is attached in a way that creates a three-fold symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the entire structure has a three-fold axis.

Wait, the fourth option is triphenyleno... So triphenylene is a tricyclic system, right? So if the trifuran is connected to triphenylene, maybe the molecule has a three-fold symmetry because the triphenylene groups are arranged around the trifuran. So each triphenylene is attached in such a way that a 120-degree rotation would leave the molecule unchanged. Additionally, a horizontal mirror plane would reflect across the molecule. So if all substituents are symmetric and arranged in a triangular fashion, it might have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, let's think about the structures.

Option A) triphenyleno[...]trifuran: So three triphenylene groups attached to trifuran? Or wait, the substituents are triphenylene parts. Maybe the trifuran has three substituents that are each a part of a triphenylene system. If those substituents are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule would have a three-fold axis. Plus, if there's a mirror plane cutting through the molecule, that would make it C3h.

Option B) benzo-fused trifuran: If each of the three rings has a benzo attached, perhaps it's symmetric. But I'm not sure if the arrangement would allow a three-fold axis.

Wait, the question is which has C3h symmetry. So, the correct molecule must have a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Let me think about quinuclidine. Quinuclidine's structure is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane with an NH group. The structure looks like a bridge with three substituents. Wait, no, actually, quinuclidine has a bridge, making it a rigid structure. The molecule has a three-fold axis because when you rotate it 120 degrees, it looks the same. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? I'm trying to visualize. If you imagine looking down the C3 axis (the bridge), is there a mirror plane that cuts through the molecule? I think quinuclidine has C3v symmetry, which includes a three-fold axis and vertical mirror planes, but not a horizontal one. So C3v wouldn't be C3h, which requires a horizontal mirror.

So quinuclidine is probably not the correct answer.

Now, the two compounds with trifuran and triphenylene parts. Let me think about their structures.

Option A is triphenylene attached to trifuran in positions 1,2; 5,6; and 9,10. Hmm, perhaps each of the three positions is a substituent, making them symmetric around a central point. So if the molecule has a three-fold axis perpendicular to the plane, and a horizontal mirror plane cutting through, then it would have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, option B is benzo attached. Benzo is a benzene ring, which is symmetric but maybe doesn't add the same symmetry as the triphenylene.

Wait, triphenylene is a symmetric structure itself. Triphenylene is a tricyclic system with three benzene rings connected in a triangular arrangement. So attaching it to a trifuran might create a more symmetric molecule.

So, for the fourth option, triphenyleno[...]trifuran. The trifuran is connected to three triphenylene groups. If these are arranged symmetrically at 120-degree intervals around the trifuran, that would create a three-fold axis. Additionally, if the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane (like a plane that includes the center of the trifuran and is perpendicular to the three-fold axis), then the molecule would have C3h symmetry.

So which of the options A or B has that?

Option A is triphenyleno, so perhaps it's the correct one.

Wait, but what about the other options. The third option (option B) is benzo-based. Benzo doesn't have the same symmetric structure as triphenylene, so the symmetry might not be as high.

So putting it all together: the correct molecule is the triphenyleno-fused trifuran (option A), which has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, giving it C3h symmetry.

Wait, but looking at the options, the question lists each as A, B, C, D. The question says: "which of the following molecules has C3h symmetry?" The options are:

A) triphenyleno[...]trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
B) benzo[...]trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

So if I'm correct, the answer is option A.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the symmetry properties of each option. **C₃h** symmetry consists of a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). The molecule must appear identical after a 120° rotation and must be symmetric with respect to a horizontal plane.

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Triisopropyl Borate**  
   This molecule has a trigonal planar geometry with three identical isopropyl groups attached to a central boron atom. While it has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃), it does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Instead, it belongs to the **D₃h** point group, which includes additional vertical mirror planes. Therefore, it does not have **C₃h** symmetry.

2. **Quinuclidine**  
   Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound with a rigid structure and a three-fold rotation axis (C₃). However, it does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Instead, it has vertical mirror planes, which place it in the **C₃v** point group. Thus, it does not have **C₃h** symmetry.

3. **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**  
   This molecule consists of a benzo ring fused to a trifuran system. While the structure is complex, the benzo substituents are not arranged symmetrically around the trifuran core. As a result, the molecule does not have a three-fold rotation axis or a horizontal mirror plane. It does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

4. **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**  
   This molecule features a trifuran core with three triphenylene groups attached at symmetric positions (1,2; 5,6; 9,10). The triphenylene groups are arranged at 120° intervals around the trifuran, creating a three-fold rotation axis (C₃). Additionally, the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that bisects the trifuran core. This combination of a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane gives it **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion:
The molecule that exhibits **C₃h** symmetry is **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**.

Answer: A
