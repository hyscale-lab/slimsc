Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I'm supposed to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is related to the structure of the crystal lattice. Let's think about what I know.

Rhombohedral crystals have all edges equal and all angles equal, right? So in this case, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Wait, wait, no, the interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, which in a rhombohedral structure is the edge length 'a'. So a is 10 Angstroms here.

The question is about the interplanar distance, which is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal. I recall that the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h^2)(cos^2 α) - (k^2)(cos^2 β) - (l^2)(cos^2 γ) + ... something with the cross terms? No, wait, maybe for a general crystal, the formula is a bit more complicated.

Wait, I think the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is:

d_{hkl} = (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - a^2 (h^2 cos^2 α + k^2 cos^2 β + l^2 cos^2 γ) + 2 a^2 (hk cos α cos β cos γ - hk (1/2)(cos(α - β)) )) )^(1/2) ) / (sqrt( ... )) 

Wait, no, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I remember that for a cubic system, the interplanar distance is a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2). But in this case, it's a rhombohedral system, which is a special case of a hexagonal or something else? No, rhombohedral is a type of cubic system but with all edges equal and angles equal but not 90 degrees. So it's a cubic system with a rhombohedral distortion.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral system. I think the formula is given by:

d = (a^2
