Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, it's about finding the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral crystal. Wait, rhombohedral... I remember that's one of the crystal systems, right. So the structure has all sides equal and all angles equal too, or is it all sides equal but angles can vary? Wait, no, in a rhombohedral structure, the lattice parameters a, b, c are all equal, and the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all the same as well. So yeah, in this problem, they've given alpha, beta, gamma as 30 degrees each.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I think the formula for interplanar distance d is given by something involving the reciprocal of the lattice parameters and the plane indices. Oh right, the formula is d = a/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(hl cos beta) + 2(kl cos alpha) ) )) ? Wait, no, wait. Or is it the other way around? Let me think.

Wait, the interplanar distance formula for a general crystal system is d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2/l^2) + (k^2/m^2) + (l^2/n^2) + ... ) ? No, maybe that's Miller indices. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let's get this straight.

I remember that for a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma, the interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2)/(a^2) + (k^2)/(b^2) + (l^2)/(c^2) + ... some cross terms involving the cosines of the angles and hk, hl, etc. Hmm.

Wait, the formula is:

d^2 = (a^2 * b^2 * c^2) / ( (h b c sin α)^2 + (k a c sin β)^2 + (l a b sin γ)^2 - 2 h k a b c^2 cos(γ - α) + ... something like that. Wait, maybe I should look it up, but since I can't, I have to remember.

Oh wait, I think the formula for interplanar distance in a general crystal is:

d^2 = 1 / [ (h^2/lm^2) + (k^2/mn^2) + (l^2/nl^2) + ... ] No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps it's better to recall the formula from the Miller indices and the metric tensor.

Alternatively, there's a more straightforward formula when the crystal is rhombohedral. Because in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma. So maybe the formula simplifies.

Let me think. For a rhombohedral lattice, since a = b = c = a0 (let's say), and all angles are alpha, which is 30 degrees here.

The general formula for d in a rhombohedral system for plane (hkl) is:

d = a0 / sqrt( h^2 + k^
