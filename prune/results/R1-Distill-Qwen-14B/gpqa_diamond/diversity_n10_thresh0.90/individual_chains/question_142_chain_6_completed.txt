Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the density matrix of a qubit. The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I'm supposed to find its geometrical position in the qubits space from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. For a single qubit, the density matrix is a 2x2 matrix. But how does that translate into geometrical positions?

Wait, I think the Bloch sphere representation might come into play here. The Bloch sphere is a geometric way to represent the state of a qubit. Each point on the unit sphere in 3D space corresponds to a quantum state. The standard basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ are at the poles of the Bloch sphere—|0⟩ is at (0,0,1) and |1⟩ is at (0,0,-1), I think.

But wait, the given density matrix isn't just |0⟩ or |1⟩. It's a mixture of both. So this must be a mixed state, not a pure state. For pure states, the density matrix would be a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. But here, ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) multiplied by 1/2. So each term is a projector, and they sum to something.

Wait, let me compute ρ properly. The density matrix is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me write this out in matrix form. The |0⟩ state is [1, 0]^T, so |0⟩⟨0| is a diagonal matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is the same but with 1 on the (2,2) position. So adding them together gives a 2x2 matrix with both diagonal elements as 1. Then, multiply by 1/2, so the diagonal elements become 1/2 each. So ρ is:

[[0.5, 0],
 [0, 0.5]]

Hmm, right. Now, how does this correspond to a point on the Bloch sphere? I remember that any single qubit state can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space. For a pure state, r would be a unit vector, but for a mixed state, it's scaled down.

Wait, let's express ρ in terms of the Pauli matrices. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So the general form of a density matrix is (I + aσx + bσy + cσz)/2, where a, b, c are real numbers, and the vector (a,b,c) has magnitude ≤1 because the density matrix must be positive semi-definite and trace 1.

So let me rewrite our ρ using this form.

ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) = (1/2)I. Because |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| is the identity matrix I.

So ρ = (I)/2. So in terms of the general formula, this would be (I + 0·σx + 0·σy + 0·σz)/2. So the vector r is (0,0,0).

Wait, but I thought that |0⟩ is (0,0,1) and |1⟩ is (0,0,-1) on the Bloch sphere. So their mixture with equal coefficients (since it's 1/2 each) should be the completely mixed state, which is in the center of the Bloch sphere. Because a completely mixed state has zero 'direction'—it's maximally uncertain, so the Bloch vector is at the origin (0,0,0).

So the geometrical position is the origin, which is option C) r=(0,0,0).

Let me check the options. Option C is (0,0,0), so that should be the correct answer.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This is a mixed state, as it is not a projector (i.e., it is not a pure state). To analyze its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. Any single-qubit state can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (a, b, c)\) is a vector in 3D space. The magnitude of \(\mathbf{r}\) must satisfy \(|\mathbf{r}| \leq 1\) to ensure the density matrix is valid.

For the given \(\rho\), we compute:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right) = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This implies that the coefficients of the Pauli matrices (\(a\), \(b\), and \(c\)) are all zero. Therefore, the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is \((0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is located at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

From the options provided:

- **A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.
- **B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to the pure state \(|0\rangle\).
- **C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\):** Correct, as this corresponds to the completely mixed state.
- **D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is at the origin, \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
