Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of density matrices. But I'll give it a shot.

The question is about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubit space. The matrix provided is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. But wait, what's the geometrical interpretation here?

I think each qubit can be represented in a Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of the state space of a qubit. For a pure state, it's a point on the surface of the sphere. For mixed states, it's inside the sphere. So, the density matrix here must correspond to a mixed state.

Let me compute ρ first. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) multiplied by 1/2. So, |0⟩ is a basis vector, right? Let me write this out in matrix form. The |0⟩⟨0| matrix is a diagonal matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is diagonal with 1 in (2,2). Adding them together gives a diagonal matrix with 1s, but multiplied by 1/2, so each diagonal element is 0.5. So ρ is a 2x2 diagonal matrix with [0.5, 0; 0, 0.5].

Wait, but how does this translate to the Bloch sphere? The Bloch vector r is given by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The density matrix can be expressed as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and I is the identity matrix. So, if I can rewrite ρ in that form, I can find r.

Let me see. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Wait, that's the same as (I)/2, because |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| is the identity matrix. So ρ = (I)/2. Then, using the formula:

ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z) / 2.

Since ρ is (I)/2, that implies that all the terms with σ must be zero. So, r_x = r_y = r_z = 0. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That's the origin, which makes sense because it's a completely mixed state—there's no coherence, and it's equally likely to be in |0⟩ or |1⟩.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which must be the correct answer. Let me just double-check. The density matrix ρ in this case is completely mixed, so it should be at the center of the Bloch sphere. Yep, that fits with r being zero.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. Density matrices can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), it is evident that all components of \(\mathbf{r}\) (i.e., \(r_x\), \(r_y\), and \(r_z\)) must be zero. This corresponds to the Bloch vector being at the origin, \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), which represents a completely mixed state.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\)**  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\)**  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\)**  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\)**  

The correct answer is **C**, as the Bloch vector is at the origin, corresponding to the completely mixed state described by the given density matrix.

Answer: C
