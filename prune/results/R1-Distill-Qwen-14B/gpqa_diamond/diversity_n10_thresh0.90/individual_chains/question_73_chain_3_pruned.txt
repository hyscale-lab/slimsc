Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, special relativity comes into play. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. So, I'm supposed to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. The relative speed isn't just the difference in their speeds, right? Because at such high speeds, you can't just subtract them normally. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)).

So let's plug in the numbers. Here, v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. Subtracting them: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. But wait, the denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7. Let me compute that: 0.1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.1428, so 0.1428c. Which is about 0.14c when rounded. So the relative speed should be around 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c.

Now for the total energy of the system. Total energy in relativity is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me calculate each energy separately.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. So gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) which is approximately 1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² = 1.1547 * 3m c². Let me compute that: 3 * 1.1547 is about 3.4641 mc².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 mc² + 3.4641 mc² ≈ 5.9641 mc². So roughly 5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options:

Option C says v_rel is 0.14c and E is 5.96 mc². Option B says E is 4.96, which is less, so probably not. Option D has E=5 mc², which is a bit lower. So the correct E is about 5.96, which matches option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the velocity addition part. Another way: if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, and we're in the frame where B is moving, what is the speed of
