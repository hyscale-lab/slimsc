Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when a specific part of the fusion process stops. Hmm, let me try to think this through.

Wait, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. But what does that mean for the neutrino flux? Oh right, neutrinos are produced in various parts of the Sun's fusion processes. The pp chain is a major one, especially the proton-proton chain, which has different branches.

So, the pp-III branch... I remember that the pp chain has a few branches. The main one is pp-I, which is the dominant process. pp-II and pp-III are side reactions. Oh right, the pp-III branch produces higher energy neutrinos compared to the main pp-I. Because in pp-III, the fusion involves higher energy processes, maybe something with heavier elements like carbon or oxygen? I'm not exactly sure, but I think the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are higher energy.

Now, the question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, if the pp-III branch stops, how does that affect the number of neutrinos in these bands?

Wait, neutrinos are produced in different energy ranges depending on the process. The main pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos, while pp-III would produce higher-energy ones. Oh, but wait, if pp-III stops, that would decrease the number of high-energy neutrinos, right? But what about the lower-energy ones?

So, the neutrinos from the main pp-I process are in lower energy bands, like 200-400 keV or something. But the pp-III process might produce neutrinos in higher energy ranges, like 800 keV and above. So if pp-III stops, the flux in higher bands (like 800-900 keV) would drop. 

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of the flux between band 1 (700-800) and band 2 (800-900). So, if pp-III stops, which produces more in band 2, then the flux in band 2 would decrease more than band 1. Or wait, does the pp-III contribute to both bands? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the main pp-I process contributes to band 1, and pp-III contributes more to band 2. So without pp-III, the flux in band 2 would drop, but band 1 would stay roughly the same or maybe even drop a bit if it's dependent on pp-I.

Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused about where each neutrino comes from. Let me think. The dominant neutrino production in the Sun is from the proton-proton chain, which has two main branches: pp-I and pp-II. pp-III is a minor part, I think. Oh, but in the pp-III branch, the fusion steps might produce higher-energy neutrinos.

So, if pp-III stops, the high-energy neutrinos (like in band 2) would be less. Let's say that the main source for band 2 is pp-III, and for band 1, it's pp-I and maybe some pp-II. So, if pp-III stops, band 2 flux goes down a lot, while band 1 remains similar. So the ratio flux1/flux2 would increase because flux2 decreased more.

Wait, but what's the typical flux contribution of each branch? I remember that the main pp-I process produces lower-energy neutrinos, and pp-III produces higher. So if the pp-III stops, the high-energy neutrinos (band 2) would be missing. So the flux in band 2 would be lower than band 1.

But in reality, the main source of solar neutrinos is the pp-I process. So, if pp-III stopped, would that significantly affect the high-energy neutrinos? I think pp-III contributes to about 20% of the total neutrino flux, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are in higher energy, so their flux would be a smaller fraction of the total. So if pp-III stops, the high-energy neutrinos (band 2) would drop, but the lower-energy band 1 (which is mostly from pp-I) would remain. So the ratio of band 1 to band 2 would increase.

Wait, but how much do each of these contribute? Let's think in terms of relative fluxes. Suppose band 1 is 700-800 keV, which is lower than band 2's 800-900 keV. If pp-III is the main source of the higher band, then stopping it would reduce band 2's flux more than band 1's.

So if the flux
