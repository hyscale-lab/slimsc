Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about diatomic molecules and their energy states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through step by step.

The question says we have a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. The model used is the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Right, because in the rigid rotor model, the bond length is fixed, but in the non-rigid one, it can change, so it includes vibrational energy as well.

The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I believe is the lowest energy state. The question is about what photon momentum is needed for the molecule to switch to the next possible state with the lowest energy. So, I need to find the photon's momentum that causes this transition.

The given data are the masses of X and Y. Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, I remember that in rotational and vibrational transitions, the energy changes are quantized. For the non-rigid rotor, the energy levels include both rotational and vibrational parts.

But wait, the fundamental state is probably the lowest vibrational state, and for rotation, the lowest quantum number. So, the molecule is in its ground state for both rotation and vibration.

Now, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The next state—so what's the next possible state? Well, the molecule could either increase its rotational quantum number or its vibrational quantum number. But since the question is about the lowest possible energy increase, the photon should cause the smallest possible energy jump.

Wait, but in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. Vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w, where v is the vibrational quantum number. But in the non-rigid model, the bond length changes, so maybe the rotational energy also depends on vibration? Or perhaps it's treated as a combination of rotation and vibration.

Wait, maybe the non-rigid rotor model is actually the same as considering both rotation and vibration together, so the energy levels are a combination. But I'm a bit confused about the exact treatment here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. The question asks about the molecule switching to the next state when a photon is absorbed. The next state would be the combination of the lowest possible increments in either rotation or vibration.

Wait, the fundamental state in the rotation-vibration model is the state where both rotational and vibrational quantum numbers are at their lowest. So the fundamental state is v=0 and J=0 (or maybe J=1? No, J can be zero. Hmm.)

Wait, for rotation, J can be 0, 1, 2,... So the ground state is J=0. For vibration, v=0 is the ground state. So the fundamental state of the molecule is J=0 and v=0.

When a photon is absorbed, the molecule can move to a higher state. The next possible state with the lowest energy would be either v=1 (vibrational excitation) or J=1 (rotational excitation), whichever requires less energy.

So the photon's energy should match the lower of the two possible energy gaps: the vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1, or the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1.

So I need to calculate both ΔE for vibrational and rotational transitions and see which is smaller. The photon with the energy corresponding to the smaller gap would allow the transition to the next state.

Wait, but the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state and wants to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one with the least energy increase. So which transition requires less energy: increasing J or increasing v?

Let me compute both.

First, the vibrational transition. The energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is h * w, right? Because each vibrational level is spaced by h w. So ΔE_vib = h w.

Now, the rotational transition. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant. The ground state is J=0, so E_rot (J=0) is 0. The next state is J=1, so E_rot (J=1) is B * 1 * 2 = 2B.

So the rotational energy difference is 2B.

So which is smaller, h w or 2B?

But wait, what's B? The rotational constant is given by B = (h)/(8 π² I c), where I is the moment of inertia. Alternatively, another formula: B = ħ²/(2 I k), but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, B is defined as (h²)/(8 π² I c). Or perhaps, B is given by (h)/(8 π² I c). No, wait, I think the correct formula is B = (h)/(8 π² I c), but no, I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Wait, the rotational constant B is related to the moment of inertia I by B = h / (8 π² I c). Or wait, perhaps I should recall the expression for rotational energy levels. Oh right, the energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), where B = (h²)/(8 π² I), but wait, no, let me think in terms of wavenumbers.

Wait, sometimes B is expressed in cm^-1. The rotational energy in terms of wavenumbers is E_J = B_J J (J+1), where B_J is the rotational constant in cm^-1. To get B_J, the formula is B_J = (h)/(8 π² I c), where I is the moment of inertia, h is Planck's constant, I in kg m², c is speed of light.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute I first.

The moment of inertia I is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass of the diatomic molecule and R is the bond length.

Right, so I need to compute μ first.

Masses are Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu. So the reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) all in kg.

Wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So:

Mx =20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = approx 3.321e-26 kg.

My = 2 *1.6605e-27 kg = approx 3.321e-27 kg.

So μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = ( (3.321e-26) * (3.321e-27) ) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 )

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Wait, Mx is 3.321e-26 kg, My is 3.321e-27 kg.

So numerator is 3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 kg².

Denominator: 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.321e-26 (1 + 0.1) )= 3.321e-26 *1.1 = 3.6531e-26 kg.

So μ = ( (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 ) / (3.6531e-26 )

Compute 3.321 squared: approx 11.026.

So numerator is 11.026e-53.

Denominator is 3.6531e-26.

So μ = (11.026e-53) / (3.6531e-26) ) = approx (11.026 /3.6531 ) * 1e-27.

11.026 /3.6531 is about 3.

So 3 * 1e-27 = 3e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

3.321 *3.321 = 11.026.

Denominator: 3.321e-26 +0.3321e-26 = 3.6531e-26.

So 11.026e-53 /3.6531e-26 = (11.026 /3.6531) * 1e-27.

11.026 /3.6531 ≈ 3.02.

So μ ≈3.02e-27 kg.

Then, the moment of inertia I = μ R².

R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R =2e-10 m.

I = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.208e-46 kg m².

Now, compute B, the rotational constant.

Wait, B is defined as (h²)/(8 π² I), right? Because E_J = (h²/(8 π² I)) J(J+1). But sometimes B is expressed in terms of wavenumbers. Let's see.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), where B is (h²)/(8 π² I c) when in cm^-1 units. Hmm, I might be getting confused between the two expressions.

Alternatively, to find the energy difference between J=0 and J=1, which is 2B (since E_1 = 2B, E_0 =0).

So the energy difference is 2B where B is in Joules? Or is B in terms of frequency?

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the rotational energy difference directly.

The rotational energy for J is E_J = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I ), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/(2π)). So E_J = (h² J (J+1)) / (8 π² I).

So for J=0, E=0. For J=1, E=(h² * 2)/(8 π² I) ) = (h²)/(4 π² I).

Wait, but I have I =1.208e-46 kg m².

h is Planck's constant, which is approximately 6.626e-34 J s.

So h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J² s².

So E_rot = (4.39e-67 J² s²) * 2 / (8 π² * 1.208e-46 kg m² )

Wait, no, wait, the formula is E_J = (h² J (J+1))/(8 π² I). For J=1, it's (h² * 2)/(8 π² I).

So plugging numbers:

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

Denominator: 8 * π² *1.208e-46 kg m².

Compute denominator: 8 * (9.8696) * 1.208e-46.

8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568.

78.9568 *1.208e-46 ≈ 78.9568 *1.208 ≈ 95.335, so 95.335e-46 =9.5335e-45.

So E_rot = (4.39e-67 * 2 ) / (9.5335e-45 )

Wait, wait, no: the formula is (h² * 2) / (8 π² I).

Wait, in numbers: h² is 4.39e-67, multiplied by 2 is 8.78e-67.

Divide by 8 π² I.

Which is 8 * (pi^2) * I.

I is 1.208e-46 kg m².

So 8 * pi^2 is about 78.9568.

Multiply by I: 78.9568 * 1.208e-46 ≈ 95.335e-46 =9.5335e-45.

So E_rot = (8.78e-67 ) / (9.5335e-45 ) ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

So the energy difference for rotation is about 9.21e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference is from v=0 to v=1, which is h * w.

w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

h is 6.626e-34 J s.

So ΔE_vib = h * w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Compare the two energy differences:

ΔE_rot ≈9.21e-23 J,

ΔE_vib =2.65e-19 J.

So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the molecule will transition from J=0 to J=1.

So the photon's energy needs to match the rotational energy difference, which is 9.21e-23 J.

But the question is about the photon's momentum. Momentum p is related to energy and wavelength (or frequency). Since photon energy E_photon = p c, where c is the speed of light.

Wait, no, E = p c. So p = E / c.

So p = 9.21e-23 J / (3e8 m/s).

Calculate that: 9.21e-23 /3e8 = approx 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, E_rot was 9.21e-23 J.

So p = E_rot / c = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options given are in that range. Let me look at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B)2.3e-27 Ns

C)1.1e-27 Ns

D)1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, 3.07e-31 kg m/s is 3.07e-31 N s (since 1 N s = 1 kg m/s).

So 3.07e-31 N s is not among the options. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the transition isn't just rotational. Maybe the question refers to a change in both rotational and vibrational states, but that's more complicated. Or perhaps I considered the wrong energy transition.

Wait, maybe the question is about the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state with the next possible lowest energy, which could be a combination of rotation and vibration. But that's more complicated. Or perhaps the next state is the first vibrational state, but that requires more energy than rotation, so it's not the first transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the transition as a vibrational one, but that would require a higher energy photon than the rotational transition.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy difference. Let me recheck the steps.

Wait, I calculated E_rot for J=1 as 9.21e-23 J. But perhaps I forgot a factor or used the wrong formula.

Wait, the formula for rotational energy is E_J = (h²/(8 π² I)) J (J+1). So for J=1, E_J = (h²/(8 π² I)) * 2.

So E_rot = 2 * (h²/(8 π² I)).

Compute that again.

h =6.626e-34 J s.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

I = μ R² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 =1.208e-46 kg m².

So (h²)/(8 π² I) = (4.39e-67 ) / (8 * (pi^2) * 1.208e-46 )

Calculate denominator:

8 * pi^2 ≈ 78.96.

78.96 *1.208e-46 = 78.96 *1.208 = approx 95.33, so 95.33e-46 =9.533e-45.

So (h²)/(8 pi² I) = 4.39e-67 /9.533e-45 = approx 4.60e-23 J.

Wait, so E_rot for J=1 is 2 * 4.60e-23 = 9.20e-23 J. Which matches what I had before.

So this is correct. So the rotational energy difference is about 9.2e-23 J.

But the options are way bigger than that. Like option A is 1.9e-28 N s, which is 1.9e-28 kg m/s.

Wait, my calculated p is 3e-31 Ns, which is 3e-31 kg m/s. So none of the options match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the model. Maybe in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational energy depends on the vibrational state. Or perhaps the energy levels are treated as a combination of rotation and vibration, leading to a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a transition that involves both vibrational and rotational changes. But the question states 'switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy,' which would be the smallest possible energy increase.

Wait, considering that, perhaps the transition is a vibrational one because the rotational transition requires a smaller energy, but the options don't match. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the reduced mass. Let me check that again.

Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu.

So μ = (20 *2)/(20 +2) amu =40 /22 = 1.818 amu.

Wait a second! Oh no! I think I made a mistake earlier. The reduced mass is (Mx*My)/(Mx+My), not the sum of the individual masses.

Ah! I think I messed up the calculation of the reduced mass earlier. Oh, sweet mother of pearl, that's a big mistake.

So, correct μ is (20 * 2) / (20 +2) ) amu =40/22= 1.818 amu.

Which is approximately 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Calculating that: 1.818 *1.6605e-27 = approx:

1.818 *1.6605 ≈ 3.022.

So μ ≈3.022e-27 kg.

Wait, that's the same as I calculated earlier. Because I used (20 amu and 2 amu) to compute μ as (20*2)/(20+2)=40/22=1.818 amu. Oh, but earlier I computed μ as (Mx * My) / (Mx + My), but I think I used their masses in kg, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck that.

Wait, Mx =20 amu =20 * 1.6605e-27 kg =3.321e-26 kg.

My =2 amu =3.321e-27 kg.

So μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (3.321e-26 *3.321e-27 ) / (3.321e-26 +3.321e-27 )

Compute numerator: 3.321e-26 *3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 = approx 11.026e-53 kg².

Denominator: 3.321e-26 +0.3321e-26 =3.653e-26 kg.

So μ =11.026e-53 /3.653e-26 = (11.026 /3.653 ) *1e-27 = approx 3.02e-27 kg.

Which is what I had before. So the reduced mass calculation is correct.

So, perhaps my initial approach is correct, but the result doesn't match any option. So maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, another approach: the question asks for the momentum of the photon. The photon's energy is equal to the energy difference between the states.

So the energy E_photon = ΔE.

But ΔE could be purely rotational or vibrational, or a combination. But earlier, I found that the rotational transition requires much less energy than the vibrational, so it's more likely that the photon's energy corresponds to the rotational transition.

But the options are way higher than my calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake in the energy calculation.

Wait, perhaps I confused the rotational energy with the vibrational. Let me compute the vibrational energy again.

Vibrational energy levels are E_v = (v + 1/2) h w.

So the difference between v=0 and v=1 is h w.

h is 6.626e-34 J s.

w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So ΔE_vib = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So that's 2.65e-19 J.

But the rotational transition is much less: 9.2e-23 J. So that's about 3e-23 J, which is much less than the vibrational transition.

But the question says: the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest state, and wants to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So that would be the next state with the smallest energy (so the smallest possible ΔE). So that's the rotational transition.

So the photon's energy should be 9.2e-23 J. Then, the momentum p is E/c.

So p =9.2e-23 J / (3e8 m/s ) =3.07e-31 kg m/s =3.07e-31 N s.

But looking at the options, the smallest option is D)1.4e-28 Ns, which is 1.4e-28 kg m/s.

Wait, three orders of magnitude larger than my calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy.

Wait, let's recompute E_rot.

E_rot for J=1 is (h²/(8 π² I)) * 2.

h² is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J^2 s^2.

I= μ R² =3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.02e-27 *4e-20 =1.208e-46 kg m^2.

So denominator: 8 π² I =8 * (9.8696) * 1.208e-46 = approx 95.335e-46 kg m².

So (h^2)/(8 π² I) =4.39e-67 /9.533e-45 = approx 4.6e-23 J.

Multiply by 2 (since J=1, so J(J+1)=2), E_rot =9.2e-23 J.

Hmm, same as before.

So where's the problem?

Wait, perhaps the model includes both rotational and vibrational transitions, and the next state is a combination. Or perhaps the question is referring to a change in vibrational state, not rotational.

Wait, but the rotational transition requires less energy. So if the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, the rotational transition is the one.

But the calculated momentum is 3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the photon must match the energy difference between the vibrational and rotational states. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from the fundamental vibrational state (v=0, J=0) to the next state with either v=1 or J=1, whichever has lower energy. Since J=1 requires less energy, the photon's energy is for the rotational transition.

But then the momentum p is E/c, which is 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s =3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I have a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state in the vibrational mode. Because the rotational transition may not be allowed under certain selection rules. Hmm, but the question doesn't specify selection rules. So perhaps it's allowed.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which could be a combination of rotational and vibrational states. But that's more complex, and I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation of μ or I.

Wait, let me recalculate I.

μ =3.02e-27 kg.

R=2 angstroms=2e-10 m.

I=μ R² =3.02e-27 * (2e-10)^2 =3.02e-27 *4e-20= 1.208e-46 kg m².

That's correct.

Hmm, maybe the mistake is in the calculation of E_rot.

Wait, another formula for rotational energy is E_J = (ħ² J (J+1))/(2 I), where ħ is h/(2 pi).

So E_J = (h² J (J+1))/(8 pi² I).

Which is the same as before.

So E_rot for J=1 is (h² * 2)/(8 pi² I) = (h²)/(4 pi² I) * (1/2? No, wait:

Wait, (h² * 2) / (8 pi² I) = (h²)/(4 pi² I).

Wait, let me compute that again.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 =4.39e-67.

4 pi² I =4 *9.8696 *1.208e-46 =approx 4 *9.8696= 39.478, 39.478 *1.208e-46 =47.7e-46 =4.77e-45.

So (4.39e-67)/(4.77e-45) ) = approx 9.21e-23 J.

Which is same as before.

I think I've done everything correctly, but the result doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the photon's momentum in a vibrational transition. Let me compute the momentum for the vibrational transition.

E_photon =2.65e-19 J.

p_photon = E_photon / c =2.65e-19 J /3e8 m/s =8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 Ns.

Which is close to option A)1.9e-28 or D)1.4e-28.

But 8.8e-28 is bigger than all the options. So that's not matching either.

Hmm. What if the calculation for B is wrong?

Wait, another formula: B = (h)/(8 pi^2 I c) where B is in cm^-1.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate B in cm^-1.

But wait, to find the energy difference between J=0 and J=1, perhaps in terms of wavenumbers, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the frequency of the rotational transition and then find the photon's momentum.

Wait, the rotational energy difference is 9.2e-23 J.

Photon energy E = h f =9.2e-23 J.

So f= E/h = (9.2e-23)/6.626e-34 = approx 1.39e11 Hz.

But the momentum p is hbar * k, where k is the wave number.

k = 2 pi f /c.

p = hbar * (2 pi f /c) = (h/(2 pi)) * (2 pi f)/c )= h f/(c).

But E =h f, so p = E/(c) = same as before.

So p =9.2e-23/3e8 =3.07e-31 N s.

So same result.

Hmm. So perhaps the options are incorrect, or maybe I made a wrong assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the next state isn't purely rotational. Maybe the next state is a combination of J=0 to J=1 and v=0 to v=1. But then, that would require more energy than either, which isn't the case.

Wait, but what if the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0), but has some rotational state. So the next state might involve a change in vibration but keeping rotation the same, or vice versa.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the transition from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next possible energy level, which could be either v=1 or J=1, whichever comes first. Since J=1 requires less energy, the photon needed is for the rotational transition.

But again, the momentum doesn't match any option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next vibrational state, not rotational. Because the options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range, which would correspond to higher energies.

Wait, let's compute the momentum for the vibrational transition again.

E_photon =2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 Ns.

Which is not any of the options, but option A is 1.9e-28, which is about 0.214 times that.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of w.

Wait, the given w is 4e14 rad/s.

Yes.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using angular frequency in terms of cm^-1 or some other unit. Wait, no, the given w is in rad/s.

Wait, maybe the mistake is that for the vibrational energy, the energy difference is not h w, but something else.

Wait, actually, the vibrational energy levels are E_v = (v + 1/2) h w. So the difference between v=0 and v=1 is h w.

But wait, in some treatments, the vibrational energy is expressed with a different constant, like the force constant k and reduced mass μ.

E_v = (1/2) h w (2v +1), but that's the same as (v + 1/2) h w.

So the energy difference is h w.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the rotational transition as being in the same state, but with J=1. Then, the photon's momentum would be for that.

But again, the numbers don't match.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy in terms of wavelength or frequency.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition because the given options are in the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns, which would correspond to energies around 1e-19 J (since E=pc, so p=1e-28 Ns → E=3e-10 J). Wait, no, 1e-28 kg m/s *3e8 m/s =3e-20 J. Hmm, no.

Wait, but photon energy for option A is 1.9e-28 Ns * 3e8 m/s =5.7e-20 J, which is way less than the vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next rotational state but in a way that includes the vibrational energy.

Wait, maybe the question is considering that the molecule is in the fundamental state, which includes both vibrational and rotational levels. So the next state with the lowest energy is J=1, v=0. So the energy comes from the rotational transition.

But regardless, I think I must have made a mistake in my calculations because the options don't match.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the rigid rotor model, not the non-rigid. But the question states non-rigid.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the model used here combines both rotational and vibrational energies in such a way that the next state is a combination. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the vibrational energy in terms of momentum.

Wait, the photon's momentum is p = h / lambda, and E_photon = h f = p c.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the vibrational transition's energy and then compute the photon's momentum.

E_photon_vib = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p_photon_vib = E_photon_vib / c=2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Which is 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, the closest one would be option A)1.9e-28, but that's about a fifth of that value.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of w. Wait, the given w is 4e14 rad/s.

Yes, correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses w in terms of wavenumbers (cm^-1), which would be different. Let me think about that.

Wait, wavenumber (tilde{w}) is in cm^-1 and is related to w by w = c * tilde{w}.

But the given w is 4e14 rad/s, which is a very high frequency, corresponding to X-rays or gamma rays. But that seems too high for a molecular vibration, which typically are in the infrared region, with w around 1e13 to 1e14 rad/s.

Ah! Wait a second. 4e14 rad/s is indeed way too high for molecular vibrations. That's perhaps a typo in the problem, but I'll proceed as given.

Alternatively, perhaps the given w is in terms of cm^-1, but that's not what the question states. The question says w is 4e14 rad/s.

Hmm. Maybe another approach: perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, but that would require the photon's energy to be h w, which I've calculated as 2.65e-19 J → p =8.83e-28 kg m/s.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state, which includes both a vibrational and rotational change, but that would require more energy than either.

Wait, maybe the problem is expecting me to calculate the rotational transition but in a different way. Let me think about this again.

The rotational energy difference is 9.2e-23 J. The photon's momentum is E/c =3e-31 kg m/s.

But perhaps the question is considering the photon's energy as the sum of rotational and vibrational, but that doesn't make sense for the next state with the lowest energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the transition from J=0 to J=1, but only considering the vibrational part. No, that doesn't make sense.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is using the approximation where the energy levels are treated as E_total = E_rot + E_vib, and the next state is the next possible state in the combined energy levels. But the next state would still be the one with the smallest energy difference.

But regardless, I'm stuck because the calculated momentum doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass μ.

Wait, let me recalculate μ.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 *2 )/(20 +2 )=40/22=1.818 amu.

1 amu=1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ=1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg.

Compute that:

1.818 *1.6605 ≈3.022.

So μ=3.022e-27 kg.

Which is what I had before.

So I think the mistake must be elsewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question refers to the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited vibrational state (v=1, J=0), which would require the photon's energy to be h w.

So the momentum p = h w /c.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s.

But that's not any of the options. The options are A)1.9e-28, B)2.3e-27, C)1.1e-27, D)1.4e-28.

Hmm. 8.8e-28 is larger than option D (1.4e-28) and A (1.9e-28), but not matching any.

Wait, perhaps the given R is 2 angstroms, but I used 2e-10 m. That's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state with the next higher rotational state but for a diatomic molecule, which might have selection rules that ΔJ=±1.

But regardless of that, the energy calculation is the same.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the non-rigid rotor model, which includes centrifugal distortion, but I don't think that affects the energy of the first transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the harmonic oscillator approximation for vibration, but that doesn't change the ΔE calculation.

I'm stuck. Given that, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 1.9e-28 Ns, but I don't see how. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the rotational energy difference.

E_rot (J=1) = 2 * (h²/(8 pi² I)).

h²= (6.626e-34)^2 =4.39e-67 J² s².

Denominator:8 pi² I =8 *9.8696 *1.208e-46.

Compute 8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568.

78.9568 *1.208e-46=95.33e-46=9.533e-45.

So (h²)/(8 pi² I)=4.39e-67 /9.533e-45 =4.60e-23 J.

Multiply by 2: 9.20e-23 J.

Hmm. So, E_rot=9.20e-23 J.

p = E/c =9.2e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 kg m/s.

None of the options match. So perhaps the answer is not among the options, but given the options, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state to the first excited state in the vibrational-rotational coupling, but I don't know enough about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula for the rotational energy. For example, sometimes rotational energy is written as E_J = B J (J+1), where B is in J.

Wait, but earlier I computed B as h²/(8 pi² I), which is in J.

Wait, let's compute B again.

h² =4.39e-67.

I=1.208e-46.

So B =4.39e-67 / (8 pi² *1.208e-46 )=4.39e-67/(9.53e-45)=4.60e-23 J.

So for J=1, E_rot=2 *4.60e-23 =9.2e-23 J.

Same as before.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option C)1.1e-27 Ns, but I can't see why.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the rotational energy in terms of the bond's potential energy, but I don't see how that would change the momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the moment of inertia in a different way.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the model considers the molecule as a rigid rotor, but that shouldn't change the outcome because the question specifies the non-rigid model.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the transition to the next energy level, which would be a combination of vibrational and rotational changes, but I don't know how to compute that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the photon's energy as the sum of the rotational and vibrational energies, but that would make the energy higher, which doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the photon's energy is the average of the two transitions. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the energy in terms of wavelength. For the rotational transition, the wavelength would be lambda = h c / E_rot.

So lambda = (6.626e-34 *3e8 ) /9.2e-23 = (1.9878e-25 ) /9.2e-23 ≈ 2.16e-3 m.

Which is about 2 mm. Not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the photon's momentum using the vibrational energy, which gives p=8.8e-28 Ns, but the options have nothing near that. So perhaps the intended answer is option A, 1.9e-28 Ns, which is about 0.214 of that.

But why would that be the case? I can't see any reason for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the given options are in error, and the correct answer isn't listed. But since I have to choose from the options provided, perhaps the intended answer is option A.

But I'm not confident. Another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the rotational energy is E_J = (h^2/(8 pi^2 I)) * J (J+1), but in some references, it's E_J = (h^2/(8 pi^2 I)) * J (J+1) * (1/(2 mu c^2)) or something else. But I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the rotational energy is expressed as E_J = (h c B) J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant in cm^-1. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is E_J = (h c) * B * J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1.

If B= (h)/(8 pi^2 I c), then E_J= (h c) * (h/(8 pi^2 I c)) ) * J(J+1) = h^2 J(J+1)/(8 pi² I).

Which is the same as before.

So no, I don't think that changes anything.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think the correct approach is that the photon's momentum is 3.07e-31 Ns, but since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option A, 1.9e-28 Ns, which is about 6e7 times larger. But I don't know why.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. So I = μ R² =3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10)^2 =3.02e-27 *4e-20 =1.208e-46 kg m². That's correct.

Hmm. I'm not seeing any other way. Maybe the intended answer is option C:1.1e-27 Ns.

Wait, 1.1e-27 Ns is 1.1e-27 kg m/s.

E_photon = p c =1.1e-27 *3e8 =3.3e-19 J.

Which would correspond to a frequency of E/h=3.3e-19 /6.626e-34 ≈5e14 Hz. Which is in the same ballpark as the given w=4e14 rad/s (since 1 Hz = 2pi rad/s, so 5e14 Hz is about 3.14e15 rad/s), but that's way higher than given w.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the first vibrational state, but with a smaller frequency, but I don't know.

I think I've spent too much time on this. Given that, I'll go with the calculation for the rotational transition, which gives p=3.07e-31 Ns, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider the vibrational transition, but with a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule absorbs a photon and transitions from the ground state to the first excited state (v=1, J=0), which requires energy h w.

So, E= h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A (1.9e-28) and D (1.4e-28). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h w. Let me double-check.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E=6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J. Correct.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Hmm, no. So perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I can't see why.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units for w. If w is given in cm^-1, not in rad/s.

Wait, no, the question states w is 4e14 rad/s. So that can't be.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the relation p = h/(lambda), but that would require knowing the wavelength.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the fact that for a photon, p = E/c.

Which I have done.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I have to go with the correct calculation, which doesn't match any option. But since the question requires an answer, perhaps the intended answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the reduced mass.

Wait, another way to compute μ:

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) =40/22=1.818 amu.

Which I converted to kg correctly.

Hmm. I think I'm out of options. I'll proceed to conclude that the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps the intended answer is option A, 1.9e-28 Ns.


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration (non-rigid rotor) model. The molecule is in its fundamental state (v=0, J=0), and the goal is to determine the photon momentum required to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The given parameters are:

- Mass of atom X: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \)
- Mass of atom Y: \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
- Bond length: \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
- Angular frequency of vibration: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reduced Mass Calculation**:  
   The reduced mass \( \mu \) is calculated as:  
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} \, \text{amu} = 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
   \]  
   Converting to kilograms:  
   \[
   \mu = 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.022 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
   \]

2. **Moment of Inertia**:  
   The moment of inertia \( I \) is given by:  
   \[
   I = \mu R^2 = (3.022 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2.
   \]

3. **Rotational Energy Transition**:  
   The rotational energy levels are \( E_J = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I} J (J+1) \). For \( J=0 \) to \( J=1 \), the energy difference is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{h^2}{4 \pi^2 I}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s} \) and \( I = 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \):  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{4 \pi^2 \cdot 1.208 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

4. **Photon Momentum for Rotational Transition**:  
   The photon momentum \( p \) is related to the energy difference by \( p = \frac{\Delta E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):  
   \[
   p = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s} = 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}.
   \]  
   This value does not match any of the provided options.

5. **Vibrational Energy Transition**:  
   The vibrational energy levels are \( E_v = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) h \omega \). The energy difference for \( v=0 \) to \( v=1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   The photon momentum is:  
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}.
   \]  
   This value is also not among the options.

6. **Comparison of Energy Gaps**:  
   The rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition. Thus, the photon momentum for the rotational transition is the correct choice. However, the calculated value (\( 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)) does not match any of the provided options.

7. **Final Consideration**:  
   Given the discrepancy between the calculated values and the provided options, the closest match to the vibrational transition momentum (\( 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)) is **option A (\( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \))**, though it is approximately 0.214 times smaller than the calculated value. This discrepancy may arise from rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is not explicitly listed, but based on the closest match to the vibrational transition, the intended answer is:

**Answer: A**
