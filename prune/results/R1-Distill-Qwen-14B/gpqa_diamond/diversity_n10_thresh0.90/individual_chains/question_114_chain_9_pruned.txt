Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out step by step. 

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. Let me read it again carefully.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something called A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. 

Hmm, okay. So I think the first reaction is some kind of substitution or addition. Butan-2-one is a ketone, right? So maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. NaCN is sodium cyanide. Oh wait, so maybe this is a cyanide acting as a nucleophile.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When ketones react with something like CN-, they usually form cyanohydrins. Oh right, the cyanohydrin formation. That's when a ketone reacts with HCN (or in this case, maybe CN- from another source) to form a cyanohydrin, which is a compound with an alcohol and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon.

So in the first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, no, because butanenitrile would have four carbons. Wait, but butan-2-one is CH3-CO-CH2-? No, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a three-carbon ketone. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, but butanenitrile would have four carbons. Oh, maybe I got the structure wrong. Let me think.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So it's CH2(CN)(OH)CH2CH3? Or maybe the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? Hmm, perhaps I need to think of it as adding the CN- to the carbonyl carbon, and then the OH also adds there. So the carbonyl becomes a secondary alcohol and a nitrile group attached. So the product is a cyanohydrin.

So the first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from the ketone. The reagent is NaCN. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions, but in a protic solvent? Or maybe in a solution where the CN- can act as a nucleophile.

Wait, but for the cyanohydrin formation, I remember that the reaction between ketones and HCN (or CN-) under acidic conditions, like with H2SO3 or H3O+ as a catalyst. Oh right, because
