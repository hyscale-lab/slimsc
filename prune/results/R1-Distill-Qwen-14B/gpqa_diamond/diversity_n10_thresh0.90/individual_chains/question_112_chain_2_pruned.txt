Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The state of an electron is given as |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, I think that means |alpha> can be written as a linear combination of the spin-up and spin-down states. But wait, because it's proportional, I should probably normalize it. So, first, I'll need to find the normalization factor.

The next part is about measuring the probability of finding the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation where Aij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, so the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix looks like this for a 2x2 system:

[[0, ħ/2],
 [ħ/2, 0]]

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. For a 2x2 matrix, the rows and columns are i and j. So A_11 is 0, A_12 is ħ/2, A_21 is ħ/2, A_22 is 0. So the operator is equal to ħ/2 times the Pauli X matrix, maybe? Because Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], and here the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So the operator could be written as (ħ/2) σ_x.

But wait, I'm not sure. Let me make sure. The matrix given is [[0, a], [a, 0]] where a is ħ/2. So yes, that's exactly the Pauli X matrix scaled by a factor of a. So the eigenstates of this operator would be the same as the eigenstates of σ_x, I think. Because the operator is proportional to σ_x.

So the eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of the operator A. So, the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

Wait, but our state |alpha> is expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, so to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of A, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>. Then the coefficients squared will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, another approach is to compute the overlap between |alpha> and each eigenstate of A.

Wait, but to do that, I first need to normalize |alpha>.

Let me start by normalizing |alpha>.

The given state is |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

So the vector components are (1+i, 2 - i).

The norm squared is (1+i)(1-i) + (2 - i)(2 + i) = (1 +1) + (4 + 2i - 2i +1) = 2 + (5) = 7.

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of the operator A. Since A's eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, let me compute the coefficients c1 and c2 such that |alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |-x>.

Let me write this out.

c1 = < +x | alpha > = [ 1/sqrt(2) ( <up| + <down| ) ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

So, c1 = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * 1 ] 

Wait, because <up|up> is 1, <down|down> is 1, and the cross terms would be zero because <up|down> is zero. Wait, no, in this case, when you have (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ), multiplying by |alpha>, it's (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up|up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * <down|down> + ... cross terms? No, because |up> and |down> are orthogonal.

Wait, wait. Let me compute it properly. The inner product < +x | alpha > is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] times ( (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ) / sqrt(7)

So, the inner product is (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) + (2 -i ) ].

Calculating (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3.

So c1 = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, c2 is < -x | alpha >.

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] times ( (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ) / sqrt(7)

So, inner product is (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]

(1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i ) = (-1) + 2i = -1 + 2i.

So c2 = (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

Wait, but so the state |alpha> is expressed as c1 |+x> + c2 |-x> .

So the probabilities are |c1|^2 and |c2|^2.

Calculating |c1|^2:

c1 = 3/sqrt(14). So square is 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

|c2|^2: c2 is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14). The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, which is close to 0.64. Hmm, but looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36, but 5/14 is approximately 0.357, not 0.36. So option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which is 9/14 and 5/14 is 0.6428, but 5/14 is approximately 0.357.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of c1 and c2. Let me check:

Wait, |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

For c1, which is < +x | alpha >:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) = (3) / (sqrt(14)).

Wait, yes because (1+i) + (2 -i) is 3.

So the magnitude squared is 9/14.

Similarly, c2 is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) = ( (1 +i -2 +i ) )/(sqrt(14)).

Which is (-1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14).

So |c2|^2 is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.357.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 → but 5/14 is about 0.357, which is 0.357, so 0.36 is close, but not exact. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, but perhaps the operator is different. Or perhaps the eigenstates are different. Let me think again.

Wait, the operator A is given with A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, else 0. So the matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. So this is the same as (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are indeed |+x> and |-x>, as I thought before.

So the eigenvalues of the operator A would be (hbar/2)(1) and (hbar/2)(-1), since the eigenvalues of σ_x are 1 and -1.

Wait, but wait, the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2) * (1
