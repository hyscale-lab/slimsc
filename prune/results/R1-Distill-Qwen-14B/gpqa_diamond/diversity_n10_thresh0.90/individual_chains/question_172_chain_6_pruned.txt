Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann equation here.

Wait, right, the Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy states in a system. The formula is something like (n_i / n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, I think n_1 for the excited state is twice n_2. Let's define E as the energy difference between the two levels. So E is 1.38e-23 J.

Let me denote the ratio of populations as n1/n2 = 2. Or wait, no, because star_1 has more excited atoms. So maybe it's the ratio of the excited state to the ground state. Oh wait, the question says twice as excited. So perhaps the excited state population is higher in star_1.

Wait, the question states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So if we're comparing the same energy levels between the two stars, star_1 has a higher ratio. Let's say the ground state is E1 and the excited state is E2, with E2 = E1 + ΔE. But since the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J, let's just consider ΔE = E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J.

So the ratio for star_1 is n2_1 / n1_1 = 2, where n2 is the excited state and n1 is the ground. For star_2, it's n2_2 / n1_2 = 1 (since it's half as excited? Wait, no. Wait, the question says star_1's atoms are twice as excited. So in star_1, the number in the excited state is
