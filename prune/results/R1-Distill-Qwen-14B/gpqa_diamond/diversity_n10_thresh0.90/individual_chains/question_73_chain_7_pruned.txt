Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. 

First, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking about the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, each giving a different relative velocity and energy.

Wait, okay. For relative velocity in relativity, I remember that you can't just subtract the speeds like you would in classical mechanics. I think the formula is something like (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). But wait, wait—no. Let me think. Oh right, the formula for relative speed when objects are moving at relativistic velocities is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Because in relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly; you have to account for the effects of special relativity.

So here, both are moving in the same direction. The first astronaut has a velocity of 0.6c, and the second is 0.5c. So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So the relative speed should be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute the numerator first: 0.6c minus 0.5c is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 minus (0.3c²/c²) which is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7. 0.1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c. So around 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c for the relative speed. So that's a clue.

Next, the total energy of the system. Hmm, in relativity, the total energy isn't just the sum of their rest mass energies. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma * m * c². So I need to calculate each of their energies and sum them.

Gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)). So for the first astronaut with v = 0.6c:

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So his energy E1 is gamma1 * m1 * c². Wait, m1 is 2m, so E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Similarly for the second astronaut, v=0.5c:

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

His mass is 3m, so E2 = gamma2 * 3m * c² ≈ 1.1547 *3 * m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 = approximately 5.964 m c². So that's close to 5.96 mc², as in option C. Option D says 5 mc², which is lower, so probably not.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations for gamma2. 0.5 squared is 0.25. 1 minus 0.25 is
