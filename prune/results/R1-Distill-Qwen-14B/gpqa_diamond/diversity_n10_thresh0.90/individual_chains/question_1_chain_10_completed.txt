Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish between these two energy levels. The options are A to D.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I remember something about the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time is at least ħ/2. Or was it ħ? Let me think. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. Or maybe I'm mixing this up with something else. Oh, no, wait, I think it's ħ over two, but sometimes people use the approximation without the ½ factor. Hmm.

So the idea is that the shorter the lifetime (Δt) of a state, the less precisely we can know its energy. Because a shorter Δt implies a larger uncertainty ΔE, right? So the energy difference between the two states needs to be larger than the uncertainty for them to be distinguishable. Otherwise, their energies would overlap, making it hard to tell them apart.

Wait, but in this problem, each state has its own lifetime. Oh, wait no, wait. The two states have different lifetimes. So perhaps each state has a certain uncertainty in energy. But we're looking for the energy difference between E2 and E1, let's say ΔE = E2 - E1. We need this ΔE to be such that it's larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state, so that they can be resolved.

Hmm, but how exactly do the lifetimes relate to the energy uncertainty? Oh, right! The uncertainty in energy (ΔE) is inversely proportional to the lifetime (Δt) of the state. So for each state, ΔE = ħ / (Δt). But which Δt do we use here? Wait, the two states have different lifetimes. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties? Because each state's energy is uncertain by its own ΔE. So the minimum ΔE required for them to be distinguishable would be when ΔE is greater than the sum of the two uncertainties. Or wait, maybe the maximum uncertainty is the larger of the two. Let me think.

Wait, let me get the formula straight. For a single state, the uncertainty in energy is approximately ħ divided by the lifetime of the state. So for the first state, which has a lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 sec, ΔE1 = ħ/(τ1). Similarly, for the second state, τ2= 1e-8 sec, ΔE2= ħ/(τ2). But wait, since τ2 is larger than τ1, ΔE2 would be smaller than ΔE1. Because a longer lifetime implies a more precise energy measurement.

But wait, the problem is about distinguishing the two energy levels. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the two energies would overlap, making them indistinguishable.

Wait, no. Let's think again. Each state's energy is known within a certain uncertainty. The actual energy of each is E1 ± ΔE1 and E2 ± ΔE2. To distinguish them, the lower end of E2 must be higher than the upper end of E1. So E2 - ΔE2 ≥ E1 + ΔE1. So the difference E2 - E1 must be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, let me write that down. Let ΔE be the energy difference E2 - E1. We have:

ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Because if ΔE is larger than the sum of the uncertainties, then E2 - E1 > (ΔE1 + ΔE2), which ensures that E2 is definitely above E1, so they don't overlap. Therefore, the minimum energy difference needed is when ΔE equals the sum of the uncertainties.

So let me compute each uncertainty. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. But ħ is h/(2π), which is approximately 1.05457e-34 J·s.

But wait, the options are in eV, so maybe I should compute the energies in eV.

Let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.05457e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) ≈ 1.05457e-25 J.

To convert J to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So ΔE1 = 1.05457e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ (1.05457 / 1.602) * 1e-6 eV ≈ approximately 0.658e-6 eV, which is 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = (1.05457e-34) / (1e-8) ≈ 1.05457e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 1.05457e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ (1.05457 / 1.602) * 1e-7 eV ≈ 0.658e-7 eV = 6.58e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV, and ΔE2 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV.

The sum of these uncertainties is approximately 7.24e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than this sum. Let's look at the options.

Option A: 1e-9 eV. That's way smaller than 7.2e-7, so no.

Option B: 1e-11 eV. Also way smaller.

Option C: 1e-4 eV. That's 0.0001 eV. 7.2e-7 is 0.00000072 eV. So 1e-4 is larger than that. So this would work.

Option D: 1e-8 eV. 1e-8 eV is 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 7.2e-7. So no.

Wait, but let me double-check. Wait, 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV. 7.2e-7 is 0.00000072 eV. So 1e-4 is larger, which would satisfy the condition. So the energy difference needs to be larger than 7.2e-7 eV. Option C is 1e-4, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4, which is much bigger than 7.2e-7.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Because the question says the lifetimes are 1e-9 and 1e-8. So for each, their individual uncertainties are about 6.58e-7 eV (for 1e-9 s) and 6.58e-8 eV (for 1e-8 s). The sum of these is approximately 7.2e-7 eV. So the energy difference should be larger than that.

Looking at the options, only option C (1e-4) is larger. Because 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is way bigger than 7.2e-7 eV. So option C would be the correct choice.

So the answer must be option C.


To distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties in energy for each state. The uncertainty in energy for a state is given by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t},
\]

where \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state. For the two states with lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), the uncertainties in energy are:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2}.
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.05457 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.05457 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

The sum of these uncertainties is:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} + 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the two energy levels to be distinguishable, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must satisfy:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_{\text{total}} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, evaluate the options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is too small.
- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is also much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is too small.
- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it satisfies the condition.
- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is \( 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is too small.

Thus, the only option that satisfies the condition is **C**.

Answer: C
