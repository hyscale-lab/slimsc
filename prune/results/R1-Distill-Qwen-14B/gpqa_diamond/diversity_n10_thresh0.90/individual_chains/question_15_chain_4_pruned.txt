Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, okay, I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Oh wait, so Planet_1's period is P1, Planet_2's is 3P1.

The planets have circular orbits. Their host stars: the star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting. So even though one star is more massive, their radii are the same. I guess Planet_2's host is a bit evolved, so perhaps it's a subgiant or something, but same radius.

The question is about the probability of transit. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size. The formula I think is something like (R_star / a) where 'a' is the semi-major axis, but wait, more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a) squared, or maybe it's (R_star / a) times another factor.

Wait, I think the transit probability depends on the ratio of the size of the planet's orbit to the star's size. The probability is roughly (R_*/ a)^2, but I might be mixing it up. Or wait, no. Let me think. The transit happens when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to our line of sight. The probability is proportional to (R_star / a), because the area where the alignment can occur is a circle with radius R_star, and the total possible area is a circle of radius a. Wait, I think it's (R_star / a)^2 multiplied by something else? Or perhaps it's the ratio of areas.

Wait, no. I remember that the probability that a planet transits is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / a, but R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so we can ignore it. So the probability is roughly R_star / a. But wait, I'm not so sure. Another way: the probability
