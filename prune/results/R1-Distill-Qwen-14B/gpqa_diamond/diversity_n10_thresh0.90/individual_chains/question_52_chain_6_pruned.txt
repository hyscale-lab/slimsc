Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about stars and their effective temperatures when spots are present or not. Hmm, let me try to break this down. 

Alright, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but why does the Teff decrease when spots are present? Oh right, because the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So the star's overall brightness decreases because a part of its surface isn't emitting as much.

The question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Wait, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation, right? The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E is energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the transition between the energy levels is at 1448 Å, which is in the near UV range. So the energy difference E2 - E1 would be related to the photon's energy. Let me calculate that. The energy E of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. H is Planck's constant, c speed of light, λ the wavelength.

So E = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m). Let me compute that. 6.626e-34 *3e8 = ~1.9878e-25. Divided by 1448e-10 is approximately 1.373e-18 J per photon. To convert to eV, since 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J, so E ≈ 1.373e-18 /1.602e-19 ≈
