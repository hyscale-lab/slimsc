Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons, varying hydrogens and oxygen. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Alright, let's go through each of the given data points one by one. First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait, a very broad peak—so maybe it's a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch because the -OH is more acidic and the hydrogen bonds are stronger. Alternatively, if it's an alcohol, the peak might be a little less broad. Hmm, not sure yet.

Then, there are two other strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 region is typically where carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids) absorb. The 1650 might be an aromatic ring (C=C stretch), or maybe another carbonyl, but that's a bit lower. Wait, 1650 could also indicate conjugation, like an ester or a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide, but the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are the ones on a double bond, usually as a pair, maybe as a triplet or a quartet depending on substituents. So the compound has a double bond somewhere, perhaps an alkene.

And then the mass spec shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. Let's think about what fragments could give m/z 45. 45 is the molecular weight of CH3OCH2CH3? Wait, no, wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. Let's break it down. 45 could be C3H7O or something else. Wait, 45 is 45. Let me think, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O, which is 45 (15 for O, 12*2 + 3*2 = 30, so 15+30=45). So that's dimethyl ether. Alternatively, 45 is also the molecular weight of HCOOH (formic acid), which is 46? No, formic acid is 46 because H is 1, COOH is 2*16 + 12 + 1 = 46? Wait, no: HCOOH is H2O2COOH? Wait, no, HCOOH is CH2O2, but no, wait: HCOOH is H2CO2O? No, perhaps I should calculate it. HCOOH: molecular formula is C=1, H2, O2. So 12 + 2*1 + 16*2 = 12 +2 +32=46. So not 45. So maybe it's (CH3)2O, which is 45. So that would be a fragment with that structure.

Alternatively, 45 could come from something else. Let's see: 45 is 45, so what other possibilities? Maybe a ketene or something else. Alternatively, the fragment could be a methyl group attached to something else. Hmm. For example, if the compound is an ester, maybe the ester group breaks off to form a methyl group (but that's 15), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the molecular ion (M) would be the molecular weight. Let's calculate the molecular weights for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight: (6×12)+(12×1)+(2×16)=72+12+32=116 g/mol.
Option B: C6H10O. (6×12)+(10×1)+(16)=72+10+16=98 g/mol.
Option C: C6H10O2. (6×12)+(10×1)+(2×16)=72+10+32=114 g/mol.
Option D: C6H12O. (6×12)+(12×1)+(16)=72+12+16=100 g/mol.

The mass spec shows a fragment at m/z 45. So
