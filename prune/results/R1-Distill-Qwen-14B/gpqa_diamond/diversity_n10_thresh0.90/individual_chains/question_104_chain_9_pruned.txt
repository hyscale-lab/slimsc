Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and we detect shifts in the spectral lines.

The question says we have two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected a shift in their spectral lines: planet 1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and planet 2 caused 7. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet 2 is compared to planet 1.

Wait, how does the shift relate to the planet's orbital period? I think the RV method measures the velocity of the star, which is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I recall is something like v = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (P)^(1/3)) ) ), but I'm not too confident about the exact formula.

Wait, another approach. The RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star. K depends on the planet's mass, the orbital period, and the inclination angle (but if we assume the orbits are edge-on, sin i is 1). Since both planets are around stars with the same mass (solar mass) and same planet mass (Neptune-like), the only varying factors here would be the orbital periods leading to different K values.

The formula for K is K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (4 * c^3 * sqrt(1 - e^2)) ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3)) )

But wait, since the eccentricity e is probably zero because the orbits are circular, that simplifies the formula. Also, because both stars have the same mass and planets same mass, the ratio of K1 and K2 would depend on the cube root of the ratio of their periods.

Wait, let me write the equation for K for each planet:

K1 = ( (G * M_p) / (4π²) )^(1/3) * (1 / (M_star^(2/3) * P1^(1/3))) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the proportionality. Because K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)) ), all else being equal. Since M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K1 is 5 milliangstroms and K2 is 7, then K2/K1 = 7/5.

But wait, wait, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K2 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3) * K1. Hmm, no, wait. Let me think again. Let me write the proportionality correctly.

The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (4π²) * M_star² ) )^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3))) )

Wait, that's probably not exactly right, but the key point is that K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3). Because if K1 is smaller, and K is inversely proportional, then P1 is larger when K1 is smaller.

Wait no, if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so K = C / P^(1/3), where C is a constant.

So K1 = C / (P1)^(1/3)
K2 = C / (P2)^(1/3)

Dividing K2 by K1:

K2/K1 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3 )

Wait, no. Let's compute K2/K1:

K2/K1 = [C/(P2^(1/3))] / [C/(P1^(1/3))] ) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

So, K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

We can rearrange that to find P2/P1.

Take both sides to the power of 3:

(K2/K1)^3 = P1/P2

So P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3

Wait, no, let me re-express.

Wait our equation is:

K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Raise both sides to the third power:

(K2/K1)^3 = P1 / P2

So P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3

Given that K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

So K1=5, K2=7. So K1/K2=5/7.

Then, (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 = P1 * 0.364.

Wait, but wait, the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet 2 compared to planet 1. So P2 / P1 = ?

From the previous step: P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. Which means planet 2's period is shorter than planet 1's by a factor of ~0.36.

Wait, but the options are A) ~0.36, B) ~1.40, C) ~1.96, D) ~0.85.

So the question is, how much longer is P2 than P1?

Wait no, I think I might have messed up because the way I set up the equation.

Wait the question says: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So P2 is longer than P1? Or shorter?

Wait, let's think about it. The star's velocity is K. So if K is higher, the star is moving faster, which implies a shorter period. Because for a given planet mass, a shorter orbital period would require a higher velocity to keep the orbit tighter. Alternatively, from the formula, higher K implies shorter period because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K2 is larger than K1 (7 >5), then P2 is shorter than P1.

Wait wait, no. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K2 > K1 implies that P2 < P1.

So planet 2 has a shorter period than planet 1. So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet 2 is about 0.364 times that of planet 1. So it's shorter.

So the question is, how many times longer is the period of planet 2 compared to planet 1.

But since it's shorter, it's 0.36 times as long. So the answer is approximately 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the proportionality.

Let me think again: K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is given by K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * [ (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2) (P)^(1/3) ) ]

Wait, perhaps a better way is to write the Kepler's third law. Because the RV method relates to the star's motion, and the period is the same as the planet's period.

Kepler's third law for the star-planet system: (P^2 G) (M_star + M_p) = (4π²) a^3.

But since the planet's mass is much less than the star's, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So, P^2 = (4π² a^3) / (G M_star)

But a is the semi-major axis. For circular orbits, a is the radius.

The RV semi-amplitude K is related to the star's velocity, which is given by:

K = (v) = (2π a_p sin i) / P,

where a_p is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since we're assuming i≈90°, sin i is 1.

But a_p can be found from Kepler's third law.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula that relates K, P, and M_p.

Wait, I've read before that K is given by:

K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * ( (2π / P ) )^(1/3) ) / (c )

Wait, maybe that's not right.

Alternatively, another formula I found online is:

K = ( (27 π) / (2 c^3) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate (1 + M_p/M_star) to 1. So,

K ≈ (27 π / (2 c^3))^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

So K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )) )

Since M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

Which implies that P ∝ 1 / K^(3)

So, if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1.

Wait, let's say K1 =5, K2=7.

Thus, K1/K2 = 5/7.

P1/P2 = (K2/K1)^3 = (7/5)^3 = 343/125 ≈ 2.744.

Wait, no, because P is proportional to 1/K^3.

So,

P1/P2 = (K2/(K1))^3

Because P ∝ 1/K^3.

Wait, let's think. If K1 = C / P1^(1/3), then P1 = (C/K1)^3.

Similarly, P2 = (C/K2)^3.

So P1/P2 = ( (C/K1)^3 ) / ( (C/K2)^3 ) ) = (K2/K1)^3.

So P1/P2 = (7/5)^3 = 343/125 ≈ 2.744.

So that would make P1 longer than P2 by a factor of 2.744.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1.

So P2 is (1/2.744) times P1, which is approximately 0.364 times.

So P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36.

Wait, but the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So if P2 is shorter, then the period is shorter, so the factor is less than 1.

So the answer is approximately 0.36, which is option A.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies:

\[
P \propto \frac{1}{K^3}
\]

For planet #1, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), and for planet #2, \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Using the proportionality:
