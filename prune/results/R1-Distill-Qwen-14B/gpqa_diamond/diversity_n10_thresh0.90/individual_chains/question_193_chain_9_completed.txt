Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Hmm. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are about how N depends on r.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Parallax and distance are related. I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Like, plx = 1/distance, but wait, actually, more precisely, plx in arcseconds is equal to 1 parsec divided by the distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So if the distance increases, parallax decreases.

So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, that would make N proportional to d^5. Because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. Wait, I think that refers to the differential: like, for a small change in distance, how much does the number of stars change. So maybe it's about the derivative of N with respect to r (distance r).

Let me formalize this. Let me denote N as the number of stars, and r as the distance. Given that N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/r, so N ∝ r^5. So N = k * r^5, where k is some constant.

But wait, when you have a distribution of stars, the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r + dr would be the number density multiplied by the volume of that shell. Oh wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again. "How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So, as r increases, how does the count change per unit r.

Wait, but the initial statement says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. So for a given region, perhaps the number of stars is a function of parallax. So for stars at a certain distance, their number relates to their parallax.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of integrating over a volume. Let's say we have a volume element in a spherical shell. The number of stars in that shell would depend on the volume and the number density.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars per unit volume is proportional to r^5. Because N ∝ r^5, so the number density (which is N per unit volume) would be N/(volume), but wait, if N is proportional to r^5, then the number density is N/(r^2 dr) ) because the volume of a shell is 4πr² dr. So number density is (k r^5) / (4π r² dr) ) = (k r^3)/(4π dr). That doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I'm confusing something.

Wait, perhaps the number of stars in a given direction (like a thin slice) is what's being considered. Because parallax is related to the distance along the line of sight. So for a fixed area, the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So if we consider a thin slice at a distance r, the number of stars in that slice would be proportional to the area times the number per unit volume times the thickness.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of number per unit volume. If the number density is n(r) = number per unit volume, then the number of stars in a shell dr thick at radius r would be n(r) * 4π r² dr. But according to the question, N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, N ∝ r^5. So for a given shell, N ∝ r^5, but that doesn't make sense because N should be number per unit volume? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, perhaps N is the number of stars observed in a specific region, say, a unit area on the sky. So the number of stars you see in that area would depend on their distance. The more distant stars have smaller parallax, so the number varies as 1/(plx)^5. So for a given area, the number of stars at a distance r is proportional to r^5.

But the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range. So perhaps the number of stars in a thin shell at radius r is what we're considering. So for a small change in r, dr, how much does the number change.

Wait, if N ∝ r^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell (i.e., between r and r + dr) would be proportional to r^5. But that's not the case, because the number in a shell would be the number density multiplied by the volume of the shell. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, considering that N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars per unit distance (i.e., the derivative dN/dr) would be 5k r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4. But none of the options have r^4 as the answer. Let me check the options again.

Options are A) r^3, B) r^5, C) r^4, D) r^2.

Wait, wait, if N ∝ r^5, then dN/dr ∝ r^4. So the number of stars increases by r^4 per unit distance. So the answer would be C) ~ r^4.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's what the question is exactly asking. The question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So per unit range, meaning per dr, how much does N change? So the derivative of N with respect to r.

So if N ∝ r^5, then dN/dr = 5k r^4. So the change in N per unit r is proportional to r^4. So the correct answer would be option C) ~ r^4.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number density, which is N divided by the volume. But that would be another approach.

Wait, if N is proportional to r^5, then the number density (n = N/(volume)) would be n = N/( (4/3) π R^3 ), but I'm not sure. For a given volume, the number of stars would be proportional to r^5. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a region is proportional to the area times the depth. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of flux or something else, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, then N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. But how does the number change with distance per unit range? That would be the derivative, which is 5 r^4, so the change is proportional to r^4.

So the correct option would be C) ~ r^4.


The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), substituting this into the relation gives \( N \propto r^5 \). 

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). This refers to the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which represents the rate of change of the number of stars per unit distance. Taking the derivative of \( N \propto r^5 \), we find:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4
\]

Thus, the number of stars changes with distance per unit range as \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**C) ~ \( r^4 \)**.

Answer: C
