Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two parts and asks for the suitable reagents A and B. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is taking 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and treating it with reagent B (which is H2O) to get 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So, the options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible A and B reagents. Let me think step by step.

First reaction: butan-2-one (which is methylacetone, I think) reacting with NaCN and reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When you add NaCN, I'm pretty sure that's a nucleophilic substitution. But wait, ketones typically don't do SN2 easily. Oh wait, maybe it's a substitution under certain conditions. Alternatively, could this be an example of the Stephen reduction or something else? No, wait, wait. Another possibility is that NaCN is acting as a nucleophile in a ketone. Oh wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group.

Wait, ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. So, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When a nucleophile like CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, it would form a cyanohydrin. The product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Let me check the product given: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no, wait. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw it.

Butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CN, but the substituents are on the second carbon. So the structure is CH(CH2CH3)(OH)CN? Wait, no, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. After adding NaCN, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So that's 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile? Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating the structure.

Wait, perhaps butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is the same as methylacetone. When it reacts with NaCN, which is a source of CN-, the nucleophilic attack would occur on the carbonyl carbon, adding CN- and OH- as the leaving group? No, wait, the addition would form a cyanohydrin. The product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But wait, the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile on C4. Wait, but the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that's a four-carbon chain with hydroxyl and methyl groups on carbon 2 and a nitrile on carbon 4? That doesn't make sense because butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, so the nitrile is at the end.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- gives (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. But the product is butanenitrile, which is four carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Oh, wait, maybe the starting ketone is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)COCH2CH3? No, wait, butan-2-one is (CH2)2CO in the middle. So structure is CH2CH2 with the ketone in the middle. Wait, no, butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3? No, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. Wait, no, acetone is propan-2-one. Butan-2-one would be pentan-2-one? No, no, wait. Butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3? No, wait, butanone is four carbons with the ketone on C2. So the structure is CH2CH2COCH3? No, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CHCO? No, wait, butan-2-one is (CH2)2CO. So it's CH2CH2 with the CO group on C2. So structure is CH2-CO-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, butan-2-one would be (CH2CH3)COCH3? No, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3. So, more accurately, it's CH2CH2COCH3? No, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Wait, no, butan-2-one is (CH2CH2)CO. Hmm. Maybe it's better to think that butan-2-one is methylacetone. So, the structure is (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. Wait, that's propan-2-one, not butan. So perhaps butan-2-one is (CH2CH2)CO? Wait, perhaps butan-2-one has four carbons. So structure is CH2CH2COCH3? No, that would be 3-pentanone. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH2)2CO, so the four carbons are CH2COCH2CH3. So, structure is CH2CH2COCH3. Wait, that's correct because butan-2-one has four carbons with the ketone
