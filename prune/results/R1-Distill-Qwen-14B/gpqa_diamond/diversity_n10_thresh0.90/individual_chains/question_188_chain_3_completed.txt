Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral... I remember that's one of the seven crystal systems. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. 

The given data is the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. Wait, interatomic distance—oh right, that's the distance between atoms in the crystal structure. In a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters are a, b, c, but wait, no, in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and all angles are the same. So the lattice is cubic in a way but with all sides equal and angles equal but not necessarily 90 degrees.

Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance d for a plane (hkl) is given by the formula:

d = a/(√(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ)^(1/2)) )

Wait, but wait, in a cubic system, the formula simplifies because the angles are 90 degrees. But here, it's a rhombohedral, so the angles are 30 degrees each. 

But wait, in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are equal, so α = β = γ = 30°, which is less than 90°, so the lattice is not cubic but rhombohedral. 

So the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal system is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / [ (h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ )^(1/2) ) ] × ( 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ )) )

Wait, no, the formula is more like:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha) } } 

But wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think. The general formula for d is derived from the Miller indices hkl and the lattice parameters. For a general crystal system, especially when the angles are not 90 degrees, the formula becomes more complicated. 

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² + k² + l² - 2hk \cos α - 2hl \cos β - 2kl \cos γ }}

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the denominator is the square root of that expression. Let me make sure. 

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance formula for any crystal system is given by:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2hk \cos \alpha - 2hl \cos \beta - 2kl \cos \gamma ) } }

But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because in the formula for interplanar distance, the denominator is the square root of the sum of squares minus twice the products times cosines of the angles between the lattice vectors.

Wait, perhaps I should write the formula correctly. Let me recall, in the context of crystal planes, the interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2hk \cos \gamma - 2hl \cos \beta - 2kl \cos \alpha } }

Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up about the angles. In the rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors are a, a, a, but the angles between them are 30 degrees each. Wait, in rhombohedral, the vectors a, b, c are all equal in length, and the angles between each pair are the same. So, for the angles, between a and b is α, a and c is β, and b and c is γ. So all three angles are 30 degrees.

So, for the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1.

So plugging into the formula, the denominator becomes sqrt(1 +1 +1 - 2*(1*1 cos α) - 2*(1*1 cos β) - 2*(1*1 cos γ)).

Wait, but wait: the formula I think is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h² + k² + l² - 2hk \cos \gamma - 2hl \cos \beta - 2kl \cos \alpha} }

Wait, but I'm getting confused again. Let me look for the correct formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2hk \cos α - 2hl \cos β - 2kl \cos γ } }

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of the case when the angles are 90 degrees. Then cos α, cos β, cos γ are all zero. The formula simplifies to d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²), which is correct for cubic systems.

In this case, all angles are 30°, so cos α = cos β = cos γ = cos(30°) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, is α, β, γ the angles between the a, b, c vectors? Yes.

So, in this problem, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait. Wait, in a crystal, the interatomic distance can depend on the structure. For example, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a√2 (for diagonal), but wait, no, in a simple cubic, the atoms are at each corner. So the nearest neighbor distance would be along the edge, which is a, but wait, no, in a simple cubic structure, each atom is only in contact along the edges. So the nearest neighbor distance is a.

Wait, but wait, the interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms. For a simple cubic structure, the atoms are at each lattice point. So the nearest neighbors are along the edges, so interatomic distance is a.

Wait, but in a face-centered cubic or body-centered cubic, the nearest neighbor distance is a√2/2 (for fcc) or a√3/3 (for bcc), but in simple cubic, it's a.

But wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance would be more complicated, depending on the vectors.

Wait, but the problem says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. So perhaps in this case, the lattice parameter a is 10 Angstroms?

Wait, wait, not necessarily. Because in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor might not be along the a, b, or c vectors. Let me think. For example, in a face-centered cubic (which is a special case of cubic), the nearest neighbor is along the face diagonal, which is a√2/2. But wait, in simple cubic, it's along the edge.

Wait, but perhaps the interatomic distance in a rhombohedral crystal is given by the distance between two nearest atoms, and perhaps in this case, it's the same as the lattice parameter a. But I'm not so sure. Alternatively, perhaps the lattice parameter a is the distance between the atoms, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter a. Because in simple cubic, the interatomic distance is a, and the formula for d is a / sqrt(...). So perhaps in this problem, a is 10 Angstroms.

Wait, the problem says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. So I think that a is 10 Angstroms. Because in simple cubic, a is the interatomic distance. But in a more complex structure, it might vary.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance. For example, in a face-centered cubic, the nearest distance is a√2 / 2, but the lattice parameter a is the edge length.

But in this case, the problem states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and the angles are 30 degrees. So perhaps a is 10 Angstroms, or perhaps the interatomic distance is derived from a. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the rhombohedral structure is such that the nearest neighbors are along the a, b, or c vectors. Because in a simple cubic, the nearest distance is a, which is the same as the lattice parameter. But in a rhombohedral system, the nearest neighbor might be along a different direction. So perhaps the lattice parameter a is not the interatomic distance.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. The question says, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. So perhaps a is not 10, but the nearest neighbor distance is 10, which is a function of a and the angles.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a primitive cell, so the nearest neighbor distance can be determined from the vectors. Let's say the lattice vectors are a, a, a, but the angles between them are 30°. Hmm, perhaps the nearest neighbor is the minimal distance between any two lattice points, which would be the minimal vector in the lattice.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance corresponds to the minimal vector in the lattice, which could be along [111], but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps to find a, the lattice parameter, from the given interatomic distance. Let me think. Suppose the interatomic distance is the distance between nearest neighbors, which in rhombohedral may involve vectors beyond a.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the minimal distance between any two points in the lattice. For example, the minimal distance could be along (111), but that's not necessarily right.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter a. I think that's a safe assumption unless told otherwise. So I'll proceed under that assumption.

So assuming a = 10 Angstroms.

Now, the plane is (111). So h=1, k=1, l=1.

Plugging into the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) - 2*(1)(1) cos α - 2*(1)(1) cos β - 2*(1)(1) cos γ )

But all α, β, γ are 30 degrees, so cos 30 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So let's compute the denominator.

First, calculate the numerator: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Then, the terms with cos: 2*(1)(1) cos α for each pair.

But wait, the formula has terms subtracting 2hk cos α, 2hl cos β, 2kl cos gamma.

Wait, the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ )

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos gamma )

Wait, but I'm not certain. Another thought: perhaps the correct formula for the interplanar distance when the crystal system is rhombohedral (i.e., a=b=c, α=β=γ) is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, because all the angles are the same, so α=β=γ=30°. So the denominator becomes:

sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos alpha - 2kl cos alpha )

Which simplifies to sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

So for (111), h=k=l=1.

So denominator becomes sqrt( 3 - 2(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) * cos 30° )

Which is sqrt( 3 - 2*(3)* (sqrt(3)/2) )

Simplify inside:

3 - 2 *3 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 3 - 3*sqrt(3)

So 3 - 3*1.732 ≈ 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Wait that can't be right. Because the square root of a negative number is not real.

Hmm, that suggests I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I mixed up the angles in the formula. Maybe the angles are between the reciprocal lattice vectors, or perhaps the formula uses the angles between the lattice vectors differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos gamma )

Wait, but then for cubic system where angles are 90°, the cos terms would be zero, and it would reduce to a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²), which is correct.

But wait, wait, when the lattice is cubic, the angle is 90°, so cos 90° = 0, and the formula becomes a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² ), which is correct.

So if the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos gamma )

But then, with angles less than 90°, the cos would be positive, adding to the denominator, making d smaller. Wait, but in this case, the angles are 30°, which are less than 90°, so their cos is positive, so the denominator would be bigger than in a cubic case.

Wait, but in our problem, when I plug in the angles as 30°, I'm getting a negative under the square root, which isn't possible. So perhaps I missed a negative sign in the formula.

Ah, I think I remember now. The correct formula is:

d = (1) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos alpha) )

But wait, no. Another thought: perhaps the formula is written as:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma) )

Wait, but that would mean that the denominator is 3 - 2*(3 * cos 30°) as before, which gives a negative value.

Wait, but that can't be right. So perhaps I have the formula wrong. Maybe the formula uses the angles between the reciprocal lattice vectors instead. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2hk (cos α) - 2hl (cos β) - 2kl (cos gamma) )

Wait, but that's the same as before. Hmm.

Wait, but if the denominator becomes negative, that implies that there's no such plane, which can't be the case because the question is giving it as an option.

So perhaps the formula is written differently. Another approach: perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2hk cos alpha + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos gamma )

Wait, but in the case of a cubic system, that would be a / sqrt( sum + 2hk 0 + 2hl 0 + 2kl 0 ), so a / sqrt( sum ), which is correct.

So let's try that.

So denominator is sqrt(3 + 2*(1*1 * cos 30° + 1*1 * cos 30° + 1*1 * cos 30° )) )

Which is sqrt(3 + 2*(3 * (sqrt(3)/2 )) )

Simplify inside:

3 + 2*(3 * 0.8660) = 3 + 6 * 0.8660 ≈ 3 + 5.196 ≈ 8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.864.

So d = a / 2.864.

If a is 10 Angstroms, then d ≈ 10 / 2.864 ≈ 3.49 Angstroms, but that's not any of the options. The options are around 9-10 Angstroms. So this can't be right.

Hmm, so perhaps my formula is incorrect. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another possible formula I found is:

d = (a) / (sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos alpha) )) )

Wait, let's recompute this denominator with that, but perhaps I inverted the sign.

With a=10, angles 30°, hkl=111.

Denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 2*(3 * (sqrt(3)/2 )) )

Which is sqrt(3 - 3*sqrt(3)).

Compute 3*sqrt(3) ≈ 5.196, so 3 - 5.196 = -2.196. So sqrt of negative is not possible.

Hmm, that's impossible, which suggests that the formula is wrong, or perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the dot product of the reciprocal lattice vectors. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / ( sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos gamma ) )

Wait, if that's the case, then the denominator is sqrt(3 - 2*(3 * (sqrt(3)/2 )) )

Which is the same as before, giving a negative number. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the angle definitions. Oh wait, in crystallography, the angles in the lattice are sometimes defined as the angles between the vectors a, b, c. So the angle between a and b is α, a and c is β, and b and c is γ. So in rhombohedral, all three are equal to 30 degrees.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = [1 / (h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos beta - 2kl cos gamma )^(1/2) ] * (a, b, c) ?

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is more complex. Another approach: perhaps I should look for the formula for interplanar spacing in rhombohedral systems.

Upon recalling, the formula for a rhombohedral system (where a = b = c = a0, and all angles equal to θ) is:

d_{hkl} = a0 / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

Wait, but if that's the case, then for (111), h=k=l=1, so:

Denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 2(3) cos θ )

Which is sqrt(3 -6 * cos 30° )

Which is sqrt(3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2 )) = sqrt(3 - 3*sqrt(3)).

Again, same problem, as 3 - 3*1.732 = negative.

Hmm, that's not possible. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the formula actually has a plus instead of a minus. Let me try:

d = a / sqrt(3 + 6 * cos(theta) )

So theta = 30°, cos(theta) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So 3 + 6 * 0.866 ≈ 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

Square root of 8.196 is approx 2.864.

So d = 10 / 2.864 ≈ 3.49 Angstroms. But that's not one of the options.

But the options are around 9-10. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is not a, but rather the distance between nearest atoms in the lattice, which might not be a. So perhaps a is different.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is a function of a and the angles. For example, the nearest neighbor distance in a rhombohedral structure could be a multiplied by some function of the angles.

Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor is along the a vector, so the distance is a. But in a rhombohedral structure, if the atoms are at the corners and the structure is primitive, perhaps the nearest neighbors are along a combination of vectors.

Wait, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance can be found using the distance between two adjacent lattice points. So, for example, the vector (1,0,0) is a, (0,1,0) is b, etc. So the distance between (0,0,0) and (1,1,0) would be sqrt( (a)^2 + (b)^2 + 2ab cos gamma ), where gamma is the angle between a and b. But in rhombohedral, a = b = c, and gamma = 30°, so that distance is sqrt( a² + a² + 2a² cos 30° ) = a * sqrt(2 + 2*sqrt(3)/2 ) = a * sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)).

But wait, wait, that's the distance between (0,0,0) and (1,1,0). But in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the nearest neighbor is along (1,0,0), which is a distance a. But wait, perhaps the structure is such that the nearest neighbor is along a different direction.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance given (10 Angstroms) is the distance between two nearest atoms, which may not be along a single a vector. So, perhaps the interatomic distance is not a but some combination of a and the angles.

Hmm, perhaps the nearest neighbor direction is along (1,1,1), which would have a distance of sqrt( (a)^2 + (a)^2 + (a)^2 + 2a*a cos 30° (for each pair) ) Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the distance between (0,0,0) and (1,1,1) is:

sqrt( (1)^2 a² + (1)^2 a² + (1)^2 a² + 2*(1)(1)*a*a cos 30° (for each pair) )

Wait, no, the correct formula for the distance between two points in a rhombohedral lattice is more involved. Each lattice vector contributes, and the angles between them come into play.

Wait, the distance between points (h1, k1, l1) and (h2, k2, l2) in a rhombohedral lattice is given by:

d² = (h2 - h1)^2 a² + (k2 - k1)^2 b² + (l2 - l1)^2 c² + 2*(h2 - h1)(k2 - k1)ab cos gamma + 2*(h2 - h1)(l2 - l1)ac cos beta + 2*(k2 -k1)(l2 - l1) bc cos alpha )

In our case, for the nearest neighbor, the change in indices is (1,0,0), (0,1,0), etc., but perhaps the minimal distance is along (1,1,0), or another direction.

Wait, but if a = b = c = a0, then the formula simplifies.

d² = (Δh² + Δk² + Δl²) a0² + 2 (Δh Δk + Δh Δl + Δk Δl) a0² cos 30° )

Because alpha = beta = gamma =30°, and a=b=c= a0.

So for the nearest neighbor, which minimal indices change?

If the minimal is along (1,0,0), then d² = a0², d = a0.

But perhaps the nearest neighbor is in a different direction. Let's try (1,1,0):

Δh=1, Δk=1, Δl=0.

d² = (1 +1 +0) a0² + 2*(1*1 +1*0 +1*0) a0² cos 30°.

So d² = 2 a0² + 2*(1) a0² * (sqrt(3)/2 ) = 2 a0² + sqrt(3) a0².

Which is a0² (2 + 1.732) = a0² * 3.732.

So d = a0 * sqrt(3.732) ≈ a0 * 1.931.

Which would be larger than a0, so perhaps the nearest neighbor is along (1,0,0), giving d = a0.

Thus, if the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, then a0 is 10 Angstroms.

But why then, when I tried this, the (111) plane's interplanar distance came out to be around 3.49 Angstroms, which is not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Another thought: perhaps the interatomic distance is not the same as a. Maybe the interatomic distance is the distance between nearest neighbors, which might not lie along the a, b, or c vectors.

Wait, for a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor's position is at (1,1,0), (1,0,1), or (0,1,1), which would have a distance of sqrt(2 + 2 cos theta), where theta is 30 degrees.

Wait, for example, the distance between (0,0,0) and (1,1,0) is:

sqrt( (1)^2 a^2 + (1)^2 a^2 + 2 * 1 * 1 * a^2 cos alpha )

Since alpha is the angle between a and b, which is 30 degrees.

So that's sqrt( a² + a² + 2 a² cos 30° )

= a * sqrt( 2 + 2 * sqrt(3)/2 )

= a * sqrt( 2 + sqrt(3) )

= a * sqrt( approx 3.732 )

= a * 1.931.

So if the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, then 1.931 a = 10.

So a = 10 / 1.931 ≈ 5.175 Angstroms.

Ah, that makes sense. So the interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance, which is along (1,1,0) in this case, leading to a being about 5.175 Angstroms.

So, now, we need to find d for (111) plane.

So using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 hk cos alpha - 2 hl cos beta - 2 kl cos gamma )

Wait, but with the correct a now. Let me recompute.

Wait, but given that h=1, k=1, l=1.

So denominator:

sqrt( 1 +1 +1 - 2*(1)(1) cos 30° - 2*(1)(1) cos 30° - 2*(1)(1) cos 30° )

Which is sqrt(3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2) )

Because cos 30° is sqrt(3)/2, and each term is 2*1*1 * cos 30°, and there are three such terms (hk, hl, kl).

So denominator: sqrt(3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2) ) = sqrt(3 - 3*sqrt(3)).

But again, this is sqrt(negative), which isn't possible. So something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula should have a plus instead of a minus.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2 hk cos alpha + 2 hl cos beta + 2 kl cos gamma )

So, with the plus signs. Let's compute.

Denominator for (111) becomes sqrt( 3 + 6 * (sqrt(3)/2) )

Which is sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3) ) ≈ sqrt(3 + 5.196) = sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.864.

So, d = a / 2.864.

But a is 5.175 Angstroms.

So, d = 5.175 / 2.864 ≈ 1.807 Angstroms. Not matching the options.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula can be written in terms of the unit cell volume or reciprocal vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance can be found using the relation between the unit cell parameters and the reciprocal lattice.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the plane's normal vector. The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (1/a)(2pi) * (1, 0, 0) / (1 - cos^2 alpha - cos^2 beta ... )

Wait, perhaps another approach: in a rhombohedral system, all a, b, c are equal, and all angles are same θ. The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (1/a)(1, 1, 1) / (sqrt(1 + 2 cos theta) )

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the reciprocal lattice for rhombohedral can be determined by the formula:

The reciprocal of the metric tensor.

The metric tensor for a rhombohedral system is:

[ a²      a² cos gamma  a² cos beta ]

[ a² cos gamma   a²      a² cos alpha ]

[ a² cos beta    a² cos alpha   a² ]

But since alpha=beta=gamma=30°, it becomes:

[ a²      a² cos 30°   a² cos 30° ]

[ a² cos30°   a²      a² cos30° ]

[ a² cos30°  a² cos30°   a² ]

The reciprocal (inverse) of the metric tensor gives the reciprocal lattice vectors.

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for d in terms of the volume.

The volume of the unit cell, V = a^3 * sqrt(1 + 2 cos alpha + 2 cos beta + 2 cos gamma - cos^2 alpha - cos^2 beta - cos^2 gamma )

Wait, for rhombohedral, since all angles are same, this simplifies.

V = a³ * sqrt(1 + 6 cos theta - 3 cos² theta )

Where theta is 30°.

So cos theta = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So V = a³ * sqrt( 1 + 6*(0.866) - 3*(0.866)^2 )

Compute inside sqrt:

1 + 5.196 - 3*(0.75) = 1 +5.196 - 2.25 = (1+5.196) is 6.196, minus 2.25 is 3.946.

So sqrt(3.946) ≈ 1.9865.

Thus, V = a³ * 1.9865.

But I'm not sure how this helps me find the interplanar distance.

Wait, another formula: the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by:

d = (1/ sqrt( (h b1)^2 + (k b2)^2 + (l b3)^2 )) )

Where b1, b2, b3 are the reciprocal lattice vectors. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the formula for d in terms of a and the angles.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²) / a² - 2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) / a².

So,

d² = 1 / [ (h² + k² + l²) - 2 (hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) ) / a² ]

Wait, that would make d = a / sqrt( denominator )

Which brings me back to the previous formula.

But earlier, that gave me a negative denominator, which is impossible. So perhaps the formula is incorrect or I have the wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the reciprocal of the metric tensor to find the reciprocal lattice vectors, then find the magnitude of the reciprocal vector for (111), and then take the reciprocal of that magnitude to get d.

So, the metric tensor G is:

G = [ a², a² cos gamma, a² cos beta;

      a² cos gamma, a², a² cos alpha;

      a² cos beta, a² cos alpha, a² ]

But for rhombohedral, all angles are 30°, so:

G = [ a², a² * cos30, a² * cos30;

      a² * cos30, a², a² * cos30;

      a² * cos30, a² * cos30, a² ]

So,

G11 = a²,

G12 = a² * cos30,

G13 = a² * cos30,

G21 = a² * cos30,

G22 = a²,

G23 = a² * cos30,

G31 = a² * cos30,

G32 = a² * cos30,

G33 = a².

The reciprocal metric tensor, G*, is the inverse of G.

The reciprocal vectors b1, b2, b3 can be found from G* as follows:

b1 = (G*11, G*12, G*13) / (2π),

and similarly for b2 and b3.

But perhaps I can compute the determinant of G to find the inverse.

The determinant of G for a rhombohedral system is:

det(G) = a^6 [ 1 + 2 cos30 (cos30 + 1) ]

Wait, perhaps another approach: the inverse of G is given by (1/det(G)) * adjugate(G).

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the inverse directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the reciprocal of the (111) plane's metric.

Wait, the plane (hkl) has a reciprocal vector (h,k,l) in the reciprocal lattice. The magnitude of this reciprocal vector is 1/d.

So, the magnitude squared of the reciprocal vector is:

h² G11* + k² G22* + l² G33* + 2hk G12* + 2hl G13* + 2kl G23*,

where G** is the reciprocal metric tensor.

But I'm not confident about this approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the reciprocal lattice vectors for (111) and compute their magnitude.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

With theta = 30 degrees.

So for (111), h=k=l=1.

Denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 6 cos 30° )

Which is sqrt(3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2) ) = sqrt(3 - 3*sqrt(3)).

But 3*sqrt(3) is about 5.196, so 3 -5.196 = -2.196. So the sqrt is imaginary. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula, or perhaps I have the wrong a value.

Wait, earlier I considered that interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. But perhaps a is the interatomic distance. Let's proceed with that.

So a=10.

Wait, but then the denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 6*(0.866)) = sqrt(3 -5.196) = sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible.

So, perhaps there's a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is wrong. I think I must have made a mistake in the formula. Let me look for the correct formula for interplanar distance in rhombohedral systems.

After a quick search in my memory, the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

But this leads to the same problem.

Wait, but given that the problem is multiple-choice and the options are around 9-10, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the reciprocal.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2 (hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) )

But in this case, the denominator is 3 - 2*( 3*(sqrt(3)/2)) ) = 3 - 3*sqrt(3) ≈ 3 -5.196 =-2.196. So that's impossible.

Wait, but perhaps the formula is actually:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l² ) + 2 (hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) )

In that case, denominator is 3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3) ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

So d = 10 / sqrt(8.196) ≈10 / 2.864≈3.49 Angstroms. Not matching the options.

Hmm. I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem. Maybe I'm confusing the angles. Let me think: in the metric tensor for rhombohedral, the angles between a, b, and c are gamma, alpha, beta respectively. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the angles wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles used in the formula are the angles between the reciprocal vectors. So the angles between the reciprocal vectors are 180-30=150 degrees. Then, cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2 ≈-0.866.

So, if I take cos as negative, then let's compute the denominator.

Denominator: 3 - 2*(3 * (-0.866) ) = 3 - 2*(-2.598) =3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)≈2.864.

So d = a/2.864. If a=10, d≈3.49 Angstroms. Still not matching options.

Hmm, but the options are around 9-10. So perhaps a is much larger.

Wait, earlier I thought that perhaps the interatomic distance (10) is not a, but a*sqrt(2 + 2 cos theta), which is a*sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)).

So interatomic distance, d_ia = a * sqrt( 2 + sqrt(3) )

If d_ia is 10, then a=10 / sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)).

Compute sqrt(2 + sqrt(3)):

sqrt(3)≈1.732, so 2+1.732=3.732, sqrt(3.732)=1.931.

So a = 10 / 1.931 ≈5.175 Angstroms.

Now, compute the denominator for (111) plane:

d = a / sqrt(3 -6 * cos 30° )

Wait, 3 -6*(sqrt(3)/2)=3-3*sqrt(3)=3-5.196= -2.196. Impossible.

Hmm, perhaps the correct formula uses the reciprocal angles, as I thought earlier. If the angles are 150°, their cos is negative.

So denominator: sqrt(3 + 6*0.866 )=sqrt(8.196)=2.864.

So d = a / 2.864 =5.175 /2.864≈1.807 Angstroms. Not matching options.

Wait, but perhaps I'm using the wrong a. If I take a=10, and the formula is:

d= a / sqrt(3 + 6 cos 30° )

Which gives 10 / sqrt(8.196)=10/2.864≈3.49 Angstroms. Still doesn't match options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is actually the reciprocal—so denominator is (h² +k² + l²) + 2 hk cos alpha + ... ?

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) )

Which, for (111), gives denominator sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2 ))=sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3))≈sqrt(8.196)=2.864.

So d= a/2.864=10/2.864≈3.49. No.

I'm stuck. Let's think differently. Perhaps the formula uses the volume.

The volume V = a³ * sqrt(1 + 2 cos alpha + 2 cos beta + 2 cos gamma - cos^2 alpha - cos^2 beta - cos^2 gamma )

For alpha=beta=gamma=30°, cos 30= sqrt(3)/2.

So,

V = a³ * sqrt( 1 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) - 3*( (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) )

= a³ * sqrt(1 + 3*sqrt(3) - 3*(3/4) )

= a³ * sqrt(1 + 5.196 - 2.25 )

= a³ * sqrt(3.946 )

≈ a³ * 1.9865.

Now, another formula for the interplanar distance is d = a / ( sqrt( ... )) as before, but perhaps the volume can be used to compute something else.

Alternatively, maybe the interplanar distance can be found using:

d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) ) / ( sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta ) )

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance formula is:

d = (a) / (sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos theta ) )

Which, for (111), gives 10 / sqrt(3 +6 * (0.866)) )= 10 / sqrt(8.196)≈3.49. Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to see if any of the options when inverted and squared would give a plausible denominator.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option C is 9.54 Angstroms.

So 9.54 ≈ d.

So d ≈9.54.

Then, 1/d ≈0.1048.

If d= a / sqrt( denominator ), then 1/d² = (denominator ) / a².

So denominator = a² * (1/d)^2.

So denominator for (111) is a² * (1/9.54)^2.

But earlier, when a=10, denominator was sqrt( ... )=3.49, which is not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the denominator, when a=10, is 10² / (9.54)^2 ≈ (100)/(91)≈1.098.

So denominator^2 is around 1.098, making denominator ≈1.048.

So, denominator =1.048.

Which implies that 3 + 6 cos(30) ≈ (denominator)^2 =1.098.

Wait, but 3+6*(sqrt(3)/2)=3+5.196=8.196.

Which is way larger than 1.098.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is 1.048, which would mean that:

3 -6 cos(30) = (denominator)^2 =1.098.

3 -6*(sqrt(3)/2) =3 -5.196= -2.196. No.

Hmm. I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should look for the correct formula elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = (1) / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2 (hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) )

But then, the units wouldn't make sense unless a is accounted for. Alternatively, perhaps I should forget trying to find the formula and use the given options to reverse-engineer.

Wait, but the options are all around 9-10, which is close to a=10. So perhaps the interplanar distance d is approximately a / something small.

Wait, if a=10, and d is around 9.54, which is option C, then the denominator would be a / d ≈10 /9.54≈1.048.

So (h² +k² + l² ) - 2*(hk cos α + ... ) ≈ (1.048 )^2 ≈1.098.

So, 3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2) =3 -5.196= -2.196.

Which doesn't match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the reciprocal angles, as earlier. So cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2.

So denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) )=sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.864.

So d= a /2.864=10/2.864≈3.49, but that's not an option.

Wait, but none of this is making sense. Maybe I'm fundamentally misunderstanding the formula. Perhaps I should try to find a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance is computed using the volume and the plane indices.

The formula for d is:

d = (V)^(1/3) / ( sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2 (hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) ) )

But V is the unit cell volume.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is given by:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2 (hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) )

Which for (111) would give 10 / sqrt(3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2) )=10/sqrt(8.196)≈3.49.

No, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

But that leads to the same value.

Hmm.

I think I'm going in circles. Maybe I should make an educated guess. The options are around 9-10. If a is 10, and the formula gives a denominator that's about 1, then d would be 10.

But if the denominator is sqrt( something like 1.0 ), then d=10.

Looking at the options, D is 10.05, which is close to 10. But why would the denominator be around 1?

Denominator sqrt(3 + 6 * (something)) would be more than sqrt(3)=1.732. So to get d=10, denominator must be 1, which is impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps a is not 10, but a is something else. If a is 10, and the formula gives d=10, then the denominator must be 1.

So,

3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) =1 →3 + 5.196=1 →8.196=1 →No.

So that can't be.

I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a guess. Since the options are around 9-10, and the interatomic distance is 10, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 9.54 Angstroms.


To determine the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for interplanar distance is:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2hk \cos \alpha - 2hl \cos \beta - 2kl \cos \gamma}}
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Identify the plane indices**: For the (111) plane, \( h = 1 \), \( k = 1 \), and \( l = 1 \).
2. **Substitute the values**:
   - \( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3 \),
   - \( \cos 30^\circ = \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.866 \),
   - The denominator becomes:
     \[
     \sqrt{3 - 2(1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 30^\circ + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 30^\circ + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 30^\circ)}
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     \sqrt{3 - 6 \cdot 0.866} = \sqrt{3 - 5.196} = \sqrt{-2.196}
     \]
     This result is imaginary, indicating a mistake in the formula or assumptions.

3. **Re-evaluate the formula**:
   - If the formula uses a **plus** sign instead of a **minus** sign in the denominator:
     \[
     \sqrt{3 + 6 \cdot 0.866} = \sqrt{3 + 5.196} = \sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.864
     \]
     Then:
     \[
     d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{\text{denominator}}} = \frac{10}{2.864} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
     \]
     This value does not match the given options.

4. **Consider alternative interpretations**:
   - If the interatomic distance is not \( a \), but the nearest neighbor distance is \( 10 \, \text{Å} \), then \( a \) must be recalculated. For example, if the nearest neighbor distance is along \( (1,1,0) \), the lattice parameter \( a \) can be derived as:
     \[
     a = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2 + 2 \cos 30^\circ}} \approx 5.175 \, \text{Å}
     \]
   - Substituting \( a = 5.175 \, \text{Å} \) into the formula again leads to inconsistencies with the options provided.

5. **Match the options**:
   - The options suggest \( d \approx 9.54 \, \text{Å} \), which is close to the interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \). This implies the formula or assumptions about the relationship between \( a \) and the interatomic distance may need adjustment.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity of the problem and the mismatch between the calculated values and the options, the most plausible answer based on the provided choices is:

**Answer: C**
