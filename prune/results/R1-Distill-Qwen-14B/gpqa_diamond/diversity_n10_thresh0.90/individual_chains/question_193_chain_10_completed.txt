Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, like 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars in that region changes with distance, per unit range of distance.

Hmm. I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. The formula I think is distance (d) in parsecs is equal to 1 divided by parallax, so d = 1/plx. Oh right, that's the basic relationship. So higher parallax means closer distance because if plx is 1 parsec, distance is 1, but if plx is 0.5, distance is 2 parsecs.

So the number of stars (let's call it N) varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, I think. Let me see: plx = 1/d, so 1/plx is d. So 1/(plx)^5 becomes (d)^5. Wait, no, because plx is 1/d, so plx^5 is (1/d)^5, which is 1/d^5. So 1/(plx^5) is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, so it's the differential number of stars per unit distance. Hmm. So maybe I need to think in terms of how N changes as r (distance) increases. Or perhaps the question is about the density, like the number per unit distance.

Wait, perhaps I should model this. Let me think about it.

If N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and plx = 1/d, then N ∝ d^5. So as d increases, N increases as d^5. But wait, that seems counterintuitive. Because when you look further away, you can see more stars? No, wait, maybe not, because the density of stars might change. Hmm, but the question says that in a specific region, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So that might imply that the number of stars at a certain distance is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So maybe it's about the number per unit volume or per unit distance shell.

Wait, let's think in terms of distance. Let's say I have a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr. The number of stars in that shell would depend on the density and the volume of the shell.

The volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πd² dr. But wait, wait, the question is about a region of the sky, which I think is a specific direction, so perhaps it's a 1D case rather than 3D. Wait, no, probably not. Let me think again.

In astronomy, when you count stars in a direction, you're looking along a line of sight. But the problem says "region of the sky", so perhaps it's a 2D area but at varying distances. So the number of stars in a certain direction at a distance d is given by N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 = d^5.

Wait, that's per unit area? Or per steradian? Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about it differently.

If N is proportional to d^5, then per unit distance, the number increases by d^5. But wait, that can't be right because as d increases, the number of stars would be increasing a lot, but in reality, the density of stars might decrease with distance. But wait, the question is about how the number varies with distance. So perhaps the number of stars increases as the fifth power of the distance.

Wait, but the question is about the change per unit range of distance. So maybe it's about the derivative of N with respect to d. Oh, because if N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr is proportional to 5d^4. So the number per unit distance would increase with d^4. But wait, why would that be the case?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the substitution. Wait, N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, so 1/plx = d, so 1/plx^5 = d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, if the number of stars is increasing with d^5, that suggests that as you look further away (higher d), the number of stars you see increases rapidly. But that doesn't make sense because as you go further, each shell has more volume, but perhaps the number density (stars per unit volume) is changing in a way that makes the total number in a shell increase with d^5.

Wait, but perhaps the question is about the number per unit distance, not per unit volume. Hmm. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number per unit distance (dN/dr) would be 5 d^4. But the options don't have a 5, but option C is r^4, so that would match.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number per unit distance, not the total number. Wait, no, the question says 'the number of stars in that region of the sky' varies as 1/plx^5. So perhaps N is in a shell of thickness dr at distance d, so N ∝ d^5 * dr. So the number per unit distance is N/dr ∝ d^5. But then the options don't have d^5 as an answer. The options are about dependence on r, not d. So perhaps r is the distance.

Wait, the options are about how the number changes with distance r. So if N ∝ r^5, then the number increases rapidly with distance. But that seems a bit odd, because if you go further away, the number of stars you can see in a region might decrease because they are more spread out, but this scenario says it's increasing. But the problem states the variation, so I have to go with that.

Wait, but let's think in terms of how many stars are present in a region at distance r. If N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and plx = 1/r, then N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars in the region is proportional to r^5. So as r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5.

But the question is how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So perhaps it's the change in N with r. So the rate of change of N with r is dN/dr. If N = k r^5, then dN/dr = 5k r^4. So the change in number per unit distance is proportional to r^4. So the number of stars increases by r^4 per unit distance.

Wait, but the options are about the number of stars (the function) changing with r. So if N ∝ r^5, then the answer would be B) ~r^5. But the question is about the change per unit range of distance. So per unit increase in r, how does N change? That's the derivative, which would be proportional to r^4.

But looking at the options, option C is ~r^4.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Let me clarify the setup.

The problem states that the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So, N ∝ 1/plx^5.

Parallax plx is 1/d, so 1/plx = d. So 1/(plx)^5 = d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

So for a given region of the sky, as you go further (d increases), the number of stars increases with d^5.

But the question is, how does the number change with distance (per unit range). So perhaps it's the change in N with distance. So the rate of change is dN/dr = 5 d^4.

Which would imply that the number of stars per unit distance, or the derivative, is proportional to d^4. So when d is the distance, the change is ~d^4. So if the distance is r, then it's ~r^4.

So the correct answer would be option C, which says ~r^4.

Wait a minute, but I'm not sure because I'm a bit confused about whether it's the function N(r) or the derivative dN/dr. Let me re-express the problem.

If N is proportional to r^5, then when you consider a small change in r (dr), the change in N would be dN = 5 r^4 dr. So the number of stars per unit distance (dr) at distance r is proportional to r^4.

So the change per unit range (dr) is proportional to r^4. So the correct answer would be C: ~r^4.

Alternatively, if the question is only about N(r), then it's r^5 (option B), but the question says 'how the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)'.

So it's about the change per unit distance, which is the derivative, so ~r^4. Hence, the answer is C.


The problem states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( d \)) by \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), substituting this relationship gives \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the number of stars increases rapidly with distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). To determine this, we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which represents the rate of change of the number of stars per unit distance. If \( N \propto r^5 \), then:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4
\]

This shows that the change in the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( r^4 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
