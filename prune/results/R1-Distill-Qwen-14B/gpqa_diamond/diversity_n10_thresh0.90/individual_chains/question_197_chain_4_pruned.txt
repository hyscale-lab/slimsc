Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for a hydrolysis reaction, maybe cleavage of something like an ester or an acid chloride. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, when you have a nitrile group (a cyano group), reacting with HI and red phosphorus is the hydrolysis to form an amine. Or wait, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, that's for converting nitriles to amines. Alternatively, maybe it's for eliminating a group, like in the case of a bromide or something else. Hmm, let me think.

Wait, another reaction: when a compound has a leaving group like a tosylate or something, red phosphorus and HI might be used for dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think when you have a benzylic halide, like maybe a bromide or iodide attached to a benzene ring via a CH2 group, then treatment with red phosphorus and HI might lead to some kind of elimination or substitution. Or wait, maybe it's more about the cleavage of an ester into a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. Oh wait, no, esters under certain conditions might break down, but I'm not sure about this.

Alternatively, another thought: when you have a nitrile (like R-CN), treating with HI and red phosphorus converts it into an amine. So the reaction R-CN + HI, P → R-CH2-NH2. But wait, maybe I should think of the possible functional groups in the starting compound.

Let me look at the spectral data provided for Compound X.

The IR data is: 3400–2500 cm-1, which suggests an O-H stretch (like in a carboxylic acid, or an alcohol, or maybe an amine). Then 1720 cm-1 is indicative of a carbonyl group, perhaps a ketone or an ester or maybe an acid. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound has a benzene ring.

The 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is often an -OH proton. So maybe a carboxylic acid? Or maybe an aldehyde proton, but that's usually around 9-10 and more downfield, but a carboxylic acid would be around 10-12, and broad.

Wait, wait, another possibility: an acidic proton like in a phenol, but phenols usually have protons around 5-7 ppm. So 10.5 is more likely a carboxylic acid -OH, but wait, the IR at 1720 cm-1 could be a carbonyl. So if it's a carboxylic acid, then the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1, and the O-H at 3400-2500 (broad). So that fits.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That's probably a para-substituted benzene ring. The two doublets each integrating to 2H suggest that the substituents are in para positions. So for example, two substituents on the benzene ring in para positions, each causing the splitting into doublets. So maybe something like a 4-substituted benzene, with two substituents across from each other.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a multiplet, maybe a methylene group next to an oxygen or nitrogen, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps a CH group adjacent to some branching.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): might be a CH2 group near something. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a triplet of three protons, maybe a methyl group attached to something, like a CH(CH3) group. 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal methyl group, like CH2CH2CH3.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has a benzene ring with substituents, one being a -COOH group (from the IR and NMR), and another substituent with a chain.

Wait, let me think about the possible structures. The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So, looking at the options, A and C are benzoic acids, while B and D are substituted benzenes (probably toluene derivatives).

But wait, if the starting compound X is a benzoic acid, how does it react with red phosphorus and HI? That seems off because benzoic acid is pretty stable. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else, and the reaction produces a benzoic acid.

So, if X has a substituent that can be hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid, that might make sense. For example, maybe X is an ester: RCOOR'. Then, treating with HI and red phosphorus could lead to cleavage of the ester into RCOOH (acid) and R'OH.

Alternatively, another possibility is that X has a nitrile group: RCN. Then, reacting with HI and red phosphorus would convert the nitrile into an amine. But then, the product would be a benzene ring with an amine substituent.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, the multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H) could be adjacent to a carbonyl group, perhaps. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

The NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm: -COOH (maybe).

So, the benzene ring has a -COOH group. Then, another substituent which is a chain. Let's look for the substituent.

The 8.0 and 7.2 ppm are the aromatic protons. So, for a para-substituted ring, each pair of H would be as doublets.

Then, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group adjacent to another group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH2CH2CH3.

Putting that together, perhaps the substituent is a chain like CH(CH2CH2CH3)-something. Wait, perhaps it's a propyl chain attached in a branched way.

Wait, the substituent on the benzene could be a group like CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH? No, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a group like CH2CH2COOH, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows:

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): this is a terminal methyl group, so likely a CH2CH2CH3 group.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to a CH, perhaps as in a CH(CH3).

What about 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): maybe a CH2 between the benzene and the branching.

So putting it together, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3 group? Wait, but that would be a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is CH2CH
