Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product from the given options. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of esters, especially in a reaction called the phosphorous oxyacid reaction, where esters get converted into carboxylic acids. So I think Compound X is an ester because that's what usually reacts with red phosphorus and HI to form a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the IR data: The peaks are in the regions of 3400–2500, 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm^-1. I know that the strong peak around 1720 cm^-1 is indicative of a carbonyl group, likely from an ester or a ketone. But the region between 3400–2500 cm^-1 probably corresponds to O-H stretches. Wait, but esters don't have O-H groups. Oh wait, no, maybe it's from an alcohol, but that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid. Wait, but if we're reacting an ester, the IR of the starting material (Compound X) would have an ester carbonyl, which is around 1720. So in that case, the ester would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. But the O-H stretch is around 2500-3300 for acids, so maybe that's part of it. Or wait, maybe the 3400-2500 is a broad peak indicating an -OH group, like in an acid. Wait, the reaction is with HI and red phosphorus, which is a way to hydrolyze an ester to a carboxylic acid. So the product would be a carboxylic acid, so the IR of Compound X (the ester) would have 1720 for the ester carbonyl, but after reaction, the product would have O-H stretch around 2500-3300.

Wait, but the question is about the product. So if Compound X is an ester, the product would be a carboxylic acid. Let me check the options.

Options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene (which is cumene)

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So options C and A are acids, B and D are aromatic hydrocarbons (they end with benzene). So the reaction would produce a carboxylic acid if starting from an ester. So I think the answer is either A or C.

Looking at the NMR of Compound X. Let's parse it:

1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet at 10.5 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton. Wait, no, aldehydes are around 9-10, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad, but maybe in the NMR of the starting compound (the ester), the aldehyde might be present. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like from a carbonyl oxygen but I'm not sure. Wait, for an ester, the carbonyl is not directly attached to O-H, so perhaps that's a different group.

Wait, the peak at 10.5 is a broad singlet, which could be an -OH group, like in a phenol? But the ester would have oxygen but not necessarily an OH. Alternatively, if the starting material is an ester, then the 10.5 might not be from an OH but perhaps an aldehyde. Hm. Let me think.

Wait, the ester functional group doesn't have an OH, so that 10.5 peak might not be from that. Alternatively, could it be an aromatic proton near an electrondonating group? No, aromatic protons are usually around 7-8 ppm. Wait, perhaps it's an aldehyde proton.

Wait, but in Compound X, which is the ester, maybe there's an aldehyde group elsewhere. But aldehydes have protons around 9-10 ppm. So a singlet at 10.5 might be an aldehyde proton. Or maybe an acidic proton, like from a carboxylic acid, but then the starting material would be a carboxylic acid, which doesn't make sense because the reaction is a hydrolysis. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the product is the result of the reaction. So if Compound X is an ester, then the product would be a carboxylic acid. The product's structure is among the options. Let's think about the NMR of Compound X to figure out its structure.

Looking at the NMR:

- 10.5 ppm, broad singlet, 1H: Maybe an aldehyde proton.

- 8.0 ppm, doublet, 2H: Could be aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, two protons in a para position. Like in an ester where the aromatic ring is para-substituted.

- 7.2 ppm, doublet, 2H: Another set of aromatic protons. So maybe a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Or perhaps an ortho, meta, para situation.

Wait, in a para-substituted benzene ring, such as p-methyl, the protons would be as two doublets. If the substituent is in the para position, then the ring has two sets of protons: the ones ortho to the substituent would be deshielded and might appear as two doublets each integrating to 2H. So if the substituent is in the para position, and there are two more substituents perhaps, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the structure is a substituted benzene with an ester group. Let's think, the ester group would be something like R-O-CO-Ar, where Ar is an aromatic ring.

Looking at the NMR:

The 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm are two doublets, each 2H. So perhaps the aromatic ring has two substituents, each causing the splitting. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is in the para position, and the protons are the ortho and meta protons.

Wait, in a para-substituted benzene with an ester group, the ortho protons would be equivalent and would show as a doublet. Hmm.

Let me sketch a benzene ring with an ester group in the para position. So, the ester would be O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R'. Wait, perhaps the structure is something like a benzyl ester, like Ar-O-CO-R, where Ar is the substituted benzene.

So the aromatic protons would be in a para-substituted pattern.

In the NMR, the 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest that. So, two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So maybe the substituent is in the para position, making the adjacent (ortho) protons split into a doublet. Each ortho proton is split by the substituent, so each would be a doublet. But wait, in a para-substituted benzene, the two ortho protons are equivalent and show as a doublet, and similarly the meta protons would be equivalent. But in this case, the substituent might be such that there's another substituent on the benzene ring. Wait, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene, like 1,4-disubstituted.

So, the substituent is in the para position, and perhaps another substituent is also present.

Wait, looking at the other NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet around 3 ppm, which could be a methylene or methine group adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps in an ester. Like the O-CO-O-R group, where R has a CH2 group.

Wait, another possibility is that it's a CH group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester. For example, if the ester is R-O-CO-aryl, and R is a branched chain, such as a butyl group.

Looking at the other signals:

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): A multiplet integrating to 2H, perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to a CH group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of 3H, maybe a methyl group attached to a CH group.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating to 3H, likely a terminal CH3 group.

Putting that together, perhaps the R group in the ester is a butyl group, but branched. Let's see: the 0.9 ppm triplet suggests a CH2CH2CH2CH3 group, but the 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) could be a CH(CH3) group. So if the structure is something like CH2CH(CH2CH3) or similar.

Wait, let's think about the substituents. The 1.7 ppm (m) could be a CH2 group next to a CH group (the 2.9 ppm peak), and the 1.4 ppm is a methyl attached to that CH.

So perhaps the R group is a sec-butyl group. Because:

- The structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, but let's see: The NMR for the R group (if it's a butyl group):

At 2.9 ppm: a CH group (since it's 1H as a multiplet), perhaps between two CH2 groups or adjacent to an oxygen.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the CH2 groups adjacent to the CH and the oxygen.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl attached to the CH, making it a -CH(CH3)- group.

And 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is the terminal methyl, part of the butyl chain.

So putting that together, R is a sec-butyl group. Because sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2- or something similar? Wait, no. Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, but I might be getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a tert-butyl group, but that would have a different NMR pattern. Let me think again.

Wait, for a sec-butyl group, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. No, wait:

Wait, sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-? No, wait, butyl is four carbons. The structure is:

For n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH2-.

For sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, actually, the correct structure for sec-butyl is -(CH2)2CH(CH3)-? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me clarify:

Butyl groups:

n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH2-

i-butyl: CH(CH2CH3)2CH2-

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, i-butyl is (CH3)2CHCH2-, so the branching is on the second carbon.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-? No, that's a pentyl group. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the substituents.

If the R group is a butyl group, perhaps it's a secondary alkyl group, like a sec-butyl, which would have a structure where the oxygen is connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH, which is connected to another CH2 and then a CH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O-CO-aryl-O-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that would be a butyl group attached via an oxygen. Wait, no, the ester is Ar-O-CO-R. So R would be a butyl group, perhaps.

So, in that case, R could be a sec-butyl group. So the ester would be Ar-O-CO-O-sec-butyl? No, wait, the ester is usually Ar-O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group.

Wait, no, the ester structure is R-O-CO-Ar, where R is an alkyl group and Ar is the aromatic ring. So if Ar is a para-substituted benzene, and R is a sec-butyl group, then the structure would be sec-butyl ester of para-substituted benzoic acid.

Wait, but the NMR shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which could be an aldehyde. So maybe the ester isn't the only group. Hmm, maybe the structure is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is part of a side chain. For example, the ester could be attached to an aldehyde group. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the structure would be a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position. So the ester would be the corresponding ester, which upon hydrolysis (with red phosphorus and HI) would give the benzoic acid.

So, if the starting material is the ester, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate ester, then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

So, let's see if the NMR of Compound X (the ester) would match this.

The ester would have the structure: (sec-butyl) O-CO-(para-substituted benzene). Wait, the benzene would have a substituent in the para position, but what else? Oh, wait, if the ester is, say, (sec-butyl) phenyl ester, but the benzene ring would have another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the benzene ring in the ester is a para-methyl group. So the ester would be methyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate. So the structure is O-CO-(para-substituted benzene), where the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

Wait, no, in that case, the ester would be something like sec-butyl benzoate, but perhaps with substituents on the benzene. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, let's consider the NMR. The aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, each a doublet of 2H.

In a para-substituted benzene, the two ortho protons would be equivalent and appear as a doublet. Similarly, the meta protons would also be equivalent. But if the substituent is in the para position, and the benzene is also substituted in another position, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons are two doublets each integrating to 2H. That suggests that the substituents are in such a way that the ring has two sets of equivalent protons, each in a doublet. So perhaps the substituents are in the para positions, but maybe it's a 1,4-dimethyl group or something like that?

Alternatively, it's a para-substituted benzene with another substituent in the ortho position. No, that would complicate things.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the 10.5 ppm peak is not from an aldehyde but from a carbonyl oxygen. Hmm, maybe it's an acidic proton, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde; but if the starting material is an ester, why would there be an aldehyde group? Alternatively, maybe the ester is attached to a benzaldehyde group, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is an -OH from a phenol group. But if the starting material is an ester, that doesn't fit because esters don't have -OH groups. Unless it's a phenol ester, which I'm not familiar with.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think about the IR again. The IR peaks are at 3400–2500 (broad?), 1720, 1610, 1450.

The broad peak between 3400-2500 suggests the presence of an -OH group, perhaps in a carboxylic acid, but the starting material is an ester, so that can't be. Wait, unless the ester is part of a hemiacetal or something, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe the 3400–2500 cm^-1 is a stretching from an -O-CH2- group or an ether. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, could it be an alkyne? No, the 1720 is more likely a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: the IR peak at 1610 cm^-1 suggests a conjugated carbonyl group, perhaps an aromatic ring. The 1450 cm^-1 could be a C-O stretch, which is common in esters.

So, putting this together: the IR suggests an ester (1720 cm^-1) and possibly an aromatic ring (1610 cm^-1). So the starting material is an ester with an aromatic ring.

Looking back at the NMR, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 (d) and 7.2 (d), each 2H. So perhaps the aromatic ring is para-substituted, and each pair of protons is split into a doublet.

So, the structure could be something like p-methyl benzoate, but with a more complex R group.

Wait, the R group (from the ester) would be O-CO-O-R, but no, that's not right. Esters are R-O-CO-R'. So if the benzene ring is connected to the ester oxygen, perhaps R' is a substituted benzene and R is an alkyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is benzyl propionate or something like that, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the NMR data includes a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group. So, perhaps the R group is a butyl group, specifically a sec-butyl.

So, the ester would be something like (sec-butyl) O-CO-(para-substituted benzene).

So, the para-substituted benzene would have substituents that cause the aromatic protons to split into two doublets. If the substituent is a methyl group in the para position, then the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets: the ortho protons and the meta protons. But wait, in the case of para-substituted toluene (methyl group), the ortho and para protons are split. Wait, in toluene, the protons ortho to the methyl are more deshielded and appear downfield. So, in the NMR, they would be doublets.

So, in the case of methyl benzoate, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which matches the NMR data. So, if the ester is methyl benzoate, but with substituents.

Wait, but in our case, the substituent on the benzene ring (from the ester) is more complex. Let me think: the benzene ring in the ester is attached to the ester oxygen, and perhaps a substituent in the para position.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-(sec-butyl) benzoate. So, the ester is a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group in the para position, and the ester oxygen is attached to an alkyl group.

Wait, but in that case, the NMR would have the aromatic protons as two doublets, each 2H. That fits the data.

Moreover, the R group (the alkyl part of the ester) would have the signals we see in the NMR.

So, the R group's NMR:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is likely the CH group in the sec-butyl structure.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): The CH2 groups adjacent to the CH and the oxygen.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): The methyl group attached to the CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): The terminal methyl group of the butyl chain.

So, putting it together, the R group is a sec-butyl group. Thus, the ester would be 4-(sec-butyl) benzoyl ester, but wait, the benzoyl part is from the aromatic ring. So, the ester would be something like (sec-butyl) O-CO-(4-substituted benzene), where the substituent is another group.

Wait, no, if the benzene ring has the ester oxygen attached to it, and a substituent in the para position, then it's 4-(sec-butyl) benzoic acid's ester. So, the ester would be (R-O-CO-) attached to the benzene, and the benzene has a sec-butyl group in the para position.

Upon hydrolysis with red phosphorus and HI, the ester would convert to the carboxylic acid, which would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

So, looking at the NMR of Compound X, which is the ester, let's see if it matches.

The aromatic protons would be at 8.0 and 7.2, each doublet, which fits a para-substituted benzene.

The 10.5 ppm peak: Hmm, in the ester, where is that coming from? If the starting material is the ester, then 10.5 ppm shouldn't be an aldehyde. Alternatively, perhaps it's a peak from another part of the molecule. Wait, perhaps the ester has another functional group, like an aldehyde. For example, maybe it's a benzaldehyde ester, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is from the O-CO-O-R group, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a phenolic O-H, but the ester shouldn't have that.

Wait, maybe the 10.5 ppm is from an acidic proton, like from a COOH group, but the ester wouldn't have that. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is from an aldehyde. So, if the ester has an aldehyde group attached, like RCH2CHO, but that seems unlikely. Or perhaps it's a conjugated system.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think: the reaction is hydrolysis of the ester to the carboxylic acid. The product is a carboxylic acid, which in the options is either A or C.

Looking at the NMR of the product, which would be a carboxylic acid, but the question is about the product, not the starting material. So perhaps the product's structure is what the options are about.

Wait, but the question is about the product after reacting Compound X with red phosphorus and HI. So, if Compound X is an ester, the product is the acid. So, looking at the options, the product would be a carboxylic acid, so options C and A are possible.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

So, in option A, the acid is propanoic acid attached to a 4-ethylphenyl group at position 2. So the structure would be:

Ph-CH2-COOH, where Ph is 4-ethylphenyl. Or Ph-CH2-COOH, but in the structure, the substituent is at the 4 position of the benzene ring, and the propanoic acid is attached at the 2 position. Wait, no, the formula is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

So, it would be CH2-COOH attached to the benzene ring at position 2, and the benzene has an ethyl group at position 4.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-COOH, where the benzene has an ethyl group in the para position.

In that case, the NMR of the product (option A) would have a triplet for the ethyl group, but that's beyond the point.

But let's think again about the NMR of Compound X.

If the ester is 4-(sec-butyl) benzoate, then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

So, the NMR of the ester would have the aromatic protons as two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which fits.

The R group (sec-butyl) would give the signals at 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm.

So, putting it all together, the product is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.


The question involves identifying the final product of a reaction where Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Based on the IR and NMR data provided, Compound X is deduced to be an ester, as the reaction conditions (red phosphorus and HI) are known to hydrolyze esters into carboxylic acids. The IR spectrum shows a strong carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, consistent with an ester, and the broad peak between 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ may correspond to an -OH group in the final product (carboxylic acid). The NMR data provides further clues about the structure of Compound X.

### Key Analysis of NMR Data:
1. **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: Likely corresponds to an aldehyde proton or an acidic proton, though this is less clear in the context of the ester.
2. **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: These doublets suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring, as the ortho and meta protons would split into doublets.
3. **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: Likely corresponds to a CH group in the R group of the ester.
4. **1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: These signals suggest a CH2 group and a methyl group, respectively, part of a branched alkyl chain.
5. **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: Indicates a terminal methyl group, consistent with a butyl chain.

### Structure of Compound X:
The NMR data suggests that the R group in the ester is a sec-butyl group. The aromatic ring is para-substituted, and the ester group is attached to the benzene ring. Thus, Compound X is likely **4-(sec-butyl) benzoate**.

### Reaction and Final Product:
When Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, the ester is hydrolyzed to form the corresponding carboxylic acid. Therefore, the final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: This structure does not match the NMR data, as it would not produce the observed splitting patterns for the aromatic protons or the sec-butyl group.
- **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: This is an aromatic hydrocarbon and not a carboxylic acid, so it cannot be the product of ester hydrolysis.
- **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: Matches the NMR data and is consistent with the hydrolysis of the ester.
- **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: This is also an aromatic hydrocarbon and not a carboxylic acid, so it cannot be the product.

### Conclusion:
The final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, corresponding to option C.

Answer: C
