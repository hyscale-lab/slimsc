Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, the question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's break this down.

First, I need to understand the structure of both the starting material and the target. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group attached. The ethynyl group is a triple bond, so it's like CH2-C≡CH connected to the ring. Wait, actually, ethynyl is -C≡CH, right? So ethynylcyclohexane would have a cyclohexane ring with a -C≡CH substituent.

The target compound is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me parse that. The main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) attached. Then, at position 1 (which is the same as the position where the formyl is attached), there's a substituent: cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So that's a CH2 group attached to both the cyclohexane ring (the cyclohexyl part) and a hydroxyl group (OH). So the substituent is -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl).

So the substituent is a methyl group (from CH2) that's connected to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. So the structure would be something like cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde.

Wait, no. Because the main chain is cyclohexane with a carbaldehyde (CHO) group. Then, at position 1, which is the same carbon as the CHO, the substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So the carbon attached to the aldehyde has another CH2 group attached, which is connected to a cyclohexane ring and an OH group. Wait, maybe it's a branching.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the cyclohexane in position 1. So the structure would be like:

Aldehyde is on a cyclohexane ring. On the same carbon as the aldehyde, there's a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So that carbon has three substituents: aldehyde, OH, and cyclohexyl groups? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So the group is CH2-OH connected to a cyclohexyl? No, wait. The substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So it's a methyl group (CH2-) that is attached to both the cyclohexane (cyclohexyl) and a hydroxy group. So the substituent is a CH2 group with two substituents: OH and cyclohexyl. So the structure
