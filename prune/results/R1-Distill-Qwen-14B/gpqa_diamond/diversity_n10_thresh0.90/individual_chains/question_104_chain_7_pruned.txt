Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is, I think.

The problem states that there are two stars with the same mass, similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the key here is probably the Doppler shift measurements.

Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. But wait, how does the shift relate to the orbital period of the planet?

I recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the orbital parameters. The formula for K is something like K = (v * sin i) * (M_p / (M_star))^(1/3) / (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3) * (1/(1 AU))^(1/3) ), but wait, I might be getting that wrong. Alternatively, I think the equation is K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/ ( P * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) )? Maybe I should look for a simpler approach.

Wait, the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. The RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity observed. So a larger K means a more massive planet or a planet with a shorter orbital period, or closer orbit? Because if the planet is closer, the star's velocity would be higher for the same mass.

The formula for K is K = [ (G * P ) / (2π c ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But since the planet masses are similar to Neptune and the stars are similar to the Sun, M_p << M_star. So M_p + M_star ≈ M_star, so the denominator simplifies. Thus, K ≈ (G * P sin i) / (2 π c )^(1/3) * (M_p ) / (M_star^(2/3) )

Wait, let me write the simplified formula for K when M_p << M_star. Then, K ≈ ( (27 * pi * G )^(-1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / (M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/(1 - e²)^(1/2)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ) * something. Maybe I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, maybe I should remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) ), but I'm not confident. Wait, let's think about how K depends on the orbital period P. Since K is the velocity, higher K would mean the star is moving more quickly, which could be due to a more massive planet or a shorter period.

In this problem, both planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), so M_p is same for both. The stars are same mass, so M_star is same. So the only difference is the Doppler shift (K) is different between the two planets.

So K1 = 5 milliangstroms, K2 =7. So K2 = (7/5) K1.

But how does K relate to the orbital period P? Let me think about the formula again. The semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * ( sin i ) / ( (P * (1 yr in seconds) )^(1/3) * c )

Wait, maybe an alternative approach is better. The RV method gives K, the semi-amplitude. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star^(2/3)) (P)^(1/3) (1 + M_p/M_star) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the relation between K and P. Since M_p and M_star are same for both planets, the ratio of K1 and K2 can be expressed as:

K1/K2 = ( (P2 / P1 )^(1/3) ) * (other factors, but since they're same, they cancel )

Wait, I might have it the other way. Let me think.

If K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star)^(2/3) * 1/( P^(1/3) )

Since M_p and M_star are same, then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3).

Wait, no. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). So if K1 = 5, K2=7, then K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4. But since K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), then (K2/K1) = (P1/P2)^(1/3). Because if K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

So, substituting:

7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Cube both sides: (7/5)^3 = P1/P2

So (343)/(125) = P1/P2 -> P2 = P1 * (125/343) = P1 * (5^3)/(7^3) ) = (5/7)^3 P1.

Wait, but actually, wait, when K increases, P should decrease because for the same M_p and M_star, a larger K implies a shorter period. Because the star's velocity is higher when the planet is closer (shorter period).

So, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So P is proportional to (1/K)^(3).

So, the ratio of periods P
