Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model. So the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. Let's think through each one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. The Standard Model, and thus SMEFT, must respect Lorentz symmetry because that's a fundamental symmetry of relativity. Any operator in SMEFT should transform correctly under Lorentz transformations. So Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a broader symmetry that includes both Lorentz transformations and translations? SMEFT operators are usually written in a way that respects local symmetries, but I'm not sure if all operators must respect Poincare. Wait, Effective Field Theories (EFTs) are formulated in a way that they respect the symmetries of the underlying theory. The Standard Model respects Poincare, so SMEFT should too. But wait, do the individual operators need to respect Poincare symmetry individually, or is it more about the theory as a whole?

Wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, and the operators are classified by their dimension and the symmetries of the SM. So each operator in SMEFT must have the same quantum numbers as the SM, implying they respect the same symmetries. So Poincare is part of the SM's symmetries, so the operators must respect it. So Poincare (2) is required.

Wait, but wait. The Poincare group includes translations, so maybe when you write down operators in SMEFT, they have to be compatible with translation invariance, which is part of Poincare. But maybe the operators are constructed in such a way that they already respect it. So operators must respect Poincare symmetry.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because the SMEFT is valid at low energies where translations aren't a problem. But all terms in the Lagrangian must be translationally invariant, so yes, each operator must respect Poincare symmetry, including Lorentz and translation. So both 1 and 2 are required.

But wait, isn't Poincare symmetry automatically included if the theory is Lorentz invariant and translation invariant? Because the Lagrangian must be invariant under these. So if the operators respect Lorentz symmetry, then they're part of Poincare as well? Or are they separate?

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering whether each operator is a Poincare symmetry. For example, each operator must transform in a certain way under Poincare. But I'm not certain. Let me try to think of it another way.

The question is about what must be respected by all operators. So if an operator doesn't respect Poincare symmetry, then it's not part of SMEFT. But I think SMEFT's operators are built to respect the same symmetries as the SM, which includes Poincare. So both 1 and 2 must be respected.

Wait, but wait. The original Standard Model respects Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT, which is an extension, must also respect it. So 2 is correct.

Now, CP symmetry (3). The Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry in general. For example, CP violation exists in the CKM matrix. So the SM doesn't have CP as a symmetry. Therefore, SMEFT operators can include terms that violate CP as well. So not all operators in SMEFT must respect CP symmetry. So 3 is not a must; it's not required. So operators can violate CP. So option 3 is not a required symmetry.

Lastly, CPT symmetry (4). The SM respects CPT symmetry. I think the SM's Lagrangian is invariant under CPT. So any effective theory derived from the SM must also respect CPT. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. So 4 is correct.

So which options are correct? The question lists four symmetries, and the options are combinations of them.

The correct symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So that's options 1,2,4. Looking at the options:

Option C says 1,2,4. Option A is 1 and 2. So the correct answer is C.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Poincare is a must. But let me double-check. Are all SMEFT operators Poincare symmetric? Or is it more that the overall theory respects Poincare symmetry, but the individual operators don't necessarily have to?

Wait, in Effective Field Theories, the Lagrangian must be translationally invariant, which is part of Poincare. So each term in the Lagrangian must be a Lorentz scalar and translation invariant. Therefore, each operator must respect Poincare. So 2 is correct.

So the required symmetries are 1, 2, and 4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the answer is C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model (SM). The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us
