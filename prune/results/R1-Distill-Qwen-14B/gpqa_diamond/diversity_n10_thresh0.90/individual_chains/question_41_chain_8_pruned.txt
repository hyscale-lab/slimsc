Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and relative velocities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer in the lab.

Wait, right. The speed of light in a medium like glass is c/n, where c is the speed in a vacuum. But here, the glass itself is moving, so does that affect the observed speed of light?

I remember something about Galilean relativity. When objects move relative to each other, velocities add in a certain way. Oh wait, but wait—light is special because it always travels at c in a vacuum, right? But in this case, the light is in a medium, so maybe the speed is different.

Wait, but the problem is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame. So the glass is moving, so how does that affect the light's speed?

Let me break it down. The light's speed inside the glass is v_light = c/n, relative to the glass. But the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So in the lab frame, the speed would be the sum of those velocities, right? Because of the way velocities add in the same direction.

So in the lab frame, the speed would be v_light + v_glass. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So, if the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, then their velocities add.

Wait, no, wait again. Let me get the directions straight. The light is propagating through the glass, same direction as the glass's motion. The glass is moving towards the observer. So the observer is in front of the direction the glass is moving. So the glass is approaching the observer. But the light inside the glass is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, so it's moving towards the observer as well.

Wait, no. I'm getting confused. Let me visualize this. The lab frame is stationary. The glass is moving to the right (towards the observer) at speed v. The light inside the glass is moving to the right as well. So from the lab frame, the speed of the light is the speed of the glass plus the speed of the light in the glass relative to the glass.

Wait, but the speed of the light in the glass is c/n. So the lab frame would see it as (c/n) + v? But that can't be, because if v is significant, adding it might make the speed exceed c, which is impossible.

Wait, wait. Wait, but according to relativity, you can't have the speed of light exceeding c, but this is only in a vacuum. Or is it that the speed of light in any inertial frame is c in the vacuum, but in a medium, it's different.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab. So, considering the glass is moving, the light's speed would be affected by the glass's velocity.

But wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about frame transformations. Like, using relative velocity addition, but since light is involved, maybe using the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, but the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light's velocity in the glass is u' = c/n. So in the lab frame, what's the velocity u?

The relativistic velocity addition formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )

But wait, that's when you're transforming from the glass frame to the lab frame. So u' is the speed in the glass frame, which is c/n. So substituting, u = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n)*v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator: 1 + v/(n c )

So u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ (n c + v ) / (n c ) ) ]

Wait, let me compute this. Let me write it
