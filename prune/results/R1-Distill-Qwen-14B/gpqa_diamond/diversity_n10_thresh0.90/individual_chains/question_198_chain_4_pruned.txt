Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the question is about.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species in the solution.

Wait, I remember that stability constants (β) relate to how stable a complex is. Higher β means the complex is more stable. The higher the β, the more the complex will form.

The complexes are probably [Co(SCN)_n]^something. But wait, I'm a bit confused. The numbering is β1, β2, etc. So maybe β1 is the constant for the first complex, like [CoSCN]^+ or something. Let me think. The general formula for the nth complex would be [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n), I think. Because Co^2+ and each SCN- is -1. So for each SCN added, the charge decreases by 1. So for n=1, it's [Co(SCN)]^+ (charge 2+ - 1 = 1+), n=2 would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0, n=3 would be [Co(SCN)_3]^-1, and n=4 would be [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

But wait, I'm not sure about the numbering; maybe it's the other way around. Oh well, perhaps it doesn't matter for this problem. The important thing is to find the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex, which I think is [Co(SCN)_2] or [Co(SCN)_2]^0. Wait, the problem mentions the "blue dithiocyanato" complex. I remember that [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is the common blue one, maybe? Or wait, no, maybe [Co(SCN)_2] is the dithiocyanato, but I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Wait, the "dithiocyanato" implies two SCN ligands. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0, perhaps. So for this problem, we're looking for the concentration of that particular complex relative to all cobalt species.

Hmm, but the problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that's four β values, so probably four complexes possible. Let me recall that the stability constant β_n is for the nth complex. So β1 would be for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^-1, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, but the order of β's is 9, 40, 63, 16. Oh wait, that's not in order. So β4 is 16, which is lower than β1. Hmm, so perhaps the most stable is β3=63, then β2=40, then β1=9, and β4=16. Wait, but that can't be right because β4 is lower than β1. Maybe I've misunderstood the numbering. Alternatively, perhaps β1 is for the first complex, which has one SCN, β2 for two, etc. So the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^-1, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I'm a bit rusty on the colors of Co complexes. I think
