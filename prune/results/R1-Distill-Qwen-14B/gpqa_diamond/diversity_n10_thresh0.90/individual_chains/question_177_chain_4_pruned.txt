Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. So the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. 

Hmm, the problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh wait, and the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times bigger than Star_2. Interesting, so same scaling for radius and mass. But then, the question is about luminosity, right? 

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law. Wien's Law states that lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. Because if lambda is the same, then T is the same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait. So they're both black bodies, same peak wavelength, so same temperature. Got it. So T1 = T2. 

Next, the problem states that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Radial velocity, that's the velocity along the line of sight, right? So that affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh, but the peak wavelengths they measured are the same. So the observed lambda is the same for both. But the actual emission peak wavelengths would be different based on their velocities, but then the observed ones are same. Hmm, but wait, the problem says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found they are the same. So the observed lambda_max is same for both. 

Wait, but when a star is moving towards or away from us, its emitted wavelengths are shifted. If a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted (lambda decreases), and if moving away, it's redshifted (lambda increases). So if Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, its observed lambda_max is the same as its emitted lambda. But Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Let me think about this.

So, the emitted lambda_max for each star is determined by their temperatures. But because of their velocities, the observed lambda_max would be different. The problem says the observed lambda_max for both are the same. So that must mean that the Doppler shift for Star_2 compensates for the difference in their emitted wavelengths.

Wait, but earlier I thought that both stars have the same temperature because their observed lambda_max is the same. But wait, no, because the observed lambda depends on both the star's temperature and its velocity. So maybe I need to factor that in.

Wait, the problem says they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So the question is about the luminosity ratio.

Luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature
