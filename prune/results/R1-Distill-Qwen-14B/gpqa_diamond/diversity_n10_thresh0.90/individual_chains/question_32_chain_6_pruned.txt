Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. It's about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the question says that the nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So the isotope would be Li-6 because Li normally has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons make it Li-6. So the mass number A is 6. That means the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus.

So I need to find the energy of the RHIC such that the speed of this nucleus is 0.96 times the speed of light. I'm guessing this is the total energy, or perhaps the kinetic energy? Well, let's see. The options are in GeV, so probably the total energy is what they're after because relativistic energies are usually given as total energy, but sometimes kinetic. Wait, but in particle physics, the collider's energy is usually the kinetic energy. Or maybe it's the total energy including rest mass. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let's think.

In high-energy physics, the energy of a particle in a collider is often given as the kinetic energy. But sometimes, especially when the rest mass is non-negligible, it's the total energy. Wait, but for heavy ions like Li, the rest mass is significant. So I need to clarify: when they say the energy of the RHIC, what exactly is being referred to?

Wait, the RHIC is a collider, so the particles are accelerated to a certain energy and then made to collide. The energy given to each beam is typically the kinetic energy, but sometimes people refer to the total energy (which includes rest mass energy). Hmm. So how to approach this?

The problem says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So if the speed is given, we can calculate the Lorentz factor gamma, then find the total energy, which is gamma times the rest energy.

So let's proceed step by step.

First, find gamma. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute that.

v = 0.96c → v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

Then sqrt(0.0784) is sqrt(784/10000) which is 28/100 = 0.28. So sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

Thus, gamma = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, 1/0.28 is approximately 3.571428... So about 3.5714.

Next, find the rest energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is m*c². So I need the mass of Li-6.

Wait, the mass of a Li-6 nucleus. The atomic mass unit (u) is about 1.660539 × 10^-27 kg. One u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c².

So the mass of Li-6 is 6 u, right? Because it's 6 nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons). So 6 * 931.5 MeV/c².

Wait, no, wait. The mass of the nucleus isn't exactly 6 u because binding energy. But in particle physics, for heavy ions, sometimes we approximate the mass as A u, where A is the mass number. But for precise calculations, the actual mass is needed. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass of the nucleus as A times the mass of a nucleon. Let me check.

The mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, and a neutron is about 1.008665 u. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So the total mass is 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665) = let's compute:

3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828 u.

3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995 u.

Total: 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 u.

Wait, that's for Li-6. So the rest energy is m*c² = 6.047823 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

Wait, 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.047823 u * 931.5 MeV/c² per u.

Calculate that:

6.047823 * 931.5 ≈ Let's approximate.

6 * 931.5 =5589.

0.047823 *931.5 ≈ 44.63 approximately.

So total ≈5589 +44.63 = 5633.63 MeV, which is about 5.6336 GeV.

Wait, but wait, let me compute that more accurately.

6.047823 * 931.5:

Let me do 6 * 931.5 = 5589.

0.047823 *931.5.

Compute 0.04 *931.5 = 37.26.

0.007823 *931.5 ≈ roughly, 0.007 *931.5 is about 6.5205, 0.000823 *931.5≈0.767.

So adding 37.26 +6.5205=43.7805 +0.767=44.5475.

So total is 5589 +44.5475 = 5633.5475 MeV, which is 5.6335475 GeV.

So the rest energy is approximately 5.6335 GeV.

Now, the total energy is gamma times the rest energy. Gamma was about 3.5714.

So 3.5714 *5.6335 GeV ≈ ?

Let me compute this.

3 *5.6335 =16.9005.

0.5714 *5.6335.

0.5 *5.6335=2.81675.

0.0714 *5.6335≈0.404.

So 2.81675 +0.404≈3.22075.

So total E ≈16.9005 +3.22075=20.12125 GeV.

Wait, that's approximately 20.121 GeV. Let me compute more accurately.

3.5714 *5.6335 = ?

3.5714 *5 =17.857.

3.5714 *0.6335 = ?

0.6335 *3.5714: Let's compute 3.5714 * 0.6 =2.14284, 3.5714 *0.0335≈0.1196.

So 2.14284 +0.1196≈2.2624.

So total 17.857 +2.2624=20.1194 ≈20.1194 GeV.

Looking at the options: option C is 20.132 GeV, option D is 21.419. Hmm, our calculation is about 20.119, which is close to option C (20.132), but perhaps I made a rounding error.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma more accurately. Let me go back.

v = 0.96c.

So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 )

(0.96)^2=0.9216.

1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly, because 0.28^2=0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

So E_total = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 *5.6335 GeV.

Let me compute that more precisely.

5.6335 *3.57142857.

Let me compute 5 *3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.6335 *3.57142857.

Compute 0.6335 *3.57142857.

Let's compute 3.57142857 *0.6=2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.0335=?

0.03 times 3.57142857=0.1071428571.

0.0035 *3.57142857 = 0.0125.

So total 0.1071428571 +0.0125 =0.1196428571.

So 0.6 gives 2.14285714, 0.0335 gives 0.1196428571.

Total 2.14285714 +0.1196428571 =2.2625.

So 5.6335 *3.57142857 =17.85714285 +2.2625 =20.11964285 GeV.

So about 20.1196 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's a bit higher than our calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest energy.

Let me recheck the mass calculation. Maybe I should use a more precise value for the mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

The exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.04783 u, right? Because 3*(proton) + 3*(neutron)=3*(1.007276) +3*(1.008664) = 3*(2.01594) =6.04782 u.

Yes, that's correct.

So the rest energy is 6.04782 u *931.5 MeV/u.

Wait, maybe using a more precise value for the u to MeV conversion. 1 u = 931.494064 MeV/c².

So 6.04782 u *931.494064 MeV/u = ?

Compute 6 *931.494064 =5588.964384 MeV.

0.04782 u *931.494064 MeV/u = 0.04782 *931.494064.

Compute 0.04 *931.494064 =37.25976256.

0.00782 *931.494064 ≈ let's compute:

0.007 *931.494064 =6.520458448.

0.00082 *931.494064 ≈0.764.  (0.00082 *931.494064 = 0.764388).

So total is 6.520458448 +0.764388 ≈7.2848.

So 37.25976256 +7.2848 ≈44.5445.

So total rest energy is 5588.964384 +44.5445 ≈5633.5089 MeV, which is 5.6335089 GeV.

So E_total = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.6335089 GeV.

Let me compute that precisely.

3.57142857 *5.6335089.

Well, 3.57142857 is exactly 25/7, since 25 divided by 7 is approximately 3.57142857.

So 25/7 *5.6335089 = (25 *5.6335089)/7.

Compute 25 *5.6335089 =140.8377225.

Divide by 7: 140.8377225 /7 ≈20.11967464 GeV.

So approximately 20.11967 GeV.

Looking back at the options:

Option C) 20.132 GeV

Option D)21.419 GeV.

Hmm, our calculation is about 20.1197 GeV. So the closest option is C)20.132 GeV. But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, v=0.96c.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

That seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. Oh! Oh right! Because sometimes in these contexts, the energy given is the kinetic energy.

Wait, the problem asks for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c. Hmm, I think the RHIC accelerates the nuclei to a certain energy. Typically, when we talk about the energy of a collider, it's the kinetic energy per particle. Or is it the total energy?

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. The total energy is gamma m c², which includes the rest energy and the kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c².

So if the problem is asking for the total energy, then I have about 20.1197 GeV. If it's asking for the kinetic
