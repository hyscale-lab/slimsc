Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow and think through each part.

First, the problem describes a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. From what I remember, when substances react violently and release a gas, it's often a reaction that's exothermic and produces something like CO2 or H2, which are common gases. The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, that makes me think of something like CO2â€”wait, no, let me think. Hmm, a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. So if the molecule is, say, CH4, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe it's a diatomic gas because the problem says "molecule." Let's see.

Wait, another approach: the gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about possible gases. For example, if W is CO2, then each CO2 molecule has... wait, no, each molecule is made of atoms, so the total neutrons and protons in the molecule. Wait, no, wait, the question says the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule has, for example, 18 neutrons and 18 protons, making 36 in total? Or maybe each atom in the molecule has equal number of neutrons and protons.

Wait, no, wait. The molecule as a whole has the same number of protons and neutrons. So the total protons in the molecule equals the total neutrons. Let me consider some possibilities. For example, if W is H2O: each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (since it's H-1), and O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So H2O has 2*(1+0) = 2 protons and 8 neutrons from each O. Wait, no, the total in the molecule: each H contributes 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So H2O has 2 H atoms (each with 1p, 0n) and one O (8p, 8n). So total protons in molecule: 2+8=10. Neutrons: 0 +8=8. No, 10 protons and 8 neutrons: not equal. So that's not it.

Another possibility: CO2. C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if it's carbon-12). O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So CO2 has 6+8*2 = 22 protons. Neutrons: 6 + 8*2 = 22. Oh wait! So CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That would make the total protons equal to neutrons. So W is CO2? But wait, does that reaction produce CO2?

Wait, but CO2 is a gas, right. Another possibility is maybe O2, but O2 is O-O. Each O has 8 protons. So molecule has 16 protons. Neutrons would be 8 *2=16. So O2 has 16 protons and 1
