Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. Hmm, it's about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so this should be a classic acid-base titration problem.

The problem states that we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I need to calculate both values correctly to choose the right option.

First, I'll tackle the initial dilution. When you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution formula. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20 cm³, and we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume is 40 cm³. The concentration after dilution can be found using M1V1 = M2V2.

So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2. Plugging in the numbers: 0.05 * 20 /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so when it's diluted, its dissociation increases a bit, but for the purpose of calculating the initial pH, maybe I can just use the diluted concentration and the Ka to find the pH. Or do I need to consider activity coefficients? No, I think the problem expects me to use the simplified approach, considering the solution as a weak acid in water.

So after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M. But when we titrate with NaOH, which is a strong base, it will react with the acetic acid. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let's calculate the moles initially.

Moles of acetic acid initially: M = 0.05 M, V = 0.02 L. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the volume is 0.04 L, but the moles remain the same, so 0.001 moles.

When titrating, each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid. At equivalence point, moles of NaOH added will be 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 mL. But wait, the problem is about the pH at 25% titration and equivalence point. So let's handle each part.

First, at 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence volume is 10 mL * 0.25 = 2.5 mL. So 2.5 mL of NaOH is added.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Since the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001, after adding 0.00025 mol NaOH, we have:

Moles of acetic acid reacted: 0.00025, so remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.00025 mol.

The total volume of the solution now is original 40 mL plus 2.5 mL NaOH added, so 42.5 mL = 0.0425 L.

So concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ let's calculate that. 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.0058824 M.

This is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Ka is given as 1.85e-5, so pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that.

Log(1.85) is around 0.267 (since log(2)=0.301, 1.85 is closer to 2, but 1.85 is 1.85, so maybe 0.267). So pKa = 4.735 approximately (since 1e-5 has pKa 5, and 1.85 is higher, so pKa is 4.735? Wait, wait.

Wait, 1.85
