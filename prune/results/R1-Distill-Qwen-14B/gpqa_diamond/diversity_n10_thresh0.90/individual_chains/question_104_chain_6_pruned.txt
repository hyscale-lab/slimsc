Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by an orbiting planet. The star moves in response to the planet's gravity, right?

The question says there are two stars with exactly the same masses, both similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. So, the planets are roughly the same mass, and the stars are the same mass. Both planets have circular orbits.

The RV measurements are given for each star. For planet #1, the spectral line shifts by up to 5 milliangstroms. For planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. Wait, why is the shift different then? I think the shift relates to the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit.

The RV method formula I recall is that the semi-amplitude K of the velocity semi-amplitude is given by K = (v) where v is the velocity of the star. K depends on the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the inclination of the orbit (which is 90 degrees for maximum effect, so sin i =1), and the orbital period and distance.

Wait, the formula for K is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(0.5) )) * ( sin i ) / ( (P) * (1 day in seconds) ) )

But since the planets are Neptune-like, their mass is much less than the star's, so M_p << M_star. So M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(1-e²)^0.5) * (sin i) / (P * day conversion factor )

Wait, maybe I should simplify. Let me think about the relation between the RV semi-amplitude K and the orbital period.

Wait, another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)) ) ) / (some factors). Hmm, maybe I should recall the exact formula.

The formula is K = (v) = ( (27 * π ) / (2 * c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) * (1 - e²)^0.5 ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1) / (P ) )

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me look for a more straightforward approach.

Another thought: The star's velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's velocity around the star. Since the star and planet orbit their common center of mass, the star's velocity is inversely proportional to the planet's mass. Wait, no, because the star is much more massive; the planet's effect on the star's velocity is what's measured.

Wait, the formula for K is:

K = ( ( (2π G) / (P c^3) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K ≈ ( (2π G ) / (P c^3) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

Wait, but for this problem, sin i is the same for both planets because the problem states that the RV method detected the planets. So sin i is close to 1 for both, so that factor is about the same and can be neglected when taking the ratio.

So, K is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Wait, no, let's think again. Let me write it step by step.

The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * P ) / (2π c^3) )^(-1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

Hmm, perhaps I should find the ratio of K2 to K1.

Let me denote the first planet (K1) and the second (K2).

Given that M_p1 ≈ M_p2 (since both are Neptune-like), and M_star1 = M_star2 (because they are same mass as Sun), and inclination i is same (since both are detected via RV, sin i is ~1 for both so same factor).

So, K is proportional to ( M_p ) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps more accurately, K is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )

Because looking at the formula, the denominator has (M_star + M_p)^{2/3} and numerator has M_p. So K ∝ (M_p) / (M_star)^(2/3) * [ (something else) ]

Wait, maybe I should just consider the proportionality.

We can write K ∝ (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

So, K1 / K2 = [ (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * (M_star2^(2/3) / M_star1^(2/3)) ) * (P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) ) ) ]

But since M_p1 = M_p2 and M_star1 = M_star2, this simplifies.

So K1 / K2 = ( P2^(1/3) ) / ( P1^(1/3) )

Which means K1 = K2 * (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, but wait the given data is that K1 is 5 milliangstroms, K2 is 7 milliangstroms.

So K2 is larger than K1.

So K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) * K1

Wait, that can't be because if K2 is larger than K1, then (P2/P1)^(1/3) must be larger than 1, which implies P2 > P1.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure.

Wait, the formula I have is K ∝ ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

So, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K is larger, then P must be smaller.

Because, for example, if P increases, 1/P^(1/3) decreases, so K would decrease.

So, K2 > K1 → (1/P2^(1/3)) > (1/P1^(1/3)) → P2^(1/3) < P1^(1/3) → P2 < P1.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the proportionality.

Wait, let me think again. The semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^0.5 ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(P * (1 day in seconds)))

Hmm, perhaps I should look up the exact formula.

Wait, I remember that K is given by:

K = ( ( (G * (M_p) sin i ) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^0.5 ) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2π c^3) ) / (P ) )^(1/3)

But I'm getting a bit stuck, perhaps I should think in terms of the formula K ∝ (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Given that, let's take the ratio K2/K1.

We have K2/K1 = [ (M_p2 / M_p1) * (M_star1^(2/3) / M_star2^(2/3)) * (P1^(1/3) / P2^(1/3) ) ]

Since M_p1 = M_p2 and M_star1 = M_star2, this simplifies to K2/K1 = (P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

So, K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

We can rearrange this to find P2/P1.

Take both sides to the power of 3:

(K2/K1)^3 = (P1/P2)

So, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

Given that K1 is 5 and K2 is7, so K1/K2 =5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So, (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So, P2/P1 ≈ 0.364.

Which means the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.364 times that of planet #1.

Wait, but the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than planet #1? So, if P2 is 0.364 * P1, then P2 is shorter than P1. So, the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So, the period of planet
