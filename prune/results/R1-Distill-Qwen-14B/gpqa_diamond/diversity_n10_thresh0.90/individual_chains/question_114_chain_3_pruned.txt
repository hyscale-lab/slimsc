Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about selecting suitable reagents for two reactions. The first reaction involves butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something labeled A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reacts it with reagent B (which is H2O?) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm. So, first, I'll break down each reaction.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write down the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When a ketone reacts with a nitrile source like NaCN, I remember that it's typically a nucleophilic substitution or addition. Wait, but wait, ketones can undergo various reactions. Oh, wait, maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation! Right, that's when a ketone reacts with CN- to form a compound where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by a hydroxyl group and the adjacent carbon gets the CN group.

The cyanohydrin reaction usually involves a base, but sometimes other conditions. Wait, no, I think the cyanohydrin formation typically uses a weak acid or a base as a catalyst. Let me recall: the cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon. But to make the carbonyl more electrophilic, sometimes a proton source is needed. Oh, wait, no, I think that the reaction is done under acidic conditions. Because the mechanism is that the carbonyl oxygen gets protonated, making it more electrophilic.

So, butan-2-one + NaCN (which is a source of CN-) would react to form the cyanohydrin. The product would have the structure where the carbonyl (C=O) becomes CH(OH)CN attached. Wait, but the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure.

Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CN, but with substituents. Wait, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH3)2C(OH)CNCH3? Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the product is 2-hydroxy... So, the structure is probably (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, but butanenitrile is four carbons, with the nitrile on the first carbon. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Hmm, not sure, but the important part is that the ketone has become a secondary alcohol with a nitrile attached.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, in the presence of an acid, perhaps, it forms the cyanohydrin. The reagent A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3, looking at the options.

Wait, H3O+ is a strong acid, and NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is an acid too but maybe a milder one. Or wait, sodium bisulfite is a source of HSO3^- which can act as an acid. Alternatively, sometimes in the cyanohydrin formation, the solvent is aqueous and maybe a little acid is used to protonate the carbonyl.

So, the first reaction is probably under acidic conditions. So reagent A is H3O+ or H2SO4 or something. Looking at the options, for reagent A, options A and B have H3O+, while C and D have NaHSO3.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: maybe it's not cyanohydrin. Because the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons: butanenitrile is four carbons. The product has a hydroxyl and a methyl on the same carbon. So the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CN, but wait, that's four carbons in the chain? Or perhaps it's (CH3)2CH(OH)CN? No, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So, when it forms a cyanohydrin, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but that would be 3-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile? Because the nitrile is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl group.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so when it reacts with CN-, it adds a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on the same carbon. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN, but that's a four-carbon molecule as well. Wait: (CH3)2C(OH)CN is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile? No, because propanenitrile is three carbons. Wait, perhaps it's butanenitrile. Let me count the carbons in the product.

The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutan
