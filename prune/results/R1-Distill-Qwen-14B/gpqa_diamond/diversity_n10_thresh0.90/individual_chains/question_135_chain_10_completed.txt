Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question gives a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions, and the mass of X is 6 GeV. I need to find the kinematically allowed decay channels at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf * ψ_fbar * f(y) * (v + X(y)) * ψ_f(y). Oh right, so the interaction term would look something like λ f ψ_fbar X ψ_f, right? So X couples to fermions with a coupling strength λ. 

Since the boson X is a boson, its decay products would be fermions and their antiparticles. So X can decay into particle-antiparticle pairs. But I need to figure out which fermions are allowed based on their masses and the X's mass.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So when X decays, the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than 6 GeV. Because, in particle physics, for a decay to be possible, the rest mass of the parent must be at least the sum of the rest masses of the decay products.

So I need to list all possible fermion-antifermion pairs that have a combined mass less than 6 GeV.

Wait, but what fermions are available? Well, the known fermions are quarks (u, d, s, c, b, t), leptons (e, mu, tau), and their antiquarks. But let's think about their masses.

Let me list the masses of the fermions:

- Up quark (u): around 2 MeV (but in some models, it's taken as a bit higher, but for this problem, maybe it's negligible compared to 6 GeV)
- Down quark (d): similar, around 4-5 MeV
- Strange quark (s): about 95-100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): around 1.2-1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): about 4.1-4.7 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV—so not possible.
- Electron (e): 0.511 MeV
- Muon (mu): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (tau): ~1.78 GeV

Wait, and for quarks, their masses are in pairs. So when the X decays into a quark-antiquark pair, the total mass is twice the mass of the quark. So for example, for u quark, mass would be 2 * 2 MeV = 4 MeV. Similarly for others.

So possible fermion pairs would be any pair where 2m_fermion ≤ 6 GeV.

Let me go through each fermion:

1. u quark: 2m_u ≈ 4 MeV → yes, allowed.
2. d quark: 2m_d ≈ 8-10 MeV → allowed.
3. s quark: 2m_s ≈ 190-200 MeV → allowed.
4. c quark: 2m_c ≈ 2.4-3 GeV → 2.4 GeV is less than 6, so allowed.
5. b quark: 2m_b ≈ 8.2-9.4 GeV → 8.2 is more than 6, so not allowed.
6. t quark: 2m_t ≈ 346 GeV → way over, so no.
7. e lepton: 2m_e ≈ 1.022 MeV → allowed.
8. mu lepton: 2m_mu ~ 211 MeV → allowed.
9. tau lepton: 2m_tau ~ 3.56 GeV → allowed.

So the possible decay products are any combination where each fermion's mass is ≤3 GeV (since 2m must be ≤6 GeV).

So the allowed fermions are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau. Wait, but wait, the tau is about 1.78 GeV, so 2*1.78 is ~3.56 GeV, which is under 6 GeV. So tau pairs are allowed.

But what about the b quark? 2m_b is ~8.2 GeV, which is above 6 GeV, so b quark pairs are not allowed. Same for top, which is way over.

So the possible decay channels are:

X → uū, dđ, sš, cč, e+e−, mu+ mu−, tau+ tau−.

Additionally, looking at the options, I need to see which option includes these.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→b bbar, s, etc. Wait, no, because b quark is too heavy. So A is out.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So yes, all allowed. Also, does X decay into t? No, so B is possible.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t. Wait, t is too heavy. So C is out because t can't be decay product.

Option D: includes b, which is too heavy. So D is out.

So option B is the correct one. Let me check the options again.

Option B: X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

Yes, that's all the allowed fermions. So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. The boson \( X \) couples to fermions, and the decay products must satisfy the condition that the total rest mass of the decay products is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mass of \( X \):** The mass of \( X \) is 6 GeV.
2. **Fermion Masses:** The masses of the known fermions are:
   - Up quark (\( u \)): \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \)
   - Down quark (\( d \)): \( \sim 4-5 \, \text{MeV} \)
   - Strange quark (\( s \)): \( \sim 95-100 \, \text{MeV} \)
   - Charm quark (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.2-1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.1-4.7 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - Top quark (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy)
   - Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \)
   - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
   - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)

3. **Decay Products:** For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the total rest mass of the pair \( f \bar{f} \) must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This rules out pairs involving the \( b \) quark (\( 2m_b \sim 8.2 \, \text{GeV} \)) and the \( t \) quark (\( 2m_t \sim 346 \, \text{GeV} \)).

4. **Allowed Decays:** The allowed fermion pairs are:
   - \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( c \bar{c} \), \( e^+ e^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect.**
- **Option B:** Includes \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), \( e^+ e^- \). All these pairs are allowed. **Correct.**
- **Option C:** Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_t > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect.**
- **Option D:** Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect.**

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decay channels for the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV.
