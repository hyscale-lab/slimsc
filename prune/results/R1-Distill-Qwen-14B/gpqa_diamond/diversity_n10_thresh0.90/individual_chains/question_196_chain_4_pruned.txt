Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator's maximum speed can be found using energy conservation. But wait, this is relativistic, so I'll have to consider how relativity affects things.

The problem states it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is F = -kx, which is Hooke's law. The question is about finding the maximum speed v_max.

In the classical case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA². Kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv² → v = sqrt(kA²/m) which is option C. But wait, this is the non-relativistic case. The question is relativistic, so I can't just use that.

Relativistically, kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. The relativistic kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, the oscillator's potential energy is also different in relativity? Or is it still (1/2)kx²? I think in this problem, they're assuming the potential is still the same as classical, which is non-relativistic. Because sometimes, when you have a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential might involve terms like sqrt(1 + (x/x0)^2) or something, but the problem says F = -kx, which suggests the potential is (1/2)kx². So maybe they're assuming the potential is classical, but the kinetic is relativistic.

So the setup is that the total energy is the sum of relativistic kinetic energy plus the potential energy. At maximum displacement (x = A), the kinetic energy is zero, and all energy is potential. So total energy E = (1/2)kA². At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic, so E = (γ - 1)mc².

Setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (γ - 1)mc².

Wait, but γ is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)). So, solving for v. Let's write that equation:

(1/2) k A² = ( (1/ (sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) ) - 1 ) m c².

Let me rearrange that:

(1/2) k A² / (m c²) ) + 1 = 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²))

Let me denote (1/2) k A²/(m c²) as some term, say, let's call it D. So,

D + 1 = 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²))

Wait, that would be (1/2 k A²)/(m c²) + 1 = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Hmm, but that can't be right because D is (k A²)/(2 m c²), which is a number. Let's see:

Let me express this step by step.

E = (1/2)kA² = (γ - 1)mc².

So, γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, no—wait, γ = (E + mc²)/mc². Because E = (γ -1) mc² → γ = (E + mc²)/(mc²) ) → E is (1/2)kA².

So γ = ( (1/2)kA² + mc² ) / ( mc² ) = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, that can't be right because the denominator is mc². Wait, let me compute that correctly.

Wait, E = (1/2)kA² is the potential energy. So E = (γ - 1) m c².

Rearranged, γ = (E)/(m c²) + 1.

So substituting E = (1/2)k A²,

γ = ( (1/2)kA² )/( m c² ) + 1.

So γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me let’s call (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term, say, alpha. So alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha.

Taking reciprocal on both sides,

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1/(1 + alpha).

Squaring both sides,

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Then,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2 ].

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

This is equal to [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2 alpha + alpha²) - 1 = 2 alpha + alpha².

So,

v²/c² = (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha)^2.

But alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v² = c² * [ (2 alpha + alpha²) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Substituting alpha,

= c² * [ 2*(k A²)/(2 m c²) + (k A^2/(2 m c²))^2 ] / [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ]

Hmm, simplifying numerator:

First term: 2 * (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) → k A²/(m c²)

Second term: (k A²)^2/(4 m² c^4 )

So numerator is [ k A²/(m c²) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) ]

Denominator is [ ( (2 m c² + k A²) )/(2 m c²) ) ]^2 → wait, denominator is (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 → which is ( (2 m c² + k A²) )/(2 m c²) ) ) squared.

Wait, perhaps it's better to factor. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor alpha from the numerator.

Wait, numerator is (2 alpha + alpha²) = alpha (2 + alpha).

Denominator is (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v²/c² = [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm. Now, let's think about whether alpha is small or not. Wait, in the non-relativistic case, alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2). Since for non-relativistic speeds, k A^2/(2m) would be much smaller than c^2, so alpha would be small. But in the problem, we're dealing with the general case, so
