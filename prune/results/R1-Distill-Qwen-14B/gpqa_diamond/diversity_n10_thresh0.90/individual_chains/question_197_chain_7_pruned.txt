Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question is about identifying a compound X after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D. I'm given the IR and NMR data of compound X. So, first, I need to figure out what compound X is, and then determine what happens when it reacts under those specific conditions.

Let's start by analyzing the IR data. The IR peaks are at 3400-2500 cm⁻¹, 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm⁻¹. The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 suggests the presence of an -OH group, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Wait, but also, the peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is strong and could indicate a carbonyl group. Carboxylic acids usually have a strong peak around 1700 cm⁻¹. So, maybe compound X is a benzoic acid derivative, or perhaps an ester or ketone.

Looking at the NMR data: The signals are at 10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H), which is a strong indication of an -OH proton, probably from a carboxylic acid. The 8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (doublet, 2H) suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like two protons in the para position, so maybe a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions.

Then, the other signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). These look like they could be from an alkyl chain. Let me think. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) is likely a methyl group attached to a CH₂. The doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) might be a CH(CH3) group, maybe a branching point. The multiplets at 2.9 and 1.7 could be adjacent CH groups, perhaps in a chain like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something.

Wait, putting this together. The aromatic part is para-substituted, so let's say positions 1 and 4 on the benzene ring. One substituent is a substituent in position 4, maybe a methyl group, and another substituent in position 1, perhaps a chain.

Wait, but the NMR shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which in a carboxylic acid would be the -OH proton. But in the IR, the strong peak at 1720 would align with a carbonyl, so that's a good fit for a carboxylic acid.

So, the structure is likely a benzoic acid with substituents. The substituents on the benzene ring would be at the para positions. One substituent could be a methyl group, and the other a more complex alkyl group.

Looking at the NMR, the 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a CH3 group attached to a CH which is a neighboring group. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) could be a CH2 group next to another CH, and the 2.9 ppm (1H) is probably a CH that's adjacent to something. The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is likely a CH2CH3 group at the end of the chain.

Putting it all together, the substituent on the benzene could be a propyl group with a branch. Let me think: If the chain is something like CH2-C(CH3)-CH2CH3, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an isobutyl group. Because isobutyl has a branch: CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2, but that's not right either. Hmm.

Wait, the substituent in the NMR seems to be a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. Let me think: The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. That CH is next to another CH2, perhaps. So, the structure could be CH2-CH(CH3)-something. But the chain might be longer. Alternatively, maybe it's a sec-butyl group.

Wait, the substituent on the benzene could be a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Or perhaps a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. Alternatively, it might be a pentyl group, but that seems longer than necessary.

Wait, another approach. Let's count the number of protons each NMR signal represents. The 1H NMR has:

- 10.5 ppm: 1H (likely the -OH of a carboxylic acid)
- 8.0 ppm: 2H (aromatic)
- 7.2 ppm: 2H (aromatic)
- 2.9 ppm: 1H (maybe a CH connected to a branching)
- 1.7 ppm: 2H (maybe a CH2)
- 1.4 ppm: 3H (CH3)
- 0.9 ppm: 3H (CH2CH3)

So the substituent on the benzene is a longer chain with branching. Let me try to draw it.

The substituent would be attached to the benzene ring as a R group. The R group's NMR signals: 2.9 ppm is a CH, which is adjacent to a CH2 (1.7 ppm, 2H) and to a CH(CH3) group (1.4 ppm, 3H). Then, the CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm, 3H) is connected to a CH2.

Wait, that would make the substituent: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, that would be a pentyl group with a branch. Or perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH
