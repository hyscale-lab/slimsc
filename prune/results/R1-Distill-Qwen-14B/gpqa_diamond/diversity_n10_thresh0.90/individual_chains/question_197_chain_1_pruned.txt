Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I'm supposed to find the final product based on the IR and NMR data provided. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, I think I should analyze the spectral data to determine what Compound X is. Then, I'll figure out what reaction it undergoes with red phosphorus and HI to find the product.

Looking at the IR data: there are strong peaks in 3400â€“2500 cm-1. That usually indicates OH groups or maybe N-H or C-H stretches. But since the options include benzoic acids, which have -COOH groups, the broad peak around 3400-2500 could be from the O-H stretch. Another peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which fits with a carboxylic acid. Then there are peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which might be C=C aromatic ring stretches.

Now the NMR data: Let's break it down.

1H NMR signals:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is typical for an aldehyde proton, but wait, or maybe a carboxylic acid O-H. But carboxylic acids usually have broad peaks around 10-12 ppm. However, aldehydes are around 9-10, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, if it's a benzaldehyde, the aldehyde proton might be around 9.8-10.5. So this could be an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid O-H. But looking at the options, benzoic acid (option C) would have a COOH group, so that 10.5 ppm peak could be the O-H.

Wait, but option A is a propanoic acid, which would also have a COOH group. So the 10.5 ppm peak is likely the COOH O-H.

Next, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): This looks like two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. For example, in para-substituted benzene, the protons are split into two doublets. So, if the ring has two substituents in para positions, each substituent having two protons. Wait, but in a benzene ring with substituents, the number of protons depends on substitution. For example, a para-substituted benzene with two groups (like two substituents opposite each other) would have each substituent with two protons each. Or perhaps one substituent has two protons, but I might be getting ahead of myself.

Wait, looking at the substituents. Let me think. If it's a benzene ring with substituents at the para positions, the H's ortho and meta to each substituent would give rise to the doublets. For example, in a para-substituted benzene with two identical groups, like two methyl groups in para, but that would cause each set of adjacent H's to be equivalent, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring with one substituent that's a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde), which would cause the adjacent H's to be deshielded and split into doublets.

Looking at the other signals: 2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 ppm (m,2H), 1.4 ppm (d,3H), 0.9 ppm (t,3H). Hmm. Let's think about these. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) is likely a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH2 or a CH. The doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) suggests a CH2CH(CH3) group or similar. The multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H) could be a CH adjacent to some substituents. The 1.7 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group attached to something.

Putting it together: maybe a propyl chain attached to the benzene ring. For example, the benzene ring has a substituent which is a propyl group. Wait, the 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is probably a methyl group attached to a CH2. So maybe it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)- structure.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the substituent is a butyl group. Let's see. The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is a terminal methyl, so perhaps a CH2CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, but butyl groups have more complex splitting. Let me think.

Wait, the substituent could be a propyl group. The signals at 1.7 (2H, m) and 2.9 (1H, m) might be part of a substituent like a CH2CH(CH3) group. Or perhaps a more branched structure.

Wait, let me think about the substituents. The 10.5 peak is likely a COOH group. So the benzene ring has a COOH substituent. Then, the other substituent is a longer chain.

Looking at the aromatic protons: in the NMR, the two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. If the ring has a substituent in para position, like a COOH group and another substituent, let's say a methyl group, but that's not matching the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring has a substituent that's a ketone, but wait, the IR has a carbonyl at 1720, which could be either a ketone or a carboxylic acid. Hmm. Wait, the 1720 cm-1 could be a ketone (around 1715 cm-1) or an ester, but the presence of the broad peak at 10.5 suggests a COOH group, so the 1720 would be the carboxylic acid C=O.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the 1720 is quite high for a carboxylic acid. Typically, carboxylic acids have C=O around 1700 cm-1. Maybe it's an ester? Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like a ketone. Wait, but the IR data also has a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those could be C=C (aromatic) stretches and possibly a carbonyl from a ketone.

Wait, perhaps Compound X is a benzophenone derivative? No, but then looking at the NMR, it's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aromatic ester or a substituted benzene ring with a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a substituted benzaldehyde. Because the 10.5 ppm could be the aldehyde proton. That would fit with the IR data if the 1720 is a carbonyl (from aldehyde), but then the 3400-2500 cm-1 would be the C-H stretch of the aldehyde, but wait, aldehyde C-H is around 2800-2700 cm-1. The 3400-2500 is a broad region, perhaps O-H.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me approach it differently.

Looking at the NMR:

The aromatic region: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That's two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2 H. So, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each being a group that deactivates the ring and causes the adjacent protons to be downfield. For example, substituents like nitro groups, carbonyl groups (like COOH or COOR), etc.

If it's para-substituted with two substituents, each causing the adjacent H's to split into doublets. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent that has two H's, like a -CH2- group attached, but that might not give doublets. Wait, perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene where the substituents are in the para positions, each causing the adjacent H's to split into doublets.

So, for example, para-substituted with a carbonyl group (like COOH) and another substituent, perhaps a methyl group, but that wouldn't give two doublets. Wait, maybe it's a nitro group and a methyl? No, that wouldn't cause the doublets in that way.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent that has two H's, like a -CH2- group or a -CHO.

Wait, another possibility: if the substituent is a group that has two H's, such as a methoxy group. But methoxy is usually OCH3, and the aromatic protons would be more upfield, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent that's a ketone. For example, if the ring has a ketone group in the para position, that could cause the adjacent H's to be deshielded and split into doublets.

Wait, but the 10.5 ppm is a broad peak, which if it's a COOH group, that's a strong indication. So perhaps the substituent is a COOH group.

So, let's say we have a para-substituted benzene with a COOH group and another substituent. The other substituent should account for the NMR signals in the lower field.

Looking at the other signals: 2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 ppm (m,2H), 1.4 ppm (d,3H), 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is likely a methyl group attached to a CH, perhaps a CH(CH3).

Putting it together, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene ring at the para position as well as the COOH group.

Wait, but how? Let me think about the structure.

If the substituent is a propyl group, perhaps as a propyl side chain attached to the ring. For example, maybe something like a benzene ring with a COOH group in one position and a propyl group in the para position.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the substitution pattern. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. Let me consider the signals again.

The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH group next to another CH2. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 connected to another CH2. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl attached to a CH. So perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group.

Wait, putting it all together: the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached to the ring. And that would come from a longer chain, like a butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group? No, that would have more H's.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. Because an isobutyl group has a CH2 connected to a CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, an isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)2? No, no, wait. Isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, no. Wait, isobutyl is (CH2)CH(CH3)2. No, wait, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, but let me think.
