Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2. So, the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the operator for angular momentum components like L_x, L_y, L_z are proportional to these sigma matrices. But here, it's the operator P, which I'm guessing is related to spin, since we're dealing with a muon, which has spin-1/2.

So, the operator P must be the spin operator, and it's given in terms of its components. The eigenvector we're looking for corresponds to spin-up along direction n with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The question is asking for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. The options are given as A to D, each with different expressions.

First, let me write down the components of the operator P:

P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, so the operator P for spin would be the vector sum of these components multiplied by the direction vector n. Since n lies in the x-z plane, n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), maybe? Or wait, wait. Let me think. If the direction is in the x-z plane, then the angle φ is zero. So the direction would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So, the unit vector n is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since it's in x-z plane, φ is 0. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

So the operator P along n would be P · n, which is P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ. Because P_y would be multiplied by 0.

So the operator P_n is (P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ) * (ħ/2).

Wait, no, wait a second. Because each component P_x, P_y, P_z is already (ħ/2) multiplied by their respective matrices. So the operator along direction n is (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z), right?

So substituting the values, since n is in x-z plane, n_y = 0. So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Since n is a unit vector, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. So,

P_n = (sinθ) * P_x + (cosθ) * P_z.

But P_x is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], and P_z is (ħ/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]]. So let's compute this.

Putting it all together:

P_n = (sinθ) * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + (cosθ) * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me factor out (ħ/2):

P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix inside:

sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]

cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]

Adding them together:

[[0 + cosθ, sinθ + 0], [sinθ + 0, 0 - cosθ]]

So the matrix becomes:

[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So P_n is (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix.

Now, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is:

P_n |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>

Which can be written as:

[ (ħ/2) * M ] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Where M is the matrix [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Divide both sides by (ħ/2), we get:

M |ψ> = |ψ>

So M is the matrix we need to diagonalize, looking for eigenvectors with eigenvalue 1.

So the equation is (M - I) |ψ> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So M - I is:

[ cosθ - 1, sinθ ],
[ sinθ, -cosθ - 1 ]

The determinant of (M - I) should be zero for non-trivial solutions.

Compute the determinant:

(cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)(sinθ) = 0

Expand this:

Multiply (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = (-cosθ)(cosθ -1) -1*(cosθ -1)
= (-cos²θ + cosθ) + (-cosθ +1)
Wait, perhaps a better approach: expand the product.

(cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = -(cosθ)(cosθ) -cosθ + cosθ +1

Which simplifies to: -cos²θ + 0 +1.

Then, subtract (sinθ)^2:

So determinant is (-cos²θ +1) - sin²θ = 0

But wait, -cos²θ +1 is sin²θ. So,

sin²θ - sin²θ = 0. So yes, determinant is zero, as expected.

So the equations to solve are:

(cosθ -1) ψ1 + sinθ ψ2 = 0
sinθ ψ1 + (-cosθ -1) ψ2 = 0

Let me take the first equation:

(cosθ -1) ψ1 +
