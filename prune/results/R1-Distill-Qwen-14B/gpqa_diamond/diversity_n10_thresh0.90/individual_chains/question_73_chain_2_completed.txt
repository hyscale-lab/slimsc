Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question says there are two astronauts. One has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, and the other has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. We need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the velocities, right? Because at high speeds, you can't just do a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula. I remember the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me write that down.

So, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. But wait, which one's the reference frame? Oh wait, the relative speed would be how fast one is moving from the other's frame. So if I'm astronaut A, I'm at rest, and I see astronaut B moving at (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by... Wait, no. Because in relativity, the relative velocity isn't just the difference. So I should apply the formula correctly.

Wait, actually, the formula is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)) when calculating the relative speed of two objects moving in the same direction. So here, v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. So plugging in, it's (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/(c²)).

Calculating the numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. So approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Now, the total energy of the system. Since the system is both astronauts, we need to calculate the relativistic energy for each and sum them up. Remember that relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for astronaut A: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c. Gamma for A is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E_A = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E_B = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Then total energy E_total = 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and D says 5 mc².

So the relative speed is 0.14c, and the energy is about 5.96 mc². Looking back at the options, option C says 0.14c and 5.96 mc². So option C is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the energy calculations. For A: 0.6c, so (0.6)^2 is 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64, sqrt is 0.8. Gamma is 5/4, so 1.25. So 2m * 1.25 = 2.5 mc². That's correct.

For B: 0.5c. (0.5)^2 is 0.25. 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is about 0.866, so gamma is 1/0.866 ≈ 1.1547. 3m * 1.1547 ≈ 3.464. Adding 2.5 and 3.464 gives 5.964, which rounds to 5.96 mc². So yes, option C is correct.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut A
Astronaut A has mass \(2m\) and velocity \(0.6c\). Calculating \(\gamma\):

\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

The energy of astronaut A is:

\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut B
Astronaut B has mass \(3m\) and velocity \(0.5c\). Calculating \(\gamma\):

\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

The energy of astronaut B is:

\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of both astronauts:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96mc^2\)**
