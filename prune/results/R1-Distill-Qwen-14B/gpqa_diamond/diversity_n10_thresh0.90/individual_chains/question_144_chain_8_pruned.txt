Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about mesons and their decay. Hmm, I need to find the mean decay distance. Let me think about what I remember from my classes.

So, the question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. So it's a very tiny distance, which makes sense because particles decay quickly.

Wait, decay distance... I think it has something to do with the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Because the mean lifetime is related to the width, right? Oh yeah, the uncertainty principle. The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ is ħ divided by Γ.

But wait, Γ is the decay width, which is the total energy uncertainty. So the lifetime τ would be inversely proportional to Γ. But I have to be careful with the units here.

Once I have τ, I need to find how far the meson travels before decaying. That depends on its velocity and lifetime. So distance L = v * τ. But what's the velocity?

The meson's energy E is given as 8 GeV, and its mass is 1.2 GeV. So I can find its momentum using E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Wait, but since E and m are given in GeV and GeV/c², perhaps I should work in natural units where c=1, but I have to remember to convert units properly later.

Wait, let's think in natural units first. In natural units, E² = p² + m². So p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(8^2 -1.2^2) GeV. Let's calculate that. 8 squared is 64, 1.2 squared is 1.44. So 64 -1.44 = 62.56. Square root of 62.56 is about 7.91 GeV. So p ≈7.91 GeV/c.

Then, the velocity beta (β) is p c / E. Since E is 8 GeV, and p is 7.91 GeV/c, then β = (7.91 GeV/c * c) / 8 GeV = 7.91/8 ≈0.98875.

So β is approximately 0.98875. So the velocity is 0.98875c, which is pretty close to the speed of light.

Now, the lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. Wait, Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV. Let me calculate τ.

But wait, ħ has units of GeV·s or something? Let me recall the value of ħ in GeV·s. I think ħ is about 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ≈ 2.056e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. So 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Once I have τ, multiply by velocity and c to get distance. So L = β c τ.

Wait, β is 0.98875, c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So let's compute that:

L = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s.

Compute this step by step.

First, 3e8 m/s times 2.056e-24 s is 3e8 * 2.056e-24 = 6.168e-16 meters.

Then, multiply by 0.98875: 6.168e-16 * 0.98875 ≈ 6.1e-16 * 0.99 is about 6.0e-16. Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 6.168e-16 * 0.98875 = ?

Compute 6.168 * 0.98875 ≈ let's see:

6.168 * 0.98875 = 

6 * 0.98875 is 5.9325. 0.168 * 0.98875 ≈ 0.166. So total ≈5.9325 + 0.166≈6.0985. So 6.0985e-16 m.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are around 6e-16. So maybe I made a mistake?

Wait, options are A:5.02e-16, B:4.06e-15, C:5.02e-15, D:4.06e-16.

Hmm, none match 6e-16. So perhaps I messed up a calculation.

Let me go back and check each step.

First, the calculation of p: p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2) in natural units.

E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

p = sqrt(8^2 - 1.2^2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) = approximately 7.91 GeV/c. That seems correct.

Beta is p c / E.

Wait, in natural units, c=1, so beta = p / E.

So 7.91 /8 = 0.98875. Correct.

Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. Correct.

Calculating tau: tau= hbar / Gamma. But wait, hbar is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = ?

6.582 / 0.32 ≈20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s. That seems correct.

Then L = beta * c * tau.

c is 3e8 m/s. So:

beta * c * tau = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s.

Wait, let's compute 3e8 * 2.056e-24 = 6.168e-16 m/s * s → 6.168e-16 m.

Then multiply by 0.98875 → 6.168e-16 * 0.98875 ≈6.1e-16 m.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the decay width and lifetime? Or perhaps the formula.

Wait, another formula for the mean decay length: L = (c * tau) * beta.

Wait, but perhaps the lifetime is given by the mean lifetime, which is tau= hbar/(Gamma). Or is it something else? Because the decay width is related to the lifetime by Gamma = ħ / tau.

Wait, no, I think that's correct. Gamma is the total decay width, which is ħ/tau. So tau = ħ / Gamma.

So that part was correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider relativistic gamma factor? Oh wait, no. Because the mean lifetime I'm using is the proper lifetime, and the observed lifetime is longer by gamma, but in this case, the meson's lifetime is tau. The velocity is already beta c, so when you multiply by beta c tau, that gives the length. But wait, is the lifetime the proper time or the dilated time?

Hmm, perhaps I'm confused. Let's think: the particle's lifetime is tau (proper time), but when you calculate the distance, you have to consider the time it lives from the lab frame. But in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma. Wait, no, because the lifetime is the proper time. Wait, no, if the particle is moving, the lab frame measures a longer lifetime due to time dilation. So the mean lifetime in the lab frame would be gamma * tau.

Wait, that's a crucial point. So earlier, I calculated tau as the proper lifetime, but when we're in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma, so the distance would be L = beta c gamma tau.

Ah, so I forgot to include the gamma factor. That must be where I went wrong.

So, I need to calculate gamma. Gamma is E/(m c²), right? Because in natural units, E = gamma m c², so gamma = E/(m c²). But since we are working in natural units where c=1, gamma is just E/m.

So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8/1.2 ≈6.6667.

So now, the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau.

So tau_lab = gamma * tau.

So L = beta c tau_lab = beta c gamma tau.

Wait, but tau is hbar / Gamma. So, let me recompute:

First, tau = hbar / Gamma = 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056e-24 s.

Gamma factor = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666667.

So tau_lab = 6.66667 * 2.056e-24 s ≈1.3706e-23 s.

Then, L = beta * c * tau_lab.

Beta is 0.98875, c=3e8 m/s.

So L = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s * 1.3706e-23 s.

Compute 3e8 * 1.3706e-23 = 4.1118e-15 m.

Multiply by 0.98875: 4.1118e-15 * 0.98875 ≈4.068e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m and option C is 5.02e-15. So 4.068e-15 is very close to option B.

Which is 4.0655e-15 m. So probably the correct answer is B.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations with more precise numbers.

Let me compute gamma more accurately. Gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666..., exactly 20/3.

Tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = Let's compute 6.582 / 0.32.

6.582 ÷ 0.32. Let's compute:

0.32 * 20 is 6.4. 6.582 -6.4 =0.182.

0.32 * 0.56875 ≈0.182. So 20.56875. So tau is 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Gamma is 20/3 ≈6.6666666667.

So tau_lab = 6.666666667 * 2.056875e-24 = Let's calculate:

2.056875e-24 *6.666666667 = 2.056875 * (20/3) e-24 = (2.056875 *20 /3) e-24.

2.056875 *20 =41.1375. 41.1375 /3 =13.7125.

So tau_lab =13.7125e-24 s =1.37125e-23 s.

Now, L = beta c tau_lab.

Beta is 7.91 /8 = 0.98875.

So L = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s *1.37125e-23 s.

Calculating 3e8 *1.37125e-23 = 4.11375e-15 m.

Multiply by 0.98875: 4.11375e-15 * 0.98875.

Let me compute 4.11375 * 0.98875.

4.11375 * 0.98875.

Hmm, 4 *0.98875 is 3.955. 0.11375 *0.98875 is approx 0.1124. So total approx 4.0674.

So 4.0674e-15 m.

Which is very close to option B, 4.0655e-15 m. So that's probably the right answer.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we start by analyzing the given parameters: production energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \), and decay width \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). The mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime \( \tau \), velocity \( \beta \), and the speed of light \( c \), and is given by:

\[
L = \beta c \tau
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the momentum \( p \)
Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation \( E^2 = p^2 + m^2 \) (in natural units where \( c = 1 \)), we find:

\[
p = \sqrt{E^2 - m^2} = \sqrt{8^2 - 1.2^2} = \sqrt{64 - 1.44} = \sqrt{62.56} \approx 7.91 \, \text{GeV}/c
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the velocity \( \beta \)
The velocity \( \beta \) is given by:

\[
\beta = \frac{p}{E} = \frac{7.91}{8} \approx 0.98875
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the lifetime \( \tau \)
The lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by the uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \) and \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \), we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Relativistic correction for the lifetime
The particle's lifetime in the lab frame is extended due to time dilation by a factor of \( \gamma \), where:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

Thus, the lab-frame lifetime is:

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau = 6.6667 \times 2.056 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.371 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \beta c \tau_{\text{lab}}
\]

Substituting \( \beta \approx 0.98875 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \approx 1.371 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \), we compute:

\[
L = 0.98875 \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 1.371 \times 10^{-23}
\]

First, calculate \( 3 \times 10^8 \times 1.371 \times 10^{-23} \):

\[
3 \times 10^8 \times 1.371 \times 10^{-23} = 4.113 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

Then multiply by \( \beta \approx 0.98875 \):

\[
L = 4.113 \times 10^{-15} \times 0.98875 \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.0655 \times
