Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka is 1.85e-5.

First, I think I need to figure out the concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution. Because when you dilute a solution, the number of moles stays the same, but the volume increases.

So, original volume is 20 cm³, concentration 0.05 M. Moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

Then, we add 20 cm³ of water. So total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles / volume. 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, 20 + 20 is 40 cm³. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So first, I need to find out how much moles of acetic acid are present, and then find the moles of NaOH added.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol (from earlier). 25% of that is 0.00025 mol. That's the amount of NaOH added, since each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid.

Now, the total solution when 25% is titrated. The diluted solution was 40 cm³. How much NaOH is added? Let's calculate the volume.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. Moles of NaOH = 0.00025 mol. Volume NaOH = moles / Molarity = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³. So the total solution is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³.

Wait, but maybe I don't need the volume for the 25% point. Let me think. After adding 25% of the required NaOH, what's the situation.

In the solution, we'll have some unreacted acetic acid and some acetate ions. Let's denote the initial moles:

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.001 mol.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.00025 mol.

So, moles of CH3COOH after reaction: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- (acetate): 0.00025 mol.

So the solution now has both weak acid and its conjugate base. That means we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Wait, but what about the concentrations? The total volume is 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

Concentration of CH3COOH: 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

Concentration of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 1.85e-5 is 5. So pKa is 4.746 ≈ 4.75.

Then, pH = 4.75 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Let me calculate that ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(1/3) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.75 - 0.477 ≈ 4.273. Hmm, that's around 4.27. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. Close enough, so that might be the pH at 25%.

Wait, but wait—maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me recalculate.

pKa: 1.85e-5 → let's get precise. Let's calculate log(1.85e-5). Log(1.85)=0.267, so 5 - 0.267 =4.733? Wait, no. Wait, log(1.85e-5) = log(1.85) + log(1e-5) → 0.2672 -5 = -4.7328. So pKa is 4.7328, approximately 4.73.

Henderson equation: pH = 4.73 + log( (0.00025) / (0.00075) ) → because [A^-] is 0.00025 and [HA] is 0.00075.

Wait, no, the ratio is [A^-]/[HA] = (0.00025) / (0.00075) = 1/3. Log(1/3)= -0.4771.

So pH = 4.73 - 0.4771 =4.2529. So around 4.25. So option A says 4.26; that's very close. So the first value is 4.26.

Now, what about the equivalence point?

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized. So moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. So moles of NaOH needed: 0.001 mol.

Volume of NaOH needed: 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L =10 cm³.

So the total solution volume is 40 +10=50 cm³ =0.05 L.

But wait, when we mix them, the NaOH will convert all the acetic acid to acetate ions. But the solution will consist of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So the solution will be basic.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈5.405e-10.

So the Kb is 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

So for a weak base, the hydrolysis reaction will produce OH-.

The Kb expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is small compared to 0.02, so:

Kb ≈ x^2 / 0.02 → x^2 = Kb * 0.02 → x^2 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 =1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6.

So [OH-] =3.288e-6 → pOH = -log(3.288e-6).

Log(3.288)=0.516. So pOH ≈5.484.

Then, pH =14 -5.484=8.516, approximately 8.52.

Hmm, looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. So that would make the first part 4.26 and the equivalence point 8.52. So the option A would be the answer.

Wait, but other options have different equivalence points. Option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Wait, that would be if the equivalence point is around 7, but that's not the case here because acetate is a weak base.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, the concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So when it hydrolyzes, the Kb is correct?

Kw=1e-14, Ka=1.85e-5 → Kb=1e-14 /1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10. Correct.

So the Kb is small, but the concentration is 0.02 M. So the x (OH-) is about sqrt(0.02 *5.4e-10) → sqrt(1.08e-11) = ~3.28e-6. So [OH-] is about 3.28e-6 → pOH is about 5.48 → pH 8.52.

So that seems correct. So the equivalence point pH is around 8.52.

So the first value is about 4.26, second about 8.52. So option A.

Let me check the other options. Option D has 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, 6.92 is lower, but our calculation suggests 8.52. So that can't be.

Option B is 3.17 and 6.73. No, the equivalence point is higher.

Option C is 4.73 and 7.00. That would be if the solution was a buffer with equal concentrations (pH=pKa), but that's only when the ratio is 1. So at 25% titration, perhaps? But our calculation for the 25% was about 4.26, which is lower than pKa.

Wait, wait, another approach for the 25% titration: maybe I should calculate it using exact concentrations.

But using the Henderson equation should be okay. Wait, let me recalculate the exact pH.

So, in the solution:

Molarity of CH3COOH (HA) is 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

Molarity of acetate (A^-) is 0.00025 /0.0425= 0.005882 M.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.333333...

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log(1/3) → pKa is 4.73, log(1/3)= -0.4771.

So pH =4.73 -0.4771=4.2529≈4.25, which rounds to 4.25. So option A says 4.26, which is very close.

At equivalence point, pH is around 8.52.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.25 \times 0.001 \, \text{mol} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of unreacted acetic acid and acetate ions are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]
\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ions are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.

### At Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming sodium acetate. The moles of sodium acetate are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.020 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{\text{K}_w}{\text{K}_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation \([\text{OH}^-] = x\), we solve:

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} \implies x^2 = \text{K}_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.41 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.020 = 1.08 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.08 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6}.
\]

Thus, \([\text{OH}^-] = 3.29 \times 10^{-6}\), and the pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48.
\]

The pH at the equivalence point is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
