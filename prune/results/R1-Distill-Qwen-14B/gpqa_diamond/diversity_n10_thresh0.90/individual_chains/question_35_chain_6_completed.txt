Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on angular momentum operators, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator Ay is given as a 2x2 matrix, and it's expressed as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h over 4π, right? And the matrix S has rows (0, -i) and (i, 0). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh yeah, that's the Pauli Y matrix, I think.

So the problem is asking about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. But more specifically, it's about which statement is correct regarding the process.

First, let me write down the matrix Ay. Since c is h/(4π), and S is the given 2x2 matrix, Ay should be:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

But wait, the Pauli matrices usually have a factor of i in some places. Let me make sure I'm getting the matrix right. Oh wait, S is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is actually -i times the Pauli Y matrix. Because the standard Pauli Y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so maybe S is the same as the Pauli Y? Wait, no, sometimes definitions vary. Let's just go with what's given.

Now, to find the eigenvalues of Ay, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue. So let's compute that.

The matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ (h/(4π)) * 0 - a , (h/(4π)) * (-i) ]
[ (h/(4π)) * i , (h/(4π)) * 0 - a ]

So the determinant is ( (-a)(-a) ) - [ (h/(4π)) * (-i) ) * (h/(4π)) * i ) ]

Wait, the diagonal terms are -a, and the off-diagonal terms are (h/(4π)) * (-i) and (h/(4π)) * i.

So the determinant is (a^2) - [ (h^2/(4π)^2) * (-i)(i) ) ]

Since (-i)(i) is (-i^2) which is -(-1) because i^2 is -1. So that gives us (h^2/(4π)^2) * (1) )

So the equation becomes:

a^2 - (h^2)/(16 π^2) = 0

Which simplifies to a^2 = h^2/(16 π^2)

Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π)

Wait, so the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). Hmm, so that's real numbers. So the eigenvalues are purely real? But wait, that's what I get from the determinant.

But wait a second, I thought angular momentum components have eigenvalues that are real and multiples of ħ/2, where ħ is h/(2π). Because for spin-1/2 particles, like electrons or muons, the possible eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

Wait, let me compute that. Because ħ is h/(2π), so ħ/2 is h/(4π). Oh, right! So the eigenvalues I found are ± h/(4π), which are exactly ± ħ/2. That makes sense because the spin is 1/2, so S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are real: a = ± h/(4π)

But looking at the options, let's see what they say.

Option A: The imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). No, because the eigenvalues are real, so imaginary parts are zero. So A is wrong.

Option B: Eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. That doesn't make sense because our calculation shows the eigenvalues are real. So B is wrong.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Wait, A² is the square of the angular momentum operator. Since A is the angular momentum component, A² is S² scaled by c². For a spin-1/2 particle, S² has eigenvalue (1/2)(1/2+1)ħ² = 3ħ²/4. So A² would be c² multiplied by that. Since the eigenfunctions of S_y are the same as the eigenfunctions of S² and S_z? Or wait, no, the eigenfunctions of S² are the same for any direction because S² is the Casimir operator. But eigenfunctions of S_y are not eigenfunctions of S_z unless they're in a simultaneous eigenstate, which they aren't.

So for any eigenstate of Ay, it's an eigenstate of A² (since A² is diagonal in the same basis as S², which commutes with S²). So the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². But are they eigenfunctions of Az? No, because Ay and Az don't commute. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it can't be an eigenstate of Az (unless it's a simultaneous eigenstate, which is only possible for commuting operators, which they aren't here). So option C is correct. Let me note that.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm. Well, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, but "the basis functions of the matrix operator." I'm not sure what that means. The matrix is 2x2, so it's in a two-dimensional space, and any two linearly independent eigenvectors would form a basis. So yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator, but I'm not entirely sure if that's what the option is saying. Alternatively, maybe the statement is incorrect because the operator is in a 2x2 space, and the eigenvectors are just the basis vectors for that space, but perhaps the wording is off. Alternatively, perhaps all eigenvectors are in the basis, but I'm not certain. So maybe option D is correct? Or perhaps it's not necessarily correct.

Wait, the statement D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. I think this is always true because the matrix is 2x2, and its eigenvectors (if they form a basis, which they do since it's diagonalizable) form the basis for the vector space. So D is correct? But I'm not sure if "basis functions of the matrix operator" is the correct terminology. Perhaps the intended meaning is that the eigenvectors form a basis, which is true. So statement D is correct?

Wait, but earlier I thought C is correct. Let me think again. Statement C: the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Well, yes, because A² commutes with Ay, so any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². But they can't be eigenstates of Az because Ay and Az don't commute. So statement C is correct.

So now, looking at the options, the correct statements are C and maybe D. Wait, but the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, the options are about which statement is correct regarding the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So looking back, options A and B are about the eigenvalues. We've established that the eigenvalues are real and ± h/(4π). So options A and B are incorrect because they suggest imaginary parts.

Option C: Correct, as discussed.

Option D: It's correct that the eigenfunctions form a basis, but the statement says "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

Wait, the matrix operator is 2x2, so its eigenvectors are vectors in a 2D space. So any set of two eigenvectors (if they are distinct) would form a basis for the space, which is the same as the basis used for the matrix. So statement D is correct.

Wait, but the question is which of the statements is correct during the calculation. So both C and D could be correct. But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the options are presented as multiple-choice, so only one is correct.

So let me reevaluate.

Statement C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of Az.

Because A² and Ay commute, any eigenvector of Ay is also an eigenvector of A². So statement C is correct.

Statement D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis, statement D is correct.

But wait, the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps more than one is correct, but looking at the options, I think only one is correct.

Wait, let me think again. The question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So let's go through the options again.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the operator is 2x2, and the eigenvectors span the space, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are indeed the basis functions (basis vectors) for the operator. So D is correct.

But the problem is that the matrix operator has eigenvectors that form a basis, but the matrix itself is in a certain representation. So the statement is correct.

Hmm, but the question is about which statement is correct. So if both C and D are correct, which is the case? Or perhaps only C is correct.

Wait, let me re-examine the options.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. That's correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Which is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space on which Ay operates.

So which of these is a correct statement? Both seem correct. But perhaps the options are trying to get at something else.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So during the calculation, what happens? The calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors involves solving (Ay - a I)|φ> = 0.

So during this calculation, the matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvectors must form a basis. So statement D's correctness is more of a general statement about linear algebra, not something specific to the calculation steps. Whereas statement C is about the properties of the eigenvectors beyond just the calculation itself.

But the question is about what you consider correct during the calculation. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct because when you find the eigenvectors, they form a basis for the space, which is exactly what the matrix operator operates on. So statement D is correct.

Hmm, but earlier, I thought statement C was correct. Maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think: A^2 is the square of the angular momentum operator. Since Ay and A^2 commute, any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So option C is correct.

But in the calculation, we don't necessarily compute A², so perhaps the correct statement is D.

Wait, the question is about what you consider correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So perhaps during the calculation, the fact that the eigenfunctions form a basis (statement D) is essential because you can express any vector in the space as a linear combination of the eigenvectors.

So in that case, statement D would be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps D is not necessarily correct. Because the matrix operator may not be diagonal in that basis. Wait, no, the eigenvectors are the basis in which the matrix is diagonal. So the operator's matrix representation is diagonal in the basis of its eigenvectors.

So for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors will form a basis, so statement D is correct.

But the options are the statements. So perhaps the correct answer is C and D are correct, but since this is a multiple-choice question, only one is correct.

Wait, let me read the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Yes, correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

Which is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator's space. So D is also correct.

But looking at the given options, perhaps only C is correct.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation, such as when performing the eigenvalue and eigenvector analysis.

So during the calculation, you find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The eigenfunctions form a basis, so D is correct. And since the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A², C is correct.

But the options are presented as individual statements. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but only one is an option.

Wait, looking back, the options are A, B, C, D.

In the original problem, option C is correct, and option D is correct. But according to the question, only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again about the eigenvalues.

Wait, I thought Ay has eigenvalues ± h/(4π). So options A and B are wrong because they talk about imaginary parts, but the eigenvalues are real.

So the correct eigenvalues are real, so the correct options are C and D.

But looking back, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, perhaps statement C is correct because it's a property of the eigenfunctions beyond just their existence as eigenvectors.

Hmm, but I'm a bit stuck between options C and D. Let me think about the statements again.

Statement C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That's correct.

Statement D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That's correct because the operator is 2x2, and the eigenfunctions form a basis.

But perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So while calculating, the fact that the eigenfunctions form a basis (D) is a given because any 2x2 matrix's eigenvectors (assuming they are distinct) form a basis. So D is a correct statement.

But which option is correct? Let me look again at the options. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation.

So during the calculation process, which statement is correct.

Statement D is correct because the eigenvectors you find will form a basis for the operator.

So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but earlier I thought C was correct too.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think about the options again.

The question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but let me look at the options.

Looking back, the options are:

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

So, for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors form a basis. So statement D is correct.

But statement C is correct in another sense. So perhaps the correct answer is both C and D, but since only one option is correct, which is it?

Wait, the question says "which statement below will you consider to be correct?" So only one option.

Wait, perhaps statement C is correct.

Because when you're calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, you find that the eigenvectors are also eigenvectors of A². But they are not eigenvectors of Az.

So the correct statement is C.

So the answer is C.


The problem involves determining the correct statement regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), for a muon. The operator is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix with the first row \((0, -i)\) and the second row \((i, 0)\). The task is to analyze the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( A_y \) and evaluate the correctness of the provided statements.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( A_y \) is explicitly written as:
     \[
     A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
     \]
   - To find the eigenvalues, solve the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \). This leads to:
     \[
     a^2 - \left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2 = 0,
     \]
     giving eigenvalues \( a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real numbers. These correspond to \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), where \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \), consistent with the spin-1/2 nature of the muon.

2. **Evaluation of Options:**
   - **Option A:** Suggests the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm 2\pi h \) and real parts \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).
   - **Option B:** Suggests the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and real parts \( \pm 1 \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \) (the Z-component of angular momentum). This is correct because \( A_y \) and \( A^2 \) commute, so any eigenstate of \( A_y \) is also an eigenstate of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) cannot be eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).
   - **Option D:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is correct because the eigenvectors of a 2×2 matrix form a basis for the vector space in which the operator acts. However, this statement is more of a general property of linear algebra and does not specifically address the properties of \( A_y \) or its eigenfunctions in the context of angular momentum.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Both options C and D are correct in different senses. However, the question asks for the statement that is correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Option C specifically addresses the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), making it the most relevant and correct choice.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
