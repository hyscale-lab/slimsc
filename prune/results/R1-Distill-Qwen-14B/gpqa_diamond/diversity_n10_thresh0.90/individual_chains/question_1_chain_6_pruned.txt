Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about two quantum states with different energies, E1 and E2, and their lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Wait, I remember that the lifetime of an energy level is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is on the order of ħ/2, maybe? So the formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

Here, Δt would be the lifetime of the state, because that's the time it exists before decaying or something. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is about ħ divided by (2 times the lifetime). But wait, since we have two different lifetimes, maybe each state has its own uncertainty.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Let me think. So the energy levels have their own lifetimes. The energy difference must be sufficiently large so that the lines don't overlap when measured. How does the uncertainty in energy affect the ability to resolve them?

Oh, I think the idea is that if the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainties in their energies, then we can distinguish them. Otherwise, if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might blend together and we can't tell them apart.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE_i = ħ/(2 τ_i), where τ_i is the lifetime of state i.

So for state 1, τ1 is 1e-9 seconds. Let me calculate ΔE1. And for state 2, τ2 is 1e-8 seconds, so ΔE2.

But wait, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 would be E2 - E1. To resolve them, we need ΔE >> ΔE1 and ΔE >> ΔE2. Because if ΔE is much bigger than the uncertainties, the peaks won't overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal required ΔE is the sum of the uncertainties, or maybe the larger uncertainty. Hmm, not sure. Let me think.

Alternatively, I remember that the natural line width is given by ΔE ≈ ħ/(τ), because the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime.

Wait, but in the context of this question, each state has its own line width. So for state 1, the line width (full width at half maximum) is proportional to 1/τ1, and similarly for state 2.

So the two lines (from E1 and E2) must be spaced apart by more than the sum of their line widths to be distinguishable. Because if they're too close, their spectral lines might overlap and you can't tell them apart.

So the minimal energy difference ΔE should be greater than the sum of the line widths (ΔE1 + ΔE2) for the two states.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference needs to be greater than the maximum of the two line widths. Because if ΔE is larger than the maximum line width, then probably they are resolvable.

But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think about the formula again. The natural line width is given by the uncertainty principle. The energy uncertainty is approximately ħ/(τ), so the line width is about 2π times that, maybe, but perhaps in this problem, we're just considering the order of magnitude without the constants.

So, for state 1, the uncertainty is ΔE1 = ħ / (2 τ1). And for state 2, ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2).

Compute these for the given τ's.

Since ħ is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s.

Let me calculate ΔE1: τ1 is 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-9) ) eV.

Wait, 2e-9 is 2*1e-9, so 6.582e-16 divided by 2e-9.

Let me compute that: 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-7 = 3.291e-7 eV.

So about 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, for state 2, τ2 is 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = (6.582e-16) / (2e-8) ) = (6.582e-16)/(2e-8) = (6.582 /2) * 1e-8 = 3.291e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 3.3e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 3.3e-8 eV.

So the line widths are 3.3e-7 for E1 and 3.3e-8 for E2.

Now, the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than the sum of these uncertainties to be resolvable. So ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Adding them: 3.3e-7 + 3.3e-8 = 3.63e-7 eV.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the energy difference is E2 - E1, which is the absolute value. So the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, because each state's energy has its own uncertainty.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the maximum of the two, but I think the sum is more correct because you don't want the
