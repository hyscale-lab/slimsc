Okay, so I'm trying to solve this particle physics problem. Let's read through it again.

The question is about the decay modes of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f-bar ψ(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, not entirely sure, but I think the interaction term is probably something like λ times some Yukawa coupling. But maybe the exact form isn't too important for determining the decay products.

The key point is the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to figure out which fermions X can decay into. Remember, particles can decay into fermions if the total energy of the fermion pair is less than the mass of X.

So, the mass of X is 6 GeV. Each fermion pair would require twice the mass of the fermion because you need to create a particle and its antiparticle. So, for each possible fermion f, 2m_f must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, but which fermions are available? Let's list them with their masses.

Quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), top (t). But top quarks are super heavy, around 173 GeV, so 2m_t is way over 6 GeV. So top is out.

Leptons: electron (e), muon (μ), tau (τ), and neutrinos (but since X is a boson and the decay would need charged leptons, probably considering e, μ, τ).

Wait, but wait. The Lagrangian has ψ_f and f-bar terms. So ψ is a fermion field, and f is probably the flavor index. The interaction term would allow X to couple to fermions ψ_f.

But perhaps the exact fermions that X can couple to depend on the term. The structure is L = -λ f f-bar ψ(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe that's Yukawa-like. Wait, perhaps the interaction is Yukawa, so X couples to certain fermions. But I'm not certain about that. Alternatively, perhaps the fermions that X can decay into are all possible, given that the interaction term allows it for any ψ_f. Or maybe not. 

Wait, but the problem statement says that the interaction is given by that Lagrangian. So the term involves ψ_f. So probably, X can interact with any fermion ψ_f, but the mass of X is 6 GeV. So possible decays would be into any fermion pair where 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

So, let's list the masses:

Light quarks:
u: about 2.2 MeV. So 2m_u is ~4.4 MeV <<6 GeV. So u and anti-u can be produced.

d: around 4.7 MeV. 2m_d is ~9.4 MeV. Also way under 6 GeV. So d and anti-d.

s: around 95 MeV. 2m_s ~190 MeV, which is 0.19 GeV. Still under 6 GeV, so s and anti-s.

c: about 1.3 GeV. 2m_c is ~2.6 GeV. 2.6 < 6, so c and anti-c.

b: around 4.7 GeV. 2m_b is about 9.4 GeV, which is larger than 6 GeV. So b and anti-b can't be produced because 9.4 >6 GeV. So b is out.

t quark is way too heavy, so no.

Leptons:

e: ~0.5 MeV. 2m_e ~1 MeV. So e+ e- can be produced.

mu: ~105.7 MeV. 2m_mu ~211 MeV <<6 GeV. So mu+ mu- can be produced.

tau: ~1.78 GeV. 2m_tau ~3.56 GeV. 3.56 <6 GeV. So tau+ tau- can be produced.

Wait, but wait. So for quarks, you can have up, down, strange, charm. But wait, the up quark is so light, but they're included as decay products.

So possible fermion pairs are:

u u-bar,
d d-bar,
s s-bar,
c c-bar,
e+ e-,
mu+ mu-,
tau+ tau-.

Wait, but what about other particles like the top quark? No, as we've already considered.

So the possible decay channels are X → (uū), (d d̄), (s s̄), (c c̄), (e+ e-), (mu+ mu-), (tau+ tau-).

Looking at the options:

Option A: includes b and s and u and d, etc. But X is 6 GeV, so b b-bar is 2 *4.7=9.4 GeV, which is more than 6. So option A is wrong because it includes b b-bar.

Option B: includes c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau, mu, e. So that's all the possible fermions we listed except for the b. Also, in option B, tau and mu are in there. So option B would be a candidate.

Option C: includes c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, t t-bar, tau, mu, e. But t is 173 GeV, 2m_t way above 6, so option C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b, which is not allowed, so D is out.

So the correct decay modes are the ones in option B.

Wait, but wait. The options:

Option B: c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau, mu, e. So that's all except b, which is correct.

Option A includes b, which is wrong.

So the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction term in the Lagrangian, \(\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}(y) (v + X(y)) \psi_f(y)\), suggests that \( X \) can couple to fermions \(\psi_f\). The decay products of \( X \) must satisfy the condition that the total mass of the fermion-antifermion pair is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Analysis of Fermion Masses:
1. **Quarks**:
   - \( u \): \( m_u \approx 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_u \approx 4.4 \, \text{MeV} \) (\( \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \)), so \( u \bar{u} \) is allowed.
   - \( d \): \( m_d \approx 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_d \approx 9.4 \, \text{MeV} \) (\( \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \)), so \( d \bar{d} \) is allowed.
   - \( s \): \( m_s \approx 95 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_s \approx 190 \, \text{MeV} \) (\( \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \)), so \( s \bar{s} \) is allowed.
   - \( c \): \( m_c \approx 1.3 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \approx 2.6 \, \text{GeV} \) (\( < 6 \, \text{GeV} \)), so \( c \bar{c} \) is allowed.
   - \( b \): \( m_b \approx 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \approx 9.4 \, \text{GeV} \) (\( > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)), so \( b \bar{b} \) is **not** allowed.
   - \( t \): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \) (\( \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \)), so \( t \bar{t} \) is **not** allowed.

2. **Leptons**:
   - \( e \): \( m_e \approx 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_e \approx 1 \, \text{MeV} \) (\( \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \)), so \( e^+ e^- \) is allowed.
   - \( \mu \): \( m_\mu \approx 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \approx 211 \, \text{MeV} \) (\( \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \)), so \( \mu^+ \mu^- \) is allowed.
   - \( \tau \): \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \) (\( < 6 \, \text{GeV} \)), so \( \tau^+ \tau^- \) is allowed.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \rightarrow c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), as listed in **Option B**.
