Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully.

So, the setup is about a star similar to the Sun. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots, and these spots have a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because the star is rotating, the spots will cause brightness variations that look like those from an exoplanet transit. The question is asking, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as these spots do.

Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. The formula I think is (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet radius and Rstar is the star's radius.

But wait, in this case, it's star spots causing the variation. How does that work? Oh right, when spots rotate into and out of view, they make the star appear slightly dimmer and brighter. Since the spots are cooler, when they face us, the star's total brightness decreases. So the variation in brightness is similar to a planet blocking light, but the calculation is a bit different.

The problem says that the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. So Rstar = R_sun. But wait, the star isn't completely covered. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. Wait, no, filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So if the filling factor is 20%, that's 0.2 of the star's surface covered.

But wait, only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view as the star spins. So the maximum effect is when the spots are facing us. But how does this affect the observed brightness?

The star's brightness depends on its temperature. Since spots are cooler, the total flux from the star would be less when spots are visible. The formula for the star's luminosity is L = 4πR²σTeff⁴. But when spots are present, the total flux is (unspotted area * Teff^4 + spotted area * T_spot^4) multiplied by the appropriate constants.

The total flux without spots would be F0 = σTeff^4. But with spots, when a certain fraction is covered, the flux F is F0 * (1 - f + f*(T_spot/Teff)^4 ), where f is the filling factor.

Wait, more accurately, the flux from the star is F = F0 * (1 - f*(1 - (T_spot^4)/(Teff^4)) ). Because the spots are cooler, they contribute less. So when a spot is present, the flux is F0 multiplied by (1 - f + f*(T_spot/Teff)^4).

Hmm, but wait, the star is viewed from a certain angle as it rotates. So when the spots are on the near side, the observed flux changes. But the scenario here is that the brightness variation is due to the spots rotating into and out of view, so the amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between when the spots are facing us and when they're not.

Wait, but the problem states that the star has a radius equal to the Sun, and one hemisphere is covered. Wait, wait, no—the problem says one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the hemisphere is half the star's surface. So filling factor is 20% of the star's total surface? Or 20% of the hemisphere's area?

Oh, the filling factor is the fraction of the total surface area covered by spots. Because the star is a sphere, each hemisphere is half the surface. So if the filling factor is 20%, that means that 0.2 of the entire surface is covered. So if only one hemisphere is spotty, that would mean that all the spots are on that hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. So the maximum effect is when the spots are facing us, so the area covered is 20% of the star's surface area.

Wait, the way the problem is worded is a bit confusing. It says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. Oh wait, no. The filling factor is the fraction of the entire star's surface covered. Because if the hemisphere is 50% of the surface, then a 20% filling factor across the entire star would mean 10% of the hemisphere is covered. Hmm, maybe I should think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the filling factor refers to the fraction of the hemisphere that is covered by spots. So if the hemisphere is half the star's surface, and the filling factor is 20%, then 0.2 * (π R^2) for that hemisphere, which is 0.2*( (4π R²)/2 ) = 0.4π R². Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface. So when only one hemisphere is spotty, the spots cover 20% of the star's surface area.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the problem again.

The key is to compute the relative change in brightness when the spots are on the visible side. So the observed flux will drop when the spots are visible, and return to normal when the spots rotate away.

The maximum variation in brightness (delta F) would depend on the area of the spots and their lower temperature. So the change in flux is the difference between the star's normal flux and
