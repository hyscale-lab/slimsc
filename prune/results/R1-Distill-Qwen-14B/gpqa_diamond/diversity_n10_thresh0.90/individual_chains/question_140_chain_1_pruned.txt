Okay, let me try to figure this out. Hmm, so the question is a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step.

First, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

I'll start by breaking down each part.

Let me think about the reaction. Substance X reacting with Y produces gas W. Gas W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. So, for a molecule, the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Wait, but for a molecule, each atom contributes protons and neutrons, so the total number of protons (which equals the sum of protons in all atoms, which is the same as the sum of atomic numbers) would equal the total number of neutrons.

What elements have atoms where protons equal neutrons? Well, for a single atom, that would be atoms where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. For example, carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. But wait, the question says the molecule has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. So the molecule's total protons equal total neutrons.

Wait, maybe I should think about possible gases that fit this. For example, H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton) and 1 O (8 protons). So total protons would be 10, and neutrons? O has 8 neutrons (since O-16 has 8). So 2 H with 0 neutrons each, so total neutrons would be 8. Wait, 8 vs 10, so that's not equal. So H2O doesn't fit.

What about CO2? Carbon has 6 protons, each O has 8. So total protons: 6 + 2*8=22. Neutrons: Carbon-12 has 6, O-16 has 8 each. So 6 + 2*8 = 22. Oh wait, same as protons. So CO2 would have 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So that fits. So gas W could be carbon dioxide.

But wait, what else? Let's see. Another possibility is CH4. Protons: C is 6, H is 1 each. So total protons 6+4=10. Neutrons: C has 6 (since 12-6=6), H has 0. So total neutrons 6. Protons 10, neutrons 6. Doesn't match.

Or maybe CO. Protons: 6 + 8 =14. Neutrons: 6 (C) + 8 (O) =14. So that's another possibility. So CO could be W.

Wait, another possibility: N2. Each N has 7 protons. So total protons 14. Each N-14 has 7 neutrons. So two N2 would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So N2 is a possibility. But when N2 is formed, does that make sense in the reaction?

Alternatively, maybe something like O2? O has 8 protons. O2 would have 16 protons. Neutrons: O-16 has 8 each, so 16. So 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So O2 could also be W.

But let me think about the reaction. X reacts with Y. Y is a liquid. What liquids are common in such reactions? Maybe water? Or maybe something like ethanol or something else.

Wait, if Y is water, then what would X be? Suppose X is a metal, like sodium or potassium, which react violently with water. But then the gas produced is H2. Let me check: H2 has 2 protons, 0 neutrons. That doesn't fit because protons (2) don't equal neutrons (0). So W can't be H2.

Alternatively, if X is something else. Let me think about another reaction. Maybe X is a carbonate. Suppose Y is an acid. Then when X reacts with an acid, it might release CO2 gas. So if W is CO2, then X could be a carbonate.

Wait, but the precipitate G forms. So maybe X is a carbonate reacting with an acid Y to give CO2. But then Y would be an acid like HCl or H2SO4. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfide. Reacting with an acid could release H2S gas. But H2S has 2 H (1 each) and 1 S (16). So protons: 2+16=18. Neutrons: for H, 0. Sulfur in H2S is typically S-32, which has 16 neutrons. So for each H2S molecule, the total neutrons would be 16, whereas protons are 18. Doesn't match.

Hmm, maybe I'm going down the wrong path. Let me think about the product of X reacting with a keto acid. The product has 2 oxygen atoms. So when X reacts with a keto acid (like maybe a ketone acid?), perhaps a neutralization reaction occurs, adding something.

Wait, another approach. The product of X and a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. So perhaps X is something that adds a group with an oxygen, like an alcohol or something else.

Wait, perhaps X is a base, and the reaction is a neutralization. If the product is something like a carboxylic acid or a salt. Hmm, but the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Maybe X is something like NaOH. For example, when a keto acid (like a ketone with a carboxylic acid group) reacts with NaOH, it could form a salt. But I'm not sure how that would give 2 oxygens.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, and the reaction is a metal reacting with a carboxylic acid. The product would be a carboxylate salt. For example, 2CH3COOH + Mg → Mg(CH3COO)2 + H2. But wait, the product here is Mg(OOCCH3)2, which has 4 oxygen atoms in the formula, I think. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe the reaction is between X and a keto acid, and the product is a ketone with two more oxygen atoms? Not sure.

Let me think about the precipitate G. When X reacts with Y, a precipitate forms. Then, when heated, G releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius, which is just above freezing. Hmm, which substance has a melting point near that?

Wait, water has a melting point of 273 K, which is 0 degrees Celsius. So 277 K is slightly higher. Maybe B is water? Or perhaps another compound.

Wait, if G is a carbonate, and upon heating, it decomposes into CO2 and B, which could be a metal oxide. For example, heating calcium carbonate gives CaO and CO2. The melting point of CaO is much higher than 277 K. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe B is sodium oxide. No, sodium oxide's melting point is higher. Alternatively, maybe B is something else. Wait, another approach: what if G is a hydroxide, and when heated, it loses water and forms an oxide. For example, copper(II) hydroxide, when heated, becomes copper(II) oxide and water. So the melting point of B would be that of the oxide.

But 277 K is about 4 degrees C. Hmm, maybe B is something like NaOH? No, NaOH's melting point is higher. Alternatively, maybe it's something else.

Wait, perhaps G is a carbonate that decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. For instance, suppose X is Na2CO3. Reacting with something like sulfuric acid (Y) would produce CO2 gas, Na2SO4, and water. But when heated, Na2CO3 might not decompose. Wait, no, sodium carbonate doesn't decompose upon heating. It requires high temperatures, and even then, it's not something that gives a low melting point.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the initial part again: gas W has same number of protons and neutrons. So CO2 fits (each CO2 molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons), but let me check other possibilities. If W is NH3, then protons would be 14 (1 N + 3 H) and neutrons: N is 14 (so 7 neutrons), H has 0, so 7. 14 vs 7: nope. What about CH4? Protons: 6 (C) +4( H) =10. Neutrons: C has 6, so 6. 10 vs 6: no.

So CO2 seems a good candidate for W. So then, the reaction between X and Y produces CO2. So X might be a carbonate. Let's suppose X is a carbonate, Y is an acid, and the reaction produces CO2. So perhaps X is Na2CO3, Y is H2SO4. The reaction would be:

Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2↑ + H2O.

So the precipitate G would be Na2SO4? But wait, sodium sulfate is soluble in water. So that wouldn't precipitate. Hmm, maybe Y isn't a strong acid. Maybe Y is something else, like a salt solution that reacts with X.

Wait, another possibility: X is a sulfide, Y is a strong acid. Then the reaction would produce H2S gas. But H2S has 2 H (1 each) and 1 S (16). So total protons: 2 +16=18. Neutrons: S in H2S is usually S-32 (16 neutrons), so 16. 18 !=16. So H2S doesn't fit.

Wait, going back to W being CO2. Then X must be a carbonate. But then, what's Y? Maybe Y is a strong acid. But then precipitate G would be the salt of the acid. For example, if Y is HCl, then reaction with X (like MgCO3) would produce MgCl2, CO2, and H2O. MgCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a metal hydroxide. Or maybe Y is a salt solution where the anion is insoluble.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a nitrate, and X is a carbonate, but their reaction doesn't produce a precipitate. Maybe I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate, Y is a weak acid like acetic acid. The reaction would produce CO2, and the salt would be soluble. But again, no precipitate.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider another possibility for W. Let's think about N2O. Nitrogen has 7 protons, oxygen 8. So N2O has 2*7 +8=22 protons. Neutrons: N-14 has 7, O-16 has 8. So 2*7 +8 =22 neutrons. So N2O is another possibility.

But would N2O be a gas released in this reaction? What reaction produces N2O? Maybe a decomposition reaction. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps W is NO. Protons: 7 (N) +8 (O) =15. Neutrons: N-14 (7), O-16 (8) → 15. So 15 protons and 15 neutrons. So NO could be W. But NO is a gas formed in some reactions.

But I'm not sure about that. Let me think again about the precipitate G. When heated, it releases B. And B's melting point is near 277 K. So perhaps B is a solid that melts just above 0°C.

Wait, water's melting point is 273 K (0°C). So 277 K is about 4°C. That's just above the melting point of water. So maybe B is water. But how? Because if G is something that when heated releases water, perhaps G is a hydrated salt. For example, when heated, the hydrate loses water.

Wait, but that would mean that when G is heated, it releases H2O and leaves a residue. So B would be H2O. But then, the melting point of B (H2O) is 273 K, which is very close to 277 K. So that's a possibility.

So perhaps G is a hydrated salt, like copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate. When heated, it loses water and becomes anhydrous copper(II) sulfate. But then, the gas released would be water vapor. So W would be H2O. But earlier, I thought W must have equal protons and neutrons. H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton) and 1 O (8). So total protons 2+8=10. Neutrons: O in H2O is O-16, which has 8, so neutrons 8. 10 vs 8: no, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, so that doesn't fit. So perhaps B isn't water. Let me think of another possibility. What substance has a melting point near 277 K? Maybe something like sodium chloride? No, it's a solid at room temperature. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: The product of X with a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. So X must be adding something to the keto acid to make a product with two more oxygen atoms. Or maybe X is a base that neutralizes the keto acid, forming a salt with more oxygens.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal. Let's say X is sodium, Na. When Na reacts with a keto acid (like a carboxylic acid), it would form the sodium salt and release H2 gas. Wait, but earlier, W is a gas with equal protons and neutrons, so H2 doesn't fit. So that might not be the case.

Alternatively, X could be something else. Let's think about the other part: X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X has one element with a heavier isotope. Common
