Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to figure it out step by step.

The question gives a density matrix ρ which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). So, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are described by density matrices that are projectors (like |ψ><ψ|), but mixed states are statistical ensembles of pure states.

So this ρ looks like it's a mixture of |0> and |1> each with equal probability because the coefficients are 1/2 each. That makes sense. So ρ would represent a completely mixed state for a single qubit. Wait, but where does this place it geometrically in the qubit space?

I recall that qubit states can be visualized on the Bloch sphere. For a single qubit, the Bloch vector is a point on the unit sphere. For a pure state |0>, the Bloch vector is at (0,0,1), and for |1>, it's (0,0,-1), but wait, no, wait. Oh right, the standard basis: |0> is at the north pole (0,0,1), and |1> is at the south pole (0,0,-1).

But wait, when we have a mixed state, like a completely mixed state, it's different. The completely mixed state has equal probabilities for all possible basis states. So for a single qubit, the completely mixed state is when ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Wait, that's exactly what this ρ is. So what's the Bloch vector for a completely mixed state?

I think the Bloch representation of a density matrix ρ is given by ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector. So, for our ρ, let me plug in. 

Our ρ is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me write that as (I + 0·σ)/2. Because if I compute |0><0| + |1><1|, that's the identity matrix I. So then ρ is (I + 0)/2 = I/2. So the Bloch vector r is zero. 

Ah, so the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), the origin. That makes sense because the completely mixed state has no direction—it's equally likely in all directions on the Bloch sphere. So, the corresponding point is at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So that's the correct answer.

Wait, let me just make sure. Let's think about the possible answers. Option B is (0,0,1), which is the |0> state. But our state isn't a pure state, it's mixed. So the Bloch vector isn't at the poles. It's at the center. So option C is correct.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit, where the system has equal probabilities of being in the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states like \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\) correspond to the north pole \((0,0,1)\) and south pole \((0,0,-1)\), respectively. However, for a mixed state, the Bloch vector is determined by the formula:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r}\) is the Bloch vector. For the given \(\rho\), it can be rewritten as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2},
\]

which implies that \(\mathbf{r} = (0,0,0)\). This means the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere, representing a completely mixed state with no directional preference. 

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position is:

**A) r=(1,1,0)**: Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.  
**B) r=(0,0,1)**: Incorrect, as this represents the pure state \(|0\rangle\), not a mixed state.  
**C) r=(0,0,0)**: Correct, as this represents the completely mixed state.  
**D) r=(1,1,1)**: Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
