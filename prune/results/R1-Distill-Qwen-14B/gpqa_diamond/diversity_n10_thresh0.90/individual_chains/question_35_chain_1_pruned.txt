Okay, so I've got this physics problem about angular momentum operators, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, called A, for a muon. The operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, Ay, which satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = aφ, where φ is the eigenfunction and a is the eigenvalue. 

They mentioned that Ay is given by c multiplied by matrix S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a specific 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So, I think S looks like this:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Hmm. Let me write that down. So Ay = c * S, with c = h/(4π).

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. The multiple-choice options are about what statements are correct during this calculation.

Wait, actually, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So I don't necessarily have to find all eigenvalues and eigenvectors, but need to see which of the options is a correct statement about the process or the results.

Let me think about the structure of the problem. Since S is a 2x2 matrix, Ay would also be 2x2. The eigenvalues would be scalars a such that det(Ay - a I) = 0. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the eigenvalues of S first, then multiply by c to get those of Ay.

Wait, because Ay is c times S, any eigenvalue of Ay would be c times the eigenvalue of S. Because if S|ψ> = s|ψ>, then Ay|ψ> = c S |ψ> = c s |ψ>. So the eigenvalues of Ay are c multiplied by the eigenvalues of S.

So first, let's find the eigenvalues of S.

S is [[0, -i],
      [i, 0]]

To find eigenvalues, we need to compute the determinant of (S - λ I) = 0.

So,

| -λ   -i      |
| i     -λ     |  = 0

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (i)(i) = λ^2 - (i^2)(1*1) → since i^2 is -1, this becomes λ^2 - (-1)(1) = λ^2 +1 = 0.

So λ^2 = -1 → λ = ±i. So the eigenvalues of S are i and -i.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, S is a 2x2 matrix, so the eigenvalues are i and -i? Let me double-check.

Wait, the determinant is ( -λ )^2 - ( (-i)(i) ), because the off-diagonal elements are -i and i. Wait, original matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S - λ I is [[-λ, -i], [i, -λ]].

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i)(i) → λ² - ( (-i)(i) ) → λ² - ( (-i²)) → because i times i is i² = -1, so (-i)*i = (-i^2) = --1? Wait, wait.

Wait, (-i) multiplied by i is (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = +1. So the determinant is λ² - (1) = 0. So, λ² = 1 → λ = ±1.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. Wait, let me compute again:

(S - λ I) = [ [-λ, -i], [i, -λ] ]

The determinant is:

(-λ)(-λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - ( (-i) * i )

Compute (-i)
