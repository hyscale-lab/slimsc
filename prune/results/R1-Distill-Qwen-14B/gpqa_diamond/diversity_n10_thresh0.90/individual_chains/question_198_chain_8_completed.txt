Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species.

Wait, dithiocyanato... that means two SCN- ligands attached. So we're looking for the [Co(SCN)_2^2+] complex, right? Because β2 is given as 40, but wait, I should make sure. Or maybe the β values are for each possible complex. Let me think. Stability constants usually describe the formation of each complex step by step. For example, β1 is for Co(SCN)_1^+, β2 for Co(SCN)_2^3+, and so on up to β4 for Co(SCN)_4^- perhaps? Or wait, maybe the complexes are each step, so the nth β is for the nth ligand.

Wait, the stability constant β for a complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation of that complex. So for each step, adding another SCN-.

So the possible complexes are:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)^(+) ... β1 = 9

Co(SCN)^+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_2^(3+) ... β2 = 40

Co(SCN)_2^(3+) + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_3^(4+) ... β3 = 63

Co(SCN)_3^(4+) + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_4^(5-) ... β4 = 16

Wait, but wait, each β is the stepwise stability constant. So the overall β for each complex is the product of the previous βs.

Wait, no, no. Wait, no. The overall formation constant, say K, for Co(SCN)_n^m+ would be the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn. So for the first complex, K1 = β1 =9. For the second, K2= β1*β2=9*40=360. For the third, K3=9*40*63= 9*40=360, 360*63=22680. K4=22680 *16= 362880.

But wait, I'm getting ahead of myself. The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is Co(SCN)_2^2+. Or wait, no, wait. Wait, the dithiocyanato implies two SCN- per Co^2+ ion. So the complex would be Co(SCN)_2^2+. Wait, but that would have a charge of +2, because each SCN- is -1, and Co^2+ is +2. So 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. Wait, no. Wait, Co^2+ is +2, each SCN- is -1, so two SCN- would contribute -2. So Co(SCN)_2 would be neutral? Wait, that can't be right. Or perhaps I'm getting the charges wrong.

Wait, the complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n^(2−n). So for n=1: Co(SCN)^(+), n=2: Co(SCN)_2^(0), n=3: Co(SCN)_3^(-1), n=4: Co(SCN)_4^(-2). Hmm, that makes sense. So the blue complex is the one with two SCN- ligands, making it neutral. So the complex in question is [Co(SCN)_2], which is neutral.

So the problem is to find the percentage of this neutral complex among all Co species.

So all the Co species present are:

Co^2+,

Co(SCN)^+,

Co(SCN)_2^0,

Co(SCN)_3^-,

Co(SCN)_4^2-.

So the sum of all their concentrations should be equal to the initial [Co^2+], which is 1e-2 M. But wait, actually, the total [Co] is given as 1e-2 M, which is the sum of all the complexes (including all the forms).

So the approach is to calculate the fraction of Co that is in each complex, then sum only the fraction for Co(SCN)_2^0.

The stability constants (β) are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. These are the stepwise formation constants. So the β for each step is the formation of the next complex from the previous.

So, for each complex, the formation constant K_n is the product of β1 to βn. So:

K1 = β1 =9,

K2=β1*β2 =9*40=360,

K3=9*40*63 = 22680,

K4=9*40*63*16= 362880.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the βs are stepwise or overall. Oh, stability constants are typically stepwise, so each β is for adding one ligand. So the formation of each complex is the stepwise process.

So the concentrations can be modeled using these βs and the concentrations of SCN-.

The general approach is to calculate the distribution of Co in each complex, considering all possible complexes.

The formula for each complex is:

[Co(SCN)_n] = K_n * [Co^2+] * ( [SCN-]^n ) / ( product of terms (1 + K_1 [SCN]) (1 + K_1 [SCN] + K_2 [SCN]^2 + ... ) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the expressions for each species.

Wait, perhaps the way to model this is to compute the fraction of each complex relative to the free ion.

The distribution can be calculated using the formula for each species.

Each [Co(SCN)_n] = K_n [Co^2+] [SCN]^n / (1 + K1 [SCN] + K1 K2 [SCN]^2 + K1 K2 K3 [SCN]^3 + K1 K2 K3 K4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, we can compute the fractional concentration for each complex by considering the formation constants and the ligand concentration.

Another approach is to consider that the total concentration of Co is the sum of all [Co^2+] and all the complex species.

But since the problem is asking for the percentage of Co in the dithiocyanato complex (n=2), we need to compute the ratio [Co(SCN)_2]/(sum of all [Co species]).

So, let me think about how to calculate the concentrations.

The initial concentration of Co^2+ is 1e-2 M. The SCN- concentration is 0.1 M.

Each complex is formed stepwise, so the concentration of each species depends on the formation constants and the ligand concentration.

The general expression for each complex is:

[Co(SCN)_n] = ( K_n [Co^2+] [SCN]^n ) / ( 1 + K1 [SCN] + K1 K2 [SCN]^2 + K1 K2 K3 [SCN]^3 + K1 K2 K3 K4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, but wait, K1 is β1, K2 is β1 β2, etc. So for each n, K_n is the product of β1 to βn.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Because each β is the stepwise formation constant. So for the first complex, K1 = β1 =9. For the second, K2 = β1 * β2=9*40=360. For the third, K3=9*40*63=22680. For the fourth, K4=9*40*63*16=362880.

So the denominator in the expression is Σ (from m=0 to 4) [K_m [SCN]^m], but wait, no. Wait, the denominator is the sum of all possible complexes plus the free ion. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the cumulative formation constant.

Wait, maybe another approach. The fraction of Co in each complex is given by (K_n [SCN]^n ) / ( sum_{m=0}^4 K_m [SCN]^m )

Where K_0 is 1 (since it's the free ion, Co^2+), K1 is β1, K2 is β1 β2, K3 is β1 β2 β3, and K4 is β1 β2 β3 β4.

So each term K_m [SCN]^m is the contribution of each species.

So the fraction for each complex is [Co(SCN)_m] = (K_m [SCN]^m) / (sum_{n=0}^4 K_n [SCN]^n )

Wait, but each K_m is the product up to βm. So for m=0: K0=1, m=1: K1=9, m=2: K2=360, m=3: 22680, m=4:362880.

So the denominator is 1 + 9*(0.1) + 9*40*(0.1)^2 + 9*40*63*(0.1)^3 + 9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4.

Wait, let me compute each term:

Term m=0: 1 * (0.1)^0 =1.

Term m=1: K1 [SCN]^1 =9 *0.1 =0.9.

Term m=2: K2 [SCN]^2=360*(0.01)=3.6.

Term m=3: K3 [SCN]^3=22680*(0.001)=22.68.

Term m=4: K4 [SCN]^4=362880*(0.0001)=36.288.

So summing all terms: 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

Let me compute that:

1 + 0.9 =1.9.

1.9 +3.6=5.5.

5.5 +22.68=28.18.

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So the denominator is 64.468.

Now, the numerator for the [Co(SCN)_2] complex is K2 [SCN]^2 =360*(0.01)=3.6.

So the fraction f2 is 3.6 /64.468 = approximately 0.05555.

Wait, that's 5.555%? Hmm, but wait, that's just the fraction contributed by the second term. But wait, each term represents the contribution of each species, so the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2] is 3.6 /64.468.

Wait, 3.6 /64.468 is about 0.05555 or 5.555%. But that's only 5.55%, which isn't one of the options. The options are in the 10-40% range. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me recheck the terms.

Wait, [SCN] is 0.1 M, which is 1e-1.

So [SCN]^2 is (1e-1)^2=1e-2 =0.01.

So K2 is 360, so 360 * 0.01 = 3.6.

Similarly, [SCN]^3 is 1e-3, so K3=22680 *1e-3=22.68.

But let's recompute all terms:

m=0: K0=1, [SCN]^0=1 → term=1.

m=1: K1=9, [SCN]=0.1 →9 *0.1=0.9.

m=2: K2=360, [SCN]^2=0.01 →360 *0.01=3.6.

m=3: K3=22680, [SCN]^3=0.001 →22680 *0.001=22.68.

m=4: K4=362880, [SCN]^4=0.0001 →362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum is 1 + 0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So the sum is correct.

So the fraction for m=2 is 3.6/64.468 ≈ 0.05555, which is about 5.555%. Hmm, but the options don't have a 5.5% option. The closest is option D:16.9%, but that's not close. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait a minute. Oh! Wait, perhaps I got the β's wrong. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem states:

Stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc.

So K1=β1=9.

K2=β1 * β2=9*40=360.

K3=K2 *β3=360 *63=22680.

K4=K3 * β4=22680 *16=362880.

So that part seems correct.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the β's are for the overall formation constants, not stepwise. No, no, because for stepwise, each β adds another ligand. So the way I have K's is correct.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in how the terms are calculated. Let me think again.

Wait, the denominator is the sum of all possible species, including Co^2+.

So each term is K_n [SCN]^n, where K_n is the overall formation constant up to n ligands.

Wait, but why is the denominator the sum of K_n [SCN]^n for n=0 to 4? Because each term represents the contribution of each species to the total concentration.

Wait, but another approach is to model the distribution using the formation constants and the ligand concentration.

Wait, another way to compute the fraction of each complex is to use the formula:

f_n = (K_n [SCN]^n) / (sum_{m=0}^4 K_m [SCN]^m )

So, for each n, f_n is the fraction of Co in that complex.

So for n=2, f_2 = K2 [SCN]^2 / sum.

Sum is 64.468 as before.

So f_2 = 3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05555 or 5.555%. But that's not matching any of the options.

Hmm. That's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of β's. Let me check the question again. The β's are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Oh wait, β4 is 16, which is less than β3.

That might affect the calculation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I got the order of the complexes wrong. For example, maybe the dithiocyanato complex is the third complex, not the second.

Wait, but the question says "dithiocyanato" which is two SCN ligands, so that should be the second step, n=2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate each fraction and sum them up.

Let me compute each term:

n=0: term=1 →1.

n=1: 9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2:360 *0.01=3.6.

n=3:22680 *0.001=22.68.

n=4:362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum =1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288=64.468.

So for each n,

f0 =1 /64.468 ≈0.0155 →1.55%.

f1=0.9/64.468≈0.01396 →1.396%.

f2=3.6/64.468 ≈0.05555 →5.555%.

f3=22.68/64.468≈0.3517 →35.17%.

f4=36.288/64.468≈0.5629 →56.29%.

Wait, wait, this can't be right because the sum of all fractions should be 100%.

1.55 +1.4 +5.555 +35.17 +56.29≈ 100% (exactly 100% because sum is 64.468, each term is divided by that).

But this suggests that the majority of Co is in the fourth complex, which is [Co(SCN)_4]^2−. Hmm, but the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2. So f2 is about 5.55%, which is roughly 5.55% and not in the options.

But the options are:

A)42.3%,

B)25.6%,

C)38.1%,

D)16.9%.

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the stability constants are given for the overall complexes, not stepwise. Oh wait, that's another possibility. Let me think: if the β's are overall, then β1 would be the constant for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc.

But earlier, I thought β's are stepwise. Let me see.

Suppose that each β represents the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc.

In that case, K1=β1=9,

K2=β2=40,

K3=β3=63,

K4=β4=16.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each β would be for a different overall complex.

Wait, but that might change the calculation, so perhaps I should try that.

In that case, for each complex, K_n = β_n.

So the terms would be:

n=0:1.

n=1:9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2:40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

n=3:63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063.

n=4:16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

Sum is 1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 = 2.3646.

So the fractions would be:

f0=1/2.3646≈0.4225 →42.25%.

f1=0.9/2.3646≈0.3802 →38.02%.

f2=0.4/2.3646≈0.169 →16.9%.

Wait, so f2 is 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So if the β's are the overall constants, then this approach would give f2=16.9%, matching option D.

But earlier I thought the β's are stepwise. So which is correct?

Hmm. The nomenclature can be a bit confusing. The term "stability constant" can sometimes refer to the stepwise constant, which is the equilibrium constant for adding one ligand, or the overall constant for the entire complex.

But in the problem statement, it's given as "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

So that would imply that β1 is the overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc.

But that doesn't make much sense because the stepwise constants would be lower for each step. Alternatively, the β's could be the log stability constants, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the β's are the formation constants for each complex, but are stepwise. So β1 is for [CoSCN]+, β2 is the stepwise for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc.

In that case, the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 would be β1 * β2.

But in the problem statement, if the β's are stepwise, then the approach I took first is correct, but that leads to f2 ≈5.55%, which isn't among the options. So perhaps the β's are the overall constants for each complex.

Wait, but that would make K1=9 for [Co(SCN)]^+, K2=40 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc.

In that scenario, the sum becomes 1 +9*(0.1) +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4.

Which is 1 + 0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016= 2.3646.

So the fraction for n=2 is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.1694, which is 16.9%, option D.

But then, why would the problem give β1=9, which would be the overall constant for [CoSCN]+, and β2=40 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc.?

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Because if the β's are stepwise, the answer isn't among the options, but if they're overall, then option D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the exponents in the terms.

Wait, in the denominator, each term is K_n multiplied by [SCN]^n.

So for the stepwise case:

n=0 →1,

n=1 →β1 * [SCN],

n=2 →β1 β2 [SCN]^2,

n=3 →β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3,

n=4 →β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4.

So the sum is 1 +β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4.

Which is 1 +9*0.1 +9*40*(0.1)^2 +9*40*63*(0.1)^3 +9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4.

Calculating each term:

n=0:1.

n=1:9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2:9*40*(0.01) =360 *0.01=3.6.

n=3:9*40*63*(0.001) = 22680 *0.001=22.68.

n=4:9*40*63*16 * (0.0001) =362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum:1+0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So the denominator is 64.468.

The fraction for n=2 is (β1 β2 [SCN]^2 ) / sum → (3.6)/64.468 ≈0.05555 or 5.55%.

But this isn't in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the way the complexes are formed is different. Let's think about the possible complexes and their charges.

I think I might have made a mistake in assuming the charge for each complex. Let me recheck.

Co^2+ can form complexes with SCN^- ligands. Each SCN^- is -1.

So for [Co(SCN)_n]^m+, the charge would be 2+ + n*(-1) = m+.

So for n=1: Co(SCN)+ → charge is +1.

n=2: Co(SCN)_2 → charge is 0.

n=3: Co(SCN)_3^- → charge is -1.

n=4: Co(SCN)_4^2- → charge is -2.

So the fraction for n=2 is when the complex is neutral, which is the dithiocyanato complex. So the calculation should be correct.

But according to stepwise β's, the fraction is 5.55%, which isn't in the options. So perhaps the β's are not stepwise but overall for each complex.

In that case, the calculation would have the fractions as I did before, giving 16.9% for option D.

But why would the problem provide β's as stepwise when that doesn't lead to any of the options? It's possible that I made a mistake in the approach.

Another possibility is that the question is using β as the overall formation constants, not the stepwise ones.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to use the formula for each complex's concentration:

The general expression for the concentration of a complex with n ligands is:

[CoL_n] = (β1 β2 ... βn [Co^2+][L]^n ) / (1 + β1 [L] + β1 β2 [L]^2 + ... + β1 β2 ... βn [L]^n )

So in this case, [L] is [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

So for each n, [Co(SCN)_n] is given by (β1...βn [Co][SCN]^n ) divided by the sum from m=0 to 4 of (β1...βm [SCN]^m ).

So the denominator is the same as before, which is 64.468.

For the n=2 case, [Co(SCN)_2] is (β1 β2 [Co][SCN]^2 ) / denominator.

So, [Co(SCN)_2] = (9 *40 *1e-2 * (0.1)^2 ) / 64.468.

Wait, wait, wait. No, wait, the [Co] is 1e-2 M, and [SCN] is 0.1 M.

Wait, but in the numerator, [Co][SCN]^n is multiplied by the product of βs up to n.

So [Co(SCN)_2] = (β1 β2 [Co][SCN]^2 ) / denominator.

Wait, but denominator is sum (β1 ... βm [SCN]^m ), for m=0 to 4.

So [Co(SCN)_2] = (9 *40 *1e-2 * (0.1)^2 ) / 64.468.

Wait, but 9 *40=360, [SCN]^2=0.01, so 360 *1e-2 *0.01=360e-4 =0.036.

So [Co(SCN)_2] =0.036 /64.468 ≈0.0005556 M.

But the total [Co] is 1e-2 M. The percentage is (0.0005556 / 0.01 ) *100% =5.556%.

Again, that's 5.55%, which isn't an option.

But wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Because the denominator is the same for all species, perhaps the fractions can be calculated as (β1 β2 [SCN]^2 ) / sum.

Which is 3.6 /64.468 ≈5.55%. Still not matching the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the logarithmic form of the stability constants? No, because β's are given as 9, 40, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the stability constants are given for the formation of the complex with each additional ligand, so the overall is K=β1 * β2 * β3 * β4.

Wait, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the complexes as [Co(SCN)_n]^n−, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the initial Co^2+ concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN^- is 0.1 M. So the ligand is in excess, which can influence the dominant species.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should be done considering the formation of all species up to n=4.

But I'm stuck, as the stepwise approach gives 5.55%, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator. Let me recheck:

sum =1 +9*0.1 + (9*40)*(0.1)^2 + (9*40*63)*(0.1)^3 + (9*40*63*16)*(0.1)^4.

Compute each term:

1 →1.

9*0.1=0.9.

9*40=360; 360*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

9*40*63=22680; 22680 *0.001=22.68.

9*40*63*16= (9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16=362880). 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So sum is 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

Yes, correct.

Hmm. So the only way the percentage would match one of the options is if the β's are not stepwise but are the overall constants for each complex.

In that scenario, for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, the overall β is 40.

So then, the sum is 1 +9*(0.1) +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4 =1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016=2.3646.

Thus, the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2] is 0.4/2.3646≈0.1694 or 16.9%, which is option D.

But why would the problem refer to β2 as the stability constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^0? That would make sense if the β's are overall for each complex.

In that case, the correct answer would be D)16.9%.

But I'm a bit confused because the problem states "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, etc." which would imply each β is for a specific complex.

So perhaps the β's are the overall constants, not stepwise. That would make sense for this problem and yield 16.9%.

So I think the correct answer is D)16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2], among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants and the concentrations of Co(II) and SCN⁻.

### Key Information:
- **Stability constants**: β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16.
- **Concentrations**: [Co²⁺] = 10⁻² M, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.
- The complexes are formed stepwise, with the stability constants representing the equilibrium constants for the sequential addition of SCN⁻ ligands:
  - Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ↔ Co(SCN)⁺ (β₁ = 9),
  - Co(SCN)⁺ + SCN⁻ ↔ Co(SCN)₂ (β₂ = 40),
  - Co(SCN)₂ + SCN⁻ ↔ Co(SCN)₃ (β₃ = 63),
  - Co(SCN)₃ + SCN⁻ ↔ Co(SCN)₄ (β₄ = 16).

The total concentration of cobalt is distributed among all species:  
\[
\text{Total Co} = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{Co(SCN)}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)_2}] + [\text{Co(SCN)_3}] + [\text{Co(SCN)_4}].
\]

The fraction of cobalt in each species is determined by the formation constants and the ligand concentration. The general formula for the fraction of cobalt in a specific complex is:
\[
f_n = \frac{K_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^4 K_m [\text{SCN}]^m},
\]
where \( K_n = \beta_1 \beta_2 \dots \beta_n \) for stepwise constants.

### Calculations:
1. **Formation constants**:  
   - \( K_1 = \beta_1 = 9 \),
   - \( K_2 = \beta_1 \beta_2 = 9 \times 40 = 360 \),
   - \( K_3 = \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 = 9 \times 40 \times 63 = 22680 \),
   - \( K_4 = \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 = 9 \times 40 \times 63 \times 16 = 362880 \).

2. **Denominator**:  
   The denominator is the sum of all terms \( K_m [\text{SCN}]^m \) for \( m = 0 \) to \( 4 \):  
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 1 + 9(0.1) + 360(0.1)^2 + 22680(0.1)^3 + 362880(0.1)^4.
   \]
   - \( 1 \),
   - \( 9 \times 0.1 = 0.9 \),
   - \( 360 \times (0.1)^2 = 3.6 \),
   - \( 22680 \times (0.1)^3 = 22.68 \),
   - \( 362880 \times (0.1)^4 = 36.288 \).
   Summing these gives:
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 + 36.288 = 64.468.
   \]

3. **Fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]**:  
   The numerator for [Co(SCN)_2] is \( K_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 360 \times (0.1)^2 = 3.6 \).  
   The fraction is:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{3.6}{64.468} \approx 0.05555 \, \text{or} \, 5.55\%.
   \]

4. **Revisiting the β interpretation**:  
   If the β values are interpreted as overall stability constants for each complex (not stepwise), the calculation changes. The formation constants become:
   - \( K_1 = \beta_1 = 9 \),
   - \( K_2 = \beta_2 = 40 \),
   - \( K_3 = \beta_3 = 63 \),
   - \( K_4 = \beta_4 = 16 \).

   The denominator then becomes:
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 1 + 9(0.1) + 40(0.1)^2 + 63(0.1)^3 + 16(0.1)^4.
   \]
   - \( 1 \),
   - \( 9 \times 0.1 = 0.9 \),
   - \( 40 \times (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \),
   - \( 63 \times (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \),
   - \( 16 \times (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \).
   Summing these gives:
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.
   \]

   The numerator for [Co(SCN)_2] is \( K_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \times (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \).  
   The fraction is:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.1694 \, \text{or} \, 16.9\%.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The interpretation of the β values as overall stability constants for each complex matches one of the provided options. Therefore, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2], is **16.9%**.
