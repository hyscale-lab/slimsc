Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So I know that spin-up and spin-down are orthonormal states.

The question asks me to calculate two things: the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator, whose matrix representation has elements A_ij. A_ij is given as hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Also, I need to find the average value (expected value) of that operator.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

First, I need to figure out what the operator looks like. The matrix A is given with A_ij = 0 when i = j, and hbar/2 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, because |up> and |down> are two states, the matrix would be:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
      [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, but wait, the dimension depends on the states. Since there are two states, the operator must be 2x2. So that's correct.

But then, the eigenstates of this operator are important because the question is about measuring in those eigenstates. So I think I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A.

Wait, but wait. The matrix A is given as zero on the diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal. Let me compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix.

The eigenvalues λ are solutions to the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0.

Calculating the determinant of a 2x2 matrix:

| (-λ)    (hbar/2) |
| (hbar/2)  (-λ)   |

The determinant is λ² - (hbar²/4) = 0.

So λ² = hbar²/4 → λ = ± hbar/2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, for a 2x2 matrix with diagonal elements a and d, and off-diagonal elements b and c, the determinant is (a - λ)(d - λ) - bc. In our case, a = d = 0 - λ, and bc = (hbar/2)^2. So the equation is λ² - (hbar/2)^2 = 0 → λ² = (hbar/2)^2 → λ = hbar/2 and λ = -hbar/2.

Wait, no. Wait, the matrix is [ [0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0] ]. So the characteristic equation is ( -λ )² - (hbar/2)^2 = 0 → λ² = (hbar/2)^2 → λ = ± hbar/2. So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

The eigenvectors for λ = hbar/2 would satisfy (A - (hbar/2) I ) |v> = 0.

So A - (hbar/2) I is [ [-hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -hbar/2] ]

Which simplifies to rows like (-1, 1) and (1, -1), scaled by hbar/2.

So the equations are:

(-hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvectors are any scalar multiples of (1, 1), because v2 = v1. So normalized, it would be (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).

Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2, the same steps would give:

( A + (hbar/2) I ) |v> = 0 → [ [hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, hbar/2] ]

So the equations are hbar/2 (v1 + v2) = 0 → v1 = -v2. So the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of (1, -1), so normalized as (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)).

So the operator A has eigenstates |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2, respectively.

Wait, but wait. Wait, let's represent the eigenstates in terms of |up> and |down>. So |+> is (1,1) / sqrt(2), which would be (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−> is (1, -1)/sqrt(2), which is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So when the problem says, "the eigenstates of the operator," those are the states |+> and |−>.

So the question is, when we measure the system in this operator's eigenbasis, what are the probabilities of each outcome, and what's the average value of the operator?

To find the probabilities, I need to express the state |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Because when you express a state in an eigenbasis, the square of the coefficients gives the probabilities.

But wait, |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

Wait, the exact state is given as proportional. So perhaps I need to normalize it first.

Wait, but first, let me write out |alpha> as a vector. Let me represent it as:

|alpha> = c1 |up> + c2 |down>,

where c1 = (1 + i), c2 = (2 - i).

But I need to normalize it because the state as given is only proportional; the actual state might have a different normalization.

Wait, the question says the state is proportional, so perhaps I need to normalize it. Let me compute the norm squared of |alpha>.

The inner product <alpha|alpha> is |c1|^2 + |c2|^2.

Compute |c1|^2: |1 + i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|c2|^2: |2 - i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So total norm squared is 2 +5 =7.

So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So now, |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> divided by sqrt(7).

Now, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates |+> and |−> of operator A.

Because the operator's eigenstates are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So any state can be written as a combination of |+> and |−>:

|alpha> = a |+> + b |−>.

Let me compute a and b.

Expressing |alpha> in terms of |+> and |−>:

a = < + | alpha >,

b = < − | alpha >.

Compute a:

a = < + | alpha > = ( <up| + <down| )/(sqrt(2)) ) * alpha.

Which is [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] * [ (1 + i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) )

So a = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( (1 + i) + (2 -i) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Wait, let me compute the inner product step by step.

First, < + | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| alpha> + <down| alpha> ].

<up| alpha> is (1 + i)/sqrt(7),

<down| alpha> is (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

So adding them:

(1 + i) + (2 - i) = 1 + i + 2 -i = 3.

So a = [3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)))] = 3 / sqrt(14).

Similarly, compute b = < − | alpha >.

< − | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| alpha> - <down| alpha> ].

So,

<up| alpha> = (1 + i)/sqrt(7),

<down| alpha> = (2 - i)/sqrt(7),

So their difference is (1 + i) - (2 -i) = (1 -2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i.

So then,

b = [ (-1 + 2i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, but wait. Let me compute that again.

Wait, (1 + i) - (2 - i) = (1 - 2) + (i + i) = (-1) + 2i.

Yes, that's correct.

So b is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, but wait. The eigenstates |+> and |−> are orthogonal. So a and b are the coefficients when |alpha> is expressed in the |+>, |−> basis.

The probability of measuring the eigenvalue +hbar/2 is |a|^2,

and the probability of eigenvalue -hbar/2 is |b|^2.

So let me compute |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2:

a = 3 / sqrt(14),

so |a|^2 = 9 /14.

|b|^2: b = (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14),

so |b|^2 = [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14.

Wait, but 9/14 +5/14 is 14/14=1, which makes sense because probabilities sum to 1.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, a is 3/sqrt(14), so |a|^2 is 9/14. That's correct.

b is (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14), so the modulus squared is (1 +4)/14 =5/14. Correct.

So the probabilities are |a|^2=9/14 and |b|^2=5/14.

Wait, but looking back at the options, I don't see 9/14 and 5/14. Hmm. Let me see the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7

B) 0.54, 0.46 and 3hbar/sqrt(7)

C) 0.28, 0.72 and hbar/sqrt(7)

D) 0.61, 0.29 and 2hbar/sqrt(7)

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64, and 5/14 is about 0.357, which is 0.36. So option A has 0.64 and 0.36 as probabilities.

Wait, so the probabilities would be 9/14 ≈ 0.642857 and 5/14≈0.35714.

So the first part of the answer is 9/14 and 5/14, which is approximately 0.64 and 0.36. That matches option A.

Now, the average value of the operator is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since the operator has eigenstates |+> and |−>, the expectation value is |a|^2 (hbar/2) + |b|^2 (-hbar/2).

So <A> = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) ) = [9*(hbar/2) -5*(hbar/2)] /14.

Which simplifies to (4*(hbar/2))/14 = (2 hbar)/14 = hbar/7.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute that again.

Compute:

= (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2)
= [ (9)(hbar/2) + (5)(-hbar/2) ] /14
= [ (9 -5) (hbar/2) ] /14
= (4 * hbar/2 ) /14
= (2 hbar ) /14
= hbar /7.

So the expectation value is hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options, option A gives the average as hbar/7. So the option A has 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7, which matches what I found.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. First, we normalize \( |\alpha\rangle \). The norm squared is calculated as:

\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \) with matrix representation \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. The matrix is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \), which gives \( \lambda^2 - \left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)^2 = 0 \). Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The corresponding eigenvectors are:

\[
|+\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of these eigenstates. The coefficients are:

\[
a = \langle + | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow | \alpha \rangle + \langle \downarrow | \alpha \rangle \right),
\]
\[
b = \langle - | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow | \alpha \rangle - \langle \downarrow | \alpha \rangle \right).
\]

Substituting \( \langle \uparrow | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( \langle \downarrow | \alpha \rangle = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \), we compute:

\[
a = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
b = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
|a|^2 = \frac{9}{14}, \quad |b|^2 = \frac{5}{14}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities of measuring \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively.

Finally, the average value of the operator \( A \) is given by:

\[
\langle A \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + |b|^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substituting \( |a|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \) and \( |b|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \), we compute:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{4}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \), which matches option A.
