Okay, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem. So the question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where we have a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like calcium, and forms a complex.

The problem states that the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. The temperature is 25°C, and the pH is ideal. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions.

Wait, so when EDTA binds to Ca²+, it forms a complex. The formula for the formation constant K is something like K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). But I think I should write the correct expression for the formation constant. So, the formation of the complex is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-

So the K would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5x10^10.

But wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. Let me denote [CaEDTA] as 0.02 M.

So, the K expression would be 5e10 = (0.02) / ([Ca²+][EDTA]).

But wait, in pure solution, EDTA is a polydentate ligand, and its form depends on the pH. Oh, but the problem says the pH is ideal, which I think means that EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form, EDTA^4-, so we don't have to worry about the other protonated forms. So [EDTA^4-] is just [EDTA].

Wait, but in reality, EDTA exists in different protonation states, but the problem says the pH is ideal, so we can assume that all EDTA is in the form that can bind Ca²+, which is EDTA^4-.

But wait, another thing. In a solution where Ca-EDTA is the only complex, and assuming that all the EDTA is tied up in the complex, but I don't think that's the case. Because EDTA can be in excess, but in this problem, the initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex.

Wait, wait. The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So perhaps, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But we need to find [Ca²+].

Let me think. Let's denote:

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

So, from the formation constant K,

K = [CaEDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA]) = 5e10.

So, 5e10 = 0.02 / ([Ca²+][EDTA]).

But wait, what is [EDTA]? Because the total EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex. But in this case, the complex is 0.02 M. So
