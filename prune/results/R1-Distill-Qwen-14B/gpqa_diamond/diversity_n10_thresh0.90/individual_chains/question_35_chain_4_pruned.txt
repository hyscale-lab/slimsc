Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to tackle it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix.

Wait, the matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). Oh right, I remember that the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices used in spin-½ systems. The S matrix here looks familiar. Let me think: the Pauli matrices are often denoted as σx, σy, σz. The σy matrix is [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]—yes, that's exactly what S is. So S is the σy Pauli matrix.

But wait, the operator Ay is c multiplied by S. So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy. I think the eigenvalues of the σy matrix are ±i times something? Let me recall. For Pauli matrices, each σ (like σx, σy, σz) has eigenvalues of ±1. So the eigenvalues of σy are i and -i, because σy is i times the Pauli matrix Y in some conventions, but wait no, let me double-check.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are:

σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
σy = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the eigenvalues of σy are +i and -i? Because when I solve for eigenvalues of σy, I can write the characteristic equation: det(σy - λI) = 0.

The matrix σy - λI is [[-λ, -i], [i, -λ]]. The determinant is (−λ)(−λ) − (−i)(i) = λ² − (i * −i) = λ² - ( (−i²) ) = λ² - ( -(-1) )? Wait, wait, let's calculate (−i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is λ² - 1 = 0. So λ² = 1 → λ = ±1. Wait, that can't be right because I thought σy has eigenvalues i and -i.

Wait, that's conflicting. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the determinant calculation.

Wait, the determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (−i)(i) ]

Wait, (−i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is λ² - 1. So λ² = 1 → λ = ±1.

Hmm, but I thought the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. Oh, wait, no, maybe I was mixing it up. Because when you have spin matrices, like S = (ℏ/2)σ. So for σy, the eigenvalues would be ±1, but when multiplied by (ℏ/2), they become ±ℏ/2.

Wait, but in our case, the operator Ay is (h/(4π)) * σy. So let me compute the eigenvalues of Ay.

The eigenvalues of σy are ±1, so the eigenvalues of Ay would be (h/(4π)) * (±1) → ±h/(4π). So the eigenvalues a are ±h/(4π). Hmm.

Looking at the options, let's check the options.

Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh, but that's not matching, because our eigenvalues are real or imaginary? Wait, no, wait. Wait a minute, wait, σy has real eigenvalues? Wait, no, wait. If the eigenvalues are ±1, then Ay would have eigenvalues ±h/(4π), which are real numbers. So the eigenvalues of Ay are real, not imaginary.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the σy matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when I set up the eigenvalue equation S φ = λ φ, solving for λ.

So let me think about the matrix S: it's [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let's call it S.

The eigenvalues are found by solving det(S - λ I) = 0.

So the matrix S - λ I is [[-λ, -i], [i, -λ]]. The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - ( (-i)(i) ) → λ² - ( (-i)(i) ) = λ² - ( (-i^2) ) = λ² - (1) because i^2 is -1, so -i^2 is 1. So determinant is λ² -1 = 0 → λ²=1 → λ=1 or λ=-1.

Wait, so the eigenvalues of S are 1 and -1. So when we have Ay = (h/(4π)) S, the eigenvalues of Ay are (h/(4π)) * 1 and (h/(4π)) * (-1 ), so ±h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers, positive and negative.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues are real. So option A is incorrect.

Option B says the imaginary parts are ±1/2 and real parts ±1. Wait, but our eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which is real. So the eigenvalue of Ay is a real number, so no imaginary part. So option B is also incorrect because it suggests the eigenvalues have both real and imaginary parts. So B's not correct.

Option C: The eigenfunction φ of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Hmm, A is the intrinsic angular momentum, so the components are A_x, A_y, A_z. So A² would be A_x² + A_y² + A_z². The eigenfunctions of A_y would be eigenfunctions of A², because in quantum mechanics, the total angular momentum squared commutes with each component. So if φ is an eigenfunction of A_y, then it's also an eigenfunction of A². So C says yes, which is correct, but then it says not of Az. Wait, wait, eigenfunctions of A_y are not eigenfunctions of Az. Because [A_y, A_z] ≠ 0. So yes, their eigenfunctions are not shared. So C's statement is correct. So C could be a correct option.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given. Hmm. The eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator, but since it's a 2x2 matrix, it's acting on a two-dimensional space. The eigenfunctions are orthogonal and form a basis, so that's correct. So D's statement is correct.

Wait, but the question is, during the calculation, which statement is correct. So let's think about what each statement says.

Option C: Can φ be an eigenfunction of A²? Since A² is a Casimir operator, it commutes with each component, so any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². So the first part of C is correct. The second part is that it's not an eigenfunction of Az. That's correct as well because A_y and A_z don't commute. So C's statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given. Well, the operator is 2x2, so the eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors, which form an orthonormal basis for the space. So the statement in D is correct.

Wait, but I need to choose which option is correct during the calculation. Let's go back to the question. It says, which statement is correct. So both C and D could be correct, but let me re-examine the options.

Wait, option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Well, the matrix is 2x2, so the basis is the set of eigenvectors. So yes, the eigenfunctions form a basis. So D is correct.

Hmm, but let's think about the options again. The question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking about the eigenvalues. Wait, perhaps I got the eigenvalues wrong. Let me double-check.

Wait, the matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me write this as S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me compute its eigenvalues.

The characteristic equation is det(S - λ I) = 0.

So,

| -λ    -i     |
| i     -λ  | 

determinant is ( (-λ)(-λ) ) - ( (-i)(i) ) = λ² - (i*(-i)).

Wait, (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is λ² - 1 = 0 → λ²=1 → λ=±1.

So eigenvalues are 1 and -1.

So Ay = (h/(4π)) S → eigenvalues (h/(4π)) *1 and (h/(4π))*(-1) → ±h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues a are ±h/(4π), which are real numbers, so their imaginary parts are zero. Looking at the options again.

Option B says imaginary parts are ±½, which is incorrect because the eigenvalues are real. So B is wrong.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which is also wrong. So eigenvalues are real, so options A and B are incorrect.

Option C: eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A², but
