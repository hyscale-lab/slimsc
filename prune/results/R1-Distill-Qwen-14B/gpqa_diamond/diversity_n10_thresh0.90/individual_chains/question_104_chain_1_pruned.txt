Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift of a star's spectrum as the planet orbits, causing the star to move back and forth. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the planet's presence.

So the question says there are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both planets have circular orbits. The RV method detected the planets, and the shifts are 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method's signal depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Oh right, the formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is given by K = [ ( (G * (M_p)^3 ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 * (1-e^2) )^(1/3) ) ] * ( sin i ) / ( c * (1 day)^(1/3) ) ). But wait, that's a bit complicated. I think for circular orbits, e is zero, so it simplifies.

Alternatively, I remember that the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(1/3) P^(1/3)) ) multiplied by some factors. Since both stars have the same mass (like the Sun), and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), so M_p is the same for both, and M_* is the same as well.

Wait, the formula I think is K = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(c)) * ( (1) ) / ( (1 + M_p/M_*)^(1/3) ) ) * ( P )^(-1/3) ) * sin i / (other constants). Hmm, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the relation between K and P.

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) c ) ) * ( (1) / ( (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) * ( (P/(24*3600*365.25)) )^(-1/3) )

But since the planets are Neptune-like and the stars are solar-like, M_p << M_*, so we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. Similarly, for circular orbits, e=0, so the term simplifies.

So simplifying, K is proportional to M_p / ( M_*^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) ) ), since K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) because the denominator has M_*^(2/3) and P^(1/3) in the denominator.

Wait, let me get this straight. The formula for K when M_p << M_* (so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*) is:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * ( 1 / (c) ) * ( 1 / ( (1 day)^(1/3) ) ) ) * ( 1 / ( (P/(1 day) )^(1/3) ) )

So K ≈ [ (G M_p ) / (M_* c^3 ) ]^(1/3) * [ 1 / ( P^(1/3) ) ]

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the proportionality. Since M_* is the same for both stars, and M_p is the same for both planets, K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period P.

So, K ∝ (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Which means that if K1 is the semi-amplitude for planet #1 and K2 for planet #2, then K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Wait, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Alternatively, K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), so K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3), where C is a constant for given M_p and M_*.

Then K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So rearranging, (
