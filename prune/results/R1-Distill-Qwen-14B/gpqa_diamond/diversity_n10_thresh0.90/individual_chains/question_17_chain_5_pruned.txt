Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on EDTA complexes. Let me think. I remember that EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is a chelating agent that forms complexes with metal ions. The complex formation is usually represented by an equilibrium equation where the metal ion (like Ca²+) reacts with EDTA⁴- to form a complex.

The formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA⁴- ↔ CaEDTA²−. So Kf is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴−]).

Wait, but in this problem, they've given K_Ca-EDTA as 5x10^10. I think that's the formation constant Kf. So Kf = 5e10.

The solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. That means the concentration of CaEDTA²− is 0.02 M. Because it's a 1:1 complex (I think Ca-EDTA is a 1:1 chelate), so the stoichiometry is 1 Ca²+ to 1 EDTA.

So the initial assumption is that the solution is 0.02 M in the complex. But we're being asked for the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²+], because the EDTA is chelated and the calcium is part of the complex.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So I'm thinking that the complex is 0.02 M, and from that, I can use the formation constant to find the [Ca²+] because the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA.

Wait, but the complex is formed in solution. So when you have CaEDTA²− in solution, it can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

The formation constant equation is Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴−]).

But wait, what's the initial situation? The solution is 0.02 M in the complex. So initially, [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M. But then, it can dissociate a little, but given that Kf is very large (5e10), which is a big number, that indicates that the complex is very stable, meaning it doesn't dissociate much. So I can probably assume that the dissociation is negligible, and [CaEDTA²−] ≈ 0.02 M.

Wait, but wait. If Kf is large, that means the reaction tends to form the complex, so the concentration of the complex is high, and the concentrations of the individual ions (Ca²+ and EDTA⁴−) are low.

Wait, but in this case, we have the complex, and we're looking for the concentration of Ca²+ in solution. Since the complex is dissociating into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−, but because Kf is so large, the dissociation is minimal. So the [Ca²+] would be very low.

Wait, but to model this, perhaps I should set up the equilibrium. Let me consider the dissociation:

CaEDTA²− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−

The formation constant Kf is given by [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = 5e10.

Wait, but if the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, then the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− are zero, but as the complex dissociates, let x be the amount dissociated. So:

[CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is small)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4−] = x

But because Kf is so large, x should be very small. So substituting into the Kf equation:

5e10 = (0.02)/(x * x)
=> 5e10 = 0.02/(x²)
=> x² = 0.02/(5e10)
=> x² = 4e-13
=> x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ?

Wait, wait, let me compute that again.

Wait,
