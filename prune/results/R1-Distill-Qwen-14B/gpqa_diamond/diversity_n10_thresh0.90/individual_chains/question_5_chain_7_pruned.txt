Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon. The eigenvector corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, right. The operator in question is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, which means its direction can be described by an angle θ from the z-axis, maybe? Because in the x-z plane, the polar angle θ would determine the direction, and the azimuthal angle φ would be zero or 180, since it's in the x-z plane.

Hmm. So the operator P is presumably the angular momentum operator or something similar because the components are given in terms of Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Oh wait, because the matrices given for P_x, P_y, P_z look like the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], which matches P_x. Similarly, Pauli Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], so that fits P_y. And Pauli Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], matching P_z.

So P is probably a spin operator. The eigenvectors of spin operators along a given direction are the eigenstates of the spin component in that direction. So the eigenvectors would be the spin-up and spin-down states along n.

But the question is specifically about the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So we're looking for the spin-up state along the direction n.

The general formula for the spin operator along a direction n is (ħ/2) times (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). Since n is in the x-z plane, the y-component n_y is zero. So the operator becomes (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

Wait, but wait, n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1. Let me think: how do we find the eigenstates of this operator?

Alternatively, another approach: The eigenvalues of the spin operator S·n are ±ħ/2. We're looking for the eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

In the basis of the Pauli matrices, the eigenstates can be written in terms of the angles θ and φ. But since n is in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π, so the state can be written in terms of θ only.

The standard spin-up state along an arbitrary direction (θ, φ) is given by:

|+⟩ = cos(θ/2)|↑⟩ + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|↓⟩ 

But in our case, φ is zero because n is in the x-z plane. So the state simplifies to cos(θ/2)|↑⟩ + sin(θ/2)|↓⟩.

Wait, actually, is φ 0 or something else? Let me think: in the x-z plane, the angle φ is 0 if the vector is in the x>0, z>0 quadrant, or π if in the x<0, z>0 etc. But in any case, since the direction is arbitrary in x-z, the general state would have e^{iφ} where φ is 0 or π, but since the options show e^{iφ}, maybe option B is considering the phase.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option B is (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ)

Wait that's in terms of θ and φ. Option C is cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). Option A has sqrt(2/3) ħ and sqrt(1/3) ħ.

Wait, but the question says "the normalized eigenvector." So the eigenvector must be a unit vector. Let's think about how to find the eigenvector.

Alternatively, maybe I should construct the operator P·n, which is (P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z).

Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y =0. So P·n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z.

Given P_x is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], P_z is (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So P·n in matrix form is (ħ/2)(n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]]).

So the matrix becomes:
(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x],
            [n_x, -n_z] ]
Because n_z is the top left, n_x top right and bottom left, and -n_z bottom right.

So the operator matrix is (ħ/2) times that matrix.

We need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix when the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Let me denote the matrix as M = (ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x],
                                      [n_x, -n_z] ].

Wait, no, actually, because n is a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1.

Wait, the eigenvalue equation is M |v⟩ = (ħ/2) |v⟩.

Wait, no, the operator P·n has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. So when the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, the equation is (P·n) |v⟩ = (ħ/2) |v⟩.

So (ħ/2) * M |v⟩ = (ħ/2) |v⟩ → M |v⟩ = |v⟩.

So the matrix M is:

M = [ [n_z, n_x],
       [n_x, -n_z] ]

Wait, because (ħ/2) * M is the operator, so to get the equation M |v> = |v>, the matrix is [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

So the eigenvalue equation is [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] * [a, b]^T = [a, b]^T.

So setting up the equations:

n_z * a + n_x * b = a → (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0.

n_x a - n_z b = b → n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0.

So we have two equations:

1. (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0.

2. n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0.

We can write these as:

Equation 1: (n_z - 1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

Equation 2: n_x a = (n_z +1) b → a = [ (n_z +1) / n_x ] b.

Wait, this seems a bit tricky. Let me try substituting equation 1 into equation 2.

From equation 1: a = (-n_x b)/(n_z -1).

Substitute into equation 2:

n_x [ (-n_x b)/(n_z -1) ] = (n_z +1) b.

Simplify:

- n_x^2 b / (n_z -1) = (n_z +1) b.

Assuming b ≠ 0 (since otherwise the vector is zero), we can divide both sides by b:

- n_x^2 / (n_z -1) = n_z + 1.

Multiply both sides by (n_z -1):

- n_x^2 = (n_z +1)(n_z -1) → -n_x^2 = n_z^2 -1.

But since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1 → n_x^2 = 1 - n_z^2.

Substituting:

- (1 - n_z^2) = n_z^2 -1 → -1 + n_z^2 = n_z^2 -1 → which holds true.

So the two equations are consistent, and so the eigenvectors can be determined using equation 1 or 2.

Let me choose from equation 1: a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

But perhaps it's easier to write the ratio a/b.

Let me denote the ratio as r = a/b.

So from equation 1: r = -n_x/(n_z -1).

We can write this as r = n_x/(1 - n_z).

Wait, n_z is cosθ, since if θ is the angle from z-axis, then n_z = cosθ and n_x = sinθ (since in x-z plane, the x-component is sinθ, and z component is cosθ).

So substituting n_z = cosθ and n_x = sinθ,

r = (sinθ)/(1 - cosθ).

We can simplify this using trigonometric identities.

Recall that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin^2(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So substituting,

r = [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] / [2 sin^2(θ/2)] ] = [cos(θ/2)] / [ sin(θ/2) ] = cot(θ/2).

So r = a/b = cot(θ/2) → a = b cot(θ/2).

So the eigenvector is [a, b] = [ b cot(θ/2), b ].

To normalize, the sum of squares must be 1.

So |a|^2 + |b|^2 = |b|^2 (cot^2(θ/2) +1 ) = |b|^2 csc^2(θ/2) ) =1.

So |b|^2 = sin^2(θ/2) → b = ± sin(θ/2).

Assuming we take the positive value (since the sign can be absorbed into the phase), b= sin(θ/2), a= cos(θ/2).

Wait, because cot(θ/2) = cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2). So a = cos(θ/2), b = sin(θ/2).

Wait wait, because a = b * cot(theta/2) = [sin(theta/2)] * [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] = cos(theta/2).

So the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

But wait, in the x-z plane, the direction could influence the phase. But in our earlier setup, we considered the angle phi as zero. However, in the general case, the components could have a phase factor. Wait, but in our case, since n is in x-z plane, phi is zero or pi, depending on the x-component's sign.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The general spin state along a direction (n_x, n_y, n_z) is given by:

|+> = cos(theta/2) |↑> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |↓>,

where theta is the angle from the z-axis, and phi is the azimuthal angle (the angle in the xy-plane from the x-axis).

But in our case, since n is in the x-z plane, phi is 0 or pi, because n is in the x-z plane, so phi is either 0 (if n_x is positive) or pi (if n_x is negative). So e^{i phi} would be 1 or -1, depending on phi being 0 or pi.

Wait, but in our earlier setup, we found the eigenvector as [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]. But that doesn't include a phase factor. However, the general solution includes e^{i phi}.

But looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), and option B has (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

Wait, but in our calculation, the eigenvector for eigenvalue +hbar/2 is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

So looking at the options, option C is exactly that, except without the ħ factors. Wait, the options are given in terms of hbar, but the eigenvectors are vectors, so their components should be dimensionless. Wait, the options have hbar in them, which doesn't make sense for a normalized vector.

Wait option A: (sqrt(2/3) hbar, sqrt(1/3) hbar) — that can't be right because the vector components have dimensions of ħ, which is energy*time, so it's not dimensionless. So probably, the correct normalized eigenvector doesn't have ħ in it. So options A and D have hbar, which might be a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

"the elements of the normalized eigenvector."

Normalizing the eigenvector would require it to have unit length. So each component is a number with no units, as vectors are normalized.

But the options A and D are multiplied by hbar.

Wait, perhaps the eigenvectors are given with a factor of hbar? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, the operator P is given as components multiplied by hbar/2, but the eigenvector is a vector in the Hilbert space, which is dimensionless. So the eigenvector components are dimensionless.

So options A and D, which have hbar, are incorrect because they have units. So the correct answers must be among B, C.

From our earlier calculation, the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Looking at the options, option C is exactly that.

But wait, in the general case, the eigenvector can have a phase factor. So perhaps the answer is more general, allowing for e^{i phi} in the second component.

Wait, in the standard case, when n is in the x-z plane, phi is 0, so the second component is sin(theta/2), not multiplied by e^{i phi}.

So in that case, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], which matches option C.

But wait, option B is ( cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) ), which is more general but doesn't involve theta/2.

Hmm. Let me think again.

Wait another approach: The eigenstates of S·n are |+> = e^{-i phi/2} ( cos(theta/2)|↑> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)|↓> )

Wait, no, perhaps I should write the eigenstate as:

|+> = cos(theta/2) |↑> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |↓>,

since the spin-up state along direction (theta, phi) is given by that expression.

In our case, since n is in the x-z plane, phi is 0 or pi, right? Because if n is, say, pointing along the +x direction, then theta is 90 degrees, phi is 0. If n is pointing along the -x direction, theta is 90, phi pi. If n is pointing along +z, theta 0, phi 0.

But for the general case, the direction is arbitrary in x-z, so phi is either 0 or pi, depending on the x-component's sign.

In our earlier calculation, n_x is sin(theta), and n_z is cos(theta). So if n_x is positive, phi is 0, else phi is pi.

So, in the eigenvector, the second component would have a phase factor of e^{i phi}.

But in our calculation, the eigenvector came out as [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Wait, but that doesn't include the phase factor. So is that correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me retrace.

Earlier, when I set up the equations for the eigenvector, I had n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta).

The ratio a/b = r = sin(theta)/(1 - cos(theta)).

Simplify that:

r = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)]/[ 2 sin^2(theta/2) ]

Because 1 - cos(theta) = 2 sin^2(theta/2), and sin(theta)= 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So r = [2 sin cos ] / [2 sin^2 ] = cos/sin = cot(theta/2).

So a = b * cot(theta/2).

So a = [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] * b.

But when we normalize, a^2 + b^2 =1.

So [ cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) ] * b^2 =1 → b^2=1 → b= ±1.

Wait, but that's only if a = (cos/sin) b.

Wait, wait, no.

Wait, a = [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] * b.

So a² + b² = [ cos^2/(sin^2) + 1 ] * b² = [ (cos^2 + sin^2)/sin^2 ] * b² = (1/sin^2) * b² =1.

So (1/sin^2) b² =1 → b² = sin^2 → b = ± sin(theta/2).

So, if we take b = sin(theta/2), then a = cos(theta/2).

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, in the general case, the state has a phase factor e^{i phi}.

Ah, right, in my earlier calculation, I assumed phi=0, which is why the phase isn't there. So the general case would have the second component as e^{i phi} sin(theta/2).

But in our problem, the direction is in the x-z plane, which implies that phi is either 0 or pi. So the phase factor would be either 1 or -1.

So the general eigenvector would be [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

Looking back at the options, option B is (cos theta, e^{i phi} sin theta), which doesn't have the theta/2 in the arguments. Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So our calculation shows that the correct components are [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

But do any of the options match this? Option C is without the phase factor, and the angles are theta/2.

Option B has theta instead of theta/2, and includes the phase factor.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think about the spin state.

The spin-up state along an arbitrary direction (theta, phi) is given by:

|+⟩ = e^{-i phi/2} [ cos(theta/2) |↑> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |↓> ]

Wait, but that depends on the convention. Some sources use different phase factors. Alternatively, another source says that the state is:

|+⟩ = cos(theta/2) |↑> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |↓>.

So in any case, the components are cos(theta/2) and e^{i phi} sin(theta/2).

So in the problem, the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi is either 0 or pi. So the second component is either sin(theta/2) or - sin(theta/2).

But the problem states that the direction is arbitrary in x-z, so the eigenvector components must include the phase e^{i phi}.

Looking at the options, option B is (cos theta, e^{i phi} sin theta), which uses theta instead of theta/2. So that's not matching.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), without a phase factor. So that's the same as when phi=0.

But the correct general form includes the phase factor. So which option includes the phase factor and correct angles?

Wait, option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is using theta instead of theta/2. That doesn't match.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C, which uses theta/2, but doesn't include the phase factor.

But why would the phase factor not be included? Because in the x-z plane, phi can be zero or pi. Wait, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, meaning that the angle phi could vary based on the direction. So the phase factor is necessary.

But looking again at the options, none of them seem to exactly match [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta
