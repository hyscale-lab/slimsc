Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

The problem says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, I can probably use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Right, the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in different energy states to the temperature. The formula is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k_B T) ). Oh, but wait, in this case, the energy levels have a specific difference, so E_i - E_j is given as 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, but the problem says that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So for star_1, the population in the excited state is twice that of star_2. So maybe n1/n2 = 2? Or wait, no. Wait, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So (n_excited)_1 = 2 * (n_excited)_2. So the ratio is (n1)/(n2) = 2.

But I need to consider whether the energy levels are the same for both stars. I think so, because it's the same energy difference in each case. So the energy levels should be the same for both stars. So the energy difference E is the same for both, 1.38e-23 J.

So applying the Boltzmann equation for each star. Let's denote for star 1, the ratio of excited to ground state is n1/n2. Wait, no, in the Boltzmann equation, it's the ratio of the populations in two energy states. So for the excited state (i) and ground state (j), the equation would be (n_i/n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k_B T) ), where ΔE is E_i - E_j.

But wait, in our case, the problem says that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So for each, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is n1_excited / n1_ground = (g_excited/g_ground) * exp( -ΔE/(k_B T1) )

Similarly, for star_2, it's n2_excited / n2_ground = (g_excited/g_ground) * exp( -ΔE/(k_B T2) )

Wait, but the problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So (n1_excited)/(n1_ground) = 2 * (n2_excited)/(n2_ground) )

Wait, but let's think again. The problem says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited..." So I think it means that the excitation level (
