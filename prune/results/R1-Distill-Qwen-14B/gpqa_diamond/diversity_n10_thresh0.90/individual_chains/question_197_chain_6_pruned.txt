Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what we're given.

The question is about identifying the product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are four different compounds, and I need to figure out which one is correct based on the IR and NMR data provided.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, 1720 cm⁻¹, 1610 cm⁻¹, and 1450 cm⁻¹. The broad peak between 3400-2500 usually indicates an -OH group, like in an alcohol, carboxylic acid, or maybe an amine. But since the other IR peaks are around 1720 and lower, I'm thinking more about carbonyl groups. 1720 is a strong carbonyl, which could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Wait, wait, but a carboxylic acid would have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300. So maybe that's what's happening here.

Looking at the options, options A and C are carboxylic acids. Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid, and option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Options B and D are aromatic compounds without carboxylic acid groups. So that might narrow things down a bit.

Now let's check the NMR data. The ¹H NMR shows several peaks:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm is characteristic of an -OH proton, especially in a carboxylic acid. So that supports the idea that the compound is a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde, but those are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But the broadness here makes me think it's an -OH.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This looks like two aromatic protons as a doublet. So perhaps para-substituted aromatic ring, like two protons next to a substituent.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, which would fit with an aromatic ring that's para-substituted. So the two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 suggest a para-disubstituted benzene.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, maybe a methylene group next to something else, like a carbonyl or an oxygen.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, perhaps a CH2 group connected to something else, maybe part of an isobutyl group or similar.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet as a doublet, which usually is a CH2CH3 group attached to something. Wait, a doublet with 3H implies maybe a CH(CH3) group or a CH2CH3 attached to something with a neighboring CH. Alternatively, it could be a geminal substituent.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, likely a methyl group at the end of a chain, like CH2CH2CH3.

Putting the NMR together: The aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. The presence of a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm indicates an -OH, so the substituent is probably a carboxylic acid group attached to the benzene ring. 

Let me think about the structure. If the benzene ring has -COOH as a substituent, then it's a benzoic acid derivative. The other substituent on the ring would be an alkyl group. Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the ring has a benzoic acid group (at position 1, perhaps) and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

Wait, the NMR also shows an ethyl group maybe? Let me think. The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is a typical terminal CH2CH2CH3. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) would be a CH(CH2CH3)2? Or maybe a CH2 connected to a CH(CH3) group.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group. Wait, let's break down the NMR:

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, its structure is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)2. So the groups would be:

- The CH(CH2CH3) would have a CH group. The NMR shows a multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H) which could be that CH group.

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl: let's imagine it's attached to the benzene ring. The structure would be benzene with a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Wait, no, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the ring? Wait, no: the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3) attached to the ring. No, wait, the structure is actually -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that can't be. Let me think: the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, perhaps more accurately, the substituent is a butyl group where the branching is at the second carbon. So, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- but that can't be correct. Wait, no: the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but that would have the substituent on the second carbon.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the ring. So the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group. Let me look at the NMR:

The peaks at 2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d,3H), and 0.9 (t,3H).

Wait, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for one proton. That's probably the CH group from the substituent. For a sec-butyl group, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me draw it:

The substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is:

Benzene ring - CH2 - CH(CH2CH3) ?

Wait, no. A sec-butyl group is like this: CH2-CH(CH2CH3) attached to the ring. So the group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring. So the structure would be benzene with a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group at the
