Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the possible decay channels for this boson X. The problem gives me the interaction Lagrangian, the mass of X is 6 GeV. The question is about kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. Hmm, I remember that for a particle decay, the mass of the boson must be greater than or equal to twice the mass of the fermions it's decaying into. Also, I think the interaction term tells me which fermions X can couple to.

Looking at the Lagrangian: L(y) = -λf f̄ ψf(y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. Oh, perhaps it's written as L = -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So the interaction is between the boson X and fermions ψ_f. So X can couple to any fermion ψ_f that's present in this term.

Wait, the term is written as -λ f f̄ X ψ_f(y)^2? Or maybe I'm misinterpreting. Oh, wait, no, the way it's written is L = -λ f f̄ ψ_f(y) (v + X) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think that's a typo in the way it's written. Maybe it's more like L = -λ X ψ_f†ψ_f, because that would make sense for Yukawa coupling. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Yukawa interaction where X is a scalar coupling to the fermion field ψ_f.

In any case, the key point is that X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the fermion mass is less than half of X's mass because the energy available must be at least twice the fermion mass. So the mass of X is 6 GeV. So for a decay X → f f̄, each f must have a mass m_f ≤ (6 GeV)/2 = 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait, no, because for a two-body decay, the threshold is when the mass of the fermion is exactly half the X mass. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be produced.

So I need to list all the fermions with mass ≤ 3 GeV. Let me recall the masses of the known fermions.

Quarks:
- Up (u): about 2.2 MeV (much less than 3 GeV)
- Down (d): ~4.7 MeV (also way under)
- Strange (s): ~95 MeV (under)
- Charm (c): ~1.3 GeV (under)
- Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV (over 3 GeV)
- Top (t): way too heavy, like 173 GeV (so no)
Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV (under)
- Neutrinos: negligible masses, so yes.

Wait, but the options don't include neutrinos, so maybe we're considering only charged leptons and quarks. So for the options, the possible fermions are:

Charged leptons: e, μ, τ.

Quarks: u, d, s, c. Because their masses are under 3 GeV.

Wait, but the tau has a mass of ~1.78 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. So X can decay into tau+ tau-.

But what about the bottom quark? It's about 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So X cannot decay into b b̄. So any option that includes b b̄ is wrong.

Looking at the options:

Option A: includes b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau−, e+ e−. So this includes b which is too heavy. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: includes c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−. So all these fermions have masses under 3 GeV, except maybe c is 1.3 GeV. So this looks possible.

Option C: includes c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−. The top quark is way too heavy, so X cannot decay into t t̄. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−. Again, b is too heavy, so D is incorrect.

Wait, but let me check the fermion masses accurately.

Quarks:
u: ~2.2 MeV
d: ~4.7 MeV
s: ~95 MeV
c: ~1.3 GeV
b: ~4.5 GeV
t: ~173 GeV

Charged leptons:
e: ~0.511 MeV
mu: ~105.7 MeV
tau: ~1.78 GeV

So any fermion with m_f ≤ 3 GeV is allowed.

So which options only include fermions with m_f ≤3 GeV?

Option B: c (1.3 GeV), s (~0.095 GeV), u (0.0022 GeV), d (0.0047 GeV), tau (1.78 GeV), mu (0.105 GeV), e (0.0005 GeV). So all these are under 3 GeV. So possible.

Option B includes c c̄, which is allowed. But wait, what about the strange quark? Its mass is about 100 MeV, so allowed.

So why is option B correct? Because it includes all the possible fermions that X can decay into.

Option D includes b, which is 4.5 GeV, so no.

So the correct answer should be the option that includes only fermions with m_f ≤3 GeV.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

So that's all allowed. So option B is the correct answer.


To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \), we analyze the interaction Lagrangian and the mass of \( X \), which is 6 GeV. The decay \( X \to f\bar{f} \) is allowed if the fermion mass \( m_f \) satisfies \( m_f \leq \frac{m_X}{2} = 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Additionally, the interaction term indicates that \( X \) couples to fermions \( \psi_f \), so only fermions present in the Lagrangian can be decay products.

### Fermion Masses
- **Quarks**:  
  - \( u \): \( \sim 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \)  
  - \( d \): \( \sim 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \)  
  - \( s \): \( \sim 95 \, \text{MeV} \)  
  - \( c \): \( \sim 1.3 \, \text{GeV} \)  
  - \( b \): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy)  
  - \( t \): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy)  
- **Leptons**:  
  - \( e \): \( \sim 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \)  
  - \( \mu \): \( \sim 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)  
  - \( \tau \): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)  

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which has a mass of \( 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), exceeding the threshold. This option is incorrect.  
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c} \), \( s\bar{s} \), \( u\bar{u} \), \( d\bar{d} \), \( \tau^{+}\tau^{-} \), \( \mu^{+}\mu^{-} \), and \( e^{+}e^{-} \). All these fermions have masses \( \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \), making this option correct.  
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which has a mass of \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \), far exceeding the threshold. This option is incorrect.  
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which has a mass of \( 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), exceeding the threshold. This option is incorrect.  

### Conclusion
The only kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order are those listed in **Option B**, as all the fermions involved have masses \( \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).
