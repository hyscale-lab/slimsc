Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about planets and the probability of them transiting. Hmm, I remember that transits are when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I need to think this through.

The question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, both have circular orbits. The host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's star is more massive (twice that of Planet_2's star). 

Wait, the host stars have the same radii but different masses. I think more massive stars are usually larger, but maybe if the star is evolved, like a subgiant or something, it might have the same radius as a less massive main-sequence star. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

So the main point is about the probability of a transit. I recall that the probability of a planet transiting depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. Oh, right! The probability also depends on the size of the star because a larger star makes the transit less likely. But wait, both stars have the same radius, so maybe that's a factor that cancels out here.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The transit probability is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / (a * sin i)), but I'm getting confused. Oh wait, no, I think the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the probability that the orbit is aligned such that it transits. Oh, right, the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 times (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))), but since both have circular orbits, e=0, so that term is 1. So it's just (R_p / R_s)^2. But wait, both planets have the same mass, but mass doesn't directly determine radius. Wait, the question says "Earth-like" but doesn't specify their radii. Oh wait, the masses are same, but no, mass doesn't directly translate to radius. Hmm, but wait, the question says that both have same masses, but that's it.

Wait a minute. The problem states that both planets have the same mass. But when considering transit probability, what's needed is the planet's radius, not mass. Oh wait, but without knowing their radii, how can we proceed? Hmm, maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the factors. Because the RV method gives us the minimum mass, but not radius. But the transit depth depends on the planet's radius and the star's radius. Oh, but in this question, the probability is about whether the planet transits, not the depth. So the main factors for transit probability are the alignment, which depends on the orbital inclination, and the relative size of the planet and star.

But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me go back. The probability of a planet transiting is higher when the planet's orbit is edge-on relative to us. The probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, but I think it's (R_p / R_s), but I'm not sure. Wait, actually, the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the probability that the inclination is such that the planet passes in front. Or wait, maybe it's (R_p + R_s) / a, but I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, another approach: the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / (R_s * (1 + m_p / M_s))))^ something. Hmm, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the orbital distance.

Wait, I think I remember that the probability of a transit can be approximated as (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / R_s) )^2, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance. Wait, no, I think the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbit is more likely to cross our line of sight. The probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2, but also depends on the orbital size. Let me think.

Wait, the orbital distance a is the distance from the star. The probability of a transit depends on the relative size of the star compared to the orbit. The higher the a (the farther the planet from the star), the less likely the transit because the alignment is less probable. So the probability is inversely proportional to a. Because for a planet farther away, the chance that it crosses our line of sight is lower.

So the formula for the probability of transit is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a)^2. Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, I think the formula is (R_p + R_s)^2 / (a^2). No, wait, that's the area of the star compared to the area of the planet's orbit? Maybe it's the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital radius, R_s / a. Because the planet's orbit is a circle, and the chance that we're aligned to see it pass in front is higher when a is smaller.

Wait, I think the transit probability can be approximated as (R_p/(R_s))² × (R_s/(a))². Wait, that doesn't seem to make sense. Let me think again. Oh, I remember a formula where the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1/(a / R_s)). So
