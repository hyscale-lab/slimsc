Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars: Star_1 and Star_2. The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Then, through spectroscopy, they found that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. Hmm, that probably relates to their temperatures because the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law. Oh right, Wien's Law says that λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. That's an important point.

Next, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Radial velocity is the speed at which they're moving towards or away from us. But wait, how does that affect luminosity? Oh, wait, no, not directly. Because luminosity depends on intrinsic properties, not velocity. Unless we're considering Doppler shift affecting the observed brightness, but I don't think that's the case here. The question says they computed the luminosity using black body radiation, so radial velocity might not factor into that calculation. Maybe it's a red herring, or perhaps it's used for something else, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, the question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. So, we need to calculate L1/L2.

I remember that the luminosity of a star (as a black body) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T^4. Oh yes, so L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power. So if I can find the ratio of R and T for both stars, I can compute the luminosity ratio.

Wait, but both stars have the same peak wavelength, which I said earlier implies the same temperature. So T1 = T2. That makes things easier. So, the temperature ratio is 1.

So, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 would be (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4. Since T1=T2, that term is 1. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

Given that R1 is 1.5 R2, substituting that in, we get (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that would be 2.25 times, which is option A.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem also gives the masses. They said Star_1's mass is 1.5 times Star_2. But in the problem, the question is about luminosity based on black body radiation, which depends on radius and temperature. So mass might not directly affect the luminosity in this context, unless it's being used for something else, like determining the radius or temperature. But in the problem, the radii are given, so perhaps mass is a distractor.

Alternatively, if the problem had given other parameters like surface gravity, but since here we have radius and temperature, I think we don't need the masses. So the radial velocity part—like, what's that for? Because if the stars are moving, maybe their observed flux is Doppler shifted, but the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity, assuming black body. So they probably accounted for any Doppler effects when measuring the flux, but in terms of their intrinsic luminosity, it's based on radius and temperature.

Wait, maybe the radial velocities are given to indicate that their actual velocities are different, but since we're considering their luminosity from their own properties, the velocities don't affect the calculation. So perhaps the velocities are there to test whether we're considering Doppler shifts or not, but in this case, since we're looking at the ratio of luminosities, which is an intrinsic property, the velocities shouldn't matter.

Wait another thought, maybe the velocities affect the observed flux, but the problem states that the luminosity is computed assuming black body, so they took that into account. So, for example, if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, which would affect the observed wavelength, but since the question says that the peak wavelengths are the same, perhaps that indicates that any Doppler shift has been accounted for. Because otherwise, if Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, its light would be blueshifted, making it appear hotter (shorter wavelength) than Star_1, but the problem says their peak wavelengths are the same. So maybe the observed wavelengths are the same, implying that their rest wavelengths are the same, so T is same.

Wait, wait, that's a bit more detailed. Let me think. If the stars are moving towards us, their emitted wavelengths would be blueshifted. So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s towards us, then its observed wavelength would be shorter than its emitted. Star_1 has zero velocity, so its observed wavelength is the same as emitted.

But the problem says that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So, so λ_observed for both is same. So, for Star_2, λ_observed = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ), but wait, v is radial velocity, and if v is towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter. So for Star_2, λ_observed = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Wait, but in this case, Star_1's λ_observed is same as its emitted, so λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

And
