Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?

Hmm, the options are A to D, with energies in eV. I remember that the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time uncertainty (Δt) is at least on the order of ħ (hbar), which is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

Wait, but time here is given as the lifetime of the states. So the uncertainty in time, Δt, is the lifetime of each state. Oh wait, but wait—both states have different lifetimes. Or is the question considering the time resolution required to distinguish them?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The energy-time uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So if the states have lifetimes τ1 and τ2, then their energy uncertainties would be ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2. But wait, the problem is about resolving two energy levels, so perhaps we need the energy difference between them to be much larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe just each of their uncertainties?

Wait, no, when you have two states with different energies, to resolve them, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the combined energy uncertainty of both states. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might overlap and not be distinguishable.

So the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Or perhaps, since each state has its own uncertainty, the difference must be bigger than each individual uncertainty? Not sure.

Wait, let me think. When you have two states with lifetimes τ1 and τ2, the uncertainty in their energies is ΔE1 = ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 = ħ/τ2. To resolve them, the energy difference |E2 - E1| should be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the peaks might overlap, making it hard to distinguish.

So ΔE_diff = |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach is that the energy resolution required is ΔE_res ≈ ħ/(Δt), where Δt is the time over which the measurement is made. But since the states have different lifetimes, perhaps the measurement time is related to the shorter lifetime? Or maybe it's the longer one? Hmm, not sure.

Let me think about the given data. The lifetimes are τ1 = 1e-9 sec, τ2 = 1e-8 sec. So τ2 is longer than τ1. So the energy uncertainty for E1 is ħ/τ1, which is larger than ħ/τ2 because τ1 is smaller.

Wait, but let's compute the uncertainties. Let's calculate ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Compute ΔE1 = ħ / τ1.

But what's the value of ħ in eV·s? I remember that 1 eV is 1.6e-19 joules, and ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So, let's convert ħ to eV·s.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s * (1 eV / 1.602176634e-19 J) ≈ (1.0545718e-34) / (1.6e-19) eV·s ≈ 6.58e-16 eV·s.

So ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (6.58e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = (6.58e-16 eV·s) / (1e-8 s) = 6.58e-8 eV.

Wait, so the energy uncertainties are approximately 6.58e-7 eV and 6.58e-8 eV.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that the states have energies E1 and E2. So the energy difference between E1 and E2 should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties to be resolvable.

So the minimum ΔE for resolution would be (ΔE1 + ΔE2), which is approximately (6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8) eV ≈ 7.23e-7 eV.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are A) 1e-9 eV, B) 1e-11 eV, C) 1e-4 eV, D) 1e-8 eV.

Wait, none of the options are anywhere near 7e-7 eV. So perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the energy difference in terms of being greater than the uncertainty of the measurement apparatus, not the sum of the two states' uncertainties.

Wait, maybe the approach is that the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Or perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties.

Wait, let me think again. Each state has its own energy uncertainty. So for E1, the uncertainty is ΔE1 = 6.58e-7 eV. For E2, it's ΔE2 = 6.58e-8 eV.

So to resolve E1 and E2, the energy difference between them should be greater than the sum of these two uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the sum, the two states' energy ranges might overlap, making them indistinguishable.

Wait, so the minimum required ΔE for them to be resolvable is (ΔE1 + ΔE2) ≈ 7.23e-7 eV. But looking at the options, the maximum option given is C) 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than our calculated 7e-7 eV. So any option above 7e-7 would work, but none of the options are in that range.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the correct approach is that the energy difference should be greater than the individual energy uncertainty, but which one? Because the longer the lifetime, the smaller the uncertainty. So the state with the shorter lifetime (τ1=1e-9) has a larger uncertainty (ΔE1=6.58e-7 eV), and the state with longer lifetime (τ2=1e-8) has a smaller uncertainty.

So, the energy difference should be larger than ΔE1, because if it's larger than the larger uncertainty, then it's automatically larger than the sum. Wait, no, because ΔE1 is larger than ΔE2. So if the energy difference is larger than ΔE1, it's definitely larger than ΔE2, but does that ensure the sum is also covered? Maybe not, because ΔE1 + ΔE2 could be larger than ΔE1. Wait, no. Because ΔE1 is 6.58e-7, and ΔE2 is about 6.58e-8, so their sum is 7.23e-7. So if the energy difference is 1e-4 eV (option C), which is 0.0001 eV, that's 1e-4 eV. Let's compute 1e-4 eV in terms of 7.23e-7 eV.

1e-4 is 100 times larger than 1e-6, which is 100 times larger than 1e-8. 7.23e-7 is approximately 0.7e-6, so 1e-4 is about 100 times larger than that. So 1e-4 is way above the required 7e-7, so it's definitely resolvable.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is well above the required 7e-7 eV. So that's a possible answer.

But wait, are any other options above 7e-7 eV? Let's check.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV = 0.001 * 1e-7 eV → way below 7e-7 eV.

B) 1e-11 eV → way too small.

C) 1e-4 eV → 10000e-7 eV → much larger.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.01e-7 eV → way below.

So the only option that's above the required 7e-7 eV is C.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the approach is that the energy difference must be greater than the energy uncertainty of the measurement, which is determined by the longer lifetime. Because the longer the lifetime, the more precise the energy measurement. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty of each state. So E_diff > ΔE1 and E_diff > ΔE2.

In that case, E_diff must be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties, which is ΔE1 = 6.58e-7 eV.

So any E_diff above 6.58e-7 eV would be resolvable. So option C is 1e-4, which is way higher. So that would work. But again, none of the other options are above 6.58e-7 except C.

Wait, but wait another thing. Maybe the problem is considering the uncertainty associated with each state as being the inverse of their lifetimes, but perhaps the question is considering the energy difference to be on the order of 1/tau, so the energy difference should be approximately comparable to the larger uncertainty.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference needs to be much larger than the uncertainty of the states. Wait, but the question says "could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved." So any ΔE larger than the sum of the uncertainties (i.e., 7e-7 eV) would be acceptable.

The options have C as 1e-4 eV, which is 100 times larger than 1e-6 eV. So that's way above the threshold.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because in the initial calculation, the energy difference needed is about 7e-7 eV, but none of the options except C are that large, and C is way larger. So the correct answer must be C.

Wait, but then why the options include D) 1e-8 eV, which is smaller than both ΔE1 and ΔE2. That's about 0.00000001 eV. But that's way below the required 7e-7 eV, so that wouldn't be resolvable.

So the correct option is C) 1e-4 eV.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we apply the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \hbar
\]

Here, \( \Delta t \) corresponds to the lifetime of the states, and \( \Delta E \) represents the energy uncertainty. For the two states, the lifetimes are \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). The energy uncertainties are given by:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2}
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{6.58 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{6.58 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E_{\text{diff}} = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{diff}} > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{diff}} > 6.58 \times 10^{-7} + 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.23 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

Now, we evaluate the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** This is much smaller than \( 7.23 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** This is also much smaller than \( 7.23 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** This is approximately \( 10000 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.23 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** This is much smaller than \( 7.23 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition for clear resolution is **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**.
