Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider so that the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, I need to use special relativity equations, probably the ones involving gamma or beta factors.

Wait, the nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. So, lithium normally has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = mass number 6. So the atomic mass number A is 6. But wait, when considering a nucleus in a collider, I think we're dealing with the mass of the nucleus, which would be the sum of the individual nucleons. But wait, in reality, the mass isn't exactly additive because of binding energy, but maybe for this problem, we can approximate it using the average mass of a nucleon?

So, each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c². So for a Li-6 nucleus, there are 6 nucleons, so the rest mass would be 6 * 938 MeV. Let me calculate that: 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. Hmm, but wait, that's the rest mass energy. But in a collider, the particles are moving at relativistic speeds, so the total energy would be gamma times the rest mass energy.

Wait, but the question is about the kinetic energy or the total energy? Oh, the question says "the energy of the RHIC," which I think refers to the kinetic energy imparted to the nucleus. Or wait, sometimes in particle physics, the "energy" can refer to the total energy, which includes rest mass. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The problem states, "the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So, I can use the beta factor, beta = v/c = 0.96. Then, I can find gamma, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). Let me compute gamma. Beta squared is 0.96^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - beta² is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. Let me calculate 0.96^2: 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... roughly 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus is m c². For Li-6, as I said, 6 nucleons each with mass about 938 MeV. So m = 6 * 938 MeV = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

So the total energy, E, of the nucleus would be gamma * m c². E = gamma * 5.628 GeV.

Wait, but wait. The problem asks for the energy of the RHIC, which is the collider. I'm a bit unclear on whether the question wants the total energy (including rest mass) or just the kinetic energy. Hmm. In particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, I think they usually refer to the kinetic energy per particle. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me read the question again.

The question says, "What is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?" So perhaps they are asking for the total energy, which includes both rest mass and kinetic. But sometimes people might refer to the kinetic energy. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the total energy is gamma * m c², and the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) * m c². So the question could be either. Let's see the possible answers. The options are A) 18.475 GeV, B) 23.069 GeV, C) 20.132 GeV, D) 21.419 GeV.

Wait, let's compute gamma * m c². Gamma is ~3.5714. m c² is 5.628 GeV. So E = 3.5714 * 5.628 ≈ let's calculate that. 3.5714 * 5 = 17.857. 3.5714 * 0.628 ≈ 2.239. So total around 20.096 GeV. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. But perhaps using more precise gamma would make it more accurate.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately. beta is 0.96, so beta squared is 0.96² = 0.9216. 1 - beta squared is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, so gamma is 1/0.28 which is exactly 35/10 = 3.5. Wait, wait, wait, no. 0.28 is 28/100 = 7/25. So 1 / (7/25) )=25/7 ≈3.57142857... So gamma is exactly 25/7, which is approximately 3.57142857.

Wait, but wait, 0.28 is 28/100 which is 7/25. So sqrt(7^2/(25)^2) is 7/25? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 1 - beta² is 0.0784, which is (0.28)^2. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, which is 28/100 = 7/25. So then gamma is 1/(7/25) =25/7 ≈3.57142857.

So gamma is exactly 25/7 ≈3.57142857.

So E = (25/7) * m c². m c² is 5.628 GeV.

So 25/7 times 5.628 GeV.

Let me calculate that precisely.

25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

5.628 * 3.57142857.

Let me compute it step by step.

5 * 3.57142857 = 17.85714285

0.628 *3.57142857.

0.6 *3.57142857 = 2.14285714

0.028 *3.57142857 = 0.100.

So 2.14285714 + 0.100 = 2.24285714.

Adding to the 17.85714285: 17.85714285 + 2.24285714 = 20.09999999 GeV.

Wait, that's approximately 20.1 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close but a bit higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 5.628 * (25/7) exactly.

Let me compute 5.628 * (25/7).

25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

But perhaps doing it as fractions would be more precise.

5.628 GeV is 5628 MeV, but perhaps that's complicating things.

Alternatively, 5.628 * (25/7) = (5.628 * 25 ) /7.

5.628 *25: 5 *25 is 125, 0.628 *25 is 15.7. So 125 +15.7=140.7.

So 140.7 /7 =20.1. Exactly 20.1 GeV.

Wait, but wait, the options have C as 20.132 GeV. Hmm, but according to this, it's 20.1 GeV.

But wait, perhaps I need to calculate gamma more accurately. Wait, beta is 0.96, so beta squared is exactly (96/100)^2 = (24/25)^2 = 576/625. So 1 - beta squared is (625 -576)/625 =49/625. So sqrt(49/625) is 7/25. So gamma is 25/7, exactly.

Ah! So gamma is 25/7. So E =25/7 * m c².

m c² is 5.628 GeV.

So 25/7 *5.628 = (25 *5.628)/7.

Let me compute 25 *5.628.

5.628 *25: 5 *25=125, 0.628 *25=15.7. So total 140.7.

140.7 /7 =20.1.

So E=20.1 GeV.

But the options have option C as 20.132 GeV. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass energy.

Wait, another thought: the mass of a lithium-6 nucleus isn't exactly 6 * 938 MeV because the binding energy reduces the mass. But maybe for this problem, it's assumed that the mass is approximately 6 * 938 MeV. Let me check Li-6's actual mass.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the rest mass using the exact isotope mass. Let me think: the actual mass of a Li-6 nucleus is a bit less than 6 * 938 MeV because of the binding energy.

Wait, but I think in this problem, we're to assume that the nucleus is treated as a particle with mass A * m_p, where m_p is the proton mass, or perhaps m_n, the neutron mass. But wait, protons and neutrons have slightly different masses, but perhaps for this problem, we can use an average. Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is taken as approximately the sum of the individual nucleons.

Wait, but perhaps I should get the exact value. Let me look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, but I don't have access to that right now. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed with m =6 * m_n, where m_n is the neutron mass. Because the nucleus is made of protons and neutrons, but perhaps it's treated as 6 neutrons. Wait, no, the nucleus is Li-6, which is 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Wait, but the exact mass might not be necessary because the problem gives the options, and perhaps the calculation with rest mass as 6 * 938 MeV gives 20.1 GeV, but the options have 20.132 GeV as option C. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the rest mass energy.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is 6 * 938.272 MeV? Because the proton is about 938.272 MeV/c². Let me double-check the exact mass of a proton and neutron.

Wait, I think the proton mass is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², and the neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So perhaps the average is around 938.9 MeV per nucleon.

But for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass would be 3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) = let's compute that.

3*938.272 = 2814.816 MeV

3*939.565=2818.695 MeV

Total = 2814.816 +2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV, which is about 5.6335 GeV.

So earlier I assumed 5.628 GeV, which is close but not exact.

So with m c² =5.6335 GeV.

Now, gamma is 25/7, which is approximately 3.57142857.

So E= gamma * m c² = (25/7) *5.6335 GeV.

Let me compute 5.6335 *25 = 140.8375.

Then divide by 7: 140.8375 /7≈20.1196 GeV.

So approximately 20.12 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. That's very close.

Wait, let me compute more precisely.

5.6335 *25 = 140.8375.

140.8375 /7 =20.119642857 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1196 GeV, which rounds to about 20.12 GeV. But the option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, perhaps I should check my calculations again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more precise value for gamma. Wait, but gamma is exactly 25/7 based on beta=0.96, so that's precise. So the calculation is exact as per the given beta.

Wait, but maybe the rest mass is calculated differently. Let me think: perhaps the problem uses the mass of the lithium nucleus as just 6 * m_p, where m_p is the proton mass. Let's recalculate with m_p =938.272 MeV/c².

So 6 *938.272 =5629.632 MeV =5.629632 GeV.

Then E = (25/7) *5.629632.

Let me compute that: 5.629632 *25=140.7408.

140.7408 /7 =20.10582857 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.106 GeV.

But the options have option C as 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the nucleus is moving, so the relativistic mass is gamma * m, and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1)*m c², but the question asks for the energy which could be the kinetic energy. Let me see what that gives.

If the energy is the kinetic energy, then E_kinetic = (gamma -1)*m c².

So with m c²=5.629632 GeV, gamma=25/7.

Gamma -1 = (25/7 -1)=18/7 ≈2.5714.

So E_kinetic = (18/7)*5.629632 GeV.

Compute 5.629632 *18 = about 101.333376.

Divide by 7: 101.333376 /7 ≈14.47619657 GeV.

Looking at the options, that's around 14.476 GeV, which isn't among the options. So perhaps the question is referring to the total energy, not kinetic.

Hmm, but according to the earlier calculations, the total energy would be around 20.1 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132), but not exactly matching.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the masses.

Wait, let me check the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus. I think the actual mass is about 5.63975 GeV/c².

Wait, I'm recalling that the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 5.63975 GeV/c².

Let me try that. So m c² =5.63975 GeV.

Then E =gamma * m c² = (25/7) *5.63975.

Compute 5.63975 *25 =140.99375.

Divide by7: 140.99375 /7 ≈20.141964 GeV.

Ah, that's approximately 20.142 GeV, which is very close to option B)23.069 GeV? No, wait, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit lower.

Wait, but I got 20.142 GeV, and the closest option is C)20.132 GeV. Hmm, perhaps the actual calculation with precise mass would give a slightly lower value.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for gamma.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem considers the energy per nucleon. No, wait, the nucleus is a single ion, so it's the entire nucleus moving, not individual nucleons.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the exact gamma value and rest mass.

Wait, if I use m c² as 5.63975 GeV, gamma as 25/7, then E=20.142 GeV. But that's not one of the options exactly. The options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Hmm. So 20.142 GeV would be closest to option C, which is 20.132. The slight difference might be due to rounding in the rest mass value.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass is calculated using the exact atomic mass. Let me think, the mass of a Li-6 atom is about 6.94094 atomic mass units (u). But wait, one atomic mass unit is about 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.94094 u is 6.94094 *931.5 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the atomic mass includes electrons as well. But since we're dealing with a nucleus, perhaps we should subtract the electrons' mass. Let me compute.

Wait, the mass of a Li-6 atom is approximately 6.94094 u. The number of electrons in neutral Li is 3 (since Li has atomic number 3), so each electron has a mass of about 0.00054858 u. So the nucleus mass would be 6.94094 u minus 3 *0.00054858 u.

So 3 *0.00054858 =0.00164574 u.

So nucleus mass is 6.94094 -0.00164574 =6.93929426 u.

Then, convert to MeV/c²:

6.93929426 u *931.5 MeV/u = ?

Let me compute that.

6.93929426 *931.5 = ?

6 *931.5 =5589

0.93929426 *931.5 ≈ let's compute that.

0.93929426 *900 =845.364834

0.93929426 *31.5 ≈29.569192

Total ≈845.364834 +29.569192 =874.934026.

So total: 5589 +874.934026 =6463.934026 MeV, which is 6.463934 GeV.

Wait, that's about 6.464 GeV. But earlier I thought the nucleus mass was about 5.6 GeV. Hmm, that's a big difference. So perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, no, wait. Because the mass of the nucleus is not the same as the mass of the atom. I think I messed up the approach. Because the number of nucleons is 6, but the actual mass is less than 6 * m_p or 6 * m_n.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look up the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Upon a quick check, the actual mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately 5.63975 GeV/c².

So, using m c²=5.63975 GeV.

Then, E = gamma * m c² = (25/7) *5.63975.

25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

5.63975 *3.57142857.

Let me compute this more accurately.

5 *3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.63975 *3.57142857.

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857 =2.14285714.

0.03975 *3.57142857≈0.14142857.

So 2.14285714 +0.14142857≈2.28428571.

Adding to 17.85714285 gives 20.14142856 GeV.

Ah, so E≈20.1414 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV, but it's a bit lower. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass.

Wait, let me compute 5.63975 * (25/7) exactly.

5.63975 *25 = 140.99375.

140.99375 /7 =20.1419642857 GeV.

So that's approximately 20.14196 GeV.

But the options don't have this. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV, which is about 0.009 GeV less. Hmm. Maybe the problem expects us to use a different approach, perhaps using the relativistic energy-momentum relation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. Wait, if the question asks for the energy of the collider, which typically refers to the kinetic energy. So let's compute (gamma-1) * m c².

Gamma is 25/7, so gamma-1= (25-7)/7=18/7=2.57142857.

m c² is 5.63975 GeV, so kinetic energy is 2.57142857 *5.63975.

Compute that: 2.57142857 *5.63975.

Hmm, 2 *5.63975=11.2795.

0.57142857 *5.63975 ≈3.21938.

So total about 11.2795 +3.21938=14.4989 GeV.

But this would be the kinetic energy, which is about 14.5 GeV, which isn't among the options either.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the total energy (including rest mass) of the nucleus, which would be around 20.14 GeV, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but looking at the options, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, maybe I should reevaluate the initial approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the total energy in terms of the rest mass being the sum of the individual nucleons, each with 938 MeV. So 6 nucleons: 6*938=5628 MeV=5.628 GeV.

Then E=25/7 *5.628 GeV=20.1 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the rest mass is not exactly 6 *938 MeV, but higher due to binding energy, but no—actually, binding energy reduces the mass, so the rest mass is lower than sum of individual nucleons. So perhaps the correct approach is to use 5.628 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute E accurately without any approximations.

Compute 5.628 *25/7.

25/7=3.57142857...

5.628 *3.57142857.

Let me compute this precisely:

5.628 *3 =16.884.

5.628 *0.57142857 ≈3.2142857 *0.57142857. Wait, no, 5.628 multiplied by 0.57142857.

Hmm, 5 *0.57142857=2.85714285.

0.628 *0.57142857≈0.3595238.

So total about 2.85714285 +0.3595238=3.21666665.

So 16.884 +3.21666665=20.10066665 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1007 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. So perhaps there's a miscalculation in the rest mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the kinetic energy, but I earlier calculated that as approximately 14.5 GeV, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use relativistic energy with beta=0.96 and calculate gamma correctly, then multiply by the rest mass energy.

Wait, perhaps the error is that the rest mass of the nucleus is 6 * m_p. Wait, no, because Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so perhaps it's better to compute the average mass of a nucleon as (m_p + m_n)/2.

m_p is approximately 938.272 MeV, m_n is approximately 939.565 MeV.

Average is (938.272 +939.565)/2= (1877.837)/2=938.9185 MeV per nucleon.

So for 6 nucleons, m c²=6 *938.9185 =5633.511 MeV =5.6335 GeV.

Then E=gamma * m c²= (25/7)*5.6335.

25/7 is about 3.5714.

5.6335 *3.5714= ?

5 *3.5714=17.857.

0.6335 *3.5714= ?

0.6 *3.5714=2.1428.

0.0335 *3.5714≈0.1195.

So 2.1428 +0.1195=2.2623.

Total E=17.857 +2.2623=20.1193 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.119 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, very close. Perhaps the exact calculation would give 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Compute (25/7) *5.6335 GeV.

25/7 =3.5714285714.

5.6335 *3.5714285714.

Let me compute this using decimal multiplication.

5.6335 ×3.5714285714.

Break it down:

5 ×3.5714285714 =17.857142857.

0.6335 ×3.5714285714.

Compute 0.6 ×3.5714285714=2.14285714284.

0.0335 ×3.5714285714.

0.03 ×3.5714285714=0.107142857142.

0.0035 ×3.5714285714=0.0125000000009.

Total for 0.0335: approx 0.107142857142 +0.0125=0.119642857142.

So 2.14285714284 +0.119642857142=2.26250000000.

So total E=17.857142857 +2.2625=20.119642857 GeV.

So approximately 20.1196 GeV.

But option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a little higher. Hmm. Perhaps the problem expects using a slightly different value for the rest mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the nucleus is treated as a single particle with charge +3e, but I don't think that affects the mass.

Wait, maybe the problem uses the rest mass as 6 * m_p, which would be 6 *938.272 MeV=5629.632 MeV=5.629632 GeV.

Then E=25/7 *5.629632.

Which is 5.629632 *3.5714285714.

Compute that:

5 *3.5714285714=17.857142857.

0.629632 *3.5714285714.

0.6 *3.5714285714=2.1428571428.

0.029632 *3.5714285714≈0.1056.

So total for 0.629632: 2.1428571428 +0.1056≈2.2484571428.

So E=17.857142857 +2.2484571428=20.1056 GeV.

Still, about 20.1056 GeV, which is very close to option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects using the relativistic energy formula with the correct gamma and precise rest mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the exact value of gamma and precise rest mass.

Wait, using the exact values:

gamma=25/7=3.5714285714.

Rest mass m=5.63975 GeV.

Then E=3.5714285714 *5.63975.

Let me compute that precisely.

5.63975 ×3.5714285714.

Compute 5 ×3.5714285714=17.857142857.

0.63975 ×3.5714285714.

0.6 ×3.5714285714=2.1428571428.

0.03975 ×3.5714285714=0.14142857142.

So 2.1428571428 +0.14142857142=2.2842857142.

Total E=17.857142857 +2.2842857142=20.141428571 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1414 GeV.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again: what if the speed is 0.96c, so beta is 0.96. Then gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Rest mass energy for Li-6 is approximately 5.63975 GeV.

So E=gamma * m c²=3.5714285714 *5.63975=20.1414 GeV.

Since none of the options match exactly, but option C is 20.132 GeV, which is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps a slight calculation error or rounding during the problem setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as using momentum and relativistic energy.

Wait, another approach: Relativistic energy is given by E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

But without knowing p, the momentum, perhaps this won't help. Unless we can express p in terms of beta and gamma.

Alternatively, E = gamma m c², which is what I have done.

Hmm. I think the correct calculation leads to approximately 20.14 GeV, which isn't exactly an option. But the closest option given is C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should round to four decimal places. Let me compute 20.1414 GeV to four decimal places: 20.1414 →20.1414 GeV.

Looking back at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Hmm, none match exactly. Did I make a mistake in the initial assumption about the rest mass? Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the average mass of a nucleon as 938.5 MeV. So 6 *938.5=5631 MeV=5.631 GeV.

Then, E=25/7 *5.631 GeV.

25/7=
