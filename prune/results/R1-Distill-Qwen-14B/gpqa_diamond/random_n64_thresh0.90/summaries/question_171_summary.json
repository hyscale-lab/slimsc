Activating groups (EDGs) are ortho/para directors, while deactivating groups (EWGs) are meta directors. The para fraction depends on the substituent's directing effect and steric hindrance.\n\n### Substituent Analysis:\n1. **C6H5-CH3 (Methyl)**: EDG, ortho/para director. High para fraction.\n2. **C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 (Ester)**: EWG, meta director. Low para fraction.\n3. **C6H5-Cl (Chlorine)**: EWG, ortho/para director. Moderate para fraction.\n4. **C6H5-NO2 (Nitro group)**: Strong EWG, meta director. Very low para fraction.\n5. **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethyl)**: EDG, ortho/para director. Highest para fraction.\n6. **C6H5-COOH (Carboxylic acid)**: Strong EWG, meta director. Low para fraction.\n\n### Order of Increasing Para Fraction:\n- **4 (NO2)**: Very low.\n- **2 (COOEt)**: Low.\n- **6 (COOH)**: Low.\n- **3 (Cl)**: Moderate.\n- **1 (CH3)**: High.\n- **5 (C2H5)**: Highest.\n\nThus, the correct order is **4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**.\n\nANSWER: A"
