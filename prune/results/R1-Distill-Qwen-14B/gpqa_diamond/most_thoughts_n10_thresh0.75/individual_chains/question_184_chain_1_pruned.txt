Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I'll try to visualize the target molecule. So, the benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Their positions are 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Wait, no— wait, the numbering is a bit tricky. Let me think: 2-(tert-butyl) means the substituent is at position 2. Then 1-ethoxy—so substituent at position 1. And 3-nitro, substituent at position 3? Or perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Wait, no. Oh wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent. Wait, but the positions are 1, 2, 3 in a row? Because 1, 2, 3 are meta when looking in a certain way. Wait, no, positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent in a row. No, wait, position 1 is next to 2, which is next to 3. So the substituents are at positions 1,2,3 in a row. So the substituents are adjacent to each other in a meta fashion? Hmm, perhaps I should sketch this.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3.
