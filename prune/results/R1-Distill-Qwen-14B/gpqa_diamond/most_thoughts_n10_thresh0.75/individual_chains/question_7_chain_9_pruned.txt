Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking. It's about when the lifetime of gamma-rays is limited by this process, which I think is called photon-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs.

The process is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. The CMB photons have an average energy of 10^-3 eV. So, the question is asking at what gamma-ray energy does their lifetime get limited by this annihilation process. The options are all in the GeV range, which is really high energy.

I remember that for high-energy photons (like gamma-rays) moving through space, they can interact with the CMB photons. The probability of this interaction depends on the energy of the gamma-ray. If the gamma-ray is too high energy, the interaction rate becomes significant, limiting how far it can travel—thus limiting its lifetime in the universe.

I think the key here is the cross-section for this process. The cross-section (σ) for photon-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs increases with the energy of the photons. The formula for the cross-section probably involves the square of the logarithm of the energy ratio or something similar.

Wait, the cross-section σ is proportional to (ln(E/E_cmb))^2 or something like that. Oh right, the cross-section for pair production via CMB photons goes as σ ~ (ln(E/(m_e c²)))^2, where E is the gamma-ray energy and m_e is the electron mass. But wait, the CMB photons have an average energy of 10^-3 eV, which is much less than the electron mass (about 0.5 MeV). So the threshold for this reaction is important.

The threshold energy for pair production is when the combined energy of the two photons is just enough to create an electron and positron. Each photon must have enough energy, but since the CMB photons are low energy, the gamma-ray needs to be high enough. The condition for the reaction is that the center-of-mass energy should be at least 2 m_e c² (since we're creating an electron and a positron).

Wait, but since the CMB photon is at low energy, maybe the threshold is when the gamma-ray energy E is such that E × E_cmb > (m_e c²)^2. Because for
