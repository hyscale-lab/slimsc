Okay, I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Let me start by understanding the given information.

First, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitude brighter than 17, which means V_mag < 17. HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitude brighter than 16, so V_mag < 16. So a star must have V_mag less than 16 to be detected by both, right? Because if a star's V is, say, 16.5, HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can. Wait, wait. No, wait. The question says, "brighter than 17" for ESPRESSO, meaning V < 17. Brighter means lower magnitude, so higher numbers are fainter. So for ESPRESSO, star must have V < 17. For HIRES, V < 16. So for a star to be detected by both, it needs to have V < 16, because if it's between 16 and 17, it can be seen by ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If a star is observed with apparent magnitude m. The "brighter than 17" means m <17, because lower magnitudes are brighter. So for both instruments, the star must have m <16 because HIRES is more sensitive, requiring m <16. So any star with m <16 is observable by both. But wait, noâ€”HIRES requires m <16, so if a star is m=16.5, it's not detectable by HIRES, but can be by ESPRESSO. But for both, the star must satisfy both. So the star must have m <16. Oh, wait, but some stars' apparent magnitudes might be affected by extinction, like interstellar dust which makes them appear dimmer. So I need to calculate the apparent magnitude including extinction for stars that have E(B-V) given.

Let me look at each star:

Star1:
- Absolute V mag: 15.5
- Distance: 10 pc
- So apparent mag is calculated as m = M + 5 log10(d/10). So d=10, log(d/10)=0. So m =15.5 + 0 =15.5. No extinction info, so m=15.5. This is <16, so HIRES can see it. Also <17, so ESPRESSO can. So Star1 is detectable by both.

Star2:
- Apparent V mag: 16.5. So without considering extinction, it's 16.5. But HIRES can't detect it because it's brighter than 16. Wait, no, HIRES requires brighter than 16, so m <16. So 16.5 is too faint for HIRES. But ESPRESSO can see it (since 16.5 <17). So Star2 can only be seen by ESP
