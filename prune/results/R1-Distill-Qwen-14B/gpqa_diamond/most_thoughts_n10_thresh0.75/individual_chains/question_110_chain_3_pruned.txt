Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs, ESPRESSO and HIRES. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I need to understand the question. The question asks which stars can be detected with both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. The key is to figure out for each star whether it's bright enough to be seen by both instruments.

I remember that the brightness of a star as seen from Earth is its apparent magnitude. Both spectrographs have different limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V mag 17, and HIRES can go down to brighter than V mag 16. So, the star must have an apparent magnitude (m_v) less than or equal to 16 in V band because HIRES can't see beyond that. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. Brighter in stars means lower magnitude numbers because lower magnitude is brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17, that's m_v <17. Similarly, for HIRES, stars brighter than 16, which is m_v <16.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. Apparent magnitude scales: lower numbers mean brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that's m_v <17. So for a star to be observable by ESPRESSO, its apparent V magnitude must be less than 17. For HIRES, the star must have m_v <16.

So any star that can be detected with both must have m_v (apparent) less than 16, because HIRES can't go beyond 16. Because 16 is brighter than 17. So the star's apparent magnitude must be less than 16.

Wait, because HIRES is more sensitive; it can observe fainter stars (lower apparent magnitude) than ESPRESSO. So a star that can be seen by both must be bright enough to be seen by HIRES, which has a lower limit (brighter) of 16 mag. Because if a star is fainter than 16, HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can because its limit is 17.

Wait, no
