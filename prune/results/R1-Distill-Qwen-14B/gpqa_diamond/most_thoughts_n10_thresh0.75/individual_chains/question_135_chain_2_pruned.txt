Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson X. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by the Lagrangian term: 

L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, the Lagrangian tells us about the interactions. So this term looks like a Yukawa interaction, which is a type of interaction between a scalar boson and fermions. The Yukawa coupling is λ, and υ is probably the vacuum expectation value, which gives mass to the fermions.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. We need to find the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. 

Wait, what do I know about decay processes? For a boson to decay into two fermions, say f and f̄, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion, because energy and momentum conservation require that. So m_X ≥ 2m_f.

So first, I need to figure out the possible fermions that X can decay into. The options given include various quarks and leptons.

Let me list the fermion masses. I think I remember approximate masses:

- Top quark (t): around 173 GeV. But wait, X is only 6 GeV, so way too heavy. So top is out.
- Bottom quark (b): about 4.5 GeV.
- Charm quark (c): around 1.25 GeV.
- Strange quark (s): ~95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
- Up quark (u) and down quark (d): both are light, like ~2 MeV each.
- Muon (μ): ~0.1 GeV.
- Tau (τ): around 1.78 GeV.
- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV (so negligible, but still needs to be considered because their mass is so tiny).

Wait, but when looking at the decay X → f f̄, the sum of the fermion masses must be less than or equal to m_X/2. Because each fermion gets some energy, but the minimum would be when they are at rest relative to each other, so 2m_f ≤ m_X.

Wait, but in reality, particles can't be at exactly rest because of momentum conservation, but for the decay to be possible, the fermion mass must be less than half the boson mass. Because in the center-of-mass frame, the two fermions must each have at least their rest mass energy.

So m_f ≤ m_X / 2.

Given m_X is 6 GeV, so m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

Looking at the fermions:

- b quark: ~4.5 GeV. 4.5 > 3 → can't decay into b b̄.
- c quark: ~1.25 GeV → 1.25 ≤ 3 → allowed.
- s: ~0.09
