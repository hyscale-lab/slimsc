Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember sigmatropic reactions involve the shift of a pi bond within a molecule, moving along a conjugated system. The question gives three reactions, and I need to figure out the products A, B, and C based on the options provided.

Let me look at each reaction one by one.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and heat gives product A. Wait, so the starting materials are two molecules reacting. I'm a bit confused. Oh, maybe it's a condensation reaction? Or perhaps a rearrangement. Since the question mentions sigmatropic rearrangements, like Cope and Claisen, which are [3,3] sigmatropic shifts. But wait, the first reaction might not be a rearrangement but a different kind of reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen-like condensation.

Wait, but the Claisen rearrangement involves an allyl vinyl ether rearranging into a gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the amine and alcohol are reacting with each other. Wait, the starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol. Oh, so the amine has two methoxy groups on the nitrogen. When heated, perhaps they undergo some kind of condensation.

Wait, when an amine reacts with an alcohol, under acidic conditions, perhaps it forms an imine or some kind of enamine. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution or a different rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps the 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is a good leaving group scenario. Let me think. The structure would be: CH3O-N(CH3)2-CH2-? No, wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (CH3O)2N-CH2CH2-OCH3? Wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would mean two methoxy groups on the ethylamine. Wait, maybe it's (CH3O)2N
