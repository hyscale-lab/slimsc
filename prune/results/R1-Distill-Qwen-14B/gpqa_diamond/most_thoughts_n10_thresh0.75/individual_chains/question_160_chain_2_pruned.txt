Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm. The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and we're looking for the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field. Oh right, and N is infinitely large, so it's almost like a circular aperture?

Wait, wait. When N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle. Because as the number of sides increases, the polygon approaches a circle. So maybe this problem is similar to the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

In the far field region, the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is given by the Bessel function. The minima occur where the Bessel function J₁ reaches zero. But wait, the first minima for a circular aperture is at θ ≈ 1.22λ/(a), right? But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, no, when N is infinite, it's a circle, so the first minima is at 1.22 λ/(diameter?), but wait, in this problem, the apothems are all length 'a'. Hmm.

Wait, the apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem is a. When N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem becomes the radius of the circle. Oh wait, because the apothem of a regular polygon is the same as the radius of the inscribed circle. So yes, for our case, the radius r of the circular aperture is 'a'.

Wait, but wait. The formula for the minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is given by the zeros of the Bessel function J₁. The first minimum occurs at J₁(k a sinθ) = 0, where k is 2π/λ. Wait, the first minimum of J₁ is at θ ≈ 1.22λ/(a). So the angular position of the first minimum is θ ≈ 1.22λ/(a). But the question is about the distance between the first two minima. Wait, wait, no.
