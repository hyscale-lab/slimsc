Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, the problem says there's a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, stochiometric means 1:1 ratio, right? So each Ca-EDTA complex has one Ca²+ ion attached.

The question is about finding the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²+], in the solution. They gave me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. Oh wait, I remember formation constants (Kf) are for the reaction where the metal ion and ligand combine to form the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the EDTA is usually in a different form. At a certain pH, it exists as Y^4-. Right, so the formation reaction is Ca²+ + Y^4- → CaY²−, and the formation constant Kf is [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]). But wait, in this problem, the complex is present at 0.02 M, which I think is the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex. So [CaY²−] is 0.02 M.

But wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So that's the concentration of CaY²
