Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes undergoing a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement. Right, but wait, the molecule given isn't just a simple 1,5-diene. Let me think about the structure.

The compound is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is like a norbornane structure, right? So it's a bicyclic compound with two rings. The substituents are at positions 1 and 4, and there's a vinyl group on the 2nd carbon. Oh wait, and it's a bicyclo structure with a double bond at position 5.

So, the molecule has a bridge structure. Let me try to visualize it. The 2-vinyl means there's a CH2-CH2 group attached to carbon 2. The azabicyclo suggests that one of the bridgehead carbons is a nitrogen. Wait, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane would have a seven-membered ring, but it's bridged. So, the structure has two bridge rings, one of two carbons, another two, and the last one. So the nitrogen is at position 2, maybe?

Wait, the substituents: 2-vinyl, so the structure might be something like the nitrogen is
