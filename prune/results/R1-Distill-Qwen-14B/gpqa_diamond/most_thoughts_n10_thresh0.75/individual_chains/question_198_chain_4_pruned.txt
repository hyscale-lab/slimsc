Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says there's a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. They give me the stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The options are A to D.

Wait, stability constants. I remember that the stability constant (β) tells us how stable a complex is. A higher β means the complex is more stable because it forms more readily. So, the complex with the highest β is the most predominant one.

But wait, the question is about the dithiocyanato complexes, which I think are the ones with two SCN- ligands. So the possible complexes are Co(SCN)n^2- where n is 1, 2, 3, or 4. The problem gives β1 to β4, each corresponding to n=1 to n=4, right?

Wait, no. Stability constants are for each step, so β1 is for the first ligand binding, β2 is for the second, etc. Or wait, sometimes, they give the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands. I think I need to confirm that. Oh right, the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands is the product of β1, β2, ..., βn. Or wait, no, maybe each β is the constant for adding each subsequent ligand. So β1 is for Co(SCN)²+ ⇌ Co(SCN)²+ + SCN^- (not making much sense; perhaps each β is for the nth step). Wait, I think the overall β for the complex with n ligands is the product β1 * β2 * ... * βn. Because each step adds another ligand.

Let me think. For a metal ion M, the first complex is M(L) with stability constant β1. The next is M(L)₂ with β₂ for the second ligand, so the overall constant for M(L)₂ is β1 * β2
