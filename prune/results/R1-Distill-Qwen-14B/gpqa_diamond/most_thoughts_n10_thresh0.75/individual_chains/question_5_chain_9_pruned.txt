Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding an eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.

The problem says the operator is called P, and it's for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. I'm supposed to find the normalized eigenvector's elements.

The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. Let me write down each component.

Px matrix:
First row: 0, 1
Second row: 1, 0
So, matrix form:
[[0, 1],
 [1, 0]]

Py matrix:
First row: 0, -i
Second row: i, 0
So,
[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

Pz matrix:
First row: 1, 0
Second row: 0, -1
So,
[[1, 0],
 [0, -1]]

So, each component is multiplied by ħ/2. But wait, in quantum mechanics, these operators are for spin-1/2 particles, right? So, P is the spin operator in some direction, probably.

Wait, the operator given is P, but in standard terms, the spin operator is usually denoted by S. Oh well, the question says P, so I'll go with that.

So, the operator for an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. That means the direction is (x and z components only, y is zero). So, the direction vector n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Wait, or maybe θ is from the x-axis? Wait, in the x-z plane, the angle is usually measured from the z-axis. So, the direction vector would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but sometimes it's the other way around. Let me think: if θ is the angle from the z-axis, then the direction cosines would be (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since the direction is in x-z, φ is 0 or π, so the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or (-sinθ, 0, cosθ), depending on θ's definition. Alternatively, some might define θ from the x-axis, in which case the direction would be (cosθ, 0, sinθ). Hmm, this might be important because the form of the eigenvector will depend on this.

But wait, the problem says "an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane". So, the general form of the spin operator in direction n is P = (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z). Since n is in x-z, n_y is zero. So, P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but what are n_x and n_z? Let me think. Since direction n is in x-z plane, it can be expressed as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), assuming θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So, n_x =
