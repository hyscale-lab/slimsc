Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the problem again carefully.

The question is about a reaction scheme involving several compounds. The compounds go from A to B to C to D and finally to E. My goal is to find out what compound E is, given the options provided.

The reaction steps are as follows:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is then reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (which is nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints given are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and compound E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

The options for E are four different ketones (since the IR peaks are in the range of carbonyl groups).

First, I'll try to deduce the structure of compound A based on the clues.

Let me start with the first hint, hint a). So, when A reacts with a phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. 

Phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes by reacting with ylides. So, if A reacts with a ylide to form an alkene, A must have been an aldehyde or ketone.

The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw that structure. It's a cyclopentane ring. At positions 1 and 2, there are methyl groups. At position 4, there's a substituent which is a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=, so as an ylide, it's CH2-C(CH3)- with a positive charge on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, no. The structure of propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(=CH2)-, but wait, no. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be the ylide part. Let me think: when the Wittig reagent is formed from propan-2-ol, it would have the structure P=CH-C(CH3)2? Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The substituent is propan-2-ylidene, which is a group attached via a double bond. So the structure is a cyclopentane ring with substituents at positions 1 and 2 as methyl groups, and at position 4, a substituent that is a propenyl group, but the substituent is =CH-C(CH3)2? Hmm, perhaps I should look at the structure again.

Alternatively, the propan-2-ylidene group is CH2-C(CH3)=, so the cyclopentane has a double bond from position 4 to another carbon. Maybe the substituent is a cyclopropenyl group. Wait, no, perhaps the substituent is a propenylidene group attached to the cyclopentane.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclopentane ring where at position 4, there's a substituent that is a double bond between C2 and C3 of a propane chain. So, the substituent is like CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, propan-2-ylidene would be (CH3)2C=CH- as a ylide, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopentane with substituents at 1 and 2 as methyl groups, and at position 4, a substituent that is a propenyl group attached in a way that forms a double bond. Maybe the substituent is a CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 group?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the Wittig reaction. The Wittig reagent (ylide) will attack the carbonyl group of compound A, forming an alkene. So, if the product is that cyclopentane with a certain substituent, compound A must have been a ketone or aldehyde attached to a cyclopentane.

Wait a minute, so the product has a cyclopentane ring with substituents. Let me imagine that the product comes from the cyclopentane ring in compound A. For example, if A is a cyclopentanone (a ketone on a cyclopentane), then the Wittig reaction would replace the ketone group with
