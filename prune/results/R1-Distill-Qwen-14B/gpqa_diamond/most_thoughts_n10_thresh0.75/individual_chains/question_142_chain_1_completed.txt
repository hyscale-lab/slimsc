Okay, so I have this question about quantum states and density matrices. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is a 2x2 matrix. The expression given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (a statistical mixture of pure states) rather than pure.

Hmm, I think the first thing I should do is write out what this matrix looks like. Remember that |0⟩ is a column vector [1; 0] and |1⟩ is [0; 1]. So |0⟩⟨0| would be a matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 in the (2,2) position.

So when I add |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|, I get the matrix:
[1 0;
0 1]
Which is the identity matrix. Then ρ is half of that, so:
ρ = (1/2) * I = [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]

Wait, but density matrices are supposed to have trace 1. Let me check: the trace is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1. Yep, that's correct.

Now the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I remember that for a single qubit, the state can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. For a pure state |ψ⟩, it's a vector on the unit sphere, but a mixed state like a density matrix would be a point inside the Bloch sphere.

The general form of a density matrix for a single qubit can be written as:
ρ = (I + r·σ)/2
Where r is a vector (the Bloch vector) and σ represents the Pauli matrices.

So expanding this, I = [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]
The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]
So r·σ would be r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz.

Putting it all together, ρ = (I + (r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz )) / 2.

Let's compute that. Let's express the matrix:

I/2 is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]
Then (r_x σx)/2 is [[0, r_x/2], [r_x/2, 0]]
Similarly, (r_y σy)/2 is [[0, -i r_y/2], [i r_y/2, 0]]
And (r_z σz)/2 is [[r_z/2, 0], [0, -r_z/2]]

Adding all these together:

The (1,1) element is 0.5 + r_z/2
The (1,2) element is (r_x - i r_y)/2
The (2,1) element is (r_x + i r_y)/2
The (2,2) element is 0.5 - r_z/2

Now, comparing this to our given ρ matrix, which is:
[0.5 0
0 0.5]

So let's match the elements.

Looking at (1,2) and (2,1) elements: in ρ, they are 0. So:

(r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0 → r_x = 0 and r_y = 0.

Now looking at (1,1) and (2,2):

(0.5 + r_z/2) = 0.5 → r_z/2 = 0 → r_z = 0.

Wait, that's interesting. So all components of r are zero. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That would correspond to the completely mixed state, which makes sense because ρ is (I/2), which is the maximally mixed state for a single qubit.

So the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. So looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which should be the correct answer.

Let me just think again. The given density matrix is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. It's an equal mixture of the |0> and |1> states. So yes, the Bloch vector is zero because it's equally likely to be found in either state, pointing no direction on the sphere. That must mean r is (0,0,0).


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & 0 \\ 0 & 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Density matrices for single qubits can generally be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix, \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli matrices, and \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is the Bloch vector. Expanding this, the general form of \( \rho \) becomes:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 + r_z & r_x - i r_y \\ r_x + i r_y & 1 - r_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the given \( \rho \), we observe:

1. The (1,1) and (2,2) elements match when \( r_z = 0 \).
2. The (1,2) and (2,1) elements are zero, which implies \( r_x = 0 \) and \( r_y = 0 \).

Thus, the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is \( (0, 0, 0) \), meaning the density matrix corresponds to the completely mixed state. Geometrically, this places the state at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) \( r = (0, 0, 0) \).**

Answer: C
