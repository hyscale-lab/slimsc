Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because eigenvectors can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, right. For a spin-1/2 particle, the Pauli matrices are involved. Oh, because the components of the angular momentum operator are often represented using Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

So each component is given as:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

But wait, the operator in question is P along direction n in the x-z plane. Hmm. So the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane. That would mean it's some direction making an angle theta from the z-axis and phi in the x-z plane, so phi would be 0 or pi maybe? Or perhaps phi is fixed because it's in the x-z plane, which is the same as saying phi=0 or something like that. Actually, in the x-z plane, the direction would have phi=0 or pi, but for now, perhaps the problem assumes phi=0? Or maybe I don't need to worry about phi because the problem is about an arbitrary direction, but the eigenvector's form is to be determined.

Wait, I'm supposed to calculate the eigenvector of the operator P along n, which is a vector in the x-z plane. So the operator P is P·n, right? Because the operator along a direction n is the dot product of the vector operator P with the unit vector n.

So P·n would be n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. So n = (n_x, 0, n_z), and n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So P·n would be n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait,
