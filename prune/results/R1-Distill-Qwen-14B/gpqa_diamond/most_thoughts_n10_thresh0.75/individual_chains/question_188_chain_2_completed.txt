Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal and finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the interplanar distance (d) in a crystal is given by the formula derived from Bragg's law, which relates the crystal structure to the diffraction angles. The formula I think is d = (a) / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + terms involving the angles...?) Wait, no, that's for cubic systems maybe. Since this is a rhombohedral crystal, the formula should account for the angles between the lattice parameters.

Rhombohedral systems have all sides equal (a = b = c) but the angles can be different. In this case, all angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. So it's a special case of a rhombohedral system where all angles are the same.

The general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ) )

Wait, but I think in a rhombohedral system, the formula simplifies because a = b = c. Also, the angles are all equal, so cos α = cos β = cos γ. Let me see. So substituting, the formula becomes d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, that makes sense because each pair of terms hk, hl, kl would contribute 2hk cos α, 2hl cos α, etc. So for a rhombohedral with α=β=γ=30 degrees, and a=10 Angstroms, we can plug in hkl=111.

So plugging in h=1, k=1, l=1.

So let me compute the denominator first. The denominator is sqrt( (1² + 1² + 1²) + 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)*cos(30°) )

Wait, let me compute each part step by step.

Compute h² + k² + l²: 1 +1 +1 =3.

Compute the other part: 2*(hk + hl + kl) * cos α.

hk=1*1=1, same for hl and kl. So hk + hl + kl = 1+1+1=3.

Multiply by 2: 2*3=6.

Multiply by cos 30 degrees: cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 ≈5.196.

So adding to the first part: 3 +5.196=8.196.

So the denominator is sqrt(8.196). Let me calculate that.

What's sqrt(8.196)? Hmm, 8.196 is between 8 and 9. Wait, but sqrt(8.196) is about 2.863, because 2.86^2 is 8.1796 (since 2.8^2=7.84, 2.9^2=8.41). Let me check: 2.86^2 = (2.8 + 0.06)^2 = 2.8² + 2*2.8*0.06 + 0.06² =7.84 + 0.336 +0.0036=8.1796. Hmm, but 8.196 is a bit higher. So maybe sqrt(8.196) is approximately 2.863? Let me compute 2.863^2: 2.86*2.86= 8.1796, plus 0.003^2 is negligible, but wait, perhaps I should do it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it with a calculator approach. Let me think: 2.86^2=8.1796, as before. So 8.196 is 0.0164 higher. So let me find the approximate sqrt.

Let me denote x = 8.1796, so sqrt(x) =2.86. Now, the next number is x + 0.0164 =8.196.

The derivative of sqrt(x) at x is (1/(2*sqrt(x))) )= 1/(2*2.86)≈1/5.72≈0.1748 per unit x.

So delta_x=0.0164, so delta_y≈0.1748 * 0.0164 ≈0.00287.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈2.86 + 0.00287≈2.86287. So approximately 2.863.

So denominator is approximately 2.863.

So d = a / denominator = 10 / 2.863 ≈3.492 Angstroms? Wait, wait, that can't be right because the options are all around 9 Angstroms. Oh wait, no, wait wait, that can't be. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait, I think I messed up. Because the interplanar distance is a/(sqrt(...)), but in this case, a is 10 Angstrom, but I calculated that the denominator is 2.863, so 10/2.863 is around 3.49 Angstroms. But the options are like 8.95 or 9.08, which are much larger.

Wait, that can't be right. Hmm, perhaps I messed up the formula in the denominator. Let me double-check the formula.

Wait, wait, the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral structure is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ), correct? Or is it another arrangement?

Wait, no, wait. I think the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, because in a rhombohedral lattice, the angles between the axes are all the same. So perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos α + hk cos α + etc.) )?

Wait, wait, perhaps I should look up the correct formula for a rhombohedral crystal. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( [h^2 + k^2 + l^2] + 2[ hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ ] )

But since in this case, α=β=γ=30 degrees, and a=b=c, so the formula becomes:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2 hk cos α + 2 hl cos α + 2 kl cos α )

Which can be written as:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2 cos α (hk + hl + kl) )

So for (111), h=k=l=1.

So, substituting:

h² +k² + l² =3.

hk + hl + kl =3.

So,

denominator = sqrt(3 + 2 * cos(30) * 3 )

Compute 2*3=6.

cos(30)=√3/2 ≈0.8660.

6 * 0.8660 ≈5.196.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 +5.196=8.196.

So denominator is sqrt(8.196) ≈2.863.

So d =10 / 2.863 ≈3.49 Angstroms. But wait, the options are all around 9 or so. That's way off. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm using the formula wrong. Because rhombohedral has a= b= c, with angles maybe different from 90 degrees. But perhaps the formula is different when it's a rhombohedral system, not a cubic one.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for interplanar distance should involve the unit cell volume or something else.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance formula for a general Bravais lattice is d_{hkl} = (1/√( (h^2 (b² c² sin² α )/(a²) ) + (k^2 (a² c² sin² β )/(b²) ) + (l^2 (a² b² sin² γ )/(c²) ) + ... )) )

Wait, no, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that for a rhombohedral system, the formula can be written using the unit cell volume.

Let me think differently. The unit cell volume V for rhombohedral is a³ * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 α + 2 cos^3 α ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should use the Miller indices (hkl) and the formula involving the reciprocal lattice. The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by (h, k, l) in reciprocal space, and the interplanar distance is 1/sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) scaled by some factor based on the unit cell.

Alternatively, the general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is given by:

1/d_{hkl}^2 = (h^2 / a^2) (1/sin^2 α) + (k^2 / b^2) (1/sin^2 β) + (l^2 / c^2) (1/sin^2 γ) ) + ... some cross terms ... ?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for the formula specific to rhombohedral systems.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula from the book. Wait, I think in the case of a rhombohedral crystal where a = b = c and α = β = γ, the interplanar distance formula simplifies.

I found in some notes that for a rhombohedral system with a = b = c = a0 and angles α, β, γ, the interplanar distance for plane (hkl) is:

d_{hkl} = (a0) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, but that's what I used earlier, which gives about 3.49 Angstroms, which doesn't match the options.

Wait, but the given interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, interatomic distance is not the same as lattice parameter a. Hmm, wait, perhaps I made a mistake about what a is.

Wait, the question says interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So maybe 'a' is not 10. Because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a√1 for (100) planes, but for other structures, it's different. Wait, no, in a cubic structure, the interatomic distance is simply a because each atom is at the corners, and for (100) planes, the distance is a.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance would be the distance between nearest neighbors. For a rhombohedral lattice, the nearest neighbors are not along the main axes but along the diagonals, perhaps. So the interatomic distance 'd' would be a function of the lattice parameter a and the angles.

Wait, perhaps the 'a' in the formula is the lattice parameter, but the interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance, which is different. So I need to determine 'a' given the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom.

Wait, this is getting complicated. So perhaps the question is giving the interatomic distance as 10 Angstrom, which is the nearest neighbor distance. So in a rhombohedral lattice, the nearest neighbor distance is the edge length of the lattice multiplied by sqrt( ... ) depending on the structure.

Wait, for a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell is a rhombohedron. The nearest neighbor distance can be found using the lattice parameter a and the angles between the edges.

In a rhombohedral structure, the distance between nearest neighbors can be found by considering the vectors. The vectors from the origin to the nearest neighbor would be along the edges, but perhaps that isn't correct because in a rhombohedron, the edges are not at 90°, so the nearest neighbor might be along a combination of vectors.

Wait, for a simple cubic structure, nearest neighbor is a, but in a rhombohedral, the nearest neighbor is the edge length multiplied by a factor that depends on the angles. Alternatively, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is a multiplied by sqrt( (1)^2 + (1)^2 + (1)^2 + 2*(1)(1) cos α + 2*(1)(1) cos β + 2*(1)(1) cos γ ) )^(1/2). Wait, no, that would be the distance between (000) and (111) in terms of the lattice parameter, but that's an interplanar distance, not nearest neighbor.

Wait, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance in a rhombohedral lattice is given by a * sqrt( (1)^2 + (1)^2 + (1)^2 + 2 cos α + 2 cos β + 2 cos γ ) )^(1/2) ) divided by some number? Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance in a rhombohedral lattice is given by d = a * sqrt( (1 + 1 + 1) + 2(cos α + cos β + cos γ) ) ) / something.

Wait, maybe in a rhombohedral lattice, the distance between (000) and (100) is a, but that's along one axis. The nearest neighbor could be along a diagonal, like (111). So the distance between (000) and (111) is sqrt( a² + a² + a² + 2a² (cos α + cos β + cos γ) ) )

Wait, let me compute that. The distance squared is:

( a*(1) + a*(1) + a*(1) ) · ( same vector )

Wait, no, the distance between (000) and (111) would be the magnitude of the vector (a, a, a) in the rhombohedral lattice, which has vectors a, b, c with angles between them.

Wait, the position vectors of the rhombohedral lattice are defined as vectors a, b, c, each with magnitude a, and the angles between them as α (between b and c), β (between a and c), gamma (between a and b) ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the angles mixed up. Maybe in the rhombohedral system, each angle is between the axes. So the angle between a and b is gamma, between a and c is beta, and between b and c is alpha.

But regardless, the distance between (000) and (111) would be the magnitude of (a + b + c), which is sqrt( |a|² + |b|² + |c|² + 2 a·b + 2 a·c + 2 b·c )

Since a = b = c = a0, and the angles between any two vectors (say a and b) is gamma, which is 30 degrees.

So the dot product a·b = |a||b| cos gamma = a0² cos 30.

Similarly for a·c and b·c. So each of the cross terms is a0² cos 30.

So the distance squared is:

a0² + a0² + a0² + 2(a0² cos 30) + 2(a0² cos 30) + 2(a0² cos 30) )

That's 3 a0² + 6 a0² cos 30.

So the distance is sqrt( 3 a0² (1 + 2 cos 30) ) = a0 * sqrt(3 (1 + 2*(sqrt(3)/2 )) )

Simplify inside the sqrt:

3 (1 + sqrt(3) ) = 3 + 3 sqrt(3).

So the distance is a0 * sqrt(3 + 3 sqrt(3)) ).

But this is the distance between (000) and (111), which is the interplanar distance for (111), right? Wait, no, wait. The interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes, which for (111) would be the reciprocal of the magnitude of the plane's normal vector in reciprocal space. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing concepts here.

Wait, but the problem states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is 10 Angstrom, which would be the distance between (000) and (111) in this case. Then, this distance is given by the formula I derived above: d = a0 * sqrt(3 + 3 sqrt(3)) )

Wait, let me compute that. Let's calculate sqrt(3 + 3 * 1.732) = sqrt(3 +5.196) = sqrt(8.196)= approximately 2.863. So d = a0 * 2.863 = 10 Angstrom.

So a0 = 10 / 2.863 ≈3.492 Angstroms.

Wait, so if a0 is about 3.492 Angstrom, then in the formula for the interplanar distance, which uses 'a' as a0, I can compute the (111) plane's interplanar distance.

Wait, but wait a minute, earlier when I used a=10, I got d=3.49, which didn't make sense because the options were around 9. But perhaps I've confused the definition here.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance in this context refers to the lattice parameter a being 10 Angstroms. The problem says, "interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom". So perhaps a=10. Because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a, so perhaps in this case, the interatomic distance is a.

So if that's the case, then the lattice parameter a is 10 Angstroms, and the interplanar distance for (111) is d = a / sqrt(3 + 2*3*cos(30 degrees)).

Wait, let me recompute that.

So, d = 10 / sqrt(3 + 6*(√3/2)).

Because 3 + 2*3*cos(30) =3 +6*(0.8660) =3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)≈2.863, so d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

But again, the options are much larger, around 8.95, 9.08, etc. So perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the formula incorrectly. Maybe the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Which for (111) would be 3 + 6 cos(30) =3 + 5.196=8.196, so sqrt is 2.863, d=10/2.863≈3.49. No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( [h² + k² + l²] + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

But since α=β=γ=30 degrees, it would be 3 + 2*(3*(cos 30)) =3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) =3 +5.196=8.196. So same result.

So that gives d=3.49 Angstroms, which is not among the options.

So perhaps I've made a wrong assumption. Maybe the formula is different. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance can be calculated using the relation d = a / (sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )) )

But in a rhombohedral structure, when all angles are 30 degrees, perhaps the formula simplifies further.

Wait, perhaps I should compute for a simple cubic system first and see. In a simple cubic system, angles are 90 degrees, so cos 90=0. So the formula becomes d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² )

So for (111), d= a / sqrt(3). If a=10, d=10/1.732≈5.773 Angstroms.

But that's not one of the options either. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the given interatomic distance is not along the (111) plane but along another direction, and the (111) plane's interplanar distance is related differently.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the Miller indices and the reciprocal lattice. The reciprocal lattice vectors are (h, k, l), and the interplanar distance is 1/|G|, where G is the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector.

The magnitude of G in a rhombohedral system is sqrt( (h/a)^2 + (k/b)^2 + (l/c)^2 + 2 hk cos γ/(ab) + 2 hl cos β/(ac) + 2 kl cos α/(bc) ) )

But since a=b=c, this becomes:

sqrt( (h² +k² +l² )/(a^2) + 2 (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α )/(a^2) )

Which is equal to sqrt( [h² +k² +l² + 2 hk cos γ + 2 hl cos β + 2 kl cos α ] ) / a

So the interplanar distance d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2 hk cos γ + 2 hl cos β + 2 kl cos α )

Which is the same as the formula I used earlier.

So with h=k=l=1, a=10, cos α=cos β=cos γ=cos(30)=sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So:

h² +k² + l² =3.

The cross terms: 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos 30 = 2*3*(0.866) =5.196.

So denominator is sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstroms. Again, same result.

But the options are much larger, 8.95, etc. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of sqrt(3) or something else.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, but the formula in the denominator is for the interplanar distance, so perhaps I'm using the wrong value for 'a'.

Wait, perhaps I have to find 'a' such that the nearest neighbor distance is 10 Angstroms, then use that 'a' to compute the (111) interplanar distance.

Earlier, I thought that the nearest neighbor distance would be the distance between (000) and (111), which is a*sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)) ), which is a*sqrt(8.196)=a*2.863.

If that's 10 Angstroms, then a=10/2.863≈3.492 Angstroms.

So then, using this a=3.492 in the formula for the (111) plane's d:

d = a / sqrt(3 +5.196) = (3.492) / 2.863 ≈1.219 Angstroms.

But that's way too small. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the nearest neighbor distance with the lattice parameter a. Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance given is along the a-axis, which would be a=10. Then the (111) interplanar distance is 3.49, which doesn't match any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system, considering the unit cell volume.

The formula for interplanar distance (d) is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Which we have as 10 / sqrt(8.196) ≈3.49 Angstroms.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the formula is different.

Wait, I found another resource that says the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal can be found using:

d = (a) / √( (h² +k² + l²) (1 - cos α) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, that seems different. Let's compute that.

So for h=k=l=1, a=10, cos α=cos 30=0.8660.

The term (h² +k² +l²)(1 - cos α) =3*(1-0.866) =3*(0.134)=0.402.

The term 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α = 6 *0.866=5.196.

So adding them: 0.402 +5.196=5.598.

So denominator sqrt(5.598)≈2.366.

So d=10/2.366≈4.227 Angstroms.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) (1 - cos α) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α )

But earlier that gave me 4.227, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the correct formula, regardless of what the options are. Let me recalculate.

Wait, another approach: the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal.

The general formula is:

1/d² = (h²/a²) sin^2 α + (k²/b²) sin^2 β + (l²/c²) sin^2 γ + ... cross terms ...

But for a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, so:

1/d² = (h² +k² + l²)/a² [sin^2 α] + 2 (hk cos α sin² α + ... ) ?

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²) (sin^2 α) / a² + 2 (hk (sin^2 α)(cos α) ) / a² + ... ?

I think I'm getting lost here. Let me try to find another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the interplanar distance, which is the magnitude of the plane's normal vector in reciprocal space.

In a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

h* = h + k cos γ/(a sin γ) + l cos β/(a sin γ)

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the reciprocal lattice vectors are more complex, but perhaps in a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal vectors can be expressed in terms of the original vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate using the metric tensor. The metric tensor g for a rhombohedral system is a 3x3 matrix given by:

g = [
 [a², a² cos γ, a² cos β],
 [a² cos γ, a², a² cos α],
 [a² cos β, a² cos α, a²]
]

Then, the interplanar distance formula is:

d² = a² (h² +k² + l²) + 2 a² (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) )

Wait, no, that's the same as before.

So solving for d gives:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) )

Which, for h=k=l=1 and γ=β=α=30 degrees, becomes:

d = a / sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) )

Which is a / sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

So if a=10 Angstroms,

d=10 / sqrt(3 + 3*1.732) =10 / sqrt(3 +5.196) =10/sqrt(8.196)≈10/2.863≈3.49 Angstroms.

This is the same result as before, which doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps the initial assumption that a=10 is wrong.

Wait, the problem states the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So what's the interatomic distance in a rhombohedral lattice? It's the distance between nearest atoms, which depends on the number of atoms per unit cell and their positions.

In a primitive rhombohedral unit cell, there's one atom per cell, located at the corners and perhaps the center. Wait, no, a primitive rhombohedral cell has one atom at each corner, but considering the number of corners, it's more likely to have a basis at the corners and the center.

Wait, perhaps in a simple rhombohedral structure (like a basis of two atoms), the nearest neighbor distance could be along the diagonal. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is along the (100) direction, which would be a, so a=10. Then, the (111) interplanar distance would be about 3.49, which again doesn't match the options. So I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the reciprocal space differently. Let me think: the interplanar distance is 1/|h^2 +k^2 + l^2 + ... | ?

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Which for (111), a=10, α=30 degrees, gives 10/sqrt(3 +6*(0.866))=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.49, which again doesn't match the options.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B is 8.95 Angstrom, which is roughly twice 4.47, which is sqrt(20), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of sqrt(3) somewhere.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the formula I'm using is correct, but the interatomic distance is the edge length a, not the nearest neighbor distance. So if a=10, then the (111) interplanar distance is about 3.49, but the options are much larger. So perhaps the given interatomic distance is not the a parameter, but the nearest neighbor distance.

Wait, let me calculate the nearest neighbor distance when a=10 and α=30 degrees.

As earlier, the nearest neighbor distance is a*sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)) ) =10*2.863≈28.63 Angstroms, which is way off. That can't be right because in that case, the interatomic distance would be much larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between atoms in the (100) direction, which is a. So a=10.

Hmm, but all the options are around 9 Angstroms. So perhaps I should try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the interplanar distance. For (111), the reciprocal is sqrt(8.196)=2.863, so the interplanar distance is 10/2.863≈3.49.

But if none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is d = a / (sqrt( [h^2 +k^2 +l^2] ) ) * (1/(1 + ... )) ?

Wait, perhaps I should look for another formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / (sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) (1 - cos α) ) )

Wait, let's compute that. For (111), (h² +k² +l²)=3. (1 - cos 30)=1-0.866≈0.134.

So sqrt(3 *0.134)=sqrt(0.402)=0.634.

So d =10/0.634 ≈15.77 Angstroms. No, that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / (sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) ) ) * (1/(sqrt(1 + ... )) )

Hmm, not making sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the face diagonal. Wait, but rhombohedral doesn't have face-centered atoms.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Let's think about the options provided. The options are A)9.08, B)8.95, C)9.54, D)10.05.

If I take the reciprocal of 8.95, I get approximately 0.1117. So 1/8.95≈0.1117.

Wait, what's 8.196? It's 3+5.196. So sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So 10/2.863≈3.49, which is not in the options. But perhaps the reciprocal is meant, but that would be 2.863, which is way off.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the interplanar distance is for a different plane, like (222). Let's see, for (222), h=k=l=2.

Then, denominator would be sqrt(4+4+4 +2*(4+4+4)*cos30) = sqrt(12 + 24*(0.866)) = sqrt(12 + 20.784)=sqrt(32.784)=5.727.

So d=10/5.727≈1.746 Angstroms. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps (120) plane. Let's compute that.

h=1, k=2, l=0.

Denominator: 1 +4 +0 + 2*(2 +0 +0)*cos30 =5 + 4 *0.866≈5+3.464=8.464. Sqrt≈2.909. So d=10/2.909≈3.438. Not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the formula should involve the product of the lattice parameters and the angles, but in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )^{-1}.

Which is same as earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal. If the interplanar distance is 8.95, then the reciprocal is about 0.1117.

But 8.196 is 8.196. So 10/ sqrt(8.196) =3.49.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the angle. The angles given are α=β=γ=30 degrees. But perhaps in the formula, the angles used are 180-30=150 degrees, because in some conventions, the angles are measured as the angles between the vectors when building the lattice, which can be the supplement.

Wait, that's possible. Because in crystallography, the angles between the lattice vectors can be either the acute or obtuse angles. So if the angle between the vectors is 150 degrees (180-30), then cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2≈-0.866.

Let me try that. So in the formula, cos α = cos(150)= -0.866.

So denominator becomes 3 +2*(3)*(-0.866)=3 +2*(-2.598)=3 -5.196= -2.196.

But sqrt of a negative number isn't possible. So that can't be right. So perhaps the formula uses the acute angles, which are 30 degrees, not the obtuse ones.

So that approach is invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the formula uses the angles between the crystallographic axes, which are different from the angles between the lattice vectors. Hmm, this is getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the reciprocal of the interplanar distance, which is the magnitude of the plane's normal vector in reciprocal space.

In that case, the reciprocal lattice vector components are (h, k, l) scaled by 2π, but the magnitude is |G| = sqrt( (h a*)^2 + (k b*)^2 + (l c*)^2 ), where a*, b*, c* are the reciprocal lattice vectors.

But perhaps for a rhombohedral system with a = b = c, the reciprocal lattice vectors can be expressed in terms of a and the angles.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is getting more complicated than necessary, and I should just proceed with the formula I have, even though it doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps the options are incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the (100) plane, which would have a different result.

Wait, for (100), h=1, k=0, l=0.

So denominator is sqrt(1 +0 +0 + 0 + 0 +0 )=1.

So d=10/1=10 Angstroms. That's option D.

But the question is about (111), not (100). So this isn't the case.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, let me recompute the denominator again.

With α=30 degrees:

h² +k² +l²=3.

2*(hk + hl + kl) * cos(30)=2*(3)*0.866≈5.196.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstroms.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the given interatomic distance is not a=10, but something else. If the interatomic distance is 10, but not along the a-axis, perhaps we need to find 'a' again.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is along the (111) direction, which is the same as the interplanar distance. So if d=10, then 10= a / sqrt(8.196) → a=10*2.863≈28.63 Angstroms. But then the interplanar distance for (111) would be 10, which is option D. But that's not the case because the question specifies the interatomic distance is 10.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect. Let me look it up.

Upon checking, the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Which is what I've been using.

So with a=10, the calculation is correct. But since the options don't match, perhaps I misread the question. Let me reread the question.

Ah! Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance refers to the edge length a, not the nearest neighbor distance. So a=10.

Then, the (111) interplanar distance is 3.49 Angstroms, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

But since all angles are 30 degrees, it's the same as 3 +6 *0.866=8.196. So same result.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is in hexagonal units or another system. But no, it's rhombohedral.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Given that my calculation leads to 3.49, which isn't an option, perhaps I should reevaluate my approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / (sqrt(h² +k² +l²) ) * (1/(sqrt(1 + ... )) )

Wait, perhaps I should think about the relation between the interplanar distance for (111) and the lattice parameter a, considering the angles.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 8.95 Angstroms, option B, which is close to 9. So perhaps I'm making a calculation mistake.

Wait, let me compute 10 / sqrt(8.196) with more precise numbers.

Compute sqrt(8.196):

We know that 2.862^2 = (2.86)^2 + 0.002^2 + 2*2.86*0.002.

Wait, 2.86^2=8.1796.

So 2.862^2 = (2.86)^2 + 2*(2.86)*(0.002) + (0.002)^2 =8.1796 +0.01144 +0.000004=8.191044.

Which is less than 8.196.

So 2.862^2=8.191044. The target is 8.196.

The difference is 8.196 -8.191044=0.004956.

So how much more do we need? Let's calculate 2.862 + delta)^2 =8.196.

Approximate delta:

(2.862 + delta)^2 = 2.862^2 + 2*2.862*delta + delta^2 ≈8.191044 +5.724*delta.

Set equal to 8.196:

8.191044 +5.724*delta ≈8.196 → 5.724*delta≈0.004956 → delta≈0.004956/5.724≈0.000865.

So sqrt(8.196)= approximately 2.862 +0.000865≈2.862865.

So 10 /2.862865 ≈3.492 Angstroms.

No, that's still about 3.49.

Wait, perhaps the formula is inverted. Maybe d = a * sqrt( ... ), not divided. But that would yield a much larger value.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the interplanar spacing formula.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. The interplanar distance is d = a / sqrt( ... ), not the other way.

Hmm, maybe I should just choose the closest option, but none are near 3.49.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, let's compute that.

For (111), denominator is sqrt(3 -6*cos30) = sqrt(3 -5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. So that's impossible.

So that can't be right.

Wait, another thought: maybe I should be using the inverse of the formula. So instead of d = a / sqrt( ... ), perhaps it's a multiplied by sqrt(... ), but that would give a larger value.

Wait, if I multiply a=10 by sqrt(8.196)=2.863, I get 28.63, which is way too big.

Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses 1/(h² +k² +l² + ...) instead of the square root.

But that would give 10 /8.196≈1.22, which is not an option.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I've been using the wrong formula and should use the following approach:

The interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system can be found using the formula:

d = (a) / ( (h² +k² +l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ )^(1/2) )

Which is same as before.

So with a=10, I get d=3.49.

But since the options don't match, perhaps I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / ( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ ) )^(1/2)

Which is same as before.

Thus, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the denominator.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ) )

Which would give the same result as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the angles given are 150 degrees, not 30. Because rhombohedral systems can have angles greater than 90 degrees. Let me try that.

So cos(150)= -√3/2≈-0.866.

So denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 2*3*(-0.866) ) → sqrt(3 -5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. So that's impossible.

Therefore, that's not the case.

Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake in the formula.

Alternative approach: Calculate the reciprocal of the interplanar distance. If d=3.49, the reciprocal is about 0.286.

But I don't see any option that would relate to that.

Wait, perhaps I should compute d using a different value of a. Because perhaps the interatomic distance is not a=10, but the nearest neighbor distance is 10, which would require calculating a.

Earlier, I calculated that the nearest neighbor distance is a*sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3) )≈a*2.863. So if that's 10, a=10/2.863≈3.492.

So using a=3.492 in the formula for (111):

d=3.492/sqrt(3 +5.196)=3.492/2.863≈1.219 Angstroms. Still not matching.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm stuck. Based on the formula, the correct interplanar distance should be approximately 3.49 Angstroms, but none of the options match. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the formula, or perhaps the question has a typo.

But given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option B)8.95 Angstroms, which is approximately 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct calculation leads to that.

Wait, perhaps I should try using the formula d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) (1 + cos α) )

So for (111), denominator inside sqrt is 3*(1 +0.866)=3*1.866=5.598.

So sqrt(5.598)=2.366. So d=10/2.366≈4.227. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) (1 + 2 cos α ) )

Then denominator is 3*(1 +2*0.866)=3*(2.732)=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)=2.863, d=10/2.863≈3.49.

Same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Which would be sqrt(3 -6*0.866)=sqrt(3 -5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible.

Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) )

Then denominator is 3 +6=9. So sqrt(9)=3. So d=10/3≈3.333. Still not matching.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I'm going around in circles. Based on the formula I've used, the correct answer should be approximately 3.49 Angstroms, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake, or the question intended a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the reciprocal of the angles. Maybe the formula uses 180-30=150 degrees for the angles, but that leads to a negative denominator. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the angles between the reciprocal vectors, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C)9.54, which is a=10 multiplied by something.

Wait, sqrt(8.196)=2.863. So 10/2.863=3.49. But 10/(something) =9.54 → something≈1.047.

Wait, 8.196 is approximately (2.863)^2=8.196.

So 10/ (2.863) =3.49.

Wait, 3.49 * 2.743=9.54.

But I don't see any reason for that multiplier.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is inverted, like d = a * sqrt(...), but that would give a much larger number.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the interplanar distance for the (222) plane, which would have a denominator of sqrt( (4+4+4) + 2*(4+4+4)*0.866 )= sqrt(12 + 24*0.866 )= sqrt(12+20.784)=sqrt(32.784)=5.727. So d=10/5.727≈1.746, which isn't an option.

Another approach: perhaps the formula is d = a / (sqrt( h² +k² +l² ) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Which would be 10/(sqrt(3) +6*0.866) → sqrt(3)=1.732, 6*0.866=5.196. So denominator=1.732 +5.196=6.928. So d=10/6.928≈1.443. No, that's not matching.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Based on the formula I know, the correct answer isn't among the options. But since the options are given, perhaps I should choose the closest one, but none are close to 3.49. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct answer is 8.95 Angstroms, option B. But I don't see how that would be possible with the given parameters.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Which would be sqrt(3 -5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible. So that can't be.

Perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended a different approach.

Given that I can't reconcile my calculation with the options, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation and see if any of the options match when I use different parameters. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the angles are in degrees and I'm supposed to use something else. Wait, no, cos(30 degrees) is correct as 0.866.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B)8.95 Angstroms, which is approximately 9 Angstroms. How could that happen?

Wait, let me compute sqrt( (111) plane's denominator as 8.196, as before, but perhaps I should compute a different way.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula uses the reciprocal of the angles. For example, perhaps the formula is d = (a) / (sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) (1 - cos α ) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ) )

Which would be sqrt(3*(1 -0.866)+6*0.866 )=sqrt(3*(0.134)+5.196)=sqrt(0.402 +5.196)=sqrt(5.598)=2.366.

So d=10/2.366≈4.227 Angstroms. Still not matching.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the formula I used, the correct answer is approximately 3.49 Angstroms, which isn't among the provided options. However, since I'm required to choose from the options given, and perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup, I'll have to proceed with the calculation I have, but it's not matching any option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B)8.95 Angstroms.


To determine the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, the formula used is:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \alpha}}
\]

### Given:
- Interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \)
- Angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \)
- Miller indices \( h = k = l = 1 \)

### Substituting into the formula:
1. Compute \( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 \):
   \[
   h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3
   \]

2. Compute \( 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \alpha \):
   - \( hk + hl + kl = 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 = 3 \)
   - \( 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \alpha = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \cos 30^\circ = 6 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 5.196 \)

3. Add the terms in the denominator:
   \[
   h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \alpha = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196
   \]

4. Compute the square root of the denominator:
   \[
   \sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863
   \]

5. Compute the interplanar distance:
   \[
   d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{\text{denominator}}} = \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- The calculated interplanar distance \( d \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the provided options (\( 9.08, 8.95, 9.54, 10.05 \, \text{Å} \)).
- It is possible that the interatomic distance given (\( 10 \, \text{Å} \)) is not the lattice parameter \( a \), but rather the nearest neighbor distance. If this is the case, \( a \) would need to be recalculated, but this approach also did not yield a value consistent with the options.
- Despite extensive re-evaluation of the formula and calculations, the result remains \( d \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \), which is not among the provided choices.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations and the options provided, the closest plausible answer is **B) 8.95 Å**, though the reasoning behind this discrepancy is unclear. It is possible that the question contains an error or assumes a different interpretation of the interatomic distance.

ANSWER: B
