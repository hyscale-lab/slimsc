Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me start by trying to understand what's being asked.

The problem is about a muon, which is like a heavy electron, and the operator in question is P. The operator is along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. I remember that in quantum mechanics, spin operators are usually represented as vectors, and for spin-½ particles, the operators are proportional to the Pauli matrices.

Wait, right, the operator P is given in components: Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So, the components are:

Px = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

I think the general form for the operator along an arbitrary direction n is P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, that means n_y is zero. So, P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, let's think about the direction vector n. It's in the x-z plane, so it can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) perhaps? Or maybe I should just say that n has components (a, 0, b), where a² + b² = 1. But the exact parametrization might not matter right now.

The eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. Because the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So, finding the eigenvector for P with eigenvalue ħ/2.

Let me write down the operator P. Since n is in x-z plane, n = (n_x, 0, n_z). So, P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Substituting the given matrices:

P = n_x (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, factoring out ħ/2:

P = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Wait, let me compute that correctly. The first term is [[0, n_x ħ/2], [n_x ħ/2, 0]], and the second term is [[n_z ħ/2, 0], [0, -n_z ħ/2]]. So when you add them:

P = (ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

So the matrix is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] multiplied by ħ/2.

Now, the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. So, the matrix equation is:

(ħ/2) [n_z , n_x; n_x, -n_z ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Wait, no, wait. The eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (eigenvalue) |ψ>. The eigenvalue given is +ħ/2. So the equation is:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

We can multiply both sides by 2/ħ to simplify:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] [a; b] = [a; b]

So, the matrix equation becomes:

n_z * a + n_x * b = a
n_x * a - n_z * b = b

Let me write these equations:

1) (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
2) n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Hmm, that's a system of equations. To find non-trivial solutions (a, b not both zero), the determinant must be zero.

But maybe I can find a ratio between a and b. Let's take the first equation:

(n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0

=> (n_z - 1) a = -n_x b

=> a = [ -n_x / (n_z - 1) ] b

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the easiest way. Alternatively, perhaps I can parameterize the direction n.

Since n is in the x-z plane, I can write it as n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So substituting into the equations:

Equation 1: (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0

Equation 2: sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

So, equation 1: (cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b

Equation 2: sinθ a = (cosθ + 1) b

Let me see if these are consistent.

From equation 1: a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

From equation 2: a = [ (cosθ +1) / sinθ ] b

So, setting them equal:

- sinθ / (cosθ -1) = (cosθ +1) / sinθ

Multiply both sides by (cosθ -1) sinθ:

- sin²θ = (cosθ +1)(cosθ -1) 

Wait, (cosθ +1)(cosθ -1) is cos²θ -1. So:

- sin²θ = cos²θ -1

But cos²θ -1 is -sin²θ. So:

- sin²θ = - sin²θ

Which is an identity. So the equations are consistent, and we can choose one equation to relate a and b.

From equation 1: a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Because (cosθ -1) is -(1 - cosθ), so when I take the negative, it becomes positive.

So,

a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Hmm, sinθ/(1 - cosθ) can be simplified using the identity:

sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)
1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2)

So, sinθ/(1 - cosθ) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / [2 sin²(theta/2)] ] = cot(theta/2) / 1

Wait, let me compute:

sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2)

So sinθ/(1 - cosθ) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / [2 sin²(theta/2)] ] = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] = cot(theta/2)

So a = cot(theta/2) * b

So, a = cot(theta/2) b

Let me write a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b.

We can let b = sin(theta/2) c, then a = cos(theta/2) c.

Wait, let's see: if I set b = sin(theta/2), then a = cos(theta/2). So the eigenvector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But wait, I need to normalize it.

The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

So, |cos(theta/2)|^2 + |sin(theta/2)|^2 = 1, which is true.

So the normalized eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )^T.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). But option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which looks like spherical coordinates but for a spin-1/2 system.

Wait, but wait, let's think again. The eigenvector we've found is proportional to (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So, the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), each multiplied by something. Wait, but in the problem statement, the options have different forms.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

That's exactly what we have, but wait, the eigenvector is for eigenvalue +ħ/2. Wait, does the direction of n affect this?

Because the operator P is along n, the eigenvector corresponds to spin up along n, which would have components in the basis of the eigenstates of Pz, perhaps.

Wait, but in the standard basis for spin-½, the eigenstates of S_z are (1,0) and (0,1). So if the direction is along theta, then the spin-up state would be a superposition of these.

Wait, but our calculation led us to (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is correct for the spin-up state along direction theta.

Wait, but let's see the options again.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Yes.

But wait, a lot of the options have hbar in them, like option A and D. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the eigenvector of the operator P, which has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. So the eigenvectors are the spin-up and spin-down states along the direction n.

So the eigenvectors should be normalized, which they are in option C.

Wait, but why do options A and D have hbar multiplied? Because hbar is a unit
