Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when we talk about the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere, it's often related to the Saha equation. Oh right, the Saha equation describes the ionization and excitation states of atoms in a stellar atmosphere under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which the question states.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level as those in star_2. So the excitation is higher in star_1. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I think that relates to the energy levels in the Saha equation.

Wait, the Saha equation for excitation can be written as (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * ( (2πm_e k T)/(h^2) )^(3/2) * e^(-ΔE/(k T)) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels, and T is the temperature. Oh wait, I think ΔE is in the exponent as a negative term because higher energy levels are less populated at lower temperatures.

In this case, n_i is the number of atoms in the excited state, and n_j is the ground state. So the ratio n_i/n_j for star_1 is twice that for star_2. So for star_1, (n_i1 / n_j1) = 2 * (n_i2 / n_j2).

But wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited"—so maybe the ratio is higher. Let me think. So, (n_i1 / n_j1) = 2 * (n_i2 / n_j2).

Assuming that the statistical weights (g_i and g_j) are the same for both stars since they're both iron atoms in the same energy levels. So, (g_i/g_j) is a constant and can be factored out. So the ratio of the ratios is (n_i1/n_j1) / (n_i2/n_j2) ) = 2.

Looking at the Saha equation, the ratio of the excitation ratios would be [ ( (2πm_e k T1)/(h^2) )^(3/2) e^(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) ] divided by [ same expression with T2 ].

So, [ (T1/T2)^(3/2) * e^(-ΔE/(k T1)) / e^(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) ] equals 2.

Wait, wait. Let me write that more clearly. The ratio is:

[ ( (T1^(3/2) e^{-ΔE/(k T1)} ) ) / (T2^(3/2) e^{-ΔE/(k T2)} ) ) ] = 2

Which simplifies to (T1/T2)^(3/2) * e^{ (ΔE/k)(1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) } = 2

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. But wait, the question gives the energy difference as 1.38e-23
