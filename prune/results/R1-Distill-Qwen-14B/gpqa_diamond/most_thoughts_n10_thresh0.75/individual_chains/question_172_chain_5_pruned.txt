Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's photosphere has something to do with the star's temperature. Oh right, it's about thermal excitation and the Boltzmann distribution.

So the question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so the usual statistical mechanics apply.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels. The equation is n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( - (E_upper - E_lower)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the excitation is the ratio of the excited state to the ground state. Since the problem says "twice as excited", I think that refers to the population of the excited state compared to the lower state. So for star_1, the ratio is 2, and for star_2, it's 1, maybe? Wait, wait. Wait, the question says in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited when compared to star_2. So maybe the ratio is higher for star_1.

Wait, let me parse that again. "Iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So the excitation level is higher in star_1. So if we denote the excitation as the population of the higher energy level, then for star_1, n_upper1 / n_lower1 = 2 * (n_upper2 / n_lower2). Or is it that the ratio is twice that of star_2?

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio for star_1 is twice as much as that for star_2. So, (n_upper1 / n_lower1) = 2 * (n_upper2 / n_lower2). Or maybe it's twice the value. Let me think.

Wait, wait, the energy difference is the same for both stars because
