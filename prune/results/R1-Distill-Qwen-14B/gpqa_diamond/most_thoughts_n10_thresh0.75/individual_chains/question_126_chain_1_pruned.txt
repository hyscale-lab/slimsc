Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit tricky. But I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question involves two reactions, Reaction I and Reaction II, and then analyzing the products by HPLC. We have to determine how many peaks will appear in the chiral and normal-phase HPLC chromatograms after combining the products.

First, let me break down each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, which is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, hexan-3-one has a ketone group at position 3. When reduced, that ketone will become an alcohol. Also, since the starting material is (S) configuration at the 5-methoxy group, I need to think about whether the reduction affects the stereochemistry.

Wait, the starting compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Structure-wise, hexan-3-one would be CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, wait. Let me draw it:

Structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one:

The molecule is hexan-3-one, so the carbonyl is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2CH2 groups on either side. Wait, perhaps more accurately, hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Wait, hexan-3-one would be:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan has six carbons. So 3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let's count:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C=O (so ketone)
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH2
Carbon 6: CH3?

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, hexan is six carbons. So 3-one would
