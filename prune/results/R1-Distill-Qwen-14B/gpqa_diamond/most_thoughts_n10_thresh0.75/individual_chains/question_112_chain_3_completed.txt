Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

Alright, the state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Hmm, I know that |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which makes sense because they're probably the standard basis states for spin-1/2 particles.

The question asks me to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation A where A_ij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and zero otherwise. Oh right, so for a 2x2 matrix, A would look like this:

A = [ [0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0] ]

Because when i≠j, the elements are hbar/2, and the diagonal elements are zero.

Wait a second, that matrix looks familiar. Oh right! That's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (hbar/2) * σ_x.

So the operator in question is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X operator. Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so this operator is also Hermitian, meaning its eigenvalues are real, and it has orthogonal eigenstates.

The eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are the eigenstates of the given operator as well. Let me think about what those eigenstates are.

The Pauli X eigenstates are the spin states along the x-axis. They can be written as |+x> and |-x>, where |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Or wait, maybe I have the signs backward. Alternatively, it's (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Yeah, that's right.

So the eigenstates of operator A are |+x> and |-x>, and their corresponding eigenvalues would be (hbar/2)*1 and (hbar/2)*(-1), because σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1.

But wait, the operator A has eigenvalues plus and minus hbar/2, right? Because when you multiply σ_x by hbar/2, each eigenvalue is scaled by that factor.

So the problem is to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each of these eigenstates (|+x> and |-x>), and also compute the expectation value (average) of operator A.

First, I need to normalize the state |alpha>. The given state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let me calculate the normalization factor.

The state can be written as |alpha> = c1 |up> + c2 |down>, where c1 = 1+i and c2 = 2 - i.

The norm is |c1|^2 + |c2|^2. Let's compute that.

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.
|2 - i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the total norm is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Okay, now I need to express this state in terms of the eigenstates of operator A, which are |+x> and |-x>.

Let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>.

First, let's express |+x> and |-x> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So any state can be written as a combination of these. Let me denote |alpha> as a|+x> + b|-x>.

Substituting the expressions for |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = a*(|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b*(|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)
= [ (a + b)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (a - b)/sqrt(2) ] |down>.

Comparing this with |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7)|down>, we can set up equations:

(a + b)/sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7)  → equation 1
(a - b)/sqrt(2) = (2 -i)/sqrt(7) → equation 2

Let me solve for a and b.

Adding equations 1 and 2:

[ (a + b) + (a - b) ] / sqrt(2) = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7)
[ 2a ] / sqrt(2) = (3) / sqrt(7)
a = [ 3 / sqrt(7) ] * [ sqrt(2)/2 ] = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7) )
Simplify sqrt(2)/(2) is 1/sqrt(2), so a = 3/(sqrt(14)) )

Wait, let me compute it again:

From adding equations 1 and 2:

2a / sqrt(2) = [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] / sqrt(7)
Which is [3] / sqrt(7)
So 2a = [3/sqrt(7)] * sqrt(2)
a = [3 sqrt(2) ] / ( 2 sqrt(7) )
Which is 3/(sqrt(14)).

Wait, because sqrt(2)/(2) = 1/sqrt(2).

Wait, 2a / sqrt(2) = 3/sqrt(7)
Multiply both sides by sqrt(2)/2:

a = 3/(sqrt(7)) * sqrt(2)/(2) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

[ (a + b) - (a - b) ] / sqrt(2) = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7)
[ 2b ] / sqrt(2) = ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(7)
So 2b = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)
b = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Wait, let me compute that again.

Wait equation 1 minus equation 2:

(a + b)/sqrt(2) - (a - b)/sqrt(2) = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7)
[ 2b ] / sqrt(2) = [ (1+i -2 +i) ] / sqrt(7)
= [ (-1 + 2i) ] / sqrt(7)
So 2b = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)
Thus, b = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / ( 2 sqrt(7) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to solve for a and b using the two equations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute a and b using the coefficients.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the expansion in terms of |+x> and |-x> directly.

So, |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Expressed in terms of |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

So |alpha> = [ ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) * |up> + ( (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) * |down> ]

We can write this as:

|alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i) |down> ] / sqrt(7)

But we need to express this in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me write |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |-x>:

From the definitions,

|up> = (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2)
|down> = (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2)

So substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i) [ (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2) ) ] + (2 -i) [ (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2) ) ] ] / sqrt(7)

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

= [ (1+i) (|+x> + |-x> ) + (2 -i) (|+x> - |-x> ) ] / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

Combine like terms:

The |+x> terms:

(1+i) |+x> + (2 -i) |+x> = [ (1+i + 2 -i) ] |+x> = (3) |+x>

The |-x> terms:

(1+i)|-x> - (2 -i)|-x> = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] |-x> = [ (1 -2) + i(1 +1) ] |-x> = ( -1 + 2i ) |-x>

So putting it together:

|alpha> = [ 3 |+x> + ( -1 + 2i ) |-x> ] / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

Simplify the denominator:

sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) = sqrt(14)

So,

|alpha> = [ 3 |+x> + ( -1 +2i ) |-x> ] / sqrt(14 )

So, the coefficients for |+x> and |-x> are 3/sqrt(14) and (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14), respectively.

Wait a minute, that's interesting. Because the state is expressed in terms of |+x> and |-x>, the probabilities will be the squares of the magnitudes of these coefficients.

So the probability of measuring |+x> is |3/sqrt(14)|² = (9)/(14) ≈ 0.6429.

Similarly, the probability of measuring |-x> is | (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14) |².

Compute that:

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.3571.

Wait, but wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, and 5/14 is approximately 0.3571. Let me check 9 +5 is 14, correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.64 and 5/14≈0.36.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7 as average. Hmm, but let me think about the average value.

The average value of operator A is <alpha| A |alpha>.

But another approach is to compute the expectation value using the eigenstate expansion.

Since A is (hbar/2) σ_x, its expectation value is (hbar/2) times the expectation value of σ_x.

Alternatively, since we've expressed |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>,

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>,

the expectation value of A is:

a^* a (hbar/2) * 1 + b^* b (hbar/2) * (-1) 

Because |+x> has eigenvalue +hbar/2, |-x> has eigenvalue -hbar/2.

So,

< A > = (hbar/2) [ |a|^2 - |b|^2 ]

Wait, because (hbar/2) [ a^* a * (1) + b^* b * (-1) ]

So,

= (hbar/2) [ |a|^2 - |b|^2 ]

Compute |a|^2 and |b|^2.

From earlier, a =3/sqrt(14), so |a|^2 = 9/14.

b= (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14), so |b|^2 = [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1+4)/14=5/14.

So,

< A > = (hbar/2) [ (9/14) - (5/14) ) ] = (hbar/2)(4/14) = (hbar/2)(2/7) )= hbar/(7).

Wait, that's hbar divided by 7. So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says average hbar/7, and probabilities 0.64 and 0.36. But wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is 0.64, and 5/14 is 0.3571428, which is about 0.36.

So the probabilities are approximately 64% and 36%, and the average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7 → matches.

Option B: 0.54, 0.46, 3 hbar/sqrt(7) → doesn't match.

Option C: 0.28, 0.72 → no.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29 → no.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculation of the probabilities.

Wait, when expressing |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, the coefficients were 3/sqrt(14) and (-1+2i)/sqrt(14). So the probabilities are the squares of these coefficients' magnitudes.

So for |+x>, it's |3/sqrt(14)|² = 9/14 ≈0.64286.

For |-x>, |(-1+2i)/sqrt(14)|²: the numerator is sqrt( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) = sqrt(1+4)=sqrt(5). So the magnitude squared is (sqrt(5))^2 /14 =5/14≈0.3571.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.64286, which is about 0.64. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which in decimal are approximately 0.64286 and 0.35714.

So the first part is correct. Then the average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A is the one that matches: probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, average hbar/7.

Wait, but what about the other options? Let me check.

Wait, option A's average is hbar/7, which matches our calculation. So that's the correct option.


The problem involves an electron in the state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be computed.

### Key Steps:
1. **Normalization of \( |\alpha\rangle \):**
   The given state is \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The norm is:
   \[
   |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
   \]
   Thus, the normalized state is:
   \[
   |\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|\downarrow\rangle.
   \]

2. **Eigenstates of \( A \):**
   The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
   \[
   A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
   This is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, and its eigenstates are:
   \[
   |+x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
   \]
   The corresponding eigenvalues are \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

3. **Expressing \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \):**
   Substituting \( |\uparrow\rangle = \frac{|+x\rangle + |-x\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle = \frac{|+x\rangle - |-x\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \) into \( |\alpha\rangle \), we find:
   \[
   |\alpha\rangle = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}|+x\rangle + \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}|-x\rangle.
   \]

4. **Probabilities of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \):**
   The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:
   \[
   P(+x) = \left|\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64,
   \]
   \[
   P(-x) = \left|\frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
   \]

5. **Average value of \( A \):**
   The expectation value of \( A \) is:
   \[
   \langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left(|a|^2 - |b|^2\right),
   \]
   where \( a = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \) and \( b = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \). Substituting:
   \[
   |a|^2 = \frac{9}{14}, \quad |b|^2 = \frac{5}{14}.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left(\frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The probabilities of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively, and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). These results match **Option A**.
