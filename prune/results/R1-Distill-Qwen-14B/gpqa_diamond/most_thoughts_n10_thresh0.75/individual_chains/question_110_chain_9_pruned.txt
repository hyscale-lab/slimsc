Okay, so I've got this astronomy question to solve. Let me read through it again carefully. It's about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. 

The problem gives me some information about each star, their apparent or absolute magnitudes, distances, and some details about extinction (E(B-V)) which I think relates to interstellar dust affecting the star's brightness. 

Let me first note down the key points:

- ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitude brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no—wait. The way it's phrased: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh, because lower magnitude means brighter. So if a star's apparent V mag is less than 17, it's bright enough for ESPRESSO. Wait, no—wait, the V magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are brighter. So the statement says "brighter than 17 mag", so the apparent magnitude has to be less than 17 (because higher magnitudes are fainter). So, if a star's apparent V mag is ≤17, ESPRESSO can observe it.

Wait, but the exact wording: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So, brighter than 17 would mean their V mag is less than 17. Because a magnitude brighter than 17 would have a smaller number. For example, magnitude 16 is brighter than 17. So stars with V mag ≤17 can be observed by ESPRESSO.

HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So their apparent V mag must be ≤16. So a star has to have V mag ≤16 to be observed by HIRES.

Wait, but wait again—wait, the question says, "with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed." So same logic: if a star's apparent V mag is less than (brighter than) 16, HIRES can observe it. So ≤16.

So, for a star to be detectable by both, its V mag must be ≤16, because HIRES can't see beyond that. Because HIRES can't see anything fainter than 16. So the star must have apparent V mag ≤16 to be observed by HIRES, and also must have apparent V mag ≤17 to be observed by ESPRESSO. But since 16 is more restrictive, the limiting factor is the apparent V mag must be ≤16.

But wait, wait. Let me make sure. Let's see: 

ESPRESSO: V mag ≤17. So any star with V ≤17 can be seen by ESPRESSO.

HIRES: V mag ≤16. So only stars with V ≤16 can be seen by HIRES.

So to be detectable by both, the star's apparent V mag must be ≤16.

So now, I need to check each star's apparent V magnitude, considering any extinction (dust) which dims the star. Because some stars have extinction (E(B-V) given), which affects their apparent magnitude.

So I'll go through each star one by one.
