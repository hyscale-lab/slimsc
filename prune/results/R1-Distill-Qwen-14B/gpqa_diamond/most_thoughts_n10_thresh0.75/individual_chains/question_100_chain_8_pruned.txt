Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because reaction mechanisms can get tricky. But let's take it step by step. I'll try to figure out each reaction and then see which statement is incorrect.

So, the problem starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, I recall that C3H6 could be either propene or cyclopropane. Wait, wait, no, cyclopropane is C3H6 too. But wait, more commonly, when C3H6 comes up in reactions like bromination, it's probably propene. Because cyclopropane is less reactive for such reactions. So I'll go with propene as Compound A.

Alright, first reaction: Compound A undergoes bromination in the presence of CCl4 to form B. Bromination of an alkene typically adds bromine across the double bond. So propene (CH2=CH2CH3?) Wait, propene is actually CH2=CHCH3. So adding bromine would add Br across the double bond. So when propene reacts with Br2, it forms 1,2-dibromopropane? Or wait, wait, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, in CCl4, Br2 adds across the double bond. Propene has two carbons in the double bond. So the product would be 1,2-dibromopropane. So Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next step: Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C. Alcoholic KOH usually dehydrohalogenates, so it's an elimination reaction. Since B is 1,2-dibromopropane, elimination would likely form an alkene. Wait, but wait, 1,2-dibromopropane has two adjacent Br atoms. When treated with alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate two HBr molecules. So each Br is on adjacent carbons, so eliminating both would form an alkene. So the product would be propene again? Wait, that can't be, because if B is 1,2-dibromopropane, removing two HBr would give propene. But wait, that's the same as A. So compound C would be propene again? Hmm, but wait, that doesn't make sense because the product after elimination would be the same as the starting material. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a single elimination, but in that case, the
