Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, a six-membered ring with a ketone group. The first reaction is treating it with bromine. Wait, bromine in what conditions? Oh right, cyclohexanone can undergo a ring-opening via an alpha bromination when treated with Br2. So the ketone's alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to the carbonyl) get brominated. Since cyclohexanone has two alpha carbons (each adjacent to the carbonyl), but they're equivalent because of the ring's symmetry. So product 1 would be 2-bromocyclohexanone? Or wait, no, wait. Wait, when cyclohexanone reacts with bromine, perhaps it's an example of the alpha bromination, producing a dibrominated compound? Or maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, no, wait. Another possibility is that when cyclohexanone reacts with bromine (Br2), it undergoes a bromohydrin formation. But I think that's when the reaction is done with water, like in the presence of water. Alternatively, wait, another possibility is that bromine could add across the double bond if it's present, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. So maybe it's an addition to the carbonyl. But wait, cyclohexanone is a ketone; adding bromine to a ketone wouldn't make much sense because ketones don't typically react with Br2 in the same way alkenes do. Oh wait, maybe it's an enol formation. Right, cyclohexanone can enolize, and the enol can react with bromine. The enol has a double bond, so bromine could add across it, forming a diepoxide or something else? Or perhaps it's an alpha bromination via the enol mechanism.

Wait, yes, I think that's right. The alpha position gets brominated. So cyclohexanone has two alpha carbons (each of the two CH2 adjacent to the ketone). So when bromine adds, it will add a Br to one of these carbons. But since they're equivalent due to the ring's symmetry, the product 1 would be 2-bromocyc
