Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, the question gives me some phase shifts and asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that in scattering theory, especially in quantum mechanics, the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts. The scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using these phase shifts. Oh right, the formula involves the sum of the phase shifts multiplied by spherical harmonics or something like that.

Wait, the question specifies the imaginary part along the incident direction. Oh wait, when the scattering angle θ is zero, that's along the incident beam. I think in that case, the expression simplifies because the spherical harmonics terms might reduce. Or maybe it's when the angle is 180 degrees? No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) is a function of both angles. But for the problem, they're considering the direction along the incident beam, which I think is θ=0. Or maybe it's the direction opposite, like θ=π? I need to think about that.

Wait, no, the scattering amplitude's real and imaginary parts are given by particular expressions. I think the formula for the imaginary part is something like (2π/k) times the sum over l of ( (2l + 1) (δ_l) ) multiplied by sinθ. Because for each l, the phase shift δ_l contributes to the amplitude.

Wait, but wait, the problem is about the imaginary part along the incident beam. So if the beam is along the z-axis, then the direction along the beam would be θ=0. So plugging θ=0 into the formula.

So the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude f_im(θ) is (2π/k) * sum_{l=0}^{∞} ( (2l + 1) δ_l ) * sinθ. Oh wait, no, because when I think of the expansion, the scattering amplitude f is written in terms of Legendre polynomials or something, so the coefficients involve these phase shifts.

Wait, here's the formula I think is correct: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, Im f(θ), is (2π/k) times the sum of (2l + 1) times δ_l times sinθ. Wait, but I'm
