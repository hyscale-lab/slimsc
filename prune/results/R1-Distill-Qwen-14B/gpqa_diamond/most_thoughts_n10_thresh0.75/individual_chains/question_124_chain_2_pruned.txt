Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

So, particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles decay quickly and travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius is 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds reach the inner walls.

Hmm. So, I think I need to figure out how the Lorentz factor affects how far a particle travels before decaying. Because if a third get to the inner walls with a gamma of 20, then maybe if they have a higher gamma, more would reach the walls. Because gamma relates to time dilation and length contraction. 

Wait, I remember that the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) is tau. The actual lifetime observed is gamma times tau. So, the distance a particle travels before decaying is its speed multiplied by the lifetime. Since it's ultra-relativistic, the speed is approximately c. So, the distance L is approximately c * gamma * tau.

Wait, but particles that don't decay will reach the detector's walls. So, the ones that decay before traveling L will not reach, and the ones that don't decay (wait, no, wait: wait, the ones that decay before reaching the wall will not reach, and the ones that don't decay in time reach the wall. Or is it the opposite? Wait, no: the particles are produced at the center and have to travel to the wall, which is 30 meters away. So, if a particle decays before reaching the wall, it doesn't make it. If it doesn't decay, it does reach the wall.

So, the fraction that reach the wall is the probability that the particle hasn't decayed by the time it's traveled 30 meters. The decay follows an exponential probability distribution. The probability of decay before time t is 1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, but I think the way to model this is using the mean lifetime. The mean lifetime is gamma times the proper lifetime tau. So, the lifetime distribution is exponential with a mean of gamma tau. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed after time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau))
