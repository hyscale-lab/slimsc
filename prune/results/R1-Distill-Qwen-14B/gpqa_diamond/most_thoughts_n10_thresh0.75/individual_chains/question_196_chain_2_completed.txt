Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it. The question is about finding the maximum speed of the mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. 

First, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator's maximum speed can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement (amplitude A) is converted into kinetic energy at the equilibrium point. The potential energy in a spring is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal, v_max² = (kA²)/m, and v_max is sqrt(kA²/m). That's the classical result, which is option C. But wait, the question is relativistic, so I can't use that directly.

Relativistically, things get more complicated because as the speed approaches the speed of light, the relativistic effects become significant. So I need to consider the relativistic kinetic energy. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by KE = (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor: 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

In the case of a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is still (1/2)kA², but the kinetic energy is relativistic. So when the mass is at the equilibrium point, all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So setting them equal: (γ - 1)mc² = (1/2)kA². 

Wait, but maybe there's another approach. The harmonic oscillator's total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential, which in the relativistic case would involve integrating the force over distance, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to go. Maybe it's better to think in terms of energy conservation. 

So, at maximum displacement A, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. The potential energy is (1/2)kA², which is the total energy. Then, at the equilibrium position (x=0), all the potential energy is converted into kinetic. So,

(γ - 1) mc² = (1/2) k A².

Let me write that equation down:

(γ - 1) mc² = (1/2) k A².

We can solve for γ. Let's rearrange:

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me square both sides to make it easier:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]².

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but let's try to solve for v. Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a variable, maybe 'a' for simplicity. So, a = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Then the equation becomes:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + a)^2.

Taking reciprocal on both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1 / (1 + a)^2.

Then, v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2.

Simplify the right side:

v²/c² = [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2.

Expanding the numerator: (1 + 2a + a² - 1) = 2a + a².

So,

v² = c² * (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2.

But wait, I can factor that numerator. 2a + a² = a (2 + a) = a (a + 2). Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, let's substitute back a = (k A²)/(2 m c²):

v² = c² * [ (2*(k A²)/(2 m c²)) + (k A²/(2 m c²))² ] / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2.

Simplify numerator terms:

The first term in numerator is (2*(k A²)/(2 m c²)) = (k A²)/(m c²).

The second term is (k A²/(2 m c²))² = (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

So,

v² = c² [ (k A²/(m c²)) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) ] / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2.

Let me factor out (k A²)/(m c²) from the numerator:

= c² [ (k A²/(m c²)) (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)) ) ] / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2.

So,

= c² * (k A²/(m c²)) * (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²))) / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2.

Simplify denominator and numerator:

= c² * (k A²/(m c²)) / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²))).

Which simplifies to:

v² = (k A²/m) / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)].

Take square root:

v = sqrt( k A² / [m (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ] )

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them exactly match. Let me look again at the options.

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2m))^2 )

Wait, that denominator is 1 - (k A²)/(2m), which would be a problem if (k A²) is more than 2m, because the denominator could be zero or negative. But in reality, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum value of (1/2)k A² must be less than the rest energy, so (k A²)/(2mc²) < 1, so that (k A²)/(2m) < c². So, that term is manageable.

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²)) )

Hmm, that seems similar to what I have, but not exactly.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me re-examine my steps.

Wait, when I set (γ - 1)mc² = (1/2)k A². Maybe that's not correct. Because in the harmonic oscillator, potential energy is (1/2)k x². When x is A, maximum displacement, potential energy is (1/2)k A². At equilibrium, velocity is maximum and PE is zero, KE is maximum. So:

KE = (γ - 1)mc² = (1/2)k A².

Wait, but is that right for relativistic cases? Because in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is indeed (1/2)k x², but the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² because of relativity. So yeah, that's correct.

But let me think again. For small oscillations, the classical approach holds, but here we are considering the maximum speed, which could be significant relativistically.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy of the oscillator is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy. So,

Total energy E = KE + PE.

At x = A, PE is (1/2)k A², KE is zero. So E = (1/2)k A².

At x = 0, PE is zero, KE is maximum. So,

E = (γ - 1) m c² + 0 = (1/2)k A².

So yes, same equation as before.

So,

(γ - 1) m c² = (1/2)k A².

So,

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, that's correct.

So,

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as 'a' again. So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + a.

Then,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + a).

Squaring both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + a)^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2.

Hmm, let's compute this:

1 - 1/(1 + a)^2 = [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2.

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2a + a²) -1 = 2a + a².

So,

v²/c² = (2a + a²)/(1 + a)^2.

Which is,

v = c * sqrt( (2a + a²) ) / (1 + a).

Factor numerator:

a(2 + a) = a(a + 2). So,

v = c * sqrt( a(a+2) ) / (1 + a).

But a is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let's plug that back in:

a = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) * ( (k A²)/(2 m c²) + 2 ) ] ) / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)).

Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but let's see if we can simplify.

Let me compute the numerator inside the square root:

a (a + 2) = [ (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ] [ (k A²)/(2 m c²) + 2 ]

= [ (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ] [ (k A² + 4 m c² ) / (2 m c²) ) ]

So,

= [ k A² (k A² + 4 m c² ) ] / (4 m² c^4 )

So the numerator inside the sqrt becomes:

sqrt( [k A² (k A² +4 m c² ) ] / (4 m² c^4) )

= [ sqrt( k A² (k A² +4 m c²) ) ] / (2 m c² )

So, putting it all together:

v = c * [ sqrt( k A² (k A² +4 m c²) ) / (2 m c²) ) ] / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )

Simplify denominator: 1 + a = (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) )

So,

v = c * [ sqrt( k A² (k A² +4 m c²) ) / (2 m c²) ) ] * [2 m c²/(2 m c² + k A²) ) ]

The 2 m c² in numerator and denominator cancel:

v = c * sqrt( k A² (k A² +4 m c²) ) / (2 m c² + k A² )

Hmm, not sure if this is helpful. Let's factor out k A² from the numerator inside the square root:

sqrt( k A² (k A² +4 m c²) ) = A k * sqrt( 1 + (4 m c²)/(k A²) )

Wait, but this might not be helpful. Perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me go back to the expression for v²/c²:

v²/c² = (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2.

Where a = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v² = c² * (2a + a²)/(1 + a)^2.

Let me factor the numerator:

2a + a² = a (a + 2) = a (a + 2).

And denominator is (1 + a)^2.

Wait, another approach: let's write this as:

v²/c² = [ a (a + 2) ] / (1 + a)^2.

Which can be written as:

v²/c² = [ a (a + 2) ] / (a + 1)^2.

Hmm. Maybe factor differently.

Alternatively, let me take a common factor from numerator and denominator.

Wait, perhaps I can express it as:

( a (a + 2) ) / (a + 1)^2 = [ (a^2 + 2a) ] / (a^2 + 2a +1) )

But that doesn't immediately suggest a simplification.

Wait, perhaps I can write (a^2 + 2a) = (a^2 + 2a +1) -1 = (a+1)^2 -1.

So,

v²/c² = [ (a+1)^2 -1 ] / (a +1)^2.

Which simplifies to:

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(a + 1)^2 ]

But wait, from earlier, I had:

v²/c² = (2a + a²)/(1 + a)^2 = [ a (a + 2) ]/(a+1)^2.

Wait, but if I write it as (a^2 + 2a) / (a +1)^2, then as (a^2 + 2a +1 -1 ) / (a +1)^2 = [ (a+1)^2 -1 ]/(a+1)^2 = 1 - 1/(a+1)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(a+1)^2.

So,

v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/(a+1)^2 )

Thus,

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(a+1)^2 )

Now, substituting a = (k A²)/(2 m c²),

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/( ( (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) + 1 )^2 )

Let me compute the denominator inside the square root:

( (k A²)/(2 m c²) + 1 ) = ( k A² + 2 m c² ) / ( 2 m c² )

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - [ (2 m c²)/(k A² + 2 m c²) ) ]^2 )

Hmm, this seems complicated, but let me compute it.

Wait, perhaps I can write this as:

1 - [ (2 m c²)/(k A² + 2 m c²) ) ]^2 = [ (k A² + 2 m c²)^2 - (2 m c²)^2 ) ] / (k A² + 2 m c²)^2.

Expanding numerator:

(k A² + 2 m c²)^2 - (2 m c²)^2 = [k² A^4 + 4 m c² k A^2 + 4 m² c^4 ] - 4 m² c^4.

Simplify:

= k² A^4 +4 m c² k A^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (k² A^4 +4 m c² k A^2 ) / (k A² + 2 m c² )^2 ) )

Factor numerator:

k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 )

Denominator:

(k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( [k A^2 (k A^2 +4 m c^2 ) ] / (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2 )

Hmm, can I factor out k A^2 from denominator?

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps factor the numerator:

= c * [ sqrt( k A^2 (k A^2 + 4 m c^2 ) ) ] / (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )

But this might not lead me anywhere. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options, option D is:

v_max = c√(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²))² )

Which matches with what I have after substituting a.

Because in my expression,

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(a+1)^2 )

And a is (k A²)/(2 m c²), so a+1 is 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So, D is:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c²) ))^2 )

Which is exactly what I have. So the correct answer should be option D.

Wait, let me make sure. Because when I calculated, I ended up with v = c * sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + a)]² ), and a is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, yes, that's option D.

Wait, but let me check option B, which is:

v_max = c√(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²)) )

Hmm, that's different. It would imply a different manipulation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: The relativistic equation of motion for a harmonic oscillator is more complex than the classical one. The equation is:

d²x/dt² = -(k/m) x / γ³,

where γ is the Lorentz factor. But solving this differential equation is non-trivial, and perhaps not needed for this problem, since we can approach it via energy conservation.

So, sticking with the energy approach:

At x = A, KE = 0, PE = (1/2)k A².

At x=0, PE =0, KE is maximum, so:

(γ -1) m c² = (1/2)k A².

Which gives γ =1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

γ = 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)).

Square both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)))^2.

Thus,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)))^2.

Which can be written as,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)))^2 ).

Which is exactly option D.

So yeah, the correct answer is D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we use relativistic energy conservation. The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the potential energy is \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), and the kinetic energy is zero. At equilibrium \( x = 0 \), all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.

The relativistic kinetic energy is given by:

\[
\text{KE} = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. Setting the total energy equal at \( x = A \) and \( x = 0 \), we have:

\[
(\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( a = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + a.
\]

Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + a},
\]

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + a)^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + a)^2}.
\]

Substituting \( a = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A**: Incorrectly uses \( 1 - \frac{kA^2}{2m} \) in the denominator, which does not account for relativistic energy conservation.
- **Option B**: Incorrectly uses \( 1 + \frac{1}{1 - \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}} \), which does not match the derived expression.
- **Option C**: Gives the classical result, which is invalid in the relativistic regime.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
