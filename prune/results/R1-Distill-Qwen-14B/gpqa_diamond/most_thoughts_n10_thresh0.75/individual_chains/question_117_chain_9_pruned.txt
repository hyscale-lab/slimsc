Okay, so I have this question about which organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism... I remember that's when compounds have stereoisomerism that affects their optical activity, meaning they can rotate plane-polarized light. Optical isomerism arises when there's a chiral center in the molecule. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups, making it non-superimposable on its mirror image.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl compounds can sometimes have axial chirality. Wait, I think biphenyls with substituents in certain positions can lead to what's called a biphenyl center. For example, if the substituents are on positions that make the two benzene rings have different substituents in a way that they can't be superimposed. In this case, the substituents are at 6 and 6' positions, but I need to visualize. Oh, but wait, the molecule has two ester groups at 2 and 2', and nitro groups at 6 and 6'. So the biphenyl's substituents are in the 2 and 6 positions. Because of the symmetric positions (both at 2 and 2' and 6 and 6'), would that create a plane of symmetry? Or no? Wait, if the substituents are in positions that are symmetric across the central bond, then maybe there's no chirality. Wait, unless the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has no internal plane of symmetry. Let me think. Since it's 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate, maybe the arrangement is such that the substituents are on each benzene ring in a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image. So it might have axial chirality. If so, it can show optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's draw that. The structure is CH3-C(OH)O-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid.
