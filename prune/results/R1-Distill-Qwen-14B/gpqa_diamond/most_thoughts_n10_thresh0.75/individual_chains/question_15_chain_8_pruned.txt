Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the chance of them transiting. Hmm, I remember that transiting is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers can prioritize their observation time.

The planets are Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the RV method, which means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Wait, so Planet_1 is closer to its star, right? Because shorter orbital period usually means closer orbit, according to Kepler's laws.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radii because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but their radii are equal. Interesting, I didn't know that.

I remember the probability of a planet transiting is related to the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit. The formula for transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by something about the orbital distance. Or wait, more accurately, the probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, the transit probability (p) is calculated as p = (R_star / a)^2, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, I think the probability depends on the planet's orbital plane being edge-on relative to us. The probability is the ratio of the area where the planet's orbit would cause a transit (which is a function of the star's size and the planet's orbital distance).

Wait, another approach: The transit probability is the area of the star's disk divided by the area of the planet's orbital path as seen from Earth. So, the probability is (R_star / a)^2, where a is the semi-major axis. Because the planet's orbit is a circle, and the area where a transit would occur is a circle with radius a. So the probability is (R_star / a)^2. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think again.

Alternatively, I've read that the probability that a planet transits is approximately R*/a, where R* is the star's radius and a
