Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the probability of them transiting their stars. Hmm, let me think. So, the researchers are trying to detect transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They want to choose which one to observe based on the higher probability of a transit, since they have limited time.

Alright, what do I remember about transit probability? I think the probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. Oh wait, right, the formula for the transit probability is something like (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (something else...). Wait no, wait. Actually, the transit probability is proportional to (R_planet / a)^2, but also considering the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight. Oh right, the main factor is the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance. Or wait, no, more accurately, the probability is higher when the planet's orbit is more likely to pass in front of the star from our point of view. The main factors are the size of the star and the distance of the planet's orbit.

Wait, the formula I remember is the transit probability P is approximately (R_star / a)^2, where R_star is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis (orbital radius) of the planet. So for a planet to transit, the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance has to be such that the planet's orbit crosses our line of sight. Wait, no, that's not
