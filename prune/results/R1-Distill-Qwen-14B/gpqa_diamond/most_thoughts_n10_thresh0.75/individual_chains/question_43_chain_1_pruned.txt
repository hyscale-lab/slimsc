Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about a benzene ring with several substituents: a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which I think is an aldehyde group attached to the benzene), and a cyano group. All three of these are meta to each other. Hmm, meta to each other means each is separated by one carbon, right? So they form a triangle on the ring.

Then, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl group and a dimethyl amino group. Wait, ortho means adjacent, so the -COOH has two substituents next to it. So the carboxylic acid is at position 1 (if I number the ring), then the hydroxyl would be at 2 and the dimethyl amino at 3? Or maybe the other way around? Oh wait, because it's benzene, the numbering can go either way, but we have to find the correct positions based on the substituents.

Also, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Para is across the ring, so if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the methoxy would be at position 4.

Additionally, the methoxy and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile. Wait, the nitrile is the cyano group. So the cyano is at a position where both the hydroxyl and methoxy are ortho to it. Let me try to visualize this.

So, benzene ring. Let me imagine drawing it. Let's start by placing the carboxylic acid group, say at position 1. Then, the substituents meta to it would be positions 3 and 5. But wait, the carboxylic acid is meta to both the carbaldehyde and the cyano? Or are the three substituents (carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, cyano) each meta to the others? Because the way it's phrased, they're all meta to one another. So that would mean each substituent is meta to the other two. So, each substituent is separated by two carbons from the others.

Wait, that might be a bit tricky. Let me think: in a benzene ring, if three substit
