Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure, right? So the substituent here is a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7. That tert-butoxy is a bulky group, which might influence the reaction somehow.

Then, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, and I think dibromomethyl groups are leaving groups. Wait, so maybe this is a nucleophilic substitution or elimination reaction. Oh wait, but wait, the starting molecule has an oxygen with a tert-butyl groupâ€”so perhaps this is a Williamson ether synthesis or something similar. Or wait, maybe it's a coupling reaction. Alternatively, since there's sodium iodide, maybe it's an elimination, but more likely, it's a substitution.

Wait, the starting structure has a bicyclo ring, and the substituent is tert-butoxy. Then, when combined with the diene that has two dibromomethyl groups, maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction? Because both are dienes or something. Wait no, the starting material is a diene, but the other component is a dienophile? Or maybe it's a [4+2] cycloaddition.

Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two substituents, each a dibromomethyl group, at positions 5 and 6. So each of those positions has a CH2Br2 group attached. Hmm.

But I'm a bit confused. When such a dienophile reacts, perhaps it's undergoing a Diels-Alder reaction with the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene or something. Wait, the starting material has two double bonds: hepta-2,5-diene, which makes it a conjugated diene. So perhaps it's acting as the diene, and the other molecule as the dienophile. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the dienophile has two double bonds, but I don't think so.

Wait, the other molecule is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So the main ring is a cyclohexene with
