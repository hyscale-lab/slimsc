Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization again? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—those are infinities that pop up in calculations, making the math tricky and the results meaningless. Regularization helps by introducing a temporary cutoff or some other method to make the math manageable, and then you remove it later. So the question is about which theory doesn't need this.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity, right? And it's a candidate for a theory that unites quantum mechanics with general relativity. Since gravity is a high-energy effect, string theory probably handles it without needing the same kind of divergences that other quantum field theories have. Wait, but wait—I remember that in string theory, the concept of a "string" replaces point particles, which might change how divergences appear. Or maybe because it's a theory that includes gravity, it inherently deals with high energies more smoothly, so maybe it doesn't require regularization as much. But I'm not entirely sure.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, right? And I remember that QCD has something called asymptotic freedom, where quarks behave almost freely at very high energies (or equivalently, at very short distances). But because of this, QCD calculations might still have issues with divergences that require regularization. Wait, but then again, I think QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, like Yang-Mills, which usually requires regularization because of divergences. So QCD would need regularization. So this option might not be the correct answer.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I know that QED is a well-behaved theory. It's a U(1) gauge theory. When you calculate loop diagrams, like in electron self-energy, you get divergences. To handle these, you need to regularize, usually using methods like cutoff regularization, Pauli-Villars, or dimensional regularization. So QED definitely requires regularization. So option C is out.
