Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I remember that the SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model. These operators are classified by their dimension, like dimension 6 being common. The idea is that these operators are corrections due to some new physics beyond the SM.

Now, symmetries in physics usually dictate which terms can appear in the Lagrangian. For example, gauge symmetries like SU(2) or U(1) are crucial for the Standard Model. But what about other symmetries like Lorentz or Poincare?

Wait, Lorentz symmetry is the symmetry of spacetime under Lorentz transformations, which includes rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry adds translations to that, so the full symmetry group includes both Lorentz and translations. But wait, in the Standard Model, the theory is Lorentz-invariant, right? So any effective theory must also respect Lorentz symmetry because the SM does. So all SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. So option 1 is a must.

But wait, Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translations. So does SMEFT respect Poincare symmetry? Well, the SM is Poincare invariant, and SMEFT is an effective theory built from
