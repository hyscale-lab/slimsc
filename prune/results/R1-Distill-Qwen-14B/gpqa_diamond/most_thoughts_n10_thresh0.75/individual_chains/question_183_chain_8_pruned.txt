Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a reaction. Hmm, right, the index of hydrogen deficiency is another term for the degree of unsaturation. I remember that each ring or double bond contributes one to the index, and each triple bond counts as two. So the idea is to calculate how many rings and double bonds are in the molecule.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize this structure. So, it's a cyclohexene ring, right? Numbering the positions, the carbons are in a six-membered ring. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. At position 2, there's a formyl group (which is a -CHO group), and at position 5, there's a vinyl group (a -CH₂-CH₂- with a double bond, so it's a -CH₂-CH₂- that's actually -CH₂-CH₂ but wait, wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH- as a substituent. So, the substituent is a vinyl group, meaning it's attached via the CH₂, but the double bond is in the substituent. And then there's the cyclohexene part—so the ring itself has a double bond at position 3, making it a cyclohexene (so the ring has one double bond).

Wait, the name is cyclohex-3-ene, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 in the ring. So the ring has one double bond. Let me count the rings and double bonds in the starting material. The cyclohexene ring—so that's one double bond, and it's a ring, so that's one ring. So that's like two degrees of unsaturation from the ring (no, wait, ring is one, the double bond is another). So each ring or double bond is one, each triple is two. So the cyclohexene ring has one ring and one double bond—so two degrees of unsaturation.

Then, the substituents: the formyl group is a CHO. So that's a carbonyl group (double bond between C and O), so that adds another degree of unsaturation. Wait, the formyl group is a CHO, which has a double bond, so that's one more. The vinyl group is a CH₂-CH₂ but with a double bond in the substituent. So the substituent is CH₂=CH-, which has a double bond. So that's another degree of unsaturation. So let's tally: the ring (1), the double bond in the ring (1), the formyl's double bond (1), and the vinyl's double bond (1). That's four degrees of unsaturation in the starting material.

Wait, wait, but wait: the cyclohexene ring has a double bond, which is one degree, and the ring itself is another. So that's two. Then the formyl group has a double bond (another one), and the vinyl substituent has its own double bond (another one). So total is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4? Wait, no, because the cyclohexene's ring counts as one and the double bond in the ring counts as another. So 2 from the ring, 1 from formyl, 1 from vinyl. So four in total.

So the starting material has four degrees of unsaturation.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, red phosphorus is often used as a catalyst for certain reactions. Wait, red phosphorus with HI—what reaction is that? Oh, I think it's the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen uses red phosphorus and HI to reduce ketones to alkanes. Wait, but wait, Clemmensen reduces ketones (or aldehydes) to CH₂ groups, right? Because it replaces the carbonyl group with a methylene group (CH₂). So in the starting material, there's a formyl group (CHO) and a vinyl group (CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond, but as a substituent). So the formyl group would be reduced. Let me think: the formyl group is a CHO attached to the cyclohexene ring.

Wait, so the starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the substituents are at 2 (CHO) and 5 (vinyl). The carboxylic acid group is at position 1 (since in the name, the substituents are numbered as 2 and 5, and the ring is cyclohexene, so position 3 is the double bond). So the carboxylic acid is at position 1.

Wait, but the
