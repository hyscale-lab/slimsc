Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length 'a'. When monochromatic light (wavelength Î») falls vertically on it, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. We need to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Oh wait, the problem says N is infinitely large, so essentially it's a circular aperture because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle. 

Wait, but wait, the question says N is infinitely large. So the shape becomes a circle. But I remember that for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a central bright spot with the first dark rings appearing at certain angles. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought for a circular aperture, the first minima (the first dark ring) occurs at a specific angle. But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, no, the first two minima after the central maximum would be the first and second minima. But wait, in a circular aperture, the first minimum is the first dark ring, and then the next minima occur at higher angles, but does the second minimum occur at a higher angle than the first?

Wait, no, in a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a series of rings. The central maximum is the brightest, then the first minimum is
