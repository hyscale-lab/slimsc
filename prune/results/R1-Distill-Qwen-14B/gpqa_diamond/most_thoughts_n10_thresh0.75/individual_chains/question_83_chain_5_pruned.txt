Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me think through how to approach this. I remember that when you titrate an acid with a base, the pH changes at different points, like at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Alright, let's start by understanding the problem. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So first, I need to figure out the concentration after dilution. Oh right, dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. 

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. The total volume after adding 20 cm³ water is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. And we need to find the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

Wait, what's 25% titration? I think that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So I need to find the volume of NaOH added when 25% of the acid is titrated.

First, let's find the moles of acetic acid after dilution. The volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L) and concentration 0.025 M. Moles = M * V = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol.

Wait, wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L is 0.001 mol. Oh wait, that's before dilution. After adding 20 cm³ water, the total volume is 40 cm³, so the concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Right, same as earlier.

So the initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) are 0.001 mol.

At 25% titration, 25% of this has reacted. So moles reacted = 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol.

Since NaOH reacts with CH3COOH in a 1:1 ratio (because the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O), the moles of NaOH needed for 25% titration is also 0.00025 mol.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³.

Wait, but maybe I don't need the actual volume right now. Let me think about the solution at 25%
