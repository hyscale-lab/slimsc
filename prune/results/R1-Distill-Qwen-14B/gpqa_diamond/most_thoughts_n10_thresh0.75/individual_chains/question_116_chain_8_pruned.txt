Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem is about a series of reactions starting with Compound A, then going through B, C, and ending with D. Then I have to identify D from the options given.

First, let's break down what's given about each compound.

Compound A has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm. I remember that in NMR, the integration (the numbers) tells us how many hydrogens are in that signal. So 6H and 4H.

The triplet at 0.9 ppm usually suggests something like a methyl group (CH3) next to a CH2 group. Because a triplet in that region is often a (CH3)2CH- group, maybe? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the triplet would come from neighboring two protons. So for example, if you have a CH3 group next to a CH2, that CH3 would be a triplet because each H in CH3 is next to two H in the adjacent CH2. But wait, in a diethyl ether situation? Or maybe it's a di-substituted something.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the splitting. The triplet would be for a group that's next to a group with two protons. So perhaps A has a structure where there are two methyl groups attached to a CH2.

Wait, but the triplet integrates to 6H. So, each of those H's must be in a group with three H, and two of them. Because 6 divided by 3 is 2. So maybe two (CH3) groups each attached to a CH2.

Wait, like maybe (CH3)2CH2? No, wait. Because if each CH3 is split by a CH2, and each CH3 gives a triplet, but wait, that would be the case if each CH3 is next to a CH2 that has two H's.

Wait, maybe it's a diethyl ether or something like that. Diethyl ether is (CH2CH3)2O. So the structure would be CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. Let's think about the NMR of that. The CH2CH3 groups in diethyl ether have their own splits.

In diethyl ether, the CH3 groups are attached to a CH2 which is next to an O. So the CH3 would be a triplet? Let me recall: in diethyl ether, the CH3 groups are next to a CH2. The CH2 group is split by the neighboring CH3. So the CH2 would be a quartet, and the CH3 would be a triplet.

Wait, but in the NMR given, the triplet is at 0.9 (CH3) and the quartet is at 1.3 (CH2). That fits with diethyl ether. Because in diethyl ether, the CH3 is around 1.2 ppm (I think) but maybe in this case it's 0.9, maybe because of the proximity to oxygen or something else. But let me think.

So, diethyl ether would have two CH2CH3 groups. The CH3 would be a triplet because each is adjacent to a CH2 with two H. The CH2 would be a quartet because each is adjacent to the CH3's three H. So the NMR would show a quartet integrating to 4H (the two CH2 groups) and a triplet integrating to 6H (the two CH3 groups). That matches exactly the description of compound A. So Compound A is diethyl ether: structure is (CH2CH3)2O.

But wait, wait. When diethyl ether undergoes monobromination, what happens? Because the next step is that compound A undergoes monobromination to form B. Monobromination would add a bromine somewhere.

But diethyl ether has two R-O-R groups. Brominating diethyl ether would involve substituting an oxygen with a bromine? Wait, no, wait. Wait, diethyl ether is (CH2CH3)2O. Monobromination would probably be a substitution where one of the ethyl groups is replaced by a bromo group. Wait, but how? Because diethyl ether is a good substrate for alkoxy group substitution, but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is not diethyl ether. Maybe I'm wrong about the structure. Let's think again.

The NMR of A: triplet (6H) at 0.9 ppm and quartet (4H) at 1.3 ppm. Another possibility is that A is 2,2-dimethylbutane or something like that. No, wait, wait. Wait, that might not have the right splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexane derivative, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, another thought: the triplet at 0.9 ppm is 6H, so perhaps two equivalent CH3 groups. The quartet at 1.3 is 4H, so that's two equivalent CH2 groups. So the structure could be something like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2
