Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let's think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? So it's probably describing some kind of surface. The question asks for the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Oh wait, I remember that pseudospheres are related to hyperbolic geometry. But wait, what's the metric for a pseudosphere?

Wait, I think the standard metric for a pseudosphere (which is a model of hyperbolic space) is usually written in terms of Poincaré coordinates or something like that. The Poincaré disk model, right? The metric for that is ds² = (4/(1 - x² - y²)²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think. In the Poincaré disk model, the radius of the disk is related to the curvature. Oh, and the metric is usually written as ds² = (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate in the disk. But wait, in the question, the metric given is in terms of x and y, so maybe it's expressed in Cartesian coordinates instead.

Let me compare the given metric to the standard Poincaré disk. The given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let's factor out the denominator. So 4 - x² - y² is like (4)(1 - (x² + y²)/4). Let me rewrite the metric as (32)/(4(1 - (x² + y²)/4)) * (dx² + dy²). Simplifying that, 32/4 is 8, so it becomes 8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4) (dx² + dy²).

Hmm, the standard Poincaré disk metric with radius R is ds² = [4/(1 - (x²+y²)/R²)] (dx² + dy²). So comparing, our given metric has 8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4) = 4 * [2/(1 - (x² + y²)/4)]. So the standard form is [4/(1 - (x² + y²)/R²)]... so in our case, the denominator is 1 - (x² + y²)/4, which would mean R² is 4, so R is 2. Oh, but our coefficient is 8 instead of 4. So our metric is 2 times the standard Poincaré metric. Wait, wait, let me recalculate.

Wait, the standard metric is (4/(1 - r²/R²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), but in Cartesian coordinates, maybe it's expressed as (4/(1 - (x² + y²)/R²)) (dx² + dy²). Because when you're in polar coordinates, r² = x² + y², so yeah.

So in our case, the given metric is:

(32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²) = [32/(4(1 - (x² + y²)/4))] (dx² + dy²) = [8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4)] (dx² + dy²).

So comparing this to the standard metric [4/(1 - (x² + y²)/R²)] (dx² + dy²), we see that our metric is 2 times bigger because 8 is twice 4. So what does that mean? The standard Poincaré metric has R=2 (since R²=4), but the coefficient is 4. In our case, it's 8, which is 4 * 2. So perhaps the curvature is different.

Wait, the curvature K of the Poincaré disk is -1/R². So if R=2, K would be -1/(2)^2 = -1/4. But wait, how does the coefficient in front affect curvature? Because the coefficient in the metric is related to the curvature. Let me think: the line element in 2D for a space of constant curvature K is ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 - K r²) when in polar coordinates. Wait, but in Poincaré coordinates, it's expressed differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the area is being asked, so maybe the area is a fixed multiple, irrespective of the coefficient? Or perhaps the scale factor affects the area.

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere (which is a model of hyperbolic space) doesn't have a finite area because it's infinitely large. But wait, the options include 'infinite'? Option D is +infty. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation gives a finite area.

Wait, wait. Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. The area of a pseudosphere is infinite. Because it's like a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. But wait, the options have 4π(x² + y²), which is a function of position, which doesn't make sense for an area. Option A is zero, which is not correct. Option B and C are similar but again depend on x and y, so they can't be the total area. So the only plausible option is D, which is infinity.

But wait, the given metric is a 2D metric, so the surface is 2-dimensional. The area would be the integral of the square root of the determinant of the metric times dx dy. Wait, no, the area element in 2D is sqrt(det g) dx dy. The determinant of the metric in this case is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] multiplied by (dx² + dy²) terms, but when you compute the determinant, it's just the product of the coefficients of dx² and dy² (since off-diagonal terms are zero). So determinant is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]^2.

Wait, no. The metric is diagonal, so the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))². So the area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy? Wait no, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy. But since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is (3
