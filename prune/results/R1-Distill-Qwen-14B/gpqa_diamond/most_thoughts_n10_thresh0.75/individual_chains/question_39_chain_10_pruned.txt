Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. They mention that when measuring the position, none of the particles were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So all the particles are between x=1 and x=3.

The question is to find the numerical value of 'a'. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay, so wave functions in quantum mechanics must satisfy the normalization condition. The integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. That's the normalization condition. But wait, here the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus a term with i. Oh wait, the wave function has a real part and an imaginary part. So the wave function must be complex.

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So it's a complex function. So when we compute the probability density, we need to compute the modulus squared, which is the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts. That's because |ψ|^2 = (Reψ)^2 + (Imψ)^2.

But wait a minute. In quantum mechanics, the wave
