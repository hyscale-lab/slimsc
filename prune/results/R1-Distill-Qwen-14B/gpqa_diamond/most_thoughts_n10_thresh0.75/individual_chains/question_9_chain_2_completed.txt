Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about molecular symmetry, specifically C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that C3h means there's a three-fold rotation axis combined with a mirror plane. Or wait, maybe it's a combination of rotation and reflection. Let me think.

The question gives four options: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone, and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. The options are labeled A to D.

So, each option is a different molecule, and I need to figure out which one has C3h symmetry. Let me think about each molecule one by one.

First, triisopropyl borate. I think this is a borate ester with three isopropyl groups attached to boron. Boron usually has a trigonal planar structure, so the molecule would be symmetric if all three substituents are the same. Isopropyl groups are symmetrical themselves. So, if all three are the same, the molecule should have a three-fold rotational symmetry. But wait, what about the mirror planes? Since all three substituents are identical and arranged symmetrically, the molecule should have a plane of symmetry as well. So C3h symmetry includes a rotation of 120 degrees and a mirror plane. Triisopropyl borate would have a three-fold rotation axis, but does it have a mirror plane? Because each isopropyl group is symmetric, maybe there are multiple mirror planes. So maybe it has higher symmetry, like D3h or something. Or perhaps just C3. Hmm, not sure yet.

Next, quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound, I think. It's a norbornane structure with an amine group. Its structure is like a bridge bicyclic system, probably with a three-membered bridge. So, the molecule's symmetry might be lower. Quinuclidine has a C3 axis because the bridge can rotate 120 degrees. But does it have a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis? If it does, then it would have C3h symmetry. Wait, I'm not too sure about quinuclidine's symmetry. Maybe it's only C3, not C3h. Or maybe it's C2v or something else. I'll need to think more.

Now, the third option is the benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. This sounds like a complex polycyclic structure. The name suggests three furan rings attached to a benzene ring. Let me try to visualize it. The numbering might be a bit tricky, but generally, such compounds have bridge structures. But I'm not sure about the symmetry here. Each substituent might not be the same, so maybe it doesn't have a three-fold symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the arrangement of the rings leads to a three-fold rotation. But I'm not certain.

The fourth option is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Triphenylene is a tricyclic structure, I think. If the molecule is a triphenylene fused with a trifuran, perhaps the arrangement is such that there are three substituents identical around a central point. That could allow for a three-fold rotation. But again, I'm not entirely sure about the specifics of the structure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the definitions again. C3h symmetry implies that the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, the molecule can be rotated 120 degrees about that axis and also has a mirror plane perpendicular to it.

Alternatively, sometimes the h in C3h refers to horizontal, so the mirror plane is perpendicular to the rotation axis. So, perhaps the molecule has a three-fold rotational axis, and at least one mirror plane perpendicular to it.

Triisopropyl borate: if the three isopropyl groups are arranged symmetrically around the boron, then any rotation by 120 degrees would leave the molecule the same. Also, since each isopropyl group is symmetrical, there should be a plane of symmetry. So maybe this molecule has C3h symmetry. Alternatively, if all three substituents are the same and symmetric, it might have higher symmetry than C3h.

Quinuclidine: I think it has a bridge structure, so the molecule is more symmetric in some planes. Wait, quinuclidine has a three-membered bridge, so when you look at the molecule, perhaps it's trigonal symmetric. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a C3 axis but no mirror planes. Or does it have a plane of symmetry? If it's a bridge structure, maybe it's symmetrical across a plane. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

The other two options, the benzo and triphenyleno ones. Benzo[...]trifuran: maybe the arrangement is such that there's three similar substituents. For example, if the benzo ring is connected in a way that creates three identical substituents around a central point, leading to a three-fold symmetry. Alternatively, if all three furan rings are the same and arranged symmetrically, that would give a three-fold rotation. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, I think I remember that triisopropyl borane (without the ester) is a trigonal planar molecule with three isopropyl groups, which would indeed have C3h symmetry. Because each isopropyl is symmetric, and the molecule has a three-fold axis with mirror planes. So triisopropyl borate (which is the same structure with boron connected to three O-R groups) should also have C3h symmetry.

But let me double-check. The borate would have the three isopropyl groups in a trigonal planar arrangement around the boron. Since each isopropyl is symmetric, the molecule would have three-fold rotational symmetry. Also, there should be a plane of symmetry, perhaps through the boron and each isopropyl group. So yes, that would give C3h symmetry.

Quinuclidine: I think its structure is such that it's a bicyclic molecule with a bridge. The molecule has a three-membered ring, and perhaps the bridge leads to a three-fold symmetry. But I'm not sure about the mirror planes. Wait, quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane derivative. The molecule is symmetric but I'm not certain if it has a mirror plane. Maybe it does, which would give it C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine has a higher symmetry. Maybe it's C2v, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: which of these molecules is known to have C3h symmetry? Triisopropyl borate is a classic example. Quinuclidine is a known molecule, but I think it has a three-fold axis but perhaps only C3 symmetry, not C3h. Or maybe it's C2 symmetry. I'm not quite recalling.

Alternatively, benzo[...]trifuran and triphenyleno [...]trifuran. Hmm, those names suggest that the furan rings are attached in a way that there are three substituents on a central ring. So, perhaps the benzo group is connected to a central ring which is connected to three furan rings in a symmetric fashion. If the three furan substituents are identical and arranged symmetrically, that would give a three-fold axis and a mirror plane, leading to C3h.

Wait, but the benzo ring is a single substituent. So perhaps the structure is more like a benzene ring connected to a central ring that has three furan substituents. No, the name is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran. So perhaps it's a benzene ring fused to three furan rings, which might create a structure with three substituents around a central point, leading to a three-fold symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the central part is a cyclopropane or a three-membered ring. Wait, no, it's a trifuran, which is a tricyclic system. Hmm, I'm not entirely certain. Maybe the molecule is more symmetric than I thought.

But back to the options. The question is which of the four has C3h symmetry.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. If I think that's correct, then the answer is C. But I should make sure.

Wait, looking up some notes: C3h symmetry is present when a molecule has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, the molecule looks the same after a 120-degree rotation and also reflects across that plane.

Triisopropyl borate: three identical groups (isopropyl) around a central boron. So, a three-fold rotation axis exists. Does a mirror plane exist? Yes, because each isopropyl is symmetric, and you can have a plane that bisects the molecule through boron and between two isopropyl groups. So yes, C3h.

Quinuclidine: I think it has a three-fold rotation axis. Let me recall. Quinuclidine has a structure where the molecule is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane with a nitrogen in the bridge. Wait, no, the structure is more like a norbornane-like structure. Wait, norbornane is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. Quinuclidine is similar but with the bridge being a pyrrolidine, I think. But the point is, the molecule has a three-membered ring. Now, does it have a mirror plane? I think it does, because the molecule is symmetrical across a plane that cuts through the bridge and the opposite side. So perhaps quinuclidine also has C3h symmetry.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine has C2 symmetry because of the positions of the bridge.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps triphenyleno [...]trifuran is the correct choice. Because triphenylene is a molecule with three phenyl groups arranged symmetrically on a central ring. If the trifuran is attached in a way that the three substituents are identical and symmetric, then that would give C3h symmetry.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each compound's structure.

Triisopropyl borate: yes, it's a trigonal planar molecule with three isopropyl groups. So it definitely has a three-fold axis. Does it have a mirror plane? Yes, because each isopropyl is symmetric, so a plane through B and the middle of each isopropyl would be a mirror plane. So C3h symmetry.

Quinuclidine: another approach. The structure of quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane with a bridge. The molecule is symmetric, but perhaps only has a two-fold axis. If the molecule can be rotated 180 degrees but not 120, then it's not C3h. Alternatively, perhaps it has a three-fold axis but no mirror plane.

Wait, I think quinuclidine has a three-fold rotational symmetry. Because the bridge has three sides. So rotation by 120 degrees would map equivalent parts. But does it have a mirror plane? If I imagine the molecule, perhaps looking along the three-fold axis, the structure is symmetric across the plane that bisects the bridge. So maybe it does have a mirror plane, leading to C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe it doesn't. I'm not too sure, but I think triisopropyl borate is a safer bet.

The other two options are more complex. The benzo and triphenylene ones. I'm not as familiar with their structures. But perhaps the triphenylene one has three substituents in a symmetric arrangement, leading to C3h. For example, if triphenylene is attached to a central ring with three identical groups, then yes.

Wait, triphenylene itself is a triphenyl structure, but when combined with the trifuran, perhaps the arrangement is such that three substituents are identical and arranged symmetrically, leading to C3h.

Alternatively, if the substituents are different, then no C3h.

Hmm, but without seeing the structures, it's tough. So perhaps I should think of which of these compounds is a known example of C3h symmetry.

Triisopropyl borate is a standard example with C3h symmetry. Quinuclidine, I'm not so sure. The benzo and triphenyleno might not have three identical substituents.

So the answer is option C: triisopropyl borate.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h symmetry**, we analyze the given options based on their structures and symmetry properties. **C₃h symmetry** implies the presence of a three-fold rotational axis (120° rotation) and at least one horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to this axis.

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule is a complex polycyclic structure with a triphenylene fused to a trifuran system. While the arrangement of the fused rings might suggest some symmetry, the presence of three identical substituents arranged symmetrically around a central point is unclear. Without explicit structural details, it is uncertain whether this molecule has **C₃h symmetry**.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule also features a polycyclic structure with a benzene ring fused to a trifuran system. The symmetry depends on the arrangement of the substituents. However, the inclusion of a benzene ring and the specific fusion pattern likely disrupts the required three-fold rotational symmetry and horizontal mirror plane for **C₃h symmetry**.

### Option C: Triisopropyl borate  
This molecule consists of a boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups in a trigonal planar arrangement. The three isopropyl groups are symmetric, and the molecule has a clear three-fold rotational axis (120° rotation). Additionally, there are mirror planes perpendicular to the three-fold axis, making this molecule a classic example of **C₃h symmetry**.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound with a norbornane-like structure and a nitrogen atom in the bridge. While it has a three-fold rotational axis due to the symmetry of the bridge, the presence of a horizontal mirror plane is questionable. The specific geometry of the molecule suggests it may only have **C₃ symmetry**, not **C₃h symmetry**.

### Conclusion  
Among the options, **triisopropyl borate** is the only molecule that clearly exhibits **C₃h symmetry** due to its three-fold rotational axis and horizontal mirror planes. The other molecules either lack sufficient symmetry or have structural features that disrupt the required symmetry.

**Answer: C**
