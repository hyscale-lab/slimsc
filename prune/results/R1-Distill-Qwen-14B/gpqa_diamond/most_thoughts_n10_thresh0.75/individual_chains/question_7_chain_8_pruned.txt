Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with CMB photons. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking at what energy the gamma-rays' lifetime in the universe is limited by the process γγ → e+ e−. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV.

Wait, I remember that processes like this are related to photon-photon interactions. So, the gamma-ray photons are annihilating with the CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. This must be about the interaction rate and how that affects the lifetime of the gamma-rays.

I think the key here is to find the energy where the mean free path of the gamma-ray equals the size of the universe, but I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, the mean lifetime is when the probability of interaction becomes significant enough that they can't travel far. So, the condition is probably that the interaction cross-section multiplied by the number of target photons is about 1. That's like the optical depth being around 1.

The cross-section for two-photon annihilation into e+ e− is given by the Klein-Nishina formula or maybe the more general formula. But wait, Klein-Nishina is for photon-electron scattering, not photon-photon. Oh right, that's different. For photon-photon interactions, the cross-section is probably proportional to (E^2) / (m_e^2 c^4) or something like that. Wait, I think the cross-section for γγ → e+ e− is on the order of (σ ~ (4π/3) (E_γ^2)/(m_e^2 c^4) ) * something. Wait, let me think more clearly.

The cross-section for two photons creating an electron-positron pair depends on both photon energies. Since the CMB photons are much lower energy, we can approximate one photon's energy as E and the other as E_cm (CMB photon energy), which is about 1e-3 eV. So E_cm is much smaller than E, the gamma-ray energy.

The cross-section formula for γγ → e+ e− is given by σ = (4π/3) * (E1 * E2) / (m_e^2 c^4) * (1 + cos²θ) where θ is the angle between the photons. But since we're considering isotropic CMB photons, the average value of (1 + cos²θ) is 2/3. So the average cross-section becomes σ ≈ (4π/3) * (E1 E2) / (m_e^2 c^4) * (2/3) ) = (8π/9) * (E1 E2) / (m_e^2 c^4).

Wait, but wait. For the case where E1 >> E2 (since E is high energy gamma and E2 is ~1e-3 eV), the cross-section simplifies. So maybe it's σ ≈ (4π/3) (E1 E2) / (m_e^2 c^4) * something. Alternatively, I've heard that the cross-section for photon-photon pair production is σ ~ (E_γ)^2 / (m_e^2 c
