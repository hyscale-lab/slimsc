Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question gives a compound with molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and then the compound undergoes a series of reactions. I need to figure out what the final product is, given the options.

First, I'll start by looking at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's see, the degrees of unsaturation can help. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9)/2 = 9/2=4.5. Hmm, that seems off because degrees of unsaturation should be an integer. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate: 2*8 +2 is 18. 18 minus H (9) is 9. Plus N which is 1 (since N counts as -1?), wait. Wait, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, X is 0 here. So 2*8+2=18. 18-9=9. 9+1 (N is +1? Or is it considered as a Halogen? Wait, no. Wait, in the formula, N is treated as +1. So, the formula becomes (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So, 5 degrees of unsaturation. That makes more sense.

5 degrees can be from a ring and a double bond, or a ring and two double bonds, etc. Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm: a triplet (t), 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So, an aldehyde group is present.

- 6.98 ppm: doublet, 2H. Maybe aromatic protons, perhaps in a para-substituted benzene ring. Like two protons ortho to a substituent.

- 6.51 ppm: another doublet, 2H. Maybe another aromatic ring, or perhaps part of a conjugated system. Wait, but the integration is 2H each, so maybe two separate aromatic rings, each with two protons.

Wait, but the molecule is C8H9NO. Let me think about possible structures. The NMR shows an aldehyde (so a CHO group), and two sets of aromatic protons. Also, there's a 3.66 ppm doublet (d) for 2H. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, maybe an oxygen. Like an OCH2 group or something similar. And a broad singlet at 6.27 ppm for 2H. That could be an enol proton, maybe in an alpha position to a carbonyl group.

So putting this together, perhaps the molecule is an aromatic aldehyde with substituents. Let me think: maybe a benzaldehyde derivative with another aromatic ring attached, and some substituents.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's see, if it's a benzaldehyde (C7H6O) plus something else. Wait, wait, but let me count the carbons. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. But the formula here is C8H9NO. So, maybe there's another group attached to the benzene ring. Like, perhaps a side chain that includes the aldehyde and another benzene or something else.

Alternatively, maybe it's something like a di-substituted benzaldehyde, but I'm not sure. Let me consider the NMR again.

The 9.72 ppm triplet suggests that the aldehyde proton is next to another proton. Wait, aldehydes usually have a singlet because they are at the end. Unless, perhaps, it's in a conjugated system or part of a coupling. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol tautomer, but that usually appears as a broad peak, so the triplet might not fit that.

Wait, maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde. So, the aldehyde is conjugated with a double bond. That could lead to coupling with adjacent protons. So, if the structure is R-CH2-CHO, no, that wouldn't have a triplet. Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system, like CH2=CH-CHO. Hmm, but I'm not sure how that would split.

Alternatively, looking at the 3.66 ppm doublet (2H). That could be a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen. Like O-CH2-C. Maybe a CH2 connected to an oxygen and another carbon. So perhaps it's a structure where the aldehyde is part of a chain with an oxygen-bearing CH2 group.

Wait, another approach: let's try to sketch the possible structure. The aldehyde is at 9.72 ppm. Then, the aromatic signals: 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H) suggest two sets of doublets, each 2H. That looks like a para-substituted benzene, perhaps. So maybe a biphenyl structure.

Wait, the integration is 2H for each of the aromatic signals. So perhaps there are two separate benzene rings with two protons each. Hmm, but that seems a bit strange. Alternatively, perhaps it's a single benzene ring with substituents causing these signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a diphenyl compound, where each ring is attached to another part of the molecule. Let me think. For example, a benzaldehyde with another benzene ring attached via a side chain.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me consider possible functional groups. We have an aldehyde (CHO), which is O-containing. Then, perhaps an oxygen elsewhere, like a hydroxyl group or an ether.

Looking at the NMR, the 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) could be a pair of protons that are in an environment like an enol, perhaps part of a conjugated system. Or maybe it's a diol or something else.

Wait, another point: the 3.66 ppm doublet (2H) is likely an OCH2 group. So, perhaps the structure has a CH2 connected to an oxygen and another group.

Putting it all together: maybe the starting compound is a benzaldehyde with a side chain that includes a CH
