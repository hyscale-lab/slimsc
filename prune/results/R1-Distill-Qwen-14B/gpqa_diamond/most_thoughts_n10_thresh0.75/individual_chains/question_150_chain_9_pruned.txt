Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR questions can be tricky. But let's take it step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, calculating the degree of unsaturation might help. For C8H9NO: each degree is a ring or a double bond. The formula is CnHmOxN. The general formula for degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m -x)/2. So here, n=8, m=9, O=1, N=1.

So plug in: (2*8 +2 -9 -1 -1)/2 → (18-11)/2 = 7/2? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the correct formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Because each N contributes like a CH unit. Oh right, because nitrogen is similar to CH in some ways.

So, C=8, H=9, X=0, N=1.

So (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 → (18 -9 +1)/2 → 10/2 =5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (3 double bonds, so 3 degrees), a double bond (another degree), and an amine or something else. Wait, but the molecular formula has an N, so perhaps an aromatic ring with substituents including an amine or something.

Wait, wait. Wait, the NMR data: 9.72 ppm as a triplet (t, 1H). That's a high chemical shift, likely an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe it's an aldehyde group.

Looking at the other signals: 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because the two doublets, each integrating for 2H, probably corresponding to two substituents in the para positions. Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene, each set of protons would be a doublet? Or maybe it's a meta substitution? Wait, no, para would have two equivalent protons across from each other. So, for example, if it's 4-substituted, the protons on the ring would be in pairs, each as doublets. So that suggests maybe two phenyl groups attached, each para to something.

Wait, but the molecule is C8H9NO. If there are two phenyl rings, that's C12H10, but that's way more than C8. So no, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, wait, perhaps one phenyl group and another substituent.

Let me recount the formula. C8H9NO: perhaps one phenyl group (C6H5) attached to a C2H4NO group? Or perhaps it's something else.

Looking back at the NMR: the
