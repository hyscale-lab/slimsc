Okay, so I've got this Lagrangian here, and I need to find the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ. Then, I have to determine whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let's see. I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of a coupling constant depends on the terms in the Lagrangian.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. Right, those are the antisymmetric products of gamma matrices, which I think are related to the spinor representation of angular momentum or something like that.

So, to find the mass dimension of κ, I should probably figure out the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has to have mass dimension [L]_M = 4 because in 4 spacetime dimensions, the action is dimensionless, and the integral over d^4x (which has dimension [L]^4) means each term inside must be dimensionless. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 because when you integrate it over four dimensions (each with dimension 1), the action is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So, let's break down L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν} into its components.

First, let's find the mass dimensions of each field and coupling.

The ψ fields are Dirac spinors. I remember that a Dirac spinor has mass dimension 3/2 in 4D spacetime. Because the Dirac equation is (i γ^μ ∂_μ - m)ψ = 0. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1, so the term i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ must have the same dimension as m ψ. The mass term m ψ must have dimension [m] + 3/2, since ψ is 3/2. The other term i γ ∂ ψ has dimension (1) + 3/2 = 5/2. Wait, but for the equation to hold dimensionally, both terms must have the same dimension. So, m ψ must have dimension 5/2
