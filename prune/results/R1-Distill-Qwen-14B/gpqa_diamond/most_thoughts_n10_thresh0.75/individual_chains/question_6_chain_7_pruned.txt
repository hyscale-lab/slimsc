Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the energy spectrum of a particle in a given potential. Alright, let's break it down step by step.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, I remember that in two dimensions, polar coordinates are often used. So the potential depends on both r and θ, but maybe I can separate variables or find a way to express this in terms of simpler potentials.

Wait, I think this potential might be separable. Let me see. The first term is (1/2)kr², which looks like a harmonic oscillator in r. The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Cos squared of theta can be written using a double-angle identity. Oh right, cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr²*(1 + cos2θ)/2.

Let me compute that. (3/2)*(1/2) is 3/4, so:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ.

Wait, combining the terms without cosθ, 1/2 plus 3/4 is 5/4. So V(r,θ) = (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ.

Hmm, that doesn't immediately ring a bell, but maybe I can write this as a sum of two potentials. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a coordinate transformation that simplifies the problem.

Wait, another approach: since the potential has terms in cos2θ, maybe it's better to switch to a coordinate system that can separate variables more easily. Or perhaps I can rewrite the potential in terms of new coordinates.

Wait, I recall that in certain potentials with angular dependence, you can use a shift in the angular variable. For instance, sometimes you can express things in terms of cos(2θ) as a new variable, say, φ. But I'm not sure if that's the right path here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about this as a perturbation. But wait, the problem asks for the energy spectrum, so maybe this is a problem with a separable solution, and the energy levels can be found exactly.

Wait another thought: the potential V(r,θ) can be written as a sum of two terms: (1/2)kr² and (3/2)kr²
