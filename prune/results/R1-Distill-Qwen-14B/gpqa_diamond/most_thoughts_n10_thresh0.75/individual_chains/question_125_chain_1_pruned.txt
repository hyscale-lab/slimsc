Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r². I remember that in such a system, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, n_z for each direction, or maybe it's easier to think in terms of the total quantum number n, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Oh wait, wait—no, actually in 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are degenerate and depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.

Wait, right. For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = ħω(n + 3/2), where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers: n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Each of n_x, n_y, n_z can be 0,1,2,... and so on.

The question is asking for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy.

Wait, what's the ground state and excited states here? The ground state is the lowest energy. So the ground state would have n = 0 (since each quantum number is 0, right? So n_x=0, n_y=0, n_z=0. Sum is 0. So E = (0 + 3/2)
