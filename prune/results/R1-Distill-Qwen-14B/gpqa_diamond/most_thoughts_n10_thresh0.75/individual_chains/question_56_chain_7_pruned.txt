Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy levels. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says that the |3,0,0> state decays to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions between energy levels are governed by the selection rules.

Wait, dipole transitions... Oh right, the selection rules for electric dipole transitions say that the angular momentum quantum number l changes by ±1. So Δl = ±1. Also, the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0, ±1. Oh, and the principal quantum number n can change by any integer, but there are other considerations like the energy levels.

So the initial state is |3,0,0>. The final state is |1,0,0>. That means the state goes from n=3 to n=1, which is a change of Δn = -2. Since each dipole transition only allows Δn = ±1, I think it must go through an intermediate state. Like, from 3 to 2, then 2 to 1. So two transitions.

Looking at the options, options A and D have the transition 3→2→1. Options B and C go through 2,1,1 or 2,1,-1.

Wait, what about the angular momentum? The initial state has l=0 (s orbital), so the first transition must go to l=1. Because l can only change by ±1. So from l=0 → l=1. Then in the second step, l=1 must go to l=0 because the final state has l=0. So that's allowed.

So the intermediate state must have l=1. Which means the state in the first step is |2,1,m>, where m can be -1, 0, or +1. Because when you have l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1.

But wait, the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m>—what are the allowed m changes? The selection rule for m is Δm = 0, ±1. So from m=0 to m=0, +1, or -1. But wait, the initial state has m=0, so the first transition can go to m= -1, 0, or +1.

So possible intermediate states after first transition are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1,+1>.

Now, let's think about the second transition. The intermediate state must go to |1,0,0>. So from l=1 to l=0. So the second transition is from l=1 to l=0. So for the second transition, the state |2,1,m> must go to |1,0,0>.

Wait, but the final state is |1,0,0> which has m=0. So the second transition must have Δm = -m_initial. So from m = some value, to m=0. So Δm can be 0, ±1.

For example, if the first transition leads to
