Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame.

Wait, I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up simply. Like, if something is moving in the same direction as the light, you can't just say their speeds add. Oh right, that's the velocity addition formula from special relativity. But wait, does that apply here? Because this isn't about the speed of light itself but the speed in a medium.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is given by c/n, right? So in the glass, the speed is v_glass = c/n. But the glass is moving. So, how does the motion of the glass affect the observed speed of the light?

Oh right, in the lab frame, the glass is moving, so the light's speed as observed in the lab would depend on that motion. I think this is a case where we need to apply the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about the speed of light in the glass from the lab's perspective. So the glass is moving at velocity v. The speed of light in the glass is c/n, but that's in the glass's frame. So we need to transform that speed into the
