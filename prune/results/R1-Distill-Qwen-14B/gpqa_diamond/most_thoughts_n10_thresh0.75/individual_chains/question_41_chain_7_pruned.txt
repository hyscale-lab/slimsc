Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about the speed of light in a moving medium, right? Hmm. I remember something about how when a medium is moving, it might affect the speed of light observed. Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

So, the setup is: a glass with index of refraction n is moving at a constant velocity v. The light beam is propagating through the glass in the same direction as the glass's motion, towards the observer. The question is, what's the speed of the light relative to the observer in the lab frame?

Wait, I think this is related to the Doppler effect or maybe the addition of velocities in special relativity. Oh, but wait, the speed of light is always c in a vacuum, but in a medium like glass, it's slower. Oh, right, in a medium with refractive index n, the speed is c/n. But wait, in this case, the glass is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: in the frame of the glass, the light is moving at c/n. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So how do we find the speed of the light in the lab frame?

I remember that velocities don't just add linearly in relativity. Oh wait, but in this case, the glass is moving at velocity v, so maybe we can use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Right, because the glass is part of the medium, and the light's velocity in the glass's frame is c/n. Then, to
