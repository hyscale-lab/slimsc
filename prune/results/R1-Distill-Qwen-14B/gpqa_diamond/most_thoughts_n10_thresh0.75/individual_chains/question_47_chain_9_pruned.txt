Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. I need to figure out which compound C9H11NO2 corresponds to based on the given spectral data. Let's see. The options are A, B, C, D. I remember that IR and NMR spectra can tell us a lot about the structure. Let me think through each part.

First, the IR data. It shows strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually indicative of N-H stretches, like in amines or amides. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group (C=O). So, the compound probably has an amide or ester group, maybe a ketone, but considering the other data, more likely an ester or amide.

Looking at the 1H NMR now. The peaks are:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H – that's likely a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl ester. Because a triplet with 3H usually comes from a CH3 attached to a CH2 which is next to something else, like an oxygen in an ester.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H – this could be an OCH2 group, maybe part of an ethoxy group or an amide. Wait, but ethoxy is usually around 1-1.5 ppm. Oh wait, no, ethoxy is the CH2CH3 part. The OCH2 would be around 3-4 ppm. Alternatively, could this be NH2 protons? But no, because amines are usually broader, but in this case, it's a singlet at 4 ppm. Hmm.

4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H – quartet suggests it's next to a CH2. If the ethyl ester's OCH2CH3 is split into a quartet on the adjacent CH2, but wait, the quartet is at 4.5, which is higher. So maybe it's an acetylamino group or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 connected to another CH2 group, like in an ester.

Then 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, each a doublet with 2H. That looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. The 7.0 is probably the para positions with substituents. Wait, but in para substitution, the protons are usually more downfield if there's an electron-withdrawing group. So 8.0 ppm is quite downfield. Maybe it's an amide or an ester group attached to the benzene.

Let me think about each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. The benzamide would have an amide group (CONH2?), but wait, benzamide is usually Ar-CONH2. The IR would show strong N-H stretches for amide, which fits the IR data. The NMR would have the ethoxy as triplet at ~1.2 ppm. The OCH2CH3 would be around 4.0-4.2 as a quartet, maybe. Wait, in ethoxy, the OCH2CH3 would cause the CH2 to be around 4.0 as a quartet. But looking at the NMR, there's a triplet at 1.2 (CH3), and a quartet at 4.5 (OCH2). Wait, no, the quartet is at 4.5, so maybe that's the OCH2 connected to something else. Alternatively, if it's ethoxy, the quartet would be for the OCH2, but then the NMR shows a quartet at 4.5 and a triplet at 1.2. So the triplet is the CH3, and the quartet is the adjacent CH2.

But wait, in ethoxy, the OCH2CH3 would have the CH2 as quartet around 4.1 or so, and the CH3 as triplet around 1.2. So that fits. Then the aromatic region. Benzamide would have substituents. If it's 3-ethoxy, then the amide is at position 1, ethoxy at position 3. So the substitution would be para to each other? Or wait, 3-ethoxy on benzamide. The benzamide is Ar-CONH2. So the substituents are at positions 1 (CONH2) and 3 (ethoxy). Then, the aromatic protons would be in the ortho and para positions. But for a para-substituted benzene, the protons are typically at around 7.5 or so. Wait, but the given NMR shows 7.0 and 8.0. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in the para positions
