Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The question is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions. There are four steps, each converting one compound to the next. Then there are some hints, and multiple-choice options. Alright, let's break it down.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints given are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

Let me think about each part.

Starting with the first reaction: A + HCN → B. HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups. So if A is a ketone or aldehyde, reacting with HCN would form a cyanohydrin. But wait, HCN adds to ketones via a nucleophilic addition, forming a cyanohydrin which is a secondary alcohol with a CN group attached. Alternatively, maybe A is an ester or another carbonyl compound. But considering the next steps, let me think about what B becomes.

The second step is B → C via hydrogenation with H2 and Pd. Since H2 and Pd are usually used for hydrogenation reactions, perhaps B has a triple bond or a double bond that gets hydrogenated. Wait, but B is the product of A + HCN. So if A is a ketone, B would be a cyanohydrin (with an OH and CN group attached to adjacent carbons). But then, when you hydrogenate that, you might reduce the CN group. Wait, but hydrogenation of nitriles typically gives amines, but under certain conditions like with H2 and a catalyst, maybe it's a different pathway.

Alternatively, maybe A isn't a ketone. Another possibility is that A is a cyclic ketone, maybe a cyclo
