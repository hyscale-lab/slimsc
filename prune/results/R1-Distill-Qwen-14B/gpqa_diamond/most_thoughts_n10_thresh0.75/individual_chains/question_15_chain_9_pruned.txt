Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our perspective, causing a dip in brightness. But wait, the probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance.

The question says both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3. Also, the host stars have the same radius, but Planet_1's star is more massive. Wait, but same radius? So the size of the star isn't changing between the two systems.

I think the probability of a transit depends on the size of the star and the planet, and the orbital distance. The formula I vaguely remember is something like the probability (P) is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (a / R_star), where a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. Or wait, maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a), or perhaps it's (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/a) ? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, I think the transit probability equation is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) / (1 + ... something with the orbital distance). No, wait, another approach. The probability that a planet transits is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (1 + (a/(R_s)))) ? Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / sqrt(a^2 + ...))? I'm not entirely sure, but I think the main factors are the planet's size relative to the star and the orbital distance.

Wait, another thought: the transit probability is higher when the orbital plane is more likely to align with our line of sight. The probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a/R_s)), but I'm not confident. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) where e is the eccentricity. But wait, the question states that the orbits are circular, so e is zero. So that part might not matter.

Alternatively, the probability might be calculated as (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a)), but scaled by some factors. Hmm, perhaps the key is the ratio of the star's size to the semi-major axis.

Wait, let me think: the transit probability formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / (a * sqrt(1 - e²))) ). But since e is zero, it's (R_p² / R_s²) * (R_s / a) ) = (R_p² * R_s) / ( a * R_s^2 ) ) = (R_p² )/( a R_s ). So P is proportional to (R_p^2) / (a * R_s) ), but wait, that might be in some specific context. Or maybe the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1/(a/R_s)) ), which would be (R_p² / R_s²) * (R_s / a) ) = R_p² R_s / (R_s^2 a) ) = R_p²/( R_s a )

Wait, maybe I should look up the formula, but since I can't, I'll proceed with the best I remember. The formula is often given as:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 + (a/R_s))) )

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, since the orbital period is involved, maybe Kepler's third law comes into play to relate the period and the semi-major axis.

Wait, Kepler's third law states that (a^3)/(P^2) = (G(M_s + M_p)) / (4π²). But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_p
