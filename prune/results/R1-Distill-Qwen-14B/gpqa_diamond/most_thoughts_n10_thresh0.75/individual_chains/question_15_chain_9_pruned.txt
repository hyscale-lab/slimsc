Okay, so I've got this question about transiting planets, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. They've already detected these planets using the radial velocity (RV) method, so they know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass. Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits. The host stars have the same radii: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star.

The options are about which planet has a higher probability of transiting, and by how much. So the question is about calculating the transit probability for each planet and choosing the higher one.

Hmm, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, as well as the size of the orbit. Wait, no, more specifically, the geometric probability of a transit is given by the formula (R_p / a) * (1/(R_*) ), but I might be mixing up the exact formula. Or wait, another way: the probability is approximately (R_p / a) * (R_* / a), no, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the transit probability is actually (R_p / a) * (R_*) / (R_* + R_p) ) or something like that. No, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is roughly (R_* + R_p) / a, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability (P) for a planet is given by the formula P = (R_p / a) * (R_* + R_p) ). Wait, no, I think that's not right. I think I should look it up, but since I can't, I'll think about it logically.

The transit happens when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to our line of sight. The probability of that alignment is higher for planets that are closer to their stars because their orbits are smaller, so the chance that their orbital plane is aligned in the right way is higher. Wait, no, actually, the probability is higher for planets with smaller orbital distances because their orbits are more likely to
