Alright, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step.

Okay, the question is about the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet_4 and Planet_2. The planets are in orbital resonance with periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So each planet's period is a multiple of the first one. Hmm, but wait, the exact order matters. Let me list them out:

Planet_1: period P

Planet_2: 2P

Planet_3: 2.5P

Planet_4: 3.5P

Planet_5: 5P

So each subsequent planet has a period that's a multiple as given. Now, the question is about equilibrium temperature ratio, specifically T4 over T2.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and its albedo. The formula I think is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A)/sigma )^1/4, but wait, alternatively, more commonly, the formula is T = T_eff * ( L / (16 pi sigma a² (1 - A) ) )^(1/4), but maybe I should think in terms of the inverse square law.

Wait, another approach: The equilibrium temperature (T) of a planet is given by T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)), but that might not account for all factors. Alternatively, I recall the formula as T = T_earth * ( (L / L_sun) / (a / AU)^2 )^(1/4) * ( (1 - A) / (1 - A_earth) )^(1/4) ), but in this problem, all planets have the same albedo, so that part cancels out. So the main factors are the luminosity of the star and the orbital distance.

Wait, but since all planets are orbiting the same star, L is the same for all. So the ratio of temperatures would depend on the square root of the inverse of the ratio of their semi-major axes.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is T = ( ( L (1 - A) ) / (16 pi sigma a²) )^(1/4). So when A (albedo) is the same for all, the term (1-A) is constant.
