Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question starts by describing compound A. It has a proton NMR spectrum with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm integrating for 4H. Hmm, NMR signals can tell me about the structure. Let me think about what these signals mean.

A triplet usually comes from coupling with two neighboring protons. The 6H at 0.9 ppm sounds like a CH3 group adjacent to another CH2. Because if each of the two protons in the adjacent group splits the signal into a triplet (n+1 rule), but wait, 6H would mean three equivalent CH3 groups. But wait, no, maybe it's one CH3 attached to a CH2, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think differently.

The quartet at 1.3 ppm with 4H—quartet suggests coupling with three neighboring protons (n+1, so 3+1=4). 4H could be a CH2 next to a CH3, because each proton in the CH2 would couple with three H's from the CH3. So that would split into a quartet. Wait, no, wait. If the CH2 is next to a CH3, each H in the CH2 would have three neighboring H's from the CH3. So each H in the CH2 would show as a quartet. Since the CH2 has two Hs, their signal would be a quartet. But wait, 4H in the quartet—so maybe it's a CH2 group split into a quartet, contributing 2H, but that doesn't add up to 4H. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong.

Alternatively, the quartet could be a CH2
