Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember that black holes have something called entropy, and it's related to their area. Oh right! There's this formula from the theory of black holes where entropy S is proportional to the area of the event horizon divided by the gravitational constant and the speed of light squared. The formula is S = A/(4 l_p^2), where A is the area and l_p is the Planck length. But wait, I think that's the basic idea. Let me think about the steps I need to take to solve this problem.

The problem gives me the angular size θ of the event horizon as 10^-17 degrees, and the distance d is 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the entropy's order of magnitude. So I guess I have to calculate the area of the event horizon first, then use that to find the entropy.

Let me start by recalling the formula for the angular size. The angular size θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the diameter of the object divided by the distance to the object, when the distance is much larger than the object's size. So θ ≈ diameter / d. But wait, θ is given in degrees and I need to convert it to radians because the formula uses radians.

First, convert θ from degrees to radians. Since 1 degree is π/180 radians, θ in radians is 10^-17 * π/180. Let me calculate that. 10^-17 degrees times π/(180) is approximately 1.745e-19 radians. But maybe I can approximate it as (10^-17) * (π/(180)) ≈ (10^-17) * (1e-2) → approx 1e-19 radians. Wait, π is about 3.14, so 3.14/(180) is roughly 0.01745. So 1e-17 * 0.01745 is about 1.745e-19 radians. Yeah, that's right.

So θ = 1.745e-19 radians.

Now, the formula says θ ≈ diameter / d. So the diameter D of the event horizon would be θ * d. Wait, but diameter is twice the radius, and the event horizon radius for a black hole is the Schwarzschild radius, R = 2GM/c². But maybe I don't need that right now.

Wait, but for a black hole, the event horizon's radius is R = (2 G M c^2)^(-1) * M, wait no, the Schwarzschild radius is R_s = (2 G M) / c². So R_s = 2 G M / c². And the area is 4 π R_s².

But perhaps I can find the area from the angular size. Since θ = D/(d), where D is the diameter. So D = θ * d. Then, the radius R is D/2 = θ d /2.

But wait, the Schwarzschild radius is R_s = 2 G M / c². So the area of the event horizon
