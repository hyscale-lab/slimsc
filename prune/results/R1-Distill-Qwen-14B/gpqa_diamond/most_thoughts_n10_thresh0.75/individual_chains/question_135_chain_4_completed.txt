Okay, so I have this physics problem about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think this describes the interaction where the boson X couples to fermions. 

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and I need to find which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order. The options are A to D, each listing different fermion pairs.

First, I remember that in particle physics, a boson can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if the mass of the boson is greater than twice the mass of the fermion. Because when a particle decays, it has to have enough energy (mass) to produce the daughter particles. So, the mass of X (6 GeV) must be greater than 2m_fermion for each possible fermion f.

Let me list the fermion masses. I think the masses of the known fermions are:

- Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): around 0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): about 1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~0.003 GeV (but up and down are light, maybe even lighter)
- Down quark (d): similar to u, maybe 0.004 GeV?
- Strange (s): around 0.095 GeV
- Charm (c): ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom (b): about 4.13 GeV
- Top (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV. But our X is only 6 GeV, so top is definitely out.

So, the fermion pairs X can decay into must have a combined mass (2m_f) less than 6 GeV.

Let me check each fermion:

- e+ e-: 2*m_e ≈ 0.001 GeV. So yes, allowed.
- μ+ μ-: 2*m_mu ≈ 0.21 GeV. Allowed.
- τ+ τ-: 2*1.777 ≈ 3.554 GeV. Also allowed.
- u ū: 2*m_u ≈ 0.006 GeV. Allowed.
- d d̄: similar to u, about 0.008 GeV. Allowed.
- s s̄: 2*0.095 ≈ 0.19 GeV. Allowed.
- c c̄: 2*1.27 ≈ 2.54 GeV. Allowed.
- b b̄: 2*4.13 ≈ 8.26 GeV. Oh wait, that's bigger than 6 GeV. So b and anti-b can't be produced because 8.26 >6. So X cannot decay into b b̄.

Wait, but some of the options include b b̄. Looking at the options:

Option A: includes b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ τ-, e+ e-
Option B: includes c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ τ-, mu pair, e pair. So B doesn't have b b̄.
Option C: has c, s, u, d, t, but t is too heavy. So C is wrong.
Option D: has b b̄, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So D includes b, which is not allowed.

Wait, but wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. Let me double-check the bottom quark mass. I thought it was around 4.5 GeV, but perhaps I should be more precise. Wait, the mass of the bottom quark is about 4.1 to 4.7 GeV (depending on the source, but around 4.5 on average). So 2m_b would be about 9 GeV. Which is bigger than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄. So any option with b b̄ is incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A: includes b b̄ → not allowed. So A is wrong.
Option B: does not include b b̄ → allowed.
Option D: includes b b̄ → not allowed.

So the correct decay channels should include all fermion pairs except those where 2m_f exceeds X's mass.

So possible fermion pairs are:
e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Because:

m_e: 0.0005 GeV → 2m ~0.001 → allowed
m_mu: 0.105 → 0.21 → allowed
m_tau: 1.777 → 3.554 → allowed
m_u: ~0.003 → 0.006 → allowed
m_d: similar to u → allowed
m_s: ~0.095 → 0.19 → allowed
m_c: ~1.27 → 2.54 → allowed
m_b: about 4.5 → 9 → Not allowed
m_t: too heavy, but no option includes it.

So the allowed decays are: e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

Now look at the options. 

Option B lists: c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau, mu, e. So that's all except b. Yes, that matches.

Option C includes t, which is wrong because X can't decay into t. So C is incorrect.

Option D includes b, which is wrong, so D is incorrect.

Option A includes b, which is wrong, so A is incorrect.

So the correct option is B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the given interaction Lagrangian. The decays are allowed if the total mass of the fermion-antifermion pair (\( 2m_f \)) is less than the mass of \( X \). The fermion masses are approximately:

- \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_u \approx 0.003 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_d \approx 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_s \approx 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_c \approx 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_b \approx 4.13 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (excluded due to its large mass).

For \( X \) to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, \( 2m_f \) must be less than 6 GeV. Checking each fermion:

- \( e^+ e^- \): \( 2m_e \approx 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- \( \mu^+ \mu^- \): \( 2m_\mu \approx 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- \( \tau^+ \tau^- \): \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.554 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- \( u \bar{u} \): \( 2m_u \approx 0.006 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- \( d \bar{d} \): \( 2m_d \approx 0.008 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- \( s \bar{s} \): \( 2m_s \approx 0.19 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- \( c \bar{c} \): \( 2m_c \approx 2.54 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- \( b \bar{b} \): \( 2m_b \approx 8.26 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 8.26 > 6 \)).
- \( t \bar{t} \): \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 346 > 6 \)).

Thus, the allowed decays are \( X \rightarrow e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^-, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c} \). Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), which matches the allowed decays. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decay channels for \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
