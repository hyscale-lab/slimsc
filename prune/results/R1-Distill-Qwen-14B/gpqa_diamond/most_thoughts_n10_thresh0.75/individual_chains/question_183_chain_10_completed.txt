Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the index of hydrogen deficiency for the product. Hmm, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, and it's reacting with red phosphorus and excess HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically involved in something called the Wittig reaction, but wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the Wittig reaction uses triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide. Oh right, red phosphorus and HI might be for something else. Oh yeah, I think that's the preparation of a ylide, but wait, no, wait. Oh wait, wait. Oh, right! When you have a carbonyl group, like an aldehyde or ketone, reacting with red phosphorus and HI, that's the Clemmensen reduction. Or wait, wait, no. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and reduces ketones to alkanes. And the other one, the Wolff-Kishner, uses hydrazine and heat to eliminate the carbonyl. Hmm, maybe it's something else. Oh wait, wait, another thought: maybe it's the hydrohalogenation of alkenes or something else.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a halogenation. Or, wait, the reagent is HI with red phosphorus. Oh, right! Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrohalogenation of triple bonds, like in the preparation of alkenes. Wait, no, no, when you have a triple bond and you treat it with HX (like HI) and red phosphorus, it adds HX across the triple bond, right? So, for example, an alkyne would become an alkene. But wait, that's for the hydration of alkynes. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material has a conjugated diene or something. Wait, the starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So let me try to draw its structure. So cyclohexene ring, with substituents at positions 2 and 5. At position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂?), wait, no, vinyl is CH₂=CH- attached. So the ring has a double bond at position 3 (since it's cyclohex-3-ene). So the ring itself has a double bond. Then, substituents at 2 and 5: formyl and vinyl.

So the structure is a six-membered cyclohexene ring. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. At position 2 (next to 3), a carbonyl group (CHO). At position 5 (which is two carbons away from 3, since positions go 3,4,5,6,1,2), so position 5 has a vinyl group (CH₂=CH₂? No, wait, it's CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond. Wait, no, vinyl is CH₂=CH–. So the substituent at position 5 is CH₂=CH– attached to the ring.

So the starting molecule has the cyclohexene ring with substituents: formyl at 2, vinyl at 5, and a carboxylic acid group somewhere? Wait, no, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 1, perhaps? Because in the numbering, the lowest possible numbers are used. Let me think: the cyclohexene has a double bond at position 3. The substituents are at 2 (CHO) and 5 (vinyl). The carboxylic acid is at position 1, I think. Because the name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, meaning the carboxylic acid is at position 1.

So the molecule is a cyclohexene ring with substituents: at position 1, a COOH group; position 2, a CHO; position 5, a CH₂CH₂ group with a double bond? Wait, no, vinyl is CH₂=CH–. So the substituent at position 5 is -CH₂CH₂? No, wait, no. Wait, the substituent is a vinyl group, which is –CH₂CH₂? No, it's –CH₂CH₂, but wait, that would be an ethyl group, but vinyl is –CH₂CH₂ with a double bond. No, vinyl is –CH₂–CH₂– but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups? Hmm, wait no. Vinyl is –CH₂–CH₂– with a double bond between the two carbons? No, wait, vinyl is –CH₂–CH₂– but it's actually –CH₂–CH₂, but that's not possible. Wait, vinyl is –CH₂–CH₂–, but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So the substituent is a vinyl group at position 5.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the structure. Let me try to draw a rough sketch. So the cyclohexene ring has the double bond between C3 and C4. The substituents are at positions 2 (CHO), 5 (vinyl), and position 1 (COOH). So positions 1,2,5, and 3-4 are the key points.

Now, when this compound reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI, what happens? I think this is a case of the Wittig reaction, but wait, no. The Wittig reagent is made from triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide, then reacts with a carbonyl. But in this case, the reagent is red phosphorus and HI. Oh wait, another possibility: the reaction is the hydrohalogenation of the double bonds in the molecule. But wait, let's think: the starting molecule has multiple double bonds. There's the cyclohexene ring (so one double bond), the formyl group (CHO), which is a carbonyl, and the vinyl group (CH₂=CH–), which is another double bond. So we have at least two double bonds: the ring and the vinyl.

But wait, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Another thought: perhaps the reaction is the deoxygenation of carbonyl groups. Like, the formyl group (CHO) is reduced. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the reduction of carbonyl groups to alkanes. Wait, no, that's the Clemmensen reduction, which uses Zn(Hg)/HCl. Oh wait, maybe it's the Wolff-Kishner, which uses NH2NH2 (hydrazine) and heat, followed by NaOH and heat to eliminate the carbonyl group.

Wait, but I've heard that there's another method where carbonyl groups are converted to alkanes using red phosphorus and HI. Yes! That's the method called the hydroboration maybe? No, wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's the addition of HI across the double bonds. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has multiple double bonds, and the reaction is an addition of HI to each double bond. Wait, but in the starting molecule, the double bonds are in the ring (cyclohexene), in the formyl group (which is a carbonyl, but that's a double bond), and in the vinyl group.

Wait, the starting molecule has:

1. The cyclohexene ring double bond (1 double bond).
2. The formyl group (CHO) which is a carbonyl, another double bond.
3. The vinyl group (CH₂=CH–), which is another double bond.

So that's three double bonds. So the index of hydrogen deficiency is 3 + any rings. Wait, rings also contribute to hydrogen deficiency. Wait, the cyclohexene ring is a ring with a double bond. So the ring is a six-membered ring (so it's a cyclic structure, which is a ring, hence one degree of unsaturation). But wait, the cyclohexene already has a double bond, so for the ring, the double bond counts as a degree of unsaturation, and the ring itself is part of the structure. Wait, no, the ring itself contributes to the hydrogen deficiency. The formula for index of hydrogen deficiency (DoH) is DoH = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. But in this case, perhaps it's easier to count the rings and double bonds.

Each ring or double bond is a DoH of 1. So the starting molecule has:

- A six-membered ring (which is a ring, so 1 DoH)
- A double bond in the ring (adds another DoH, making 2)
- The formyl group (CHO) which has a double bond (adds another DoH, 3)
- The vinyl group (CH₂=CH–, another double bond, DoH 4)

Wait, but wait, the cyclohexene ring already has a double bond, so that's one DoH for the ring and one for the double bond. No, wait, no. The ring (cyclohexane) would have 0 DoH. But when it's cyclohexene, which is a cyclohexane with a double bond, each ring is one DoH, and each double bond is another. So cyclohexene has 1 (ring) +1 (double bond) = 2 DoH. Then, the formyl group (CHO) adds another DoH, and the vinyl group (another double bond) adds another. So total DoH would be 2 (from ring and double bond) + 1 (CHO) +1 (vinyl) = 4. But wait, that might not be correct because the ring is already a single ring and the cyclohexene has a double bond, so that's 2 DoH for the ring and double bond. Plus the two other double bonds (CHO and vinyl), so 4 in total.

But the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the ring has one double bond (cyclohexene), so that's 1 DoH for the ring (since it's a ring), plus one for the double bond, so that's 2. The substituents: formyl has a carbonyl (double bond, DoH 1), vinyl has a double bond (DoH 1), and the carboxylic acid is -COOH, which is a carbonyl as well. Wait, but carboxylic acid is a carbonyl, so that's another double bond. Oh wait, wait. The name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the ring has a double bond (3-en), and the carboxylic acid is attached, which is a carbonyl. So the carboxylic acid is another DoH.

Wait, so starting to count:

- Cyclohexene ring: 1 (ring) + 1 (double bond) = 2
- Carboxylic acid group: 1 (the carbonyl)
- Formyl group: 1 (carbonyl)
- Vinyl group: 1 (double bond)

So total DoH is 2 + 1 +1 +1 =5. So the starting material has 5 degrees of unsaturation.

But wait, maybe I'm double-counting. Let me think again. The formula for DoH is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So maybe I should compute that.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think about the product after the reaction. The reaction conditions are red phosphorus and excess HI. So what happens when a molecule with multiple carbonyl groups and double bonds is treated with red phosphorus and HI? I think this is a case of the reaction where carbonyl groups (like aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids) are converted into alkanes.

Wait, but how? For example, the Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones to alkanes, using Zn(Hg)/HCl. The Wolff-Kishner removes the carbonyl group from ketones or aldehydes, converting them into methylene groups, eliminating CO₂ or other products. But in this case, the reagents are red phosphorus and HI. I think that's the method where carbonyl groups are converted into CH₂ groups. So for each carbonyl (like CHO), it becomes CH₂I. Wait, no. Alternatively, the reaction adds HI across the carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: when alkenes react with HI, they undergo hydrohalogenation. But in the presence of red phosphorus, maybe it's a different reaction. Wait, perhaps the reaction is the addition of HI to the double bonds. So each double bond would add two H and two I, but since it's excess HI, maybe each double bond is saturated.

Wait, the starting molecule has three double bonds: the cyclohexene ring (one), the formyl (another), and the vinyl group (third). So the product after reaction with HI would have each double bond saturated, and perhaps the carbonyl groups are converted into something else.

Wait, but the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Another possibility: the Michaelis-Arburn reaction? No, that's for ketones and aldehydes. Alternatively, perhaps it's the hydrohalogenation of all the double bonds.

But let me think step by step. The starting molecule has:

1. A cyclohexene ring with a double bond (position 3)
2. A formyl group (CHO) at position 2
3. A vinyl group (CH₂=CH–) at position 5
4. A carboxylic acid group at position 1.

So when treated with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Red phosphorus and HI are known to effect the cleavage of double bonds. Wait, in the presence of red phosphorus, HI can add across double bonds. Additionally, in some cases, carbonyl groups can be reduced.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think of each functional group.

Reaction with HI and red phosphorus:

- The cyclohexene ring (double bond) would react with HI in hydrohalogenation, but since it's a conjugated diene or something else? Or maybe it's a ring that would undergo addition.

Wait, but the starting molecule is a monocyclic cyclohexene with substituents. So the ring's double bond would add HI. But in this case, since it's a six-membered ring, which is not a conjugated diene, the addition would be possible. But wait, would it open up? Maybe not. Maybe the reaction doesn't affect the ring's double bond because it's a strained position, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't add to the ring's double bond but instead targets the alkenes and carbonyl groups elsewhere.

Wait, but the formyl group is a carbonyl. So maybe that's reduced. But with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the carbonyl is converted into a CH₂ group. For example, in the Clemmensen reduction, the carbonyl becomes CH₂. So if the formyl (CHO) is reduced to CH₂I, perhaps. Similarly, the carboxylic acid group (COOH) would be reduced as well?

But wait, the carboxylic acid is a strong acid, so under what conditions would it react? Maybe the red phosphorus and HI would first react with the carboxylic acid. Wait, but HI is a strong acid, so maybe the carboxylic acid is deprotonated, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the addition of HI across the double bonds. So for each double bond, two H and two I would add. So the cyclohexene's double bond would become a single bond with H and I added. The formyl group's double bond (C=O) would add HI, but that's unlikely because carbonyl groups are not typically added by HI in such a way. Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is reduced.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each group:

1. Cyclohexene ring (double bond): would react with HI to form a di-substituted alkane. But since it's a six-membered ring, I'm not sure if it's possible to open it up. Alternatively, perhaps the ring remains intact.

2. Formyl group (CHO): in the presence of H and I, maybe the carbonyl is reduced. For example, in the Clemmensen reduction, the CHO becomes CH₂. So perhaps the formyl group becomes CH₂I?

3. Vinyl group (CH₂=CH–): this is an isolated double bond. So it would react with HI in hydrohalogenation. Since it's a vinyl group, the addition of HI would follow anti-Markovnikov addition. So the H would add to the less substituted carbon, and I to the more substituted.

Wait, but if the starting substituent is CH₂=CH–, adding HI would produce CH₂-I-CH₂–? No, wait, the vinyl group is –CH₂–CH₂– with a double bond. So when adding HI, it would become –CH₂–CH(I)–H. But wait, no. Let me correct that: the vinyl group is –CH₂–CH₂– with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So it's actually –CH₂–CH₂– but with the double bond between the two carbons. So the structure is –CH₂–CH₂– but as –CH₂=CH–.

So when HI adds to this double bond, the H adds to one carbon and I to the other. Since it's a vinyl group (sp² hybridized), the addition would follow anti-Markovnikov. So the H would add to the less substituted carbon, which is the one attached to the ring. So the product would have the I on the more substituted carbon. So the vinyl group (CH₂=CH–) would become CH₂–CH(I)H.

But wait, in the case of excess HI, perhaps the addition is not just once but fully. Hmm, no, each double bond can only add twice. Wait, no, each double bond can add two H and two I atoms, but for a single double bond, adding one mole of HI would give a mono-substituted product, but with excess HI, perhaps it's more. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps all the double bonds (in the ring, formyl, and vinyl) are saturated by HI. So the cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane, the formyl group becomes CH₂I, and the vinyl group becomes CH₂–CH₂I (but that's a single bond, so no more double bond).

Wait, but the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus is often used in the hydroboration reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but that's more for elimination.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not adding HI but instead breaking the double bonds. Let me think: when an alkyne is treated with HX (like HI) and red phosphorus, it gets converted to an alkene. But wait, that's the situation when the alkyne is converted to a trans-alkene. But I'm not sure if that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrohalogenation of all the double bonds in the molecule. So each double bond adds two H and two I atoms, converting them into single bonds.

So, the starting molecule has:

- One double bond in the ring → becomes single bond with H and I added on each end.
- One double bond in the formyl group → becomes single bond, but maybe the carbonyl is reduced to CH₂I.
- One double bond in the vinyl group → becomes single bond with H and I added.

Wait, but the formyl group is a carbonyl, which is a double bond between C and O. So adding HI across that would lead to some product. But typically, aldehydes don't react with HI in that way because the carbonyl is not as reactive as alkenes. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is reduced to a CH₂ group.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a combination of addition and reduction. So for each carbonyl group (CHO and COOH), they are reduced to CH₂ groups. The alkenes (ring and vinyl) are hydrogenated, adding H and I.

So for the ring's double bond: becomes single bond with H and I added on each end. But wait, a ring would have two adjacent carbons with double bond. Adding H and I across would lead to two substituents on adjacent carbons. But perhaps the ring doesn't open but the double bond is saturated.

Similarly, the vinyl group's double bond would be saturated, becoming CH₂–CH₂I. Wait, but that's only if one equivalent of HI is added; with excess, maybe both ends are substituted. No, each double bond can only add two HI molecules? No, each double bond can add two H and two I atoms in one addition. Wait, no, each double bond can only add one molecule of HI, resulting in a vicinal dihalide. Wait, that's right. For each double bond, one molecule of HI adds, converting it into a vicinal dihalide.

Wait, so for each double bond, adding one HI molecule: adding H to one end and I to the other. So, for example, the cyclohexene's double bond would become a cyclohexane with two adjacent CH₂ groups, each having an H and I attached. But wait, no. Let me think: when a double bond is treated with HI, it adds across the double bond in a way that the H adds to the less substituted carbon (anti-Markovnikov), and the I adds to the more substituted.

So for the cyclohexene ring, the addition would be such that H adds to one carbon and I to the adjacent. So the ring would now have two substituents: H and I on adjacent carbons, and the ring is now a cyclohexane.

Similarly, the formyl group's carbonyl (CHO) would be a problem. Adding HI to the carbonyl might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is reduced to a CH₂ group. Wait, but how? Red phosphorus and HI might reduce the carbonyl to CH₂I. Let me see: the formyl group is RCHO. If it's treated with HX (like HI) and red phosphorus, perhaps it's a case of the reduction of a carbonyl group. For example, in the presence of red phosphorus, HX can reduce the carbonyl to a CH₂ group.

Similarly, the carboxylic acid group (COOH) would be reduced. Wait, but how? Typically, carboxylic acids are difficult to reduce. However, in the presence of strong reducing agents like LiAlH4, they can be reduced to CH₂OH groups, but I'm not sure about red phosphorus and HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the carboxylic acid group is converted into a CH₂I group. But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the carboxylic acid but only the other groups.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think again about the overall plan. The product's index of hydrogen deficiency will depend on how many rings and double bonds are present after the reaction.

The starting material has DoH of 5. After reaction with HI and red phosphorus, how many rings and double bonds will remain?

If all double bonds are saturated, and the rings remain, then the rings would contribute to DoH.

Wait, but the cyclohexene ring is a six-membered ring with a double bond. After hydrohalogenation, that double bond is saturated, so the ring remains but now without the double bond. So the ring's double bond is gone, so only the ring remains. So the ring is one DoH. The formyl group's double bond is either gone (saturated) or converted into a CH₂ group. Similarly, the vinyl group's double bond is gone (saturated) or converted into a single bond.

Wait, but if the reaction adds HI across all double bonds, then each double bond becomes a single bond with H and I added on each adjacent carbon. So:

- Cyclohexene → cyclohexane (ring, which is a ring, so DoH 1)
- Formyl group (CHO) → CH₂I (no double bond, so no DoH)
- Vinyl group (CH₂=CH–) → CH₂–CH₂I (single bond, no DoH)
- Carboxylic acid group (COOH) → ???

Wait, but what about the carboxylic acid group? Maybe in the presence of HI, the -COOH group is converted into something else. Maybe it's reduced to a CH₂ group. So COOH → CH₂I?

If that's the case, then the product would have:

- A cyclohexane ring (DoH 1)
- The substituents: CH₂I (from formyl), perhaps another CH₂I (from COOH), and CH₂CH₂I (from vinyl).

So in the product, the rings would contribute 1 DoH, and any double bonds would add to that. But if all double bonds are saturated, the product would have only the ring as a DoH.

So the product would have a cyclohexane ring (DoH 1) and no double bonds elsewhere. So the index of hydrogen deficiency would be 1.

Wait, but let me check if any double bonds remain. The original formyl group (CHO) would have its double bond saturated, the vinyl group's double bond would be gone, and the ring's double bond would be gone. So no more double bonds. So the product would have only the cyclohexane ring, which contributes 1 DoH. Hence, the index is 1.

Looking at the options, option A is 1, B is 3, etc.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the reaction doesn't add to the ring's double bond. Perhaps it only adds to the other double bonds. Let me consider that.

If the ring's double bond remains, then the product would have the ring (1 DoH) and any other double bonds that weren't saturated.

But I'm not sure. If the ring's double bond is saturated, then the product's DoH is 1 (from the ring). If the ring's double bond remains, then the DoH would be higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring's double bond isn't affected, but the other double bonds are. So, for example, the formyl and vinyl double bonds are saturated.

But then, the ring's double bond (1 DoH) plus any other double bonds would be the total.

Wait, but the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I'm not exactly certain about the reaction's specifics. Maybe the ring's double bond is more reactive and gets saturated, while the other double bonds are not, or vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction only affects the formyl and vinyl double bonds, leaving the ring's double bond untouched. Then, the product would have:

- Ring double bond (1 DoH)
- Any other double bonds from the substituents, but if they are saturated, then the product would have 1 DoH.

Hmm, but I'm not confident. Let me think again.

Another approach: the starting material has 5 DoH. The reaction could either add H and I, which would reduce the DoH by the number of double bonds saturated.

Each double bond that's saturated reduces the DoH by 1. So if three double bonds are saturated, DoH would decrease by 3. So starting from 5, 5-3=2, but that's not an option. Wait, but the options are A)1, B)3, etc.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction converts carbonyl groups into CH₂ groups, which would eliminate two DoH each (since a carbonyl is a double bond, and if it's converted into a single bond, that's a loss of one DoH per carbonyl group).

Wait, the starting material has:

- One ring (DoH 1)
- One ring double bond (already counted in ring)
Wait, no, the ring itself is a six-membered ring, so that's one DoH. The double bond in the ring is another DoH. So ring contributes 2 DoH.

Then, the formyl group is another DoH (1), the vinyl group is another (1), and the carboxylic acid is another (1). So total is 2 + 1 +1 +1 =5.

If the reaction reduces the formyl and vinyl double bonds, each losing a DoH, and maybe the ring's double bond is also reduced.

If the ring's double bond is saturated, that's a loss of 1 DoH. The formyl and vinyl groups are each a DoH, so each reduction would decrease by 1. So 5 -3=2. But the options don't have 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring's double bond remains, but the formyl and vinyl groups are saturated. So 5 -2=3. So DoH would be 3. Looking at the options, option B is 3.

But earlier I thought the product would have only the ring as a DoH. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring's double bond is also saturated. So 5-3=2. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the ring's double bond. Then, the product would have:

Ring (still with a double bond): 2 DoH (ring and double bond)
Formyl and vinyl groups are converted. So formyl's double bond is gone (DoH -1), vinyl's double bond is gone (DoH -1). So 5-2=3 DoH.

So the product has 3 DoH.

Looking back, option B is 3.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the ring's double bond but does affect the other double bonds.

So, the starting molecule's DoH is 5. After reaction with HI and red phosphorus:

- Formyl group (CHO) is reduced to CH₂I → DoH decreases by 1 (from 1 to 0)
- Vinyl group (CH₂=CH–) is converted to CH₂–CH₂I → DoH decreases by 1 (from 1 to 0)
- The ring's double bond remains → DoH remains at 2 (ring and double bond)
- The carboxylic acid group may or may not be affected. If it's reduced to CH₂I, then DoH for the COOH group (1) is lost → DoH decreases by 1.

So, if all three groups (formyl, vinyl, and COOH) are saturated, then DoH would be 5 -3=2. But that's not an option. So maybe the COOH group isn't affected.

Wait, perhaps the reaction only affects the formyl and vinyl groups. So:

DoH after reaction = ring (2) + formyl and vinyl (both converted, so no DoH) → total DoH 2. Again, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group is also reduced. Let me compute:

Starting DoH:5

If ring remains (2 DoH), formyl → CH₂I (0), vinyl → CH₂CH₂I (0), COOH → CH₂I (0). So total DoH is 2 (from ring). So answer is 2, but that's not an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring's double bond is also saturated, so:

Starting DoH 5.

After reaction: ring becomes cyclohexane (1 DoH from ring), formyl and vinyl converted (each losing 1), and COOH converted (losing 1). So 5-4=1 DoH.

That would be option A)1.

So which is it? I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't reduce the carboxylic acid group. Let's see:

If the reaction reduces the formyl and vinyl groups, and the ring's double bond is also reduced. So:

DoH after reaction:

- Ring becomes cyclohexane → 1 DoH (just the ring)
- Formyl converted → 0
- Vinyl converted →0
- COOH remains → 1 DoH (its carbonyl)
So total DoH:1 +1=2 → again, not an option.

Wait, perhaps the COOH group is also reduced to CH₂I. Then:

DoH after reaction:

- Ring →1
- COOH →0
- formyl →0
- vinyl →0
Total DoH:1.

Which is option A.

But why would the COOH group react? COOH is a strong acid. I'm not sure if it would react under red phosphorus and HI conditions. Maybe it doesn't react, so the product would have the COOH group, which is a carbonyl, adding to the DoH.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction conditions don't affect the COOH group, so it remains. Then:

After reaction:

- Ring →1 DoH (if its double bond was saturated)
- COOH →1 DoH (carbonyl)
- formyl →0 (converted)
- vinyl →0 (converted)
Total DoH:1+1=2 → not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the COOH group isn't affected, so it remains as a carbonyl. So the product's DoH is 2 (ring and COOH's carbonyl). But since 2 isn't an option, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the ring's double bond, but reduces the formyl and vinyl groups. So the product has:

- Ring (2 DoH)
- COOH (1 DoH)
Total:3 → option B.

So the correct answer would be B)3.

But I'm not entirely certain. I think the correct approach is to determine that each double bond is reduced, so the product loses 3 DoH (the formyl, vinyl, and ring double bond), leaving only the ring as a single DoH. Wait, but the ring without the double bond would be a cyclohexane, which is just a ring, so 1 DoH.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring's double bond is not affected, so the product has 3 DoH (ring's 2, COOH's 1). But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think: the product after reaction would have all double bonds saturated except for any that remain. So if the ring's double bond is saturated, and the formyl and vinyl groups are saturated, then the only DoH is the cyclohexane ring (1).

So the product has 1 DoH → answer A.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the ring's double bond, which remains, and the formyl and vinyl are saturated. Then DoH is 2 (ring's 2: ring and double bond) plus COOH's 1 (carbonyl) → 3. Which is option B.

I think the correct answer is A)1, because the reaction would add HI to all the double bonds, including the ring's, making the ring a cyclohexane, which has 1 DoH. So the product has only the ring as DoH.


The problem involves determining the index of hydrogen deficiency (DoH) of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The starting material contains multiple functional groups, including a cyclohexene ring with a double bond, a formyl group (CHO), a vinyl group (CH₂=CH–), and a carboxylic acid group (COOH). Each of these contributes to the total DoH.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Starting Material's DoH**:
   - The cyclohexene ring contributes **2 DoH** (1 for the ring and 1 for the double bond).
   - The formyl group (CHO) contributes **1 DoH** (carbonyl double bond).
   - The vinyl group (CH₂=CH–) contributes **1 DoH** (double bond).
   - The carboxylic acid group (COOH) contributes **1 DoH** (carbonyl double bond).
   - Total **DoH = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5**.

2. **Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI**:
   - Red phosphorus and HI are known to reduce carbonyl groups (e.g., formyl and carboxylic acid) to CH₂ groups and add across double bonds (e.g., the vinyl group and the cyclohexene ring's double bond).
   - The reaction likely converts:
     - The formyl group (CHO) to CH₂.
     - The vinyl group (CH₂=CH–) to CH₂–CH₂.
     - The cyclohexene ring's double bond to a single bond, resulting in a cyclohexane ring.
   - The carboxylic acid group (COOH) is also reduced to CH₂.

3. **Product's Structure**:
   - The product contains a cyclohexane ring (1 DoH, as it is a six-membered ring without any double bonds).
   - All other double bonds (formyl, vinyl, and cyclohexene) are saturated, contributing no additional DoH.
   - The total **DoH of the product = 1**.

### Conclusion:
The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is **1**, corresponding to the cyclohexane ring.
