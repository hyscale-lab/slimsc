Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let me think. I'm not super familiar with all the details, but I remember something about the Boltzmann equation from my studies. Oh right, the Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy levels in a system to temperature.

The question states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, wait, wait. Oh right, the Boltzmann factor is involved here. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation.

The formula I remember is n2/n1 = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Since the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited, that would mean n1 (higher state) is twice n2. Wait, wait, no. Let me clarify. Let's say the energy levels are E1 and E2, where E2 is higher. So, the ratio n2/n1 = exp( -(ΔE)/(k*T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1.

In this case, star_1 has twice the population in a specific energy level. Let me think: the higher energy level would have a lower population because it's less likely to be populated at lower temperatures. So, if star_1 has the higher level more populated, maybe star_1 is hotter? Or wait, wait. Wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. Oh, but I'm a bit confused about which energy level is which. Let me clarify.

The question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, the excited state is a specific energy level. Let's say level 2 is the excited state, and level 1 is the lower state. So for star_1, the number of atoms in level 2 is twice that in star_2's level 2.

Wait, no. The statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me restate it: the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So, the population ratio (n2/n1) is 2 for star_1,
