Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, so the excitation here refers to the energy levels of the atoms. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, that number looks familiar. Oh, 1.38 is close to Boltzmann's constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh yeah, k = 1.38e-23 J/K. So the energy difference ΔE is k*T, where T is temperature. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. The Boltzmann distribution relates the probability of particles being in different energy states.

Wait, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. I think that refers to the population of the excited state compared to the ground state or another state. So the ratio of the populations is 2:1? Or wait, the problem says they're twice as excited, so maybe the number of excited atoms is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2.

In Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in energy states follows the Boltzmann distribution. The population ratio between two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. So, the ratio of populations n_upper to n_lower is (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight.

Wait, but in this problem, maybe it's just the ratio of two stars. Let me think. The problem says that the energy difference is approximately 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE is given.

Star 1 has twice as many excited atoms as star 2. Wait, or wait, the question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. Let me read again. "Iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So maybe the excitation level is higher in star_1?

Wait, in LTE, the fraction of atoms in a
