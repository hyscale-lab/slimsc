Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, I remember RHIC collides heavy ions, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. The question is about finding the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Oh right, c is the speed of light.

Wait, the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li is lithium. Let me think, lithium has an atomic number of 3. The isotope with 3 neutrons would be lithium-6, right? Because atomic number is 3 protons, plus 3 neutrons makes 6 nucleons in total. So the mass number is 6. So the nucleus in question is ^6Li.

I need to find the energy of the RHIC when the speed of the lithium nucleus is 0.96c. RHIC typically accelerates heavy ions to relativistic speeds, so I think relativistic mechanics apply here. Since the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (0.96c is pretty high), I'll need to use the relativistic energy formulas.

The energy of a particle in relativity is given by the total energy, which includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The formula is E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 - v²/c²).

So first, I should calculate gamma. Given v = 0.96c, let's plug that in.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

v = 0.96c, so v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that. 1 ÷ 0.28 equals approximately 3.5714. Wait, wait, no, 0.28 is 7/25, so 1/(7/25) is 25/7, which is about 3.5714. Hmm, but exactly 25/7? Let me check:

25 divided by 7 is 3.57142857... So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now I need the rest mass energy of the ^6Li nucleus. The rest mass energy is m0 c squared. But I need to find m0, the rest mass of the nucleus.

The mass of a nucleus can be found using the mass number. The mass number A is 6 for ^6Li. The molar mass of lithium-6 is approximately 6.941 g/mol. Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: the actual mass of a single ^6Li nucleus is approximately the atomic mass in atomic mass units (u). So 1 u is about 1.660539 ×10^-27 kg.

But wait, the exact mass of ^6Li is known.
