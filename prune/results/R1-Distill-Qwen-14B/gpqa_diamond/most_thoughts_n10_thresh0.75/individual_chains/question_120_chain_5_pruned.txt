Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I need to think through this carefully.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (p) is the reciprocal of distance (d) in parsecs, so p = 1/d. That means as distance increases, parallax decreases. So stars farther away have smaller parallaxes.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed, which probably means that their spatial density is uniform. Wait, but uniform distribution in what sense? Like the same number of stars per volume? Because in reality, the galaxy isn't uniform, but in this scenario, let's go with that.

I need to find how the number of stars per unit parallax range (like dplx) changes with plx. So, the question is about N(p) dpL, where N(p) is stars per unit parallax, and dpL is a small change in parallax. Or perhaps it's the number of stars in a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of volume. The number of stars in a given volume depends on the volume. If the distribution is uniform, then more volume would mean more stars.

But how does parallax relate to volume? Let's think about a thin shell at a particular distance d. The volume of that shell is approximately 4πd² dd, where dd is the thickness of the shell. Wait, because the volume is the surface area (4πd²) times the thickness (dd). And since parallax p is 1
