Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about black holes and entropy. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ=10^-17 degrees, and the distance is d=10^10 parsecs. We need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are A to D, with exponents ranging from 59 to 66.

Wait, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. Something like S = (k c^3 A) / (4 ħ G), where A is the area of the event horizon, right? Oh right, more specifically, S = (k_B * A) / (4 * ħ * c^4) * something... Wait, no, I think I should double-check the formula. Oh right, the formula is S = (k_B c^3 A) / (4 ħ G) divided by something? Or wait, I think it's S = (k_B A)/(4 ħ c^4) multiplied by the Planck charge or something. No, wait, no, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G) * k_B. Or actually, the formula is S = (A k_B)/(4 ħ c^4) multiplied by the speed of light squared? No, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, let me think again. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is S = (k_B c^3 A) / (4 ħ G), where A is the area of the event horizon, and G is the gravitational constant, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and k_B is Boltzmann's constant. Right, that sounds familiar. So the main task is to find the area A, then plug into this formula.

So first, we need to find the radius of the event horizon, because the area is 4π R².

Wait, the angular size θ is given. So θ is the angle subtended by the event horizon at distance d. The formula relating angular size, actual size, and distance is θ ≈ (R) / d, when θ is small. Because for small angles (in radians), θ ≈ (length) / (distance
