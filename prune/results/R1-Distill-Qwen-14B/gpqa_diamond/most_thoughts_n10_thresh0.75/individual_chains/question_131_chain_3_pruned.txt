Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me go through it step by step. 

The question is about a reaction involving an anhydride and a cyclopentadiene derivative, leading to two products. The major and minor products have specific molecular formulas, and their NOESY NMR spectra show certain cross-peaks. My goal is to figure out which resonances are connected by the cross-peak in the major product.

First, let me parse the given information.

The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride has an NMR: 1H shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and 13C shows peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Hmm, what's that mean?

Wait, 1H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. That's probably from protons on an aromatic ring, but wait, the molecule comes from a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Oh, wait, maybe it's a conjugated diene or some cyclic structure. Alternatively, the anhydride formation could lead to a cyclic structure with some conjugated double bonds, which could deshield protons.

Wait, another thought: in the 13C NMR, 165 ppm is a carbonyl carbon, like in an anhydride. The 137 ppm is probably from a carbon adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, maybe a double bond or a carbonyl. So, the anhydride structure might have two carbonyl groups connected by a ring or some conjugated system.

Wait, maybe the starting material is something like a cis-dicarboxylic acid. Dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride. For example, if it's succinic acid, but that's trans. Wait, no, the starting acid has a cis-alkene. So the diacid would have a structure like HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH, but with a double bond. No, wait, maybe HOOC-CH2CH=CH-COOH, but that's a trans or cis configuration.

Wait, perhaps the diacid is HOOC-CH2
