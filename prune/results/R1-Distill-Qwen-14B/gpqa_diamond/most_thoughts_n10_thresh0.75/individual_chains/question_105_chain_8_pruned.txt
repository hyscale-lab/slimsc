Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me start by understanding the question.

The problem is about a star that's similar in radius to the Sun. Half of its surface (one hemisphere) has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. So the spots are at 5000 K. The question says that when we observe this star's brightness over time, the variations due to the spots rotating into and out of view look a lot like an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. Now, the task is to figure out what radius a hypothetical exoplanet would need to have to produce the same brightness variation (amplitude) as these spots do. But only when the star isn't spotted, I guess—so comparing the two scenarios.

Wait, the problem says "if the star was not covered by spots" so we're comparing the brightness variation caused by the planet to what the spots cause. So the spots cause a certain dip in brightness, and we want the planet to cause the same dip.

I remember that the brightness variation, or the drop in light when a planet transits a star, depends on the ratio of their areas. The formula I think is that the fractional change in brightness (delta F) is approximately (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet radius and Rstar is the star's radius. Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius.

But wait, in this case, the star's brightness is affected by spots. So the spots cause a dip because they are cooler than the rest of the star. So when the spots rotate into view, the total brightness of the star as seen from Earth decreases because a part that's emitting less light is now visible.

So I need to calculate the effective area of the spots and how much they dim the star. Then, compare that to the area a planet would need to block to cause the same change.

Let's break it down step by step.

First, the star's radius is R_sun. One hemisphere is covered with spots. The filling factor is 20%, so 20% of that hemisphere is covered. Wait, wait, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere.

Wait, a hemisphere is half the star's surface, right. So the area of the star is 4πR². Hemisphere is 2πR². 20% of that would be 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the spot area is 0.4 π R².

But wait, the star's total surface area is 4π R². So the spot area is 0.4 π R², which is 0.1 of the star's total surface area, since 0.4 π R² divided by 4 π R² is 0.1.

Wait, no. Because the filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere. So the total spotted area is 20% of (2π R²) = 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R², which
