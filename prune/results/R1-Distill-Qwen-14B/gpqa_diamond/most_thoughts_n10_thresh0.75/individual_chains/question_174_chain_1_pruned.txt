Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nuclei and fission. Hmm, fission is when a heavy nucleus splits into two or more smaller nuclei, right? The problem says it's a spontaneous fission into two fragments, and the more massive one has a kinetic energy T1. I need to find the difference between the correct relativistic T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Let me read the problem again. The initial nucleus has a rest mass M with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. It splits into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other, so if the other is x, the first is 2x. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. Oh wait, the initial rest mass is M, so the sum is 0.99*M. So 2x + x = 0.99 M => 3x = 0.99 M → x = 0.33 M. So the two fragments have rest masses of 0.33 M (lighter) and 0.66 M (heavier).

Wait, but the initial rest mass is 300 GeV. So M is 300 GeV/c². Then the lighter fragment is 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV, and the heavier is 198 GeV. But wait, sum is 297 GeV, which is 0.99 * 300 GeV. That makes sense
