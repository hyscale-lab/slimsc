Okay, so I have this question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both poles together; you can't isolate them. That must be related to one of Maxwell's equations.

Wait, Maxwell's equations... I think one of them deals with the divergence of the magnetic field. Oh right, Gauss's Law for magnetism. The equation is that the divergence of B is zero, which means there are no isolated magnetic charges—so monopoles don't exist. 

But the question says in this universe, magnets can have isolated poles. So that equation must change. So the equation that would be different is the one related to the divergence of B. Oh wait, what's the original equation again? It's ∇·B = 0. If monopoles exist, that would change. So ∇·B would equal something like μ times the magnetic charge density, right?

So Maxwell's equations are four in total. Let me think about each of them:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀ (Gauss's Law for electric fields) – this is about electric charge.
2. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t (Faraday's Law) – this is about the curl of E.
3. ∇·B = 0 (Gauss's Law for magnetism) – would change if monopoles exist.
4. ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t (Ampère's Law including Maxwell's addition) – this is about the curl of B.

So the third equation would change. Also, Ampère's Law or Maxwell's correction – do they involve magnetic charge? Wait, if there are isolated magnetic poles, maybe another equation would change too. Because in Ampère's Law, the sources are currents (moving charges). But if you have magnetic charges, perhaps there's an additional term in Ampère's Law? Or does that affect the equation for the curl of B?

Wait, let's think. The equation ∇×B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t) is Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition. If magnetic monopoles exist, would there be a current associated with them? I think in that case, there would be another term in the equation. So Ampère's Law would have another current term, perhaps. Or wait, maybe another equation would change.

Wait, but in Maxwell's equations, only Gauss's Law for B and Ampère's Law (or Faraday's Law, but Faraday's is about changing B fields) might change. Hmm. Let me try to remember. The original equations are:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀ (electric charge)
2. ∇·B = 0 (no magnetic monopoles)
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

If magnetic monopoles exist, then equation 2 would become ∇·B = μ_m ρ_m, where μ_m is some magnetic permeability term and ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. So equation 2 changes.

But wait, what about Ampère's Law?
