Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. It usually involves 1,5-dienes rearranging to another 1,5-diene, right? But wait, the molecule given isn't just a simple diene. Let's see, the structure is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. 

Alright, let me draw this out. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has two bridgeheads, right? The numbering starts with the first bridge as two carbons, the second as two, and the third as one. So the structure would have a seven-membered ring with two bridges: two carbons, two carbons, and one carbon. 

The substituents: there's a vinyl group on carbon 2 and an azabicyclo structure. So the nitrogen is at position 2, and there's a vinyl group attached to that same carbon. Wait, 2-azabicyclo... That makes sense. So the molecule is a bicyclic compound with a vinyl substituent on the nitrogen.

Now, the Cope rearrangement typically occurs in 1,5-dienes, but I'm not sure if this structure fits that. Alternatively, I've heard that the Cope rearrangement can also happen in allenes or other conjugated systems. Wait, maybe this molecule has a conjugated diene system that can undergo [3,3] rearrangement.

Wait, the molecule is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the azabicyclo is a norbornene derivative. The double bond is at position 5, which is in the bridge. Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group and the ring's double bond form the necessary conjugation for the rearrangement.

Let me try to sketch this. So the bicyclo structure has a bridge, and the nitrogen is at one of the bridgehead positions. The vinyl group is on the same carbon as the nitrogen. So, in the structure, there's a ring double bond (hept-5-ene) and a vinyl group (CH2-CH2, but with a double bond) attached to the nitrogen.

Wait,
