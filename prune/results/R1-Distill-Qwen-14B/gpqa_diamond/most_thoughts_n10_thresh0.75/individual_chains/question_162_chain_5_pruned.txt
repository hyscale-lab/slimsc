Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that the metric tells us about the geometry of the space. The question is about a pseudosphere, which I think is an example of a space with constant negative curvature. Oh right, pseudosphere is like the hyperbolic equivalent of a sphere.

The area of a sphere in 2D (which is a circle) is 4πr². But pseudosphere is a hyperbolic surface, so its area might be different. Oh wait, but pseudosphere is kind of a surface of constant negative curvature, which doesn't close up like a sphere; it's more like an infinite horn or something, so maybe the area is tricky.

Wait, wait, the metric here looks a bit familiar. Let me parse it. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator gets small, which might mean the metric blows up there. So perhaps this is a model of hyperbolic space.

In 2D hyperbolic geometry, the metric often looks like ds² = (dr²)/(a² cosh²(r/a)) + a² tanh²(r/a) dθ², but that's in polar coordinates. Alternatively, the Poincaré disk model uses ds² = (4 dx²)/( (1 - x² - y
