Alright, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says. Okay, it's about exoplanets detected using the RV method. Hmm, I remember the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by an orbiting planet.

The setup is that there are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both planets are in circular orbits. The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets relative to each other.

So, the key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but how does this relate to the orbital period?

I think the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet. The RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us, right? So the velocity semi-amplitude (K) would be larger for a planet causing a bigger shift. Because the shift is proportional to velocity, I guess. Or is it directly tied to velocity?

Wait, the shift is in wavelength, so that's the Doppler shift. The formula for Doppler shift when the star is moving towards or away from us is delta lambda over lambda equals v over c, or something like that. Wait, no, the exact formula might be delta lambda = (v/c) * lambda. Or is it the fractional change in wavelength?

Alternatively, I recall that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by some formula involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period. Oh right, the formula is K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) ) × (1 / (1 AU)^(1/3)) ), but I might be getting the units wrong. Alternatively, maybe a simpler approach.

Wait, since both stars have the same mass (solar masses), and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), perhaps the main factors are the velocity semi-amplitude and the orbital period.

The velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2
