Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The bigger the wobble, the more massive the planet, right? Or wait, no, maybe it's more about the planet's mass and how close it is to the star.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both have circular orbits. So, the key factors here are the Doppler shifts observed. Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. They ask how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet. I think the formula is something like the semi-amplitude K = (v) is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) * ( (1) / ( (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) )) ), but since M_p is much smaller than M_star, that term is negligible. So K is approximately proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) ), wait no, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, actually, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) ) ) * (1 / (P * (2π)^(1/3)) ) )

But since M_p << M_star, M_p/M_star is negligible, so approximately, K ≈ ( (G * M_p )/(M_star^(2/3)) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (2π P)^(1/3) )) )

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I've heard that the RV semi-amplitude depends on the mass of the planet, the period, and the mass of the star. But since the stars are the same mass as the Sun, and both planets are similar to Neptune, their masses are the same. Wait no, the question says both have masses similar to Neptune, so M_p1 ≈ M_p2. So M_p is the same for both.

Wait, but the RV semi-amplitude K depends on (M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e^2)) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that term is 1. So K ≈ (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) ) )

Wait, maybe the formula can be simplified. Oh, I think the key relation is that the semi-amplitude K
