Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A, and the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to choose the right reagent A and catalyst B from the given options.

Hmm. So first, I should think about what kind of reaction this is. The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, which is a cyclic amine. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Looking at that structure, I think it's a ring expansion or perhaps a ring-forming reaction. Wait, pyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with four carbons and one nitrogen. If the product has a cyclohexyl group attached, maybe it's a ring-opening or some kind of addition.

Wait, the product's name is a bit complicated. Let me break it down. 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl) suggests that there's a cyclohexylidene group attached via a methylene (-CH2-) group. The 'idene' part implies a double bond. So cyclohexylidene would be a cyclohexene ring with a double bond, perhaps as a substituent.

Wait, pyrrolidine is a five-membered amine. When it reacts with compound A under acid catalysis, it forms
