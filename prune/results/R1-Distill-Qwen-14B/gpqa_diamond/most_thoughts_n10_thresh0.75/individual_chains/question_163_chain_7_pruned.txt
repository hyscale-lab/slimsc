Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not entirely confident with all the concepts here. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid and then finding the minimum volume of the acid needed, as well as the pH of the resulting solution. Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, so it's a base, and when you add a strong acid, they should react. The acid is monobasic, so I think that means it donates one H+ ion, like HCl or HNO3.

Alright, let's see. The given data is: 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3, and the total volume is 100 cm³. We need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid required. Also, calculate the pH of the resulting solution.

First, I think I should calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3. The formula for iron(III) hydroxide is Fe(OH)3. The molar mass would be the sum of the atomic masses: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So, 55.85 + (16*3) + (1*3) = 55.85 + 48 + 3 = 106.85 g/mol. Wait, let me calculate that again: 55.85 + (3*16)=48, plus 3*(1)=3. So yeah, 106.85 g/mol. 

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass. That's 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Let me do the division: 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.0009358. So about 0.000936 moles.

Fe(OH)3 is a base, and when it reacts with a strong acid, like HCl, the reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2O. Right? So the acid is monobasic, which means each molecule provides one H+ ion. So the reaction equation is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

So each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+.

So the moles of H+ needed = 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3. Moles of Fe(OH)3 is 0.000936, so H+ needed is 0.002808 moles.

But wait, the acid is 0.1 M. So the volume of acid needed (in liters) is moles / concentration. So volume (L) = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, does that make sense? Well, the options are given, and option C is 28.05 cm³. Oh wait, but wait a second—am I considering the dilution correctly?

Wait, the total volume is 100 cm³. So when you add the acid to the solution, the total volume might change. Oh, but in this case, the problem says the total volume is 100 cm³, which includes the acid added. But wait, the question is, what is the minimal volume of the acid needed to prepare the solution. So perhaps we're assuming that the acid is added to the Fe(OH)3 solution, and the resulting volume is 10
