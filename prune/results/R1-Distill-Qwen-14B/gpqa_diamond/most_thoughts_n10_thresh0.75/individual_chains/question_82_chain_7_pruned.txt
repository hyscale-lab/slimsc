Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with cyclooctatetraene and ending up with product 3. The options are four different structures, so I need to figure out the correct one based on the reactions described.

First, let me outline the reactions:

1. Cyclooctatetraene is heated with maleic anhydride in a 1:1 ratio to form product 1.
2. Product 1 is heated with methanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid to form product 2.
3. Product 2 is heated with cyclopentadiene to form product 3.

I need to find the structure of the major isomer of product 3.

Let me break down each step.

**Step 1: Cyclooctatetraene + Maleic Anhydride â†’ Product 1**

Cyclooctatetraene is a non-aromatic, tub-shaped molecule. When it reacts with a dienophile like maleic anhydride, it's likely undergoing a Diels-Alder reaction. But wait, cyclooctatetraene can act as a diene or a dienophile? Hmm. Wait, cyclooctatetraene is a conjugated eight-membered ring with four double bonds. I think in the Diels-Alder reaction, it can act as the diene because it has conjugated double bonds. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's undergoing some kind of addition reaction.

Wait, no, Diels-Alder requires a diene (conjugated double bonds) and a dienophile (like a molecule with a double bond that's electron-deficient, like maleic anhydride). So the cyclooctatetraene would be the diene in this case, and maleic anhydride is the dienophile. So the reaction would form a six-membered ring, adding two new rings perhaps?

Wait, but cyclooctatetraene is a eight-membered ring. If it does a Diels-A
