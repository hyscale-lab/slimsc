Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so please bear with me.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So substituting: (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-9-1+1)/2 = (8)/2 = 4. So four degrees: likely one ring and three double bonds or combinations. But wait, maybe a benzene ring (which counts for 3) plus another double bond and a ring? Or maybe it's a benzene with some substituents and another double bond.

The NMR data is given. Let me look at that. The peaks are at 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H).

Hmm. The 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. A triplet around 9-10 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton. Wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10, but they are usually singlets. Oh but wait, in some cases, like if it's adjacent to a CH2 group, maybe it could split into a triplet? Or maybe it's an acidic proton like an enol? Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with some coupling. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone, but ketones don't show up that high. Wait, no, aldehyde protons are around 9-10. So maybe this is an aldehyde.

Wait, but wait: if the aldehyde is attached to something that has two protons, like maybe a CH2 group adjacent, then the aldehyde proton could split into a triplet. Because the aldehyde (RCHO) would have no adjacent protons, but if it's RCH2CHO, then the CH2 next to the aldehyde (like in butanal, but that's a straight chain). Alternatively, maybe it's part of a conjugated system where the
