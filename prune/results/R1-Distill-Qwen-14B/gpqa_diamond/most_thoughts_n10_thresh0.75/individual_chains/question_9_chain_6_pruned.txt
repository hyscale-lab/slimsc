Okay, so I have this chemistry question here about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that symmetry in molecules involves certain elements like rotation axes, planes of symmetry, and centers of inversion. C3h symmetry... wait, what does that mean exactly?

So, C3h is a type of molecular symmetry. The 'C' stands for 'cyclo,' meaning a rotation axis, and the subscript 3 means it's a three-fold rotation. The 'h' probably refers to a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, wait. Let me think. Oh, right! C3h symmetry implies that the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (so 120-degree rotations) and a horizontal mirror plane that's perpendicular to that axis.

The question gives four options: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, another benzenoid compound, and another with triphenylene. I need to figure out which of these has C3h symmetry.

Starting with option C) triisopropyl borate. Triisopropyl borate has the formula (i-Pr)3BO. The structure is a boron atom attached to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl group is CH(CH3)2. So, the molecule should have a trigonal structure around boron. Since each substituent is the same, the molecule should have three-fold rotational symmetry. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, the molecule is trigonal planar around boron. But the substituents are bulky. Let me visualize: the boron is in the center, and each isopropyl group is attached. Since all three are identical, rotation by 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself. But for C3h symmetry, you also need a horizontal mirror plane. Is there such a plane in triisopropyl borate?

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is nonpolar, which suggests a center of inversion. Wait, if there's a center of inversion, then the symmetry would be higher. Hmm. Wait, another thought: triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar arrangement, but is the structure symmetric enough to have a mirror plane? I'm not entirely sure. Let me move on and come back.

Option D) quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine, right? It's a structure where there are two bridgeheads with two methylene groups each. I think
