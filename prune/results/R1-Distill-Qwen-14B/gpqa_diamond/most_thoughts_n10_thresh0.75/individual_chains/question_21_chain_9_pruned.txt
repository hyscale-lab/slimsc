Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about isomersâ€”specifically constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. But the main part of the question is about two different tasks: part A and part B. 

First, the problem says that among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, one doesn't show tautomerism. I need to figure out which one that is. Then, for part B, among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, I need to determine which shows optical isomerism.

Let me tackle part A first. Tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between two atoms, resulting in different tautomers. For example, in ketones and aldehydes, tautomerism typically relates to enol and keto forms. But wait, I think it's more about compounds that have adjacent double bonds or conjugated systems where such shifts are possible.

Benzoquinone is a cyclic quinone. Quinones usually have two ketone groups. Benzoquinone would be something like O=C6H4=O, but wait, actually benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Since the quinone structure has conjugated double bonds, I'm wondering if that allows for any keto-enol tautomerism. Wait, but quinones are generally in the keto form, and I'm not sure if they undergo tautomerism. Alternatively, maybe not. Or maybe they don't show tautomerism because the structure is more stable in one form, so the tautomer doesn't form easily.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So the structure would be O=C-C-C-O=C-O=C-C-C, but arranged in a ring. Wait, no, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three ketone groups at alternate positions. So, the structure is O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C- all in a six-membered ring. Now, can this compound undergo tautomerism?

Wait, but each ketone group is at a different carbon. Since the carbonyl groups are all in conjugated
