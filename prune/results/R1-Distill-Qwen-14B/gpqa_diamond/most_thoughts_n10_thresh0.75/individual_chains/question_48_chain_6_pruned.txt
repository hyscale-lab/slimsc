Okay, I'm going to try to figure out this organic chemistry problem step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the starting material is cyclohexanone. Then, it's treated with bromine to form product 1. After that, product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide to make product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride to give product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are on product 4. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

Hmm, let me break this down reaction by reaction.

First reaction: Cyclohexanone + bromine. I remember that bromine can undergo different reactions depending on the conditions. For ketones, bromine might add via some mechanism. Wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. When ketones react with bromine, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. Oh wait, but cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. So, probably, bromine adds to the carbonyl, right? So the carbonyl oxygen could attack Br2, leading to the formation of a dibromide. Alternatively, maybe it's an electrophilic addition. Wait, no, ketones typically don't undergo addition of bromine in the same way alkenes do. Oh wait, maybe it's a haloform reaction? No, that's when you have a methyl ketone and you treat it with X2 in the presence of a base. But cyclohexanone isn't a methyl ketone; it's a six-membered ring with a ketone.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. Another possibility is that bromine is adding to the carbonyl group. So the ketone (O) would get two bromines attached, but that doesn't make much sense because the carbonyl is a double bond. Oh, wait, maybe it's a conjugate addition or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is adding across the double bond if any were present. But cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so it doesn't have a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe cyclohexanone is undergoing a ring-opening reaction. For example, if the ring is under acidic conditions, but bromine
