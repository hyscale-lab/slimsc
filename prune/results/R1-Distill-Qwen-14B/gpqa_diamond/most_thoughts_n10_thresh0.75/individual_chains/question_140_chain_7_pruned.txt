Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B has a melting point very close to 277 K. Plus, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially when considering its analog.

Hmm, okay. Let's start by piecing together the reactions and the substances involved.

First, the gas W: same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule must be something like a noble gas or maybe a diatomic molecule where the number of neutrons equals the protons. Wait, protons are the atomic number, and neutrons would be the number of neutrons in each atom. So for a molecule, the sum of protons and neutrons per molecule should be the same. Let's think about possible gases.

Wait, W is a gas, so maybe H2? No, because H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons in H1. If it's H2, each H has 1 proton. But the number of neutrons in each H is 0 for H1, so per molecule, 2 protons and 0 neutrons. No, that wouldn't match. Or maybe another gas.

Wait, maybe CO2? No, that's a gas but let me think. Alternatively, could it be O2? Oxygen gas. Each O has 8 protons. If the molecule is O2, then each O has 8 protons. The number of neutrons in each O is 8 (since O-16 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons). So for O2, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So per molecule, 16 protons (8*2) and 16 neutrons (8*2). But wait, the problem says the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the total for the molecule should be equal. Let me think: O2 has 16 protons (each O has 8, two atoms) and 16 neutrons (each O has 8, two atoms). So 1
