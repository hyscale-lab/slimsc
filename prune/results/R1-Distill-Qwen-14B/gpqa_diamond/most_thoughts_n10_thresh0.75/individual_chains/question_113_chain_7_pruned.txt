Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options given are different chemical formulas, and I need to figure out which one is correct. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's look at each piece of data.

First, the FTIR spectrum. The peaks mentioned are a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹, and two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. I remember that IR peaks around 3000 usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches, but since the compound is likely organic and without nitrogen mentioned, it's probably an O-H group, like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Wait, but a broad peak around 3000 could also be an alcohol. But wait, carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch because the -OH is more acidic and has strong hydrogen bonding. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol, but the broadness might suggest something else.

The two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. 1700 is a carbonyl group (C=O), which could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 cm⁻¹ is a bit lower. I think that's around where conjugated carbonyls might appear. Wait, maybe an aromatic ring conjugated with a carbonyl? Like a ketone in an aromatic ring, but I'm not sure. Or maybe an ester or a conjugated carbonyl group.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum has peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are those on a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound has a double bond, which makes sense with the IR absorption around 1650 maybe being a conjugated double bond or a C=C.

Now, the mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z =45. I remember that 45 is a common mass for certain functional groups. Let me think, what fragments give m/z 45? Maybe a CH3CO+ ion (which is 45, since CH3CO+ is
