Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question involves Compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the given options. The data provided are IR and 1H NMR spectra.

First, I'll start by analyzing the spectroscopic data to figure out what Compound X is. Then, I'll determine what reaction occurs when it's treated with red phosphorus and HI. That should tell me the product.

Let's look at the IR data first. The IR peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1.

The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 cm-1 is probably an -OH stretch, maybe in a carboxylic acid since those have broad peaks. Alternatively, it could be an alcohol, but if it's a carboxylic acid, that's more likely because of the 1720 peak.

The 1720 cm-1 peak suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde or carboxylic acid. Wait, but if there's an -OH peak too, maybe it's a carboxylic acid because they have both an -OH (broad) and a carbonyl around 1700. So maybe Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative.

Next, the NMR data. Let me list them:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H)
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H)
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)

Looking at the aromatic region first. The signals at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm are doublets each integrating for 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons on each adjacent carbon are equivalent and show as doublets when coupled. So the ring has substituents in the para positions.

What about the 10.5 ppm peak? That's a singlet for 1H. That's a strong downfield shift, which is typical for an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. But that's a broad singlet. Oh wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH might be exchanging and show as a broad peak, but that's usually around 10-12 ppm. So maybe that's a carboxylic acid proton.

Wait, but wait. Carboxylic acids have protons that are usually broad singlets around 10-12 ppm. So the 10.5 ppm peak is probably the -OH of a carboxylic acid.

So the benzene ring has a substituent that's a carboxylic acid group
