Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Wait, parallax is related to distance, right? Oh right, the parallax (plx) in arcseconds is inversely proportional to the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance. That means as plx increases, the distance decreases. So closer stars have larger parallaxes.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly probably means that the number density of stars is the same in all directions. So the number of stars per unit volume is constant. But wait, when we observe them, their distribution in terms of parallax isn't uniform because closer stars are more numerous in higher parallax bins.

So the problem is about how the number of stars per unit range of plx (like a bin from plx to plx + dplx) depends on plx. Let's denote N as the number of stars in a small range dplx around plx.

I remember that in three dimensions, the number of stars in a thin spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr is proportional to r² dr, because the surface area of a sphere is 4πr². So number of stars dN = n * 4π r² dr, where n is the number density (stars per volume).

But how does this relate to parallax? Since plx = 1/r, r = 1/plx. So dr = - (1/plx²) dplx, because dr = derivative of r with respect to plx times dplx. Wait, let me compute that properly. If r = 1/plx, then dr/dplx = -1/plx². So dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. But since dplx is positive (we're considering a range), dr would be negative, but when considering the magnitude, it's okay.

So putting it together, the number of stars in a parallax range dplx is dN = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, wait no, let me double-check. Because r is 1/plx, so r² is 1/plx². And dr is (dr/dplx) dplx = (-1/plx²) dplx. So the absolute value of dr is (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting, dN = n * 4π (r²) dr.
