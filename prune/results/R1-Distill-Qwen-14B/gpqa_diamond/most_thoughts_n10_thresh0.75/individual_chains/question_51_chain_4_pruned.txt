Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The question is: If a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. Calculate the net potential energy of this system.

Hmm, the options are A to D. I need to find the correct potential energy expression.

I remember that when dealing with potential energy in electrostatics, especially with conductors, image charges might come into play. Wait, but this sphere is grounded. Oh right, a grounded conductor means that any excess charge on it can move to the ground. So in this case, the sphere itself is neutral, but the presence of the external charge q induces charges on the sphere.

Wait, no. Wait, let me think again. If the sphere is conducting and grounded, any external charge would cause an induced charge opposite of q on the inner surface, and because the sphere is neutral overall, the outer surface would have a charge equal to the induced charge. But wait, no, actually, since the sphere is grounded, any induced charge would flow away. Let me clarify: when I have a grounded conducting sphere and place a charge near it, the sphere's inner surface would have an induced charge of equal magnitude but opposite sign if the sphere is isolated. But since the sphere is grounded, it can lose or gain electrons. So in that case, the inner surface would have a charge equal to -q, and the outer surface remains neutral because the sphere's total charge is zero. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the sphere itself is neutral, so when you place a charge q outside, the conducting sphere's inner surface must have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface would have +q. But because it's grounded, the outer charge can go away, so the outer surface remains neutral, and the inner surface has -q, but the sphere must have a net charge of zero. Wait, that doesn't align. Wait, the sphere is initially neutral. When you bring a charge q near it, the inner surface of the conductor (closest to q) will have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface will have +q. But since the sphere is grounded, the +q on the outer surface can flow into the ground, leaving the sphere's outer surface neutral and the inner surface with -q. Wait, but that would make the sphere have a net charge of -q, which contradicts it being neutral.
