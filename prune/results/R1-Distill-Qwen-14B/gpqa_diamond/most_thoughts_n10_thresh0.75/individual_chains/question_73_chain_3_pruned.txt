Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem states that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. The question asks for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, right. When dealing with relative velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics. I remember the formula for relativistic velocity addition. Let me think. Oh right, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/c²). But wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction, so u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c. Wait, no, no. Wait, the relative velocity would be the velocity of astronaut 2 as seen from astronaut 1's frame. Or is it the other way around? Oh, the question says 'relative speed' so it's the speed between them, regardless of direction. So which astronaut's frame are we looking at?

Wait no, the problem is asking for the relative speed between the two astronauts. So from astronaut A's perspective, how fast is astronaut B moving, and vice versa. But since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference in their speeds, but adjusted for relativity.

So I think the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Let me plug in u = 0.
