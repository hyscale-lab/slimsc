Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. It's about nuclear decay, which I remember a bit from my studies. Let's try to work through it step by step.

The question describes a decay process where two nucleons of flavor A convert into two B's, emitting two E particles and two V particles. The reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. It's given that the E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with some maximum value Q as the endpoint.

Then, there's a variant where instead of emitting two V particles, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. The question is about how the energy spectrum of E particles changes in this variant compared to the original decay.

Hmm, I need to think about how the decay process and the emitted particles affect the energy spectrum of E. So, let's break this down.

First, in the original decay, two E particles are emitted. I remember that in beta decay, electrons (which are like E here) have a continuous spectrum because the decay involves conservation of energy and momentum, leading to a range of possible energies. The maximum energy (endpoint) occurs when the other particles (like neutrinos) take away the least possible energy. So for two E particles, their energies vary, but each can't exceed Q. But wait, maybe the maximum energy per E is Q/2? Or does Q refer to the total energy available?

Wait, in the original problem, the E particles have a continuous spectrum with endpoint Q. That implies that each E particle can have energy up to Q. But wait, wait—if two E's are emitted, their energies would sum up to something. But the question says the total energy spectrum of outgoing E's is continuous up to Q. So perhaps the maximum total energy of the two E's is Q, meaning each can have up to Q but in reality, their energies sum to less than Q. Or maybe the maximum possible energy for each E is Q, but that can't be because two E's would have to share the available energy. So maybe the maximum for each is Q, but that doesn't make sense because if each E could go up to Q, the total would be 2Q, but the available energy is limited.

Wait, no. Let me think again. In the original decay, the combined energy of the E particles (like two electrons) can't exceed Q. So the maximum energy any single E can have is Q, but actually, since there are two, their maximum combined is Q. So each can't have more than Q, but in reality, when one is at max Q, the other would have zero, but that's not possible because they're emitted together, so both must have some positive energy. So the spectrum of each E would be from 0 up to Q, but their sum can't exceed Q. So the total energy of the two E's is Q, and each can vary from 0 to Q, but their sum is always Q. Wait, no, that would mean the E's are emitted with a fixed total energy Q. But that's not the case because the E may share the energy in various ways, but why would the spectrum be continuous?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The total energy
