Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to break it down. Let's see what the question says. 

So, there are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both have circular orbits. 

The first thing, the RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift is periodic and depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period, I think. 

The given data: Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1's. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method formula involves the velocity semi-amplitude, which relates to the Doppler shift. The formula is something like K = (v) where v is the velocity, which causes the spectral line shift. The relationship between K and the orbital period involves the mass of the planet and the star.

Wait, the formula I think is K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (P * 2π) )^(1/3) ), but since e is zero (circular orbits), that term goes away. Also, M_p is much smaller than M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, which is solar mass, so that's convenient.

Alternatively, I think the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's orbital period (P), its mass (M_p), and the star's mass (M_*, which is solar here). 

But wait, the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star in the orbit. The Doppler shift is proportional to this K. So if K is larger, the shift is larger.

So, the shift observed is directly proportional to K. So, if Planet #1's shift is 5 milliangstroms and #2 is 7, then K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

But how does K relate to the orbital period? 

I remember the formula for K is given by:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( ( M_* + M_p )^(1/3) * (a (1 - e²)) )) )^(1/3) ) / ( P * (2π) )

Wait, maybe I should look for a simpler relation. Since both planets are around the same mass stars, and the star's mass is the same, and the planets have the same mass (Neptune-like), then perhaps there's a relation between K and the orbital period.

Wait, the formula for K is:

K = [ ( G * P )^(1/3) * ( M_p * sin i ) ] / [ ( ( M_* + M_p )^(2/3) ) * (2 π)^(1/3) ) ]

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

K ≈ ( ( G^(1/3) * (M_p)^(1/3) * sin i ) ) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) * (2 π)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula that connects K and the period P. Another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Alternatively, I remember that for a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2 π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )

Since M_p is much less than M_*, this simplifies to:

K ≈ (2 π G)^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) )

So, rearranging:

K = ( (2 π G )^(1/3) * M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Let me denote the constants. Let me write K proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), so K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). Or, in another way, P^(1/3) ∝ 1/K.

So, if K2 is larger than K1, then P2^ (1/3) is smaller than P1^(1/3), which implies that P2 is smaller than P1? Wait, that can't be right because the question is about how many times longer P2 is than P1.

Wait, no, let's think again. If K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_*) )^(2/3) * (1/ P^(1/3)), then if K increases, P^(1/3) decreases, so P decreases.

So, if K2 is larger than K1 (7>5), then P2 is smaller than P1. So, the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1. So, the ratio P2/P1 would be less than 1, meaning the period of planet 2 is shorter.

Wait, but the question is asking "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So that's P2 / P1.

If P2 is shorter, then P2/P1 is less than 1.

So, the options are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So, which one is it?

Let me go back to the formula.

K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)).

Let me write this as K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3).

Wait, let me think again:

K1 is the shift for planet 1: 5 mA.

K2 is the shift for planet 2: 7 mA.

So, K2 = (7/5) K1.

But K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so:

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

=> (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Cube both sides:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

So (5^3)/(7^3) = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 ≈ 0.364.

Which is approximately 0.36 times.

So the answer is A) ~0.36.

Wait, but wait. Another approach. Let's think about the ratio of K1 and K2.

Because K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_* )^(2/3) * 1/(P^(1/3)).

Assuming M_p and M_* are the same for both planets, then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So,

K1 = 5, K2=7.

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

=> (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

Calculating 5^3 is 125, 7^3 is 343.

125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So yes, P2 is about 0.36 times longer than P1? No, wait.

Wait, wait! I'm a bit confused here. Let me clarify.

If K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then when P increases, K decreases.

So, if K2 > K1, then P2 < P1.

Because K2 is larger, that implies a smaller P.

Wait, but the question is asking P2's period compared to P1. So P2 is shorter, so the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1.

In our calculation, P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364.

Which is about 0.36 times, meaning P2 is 0.36 times P1. So P2 is shorter.

So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That is, P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So it's shorter; the answer would be approximately 0.36 times. So the correct option is A.

Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up the ratio. Let me recheck.

The formula we derived was:

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So,

(5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Cubing both sides gives (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

Which is approximately 0.36. So P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. So P2 is shorter.

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the answer is A.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift, \( K \), is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), assuming the star's mass dominates over the planet's mass. This relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

For Planet #1 and Planet #2, the observed Doppler shifts are 5 milliangstroms and 7 milliangstroms, respectively. Since \( K \) is proportional to the Doppler shift, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{7}{5}
\]

Using the relationship \( K \propto P^{-1/3} \), we can write:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \):

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \):

\[
\frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, \( P_2 \approx 0.364 \, P_1 \), meaning the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Therefore, the orbital period of Planet #2 is about 0.36 times longer than that of Planet #1.

Answer: A
