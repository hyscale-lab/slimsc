Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's go through it.

The question starts with heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH. I remember that when dihalides react with a strong base like KOH, they usually undergo elimination reactions, especially if it's a vicinal dihalide. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. Oh right, adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four fused cyclohexane rings. So the molecule is pretty rigid.

Heating with KOH would likely lead to an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. Because KOH is a strong base, it would deprotonate and then eliminate a molecule of HBr. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—elimination could occur between C1 and C2 or C2 and C3, but wait, 1 and 3 are adjacent? No, wait, in adamantane, positions 1 and 3 are across a bridge. Hmm. Maybe the structure allows for the formation of a more substituted double bond. Since elimination typically favors the most substituted (Zaitsev's rule), the base would abstract a β-hydrogen leading to the most stable alkene.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms an epoxide? Wait, no—epoxides form from dihalides when treated with a base like KO
