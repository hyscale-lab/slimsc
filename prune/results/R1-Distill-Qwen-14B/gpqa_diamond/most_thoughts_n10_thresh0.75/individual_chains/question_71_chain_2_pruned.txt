Okay, so I've got this problem about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. The question says there are five planets with orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. They're in orbital resonance and have circular orbits. We're supposed to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet 4 and Planet 2. All planets have the same albedo, so albedo doesn't come into play here.

Wait, equilibrium temperature. I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature. It's based on the inverse square law, right? The formula is T = T_0 * sqrt(R/(2a)), where T_0 is the star's effective temperature, R is the star's radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance. Or wait, maybe it's T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4). Oh wait, no, since albedo is the same for all planets, it cancels out when taking the ratio. So yeah, the albedo doesn't affect the ratio, which is good because we don't need to worry about that.

But wait, another version of the formula I saw is T = ( ( L ) / (16 * π * σ * (4π a²) ) )^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity. Hmm, maybe that's more accurate. Wait, the star emits L, and the planet absorbs it. The equilibrium temperature would then be based on how much energy the planet absorbs and how much it emits. The incoming flux is L/(4πa²) because the star's light spreads out over a sphere of radius a. The planet's cross-section is πr², but it's a disk, so maybe it's like (L/(4πa²)) * πr². Then the planet radiates as a blackbody with surface area 4πr². So the energy balance equation would be (L/(4πa²)) * πr² * (1 - albedo) = 4πr² σ T^4. Oh wait, the albedo is the fraction reflected, so the absorbed is (1 - albedo) times the incident flux. But since all have same albedo, when taking the ratio, it cancels out.

Let me simplify. The equilibrium temperature formula is T = [ (L (1 - A) ) / (16 π σ a²) ]^(1/4). So T is proportional to sqrt( (1 - A) )^(1/2) divided by a. But since A is same for all, (1-A) is same, so T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So the temperature depends only on the square root of the inverse of the orbital distance. But how does orbital distance relate to the orbital period?

Oh right, Kepler's third law. The orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis (a) by P² = (4π²/GM) a³. So a³ is proportional to P², so a is proportional to P^(2/3). So a = k P^(2/3), where k is some constant.

So putting it all together. The equilibrium temperature T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a
