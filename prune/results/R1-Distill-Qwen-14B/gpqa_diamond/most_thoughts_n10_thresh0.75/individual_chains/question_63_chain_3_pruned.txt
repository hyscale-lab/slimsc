Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diatomic molecules and quantum models. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, no, maybe the rigid rotor is different. Oh right, the rigid rotor model assumes the bond length is fixed, but the non-rigid one allows for some stretching, so it's like the vibration comes into play there.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So for vibration, I think the ground state is n=0. And for rotation, the ground state is when the rotational quantum number is the lowest, which is J=0, maybe? Or wait, no, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational states are quantized with J being an integer, starting from 0.

But wait, the question is about moving to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule is absorbing a photon, increasing its energy. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

The problem gives me some data: masses of X and Y are 20 amu and 2 amu, respectively. Bond length R is 2 angstroms, and angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

So the molecule's model combines both rotation and vibration. To switch to the next state with the lowest energy, I think the photon must be absorbed in a way that the molecule moves to the next higher energy state. But in quantum mechanics, transitions are quantized.

Wait, but what's the next state? If the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy, probably n=0 for vibration and J=0 for rotation. So the next state could either be the next vibrational state (n=1) or the next rotational state (J=1), whichever has lower energy. But that depends on whether the vibrational or rotational energy levels are lower in spacing.

Wait, the problem says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So we need to find which transition (rotational or vibrational) requires the least energy, and thus the photon with that energy.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about a pure vibrational transition, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is about a diatomic molecule in its fundamental state, switching
