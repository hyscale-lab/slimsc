Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diatomic molecules and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that the molecule is in its fundamental state and needs to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy when it absorbs a photon. So, I guess this involves both rotational and vibrational energy transitions.

Wait, the model they're using is the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, because unlike the rigid rotor model where the bond length is fixed, the non-rigid one allows the bond to stretch a bit, so rotation and vibration are treated together.

But wait, the question is about the momentum of the absorbed photon. So, the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the initial and final states of the molecule.

The molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. When it absorbs a photon, it moves to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, that must be the first excited state.

Wait, what's the fundamental state in this context? Let me clarify. For a diatomic molecule, the fundamental vibrational state is the ground state, n=0. But in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. So the energy levels have both contributions.

But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, wait, perhaps it's the next higher energy state, which would be the first excited state. So, the energy difference would be the energy of the first excited state minus the fundamental state.

Alternatively, maybe the fundamental state is the lowest energy, so what's the next state? It could be the next vibrational state (n=1) or the next rotational state (like J increases by 1), but which one is considered the next lowest?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The molecule's energy can have rotational and vibrational parts. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w, where n is the vibrational quantum number.

But the total energy is a combination of both. The fundamental state is the lowest, which would be n=0 and J=0. The next possible state would be either n=1 (vibrational excitation) or J=1 (rotational
