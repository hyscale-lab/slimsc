Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, have been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. The researchers want to observe the one more likely to transit, which would give them a better chance of detecting it via the transit method. They have limited time, so they need to choose wisely.

Both planets have the same mass, which is interesting. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is, say, 300 days, Planet_1's is 100 days. Since the periods are shorter, Planet_1 is orbiting much closer to its star.

The host stars have different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Usually, more massive stars are larger, but maybe Planet_2's star is slightly evolved, like a subgiant or something, so it hasn't expanded yet. So both stars have the same radius.

The question is about the probability of a transit. I remember that the probability depends on the orbital inclination and the size of the planet relative to the star. The transit probability is higher when the planet's orbit is edge-on relative to us, but only a fraction of the time would that be the case. The probability also depends on the star's size and the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, the transit probability formula, if I recall correctly, is roughly (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by (a / (2R_star)), or something along those lines. Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1/(sqrt(1 - e²))) or something with the orbital distance. But since the orbits are circular, eccentricity e is zero, so that term goes away.

Wait, no, the main formula for the probability of a transit is (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1 / (a (1 - e²)^(1/2))) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about it differently.

I think the probability of a transit is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / a), or some
