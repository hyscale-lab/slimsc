Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and 1H NMR spectra. The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Hmm, that's got 9 carbons, 11 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and two oxygen atoms. So, possible functional groups could be amide, ester, maybe a ketone or something else. Let's look at the data.

First, the IR data. There are medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm^-1. Those usually indicate N-H or O-H stretches. The strong band at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, amide, or maybe an acid. But since there's no broad peak around 2500-3300 that would suggest an -OH (like in a carboxylic acid), maybe it's an amide or ester. Wait, but amides have N-H stretches which are usually around 3300 cm^-1, possibly split into two because of the two N-H groups. Oh wait, the IR here has two peaks: 3420 and 3325. That could be two different types of N-H, maybe an amide and something else, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps one is from an amine and the other from an amide. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic amine or something else.

Then, looking at the 1H NMR. Let's break it down.

1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H. That's probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad singlet, maybe an -OCH2- group. Or perhaps an NH2, but NH protons usually are broad, but in this case, maybe it's an oxygenated CH2. Alternatively, maybe this is an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, but wait, the triplet at 1.2 suggests another part of an ethyl group. So perhaps we have
