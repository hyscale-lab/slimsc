Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the area of a pseudosphere from the given metric. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry, right? But wait, I'm a bit rusty on the exact details. Let me think.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So, this looks like a line element in two dimensions, probably in some kind of space that's curved. I think the denominator being 4 - x² - y² suggests that there's a radius involved. Oh wait, wait, the problem states it's a pseudosphere with radius r=2. So 4 is (2)^2, which makes sense.

I remember that the area element in a metric like this would involve the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. So for a metric ds² = g_{xx} dx² + 2g_{xy} dx dy + g_{yy} dy², the area element dA is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. But in this case, since it's diagonal (no cross terms), the determinant is just (g_xx * g_yy). 

So, let me write that down. The metric is diagonal, so the determinant g is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]^2. Wait no, because g_xx is 32/(4 - x² - y²) and same for g_yy, right? Because (dx² + dy²) is multiplied by that factor.

Wait, no, the given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So the metric tensor components are g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), g_yy = same as g_xx, and g_xy = 0. So the determinant g is g_xx * g_yy = [32/(4 - r²)]² where r² is x² + y². But wait, I think the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, but since g is positive here, it's just g dx dy, but wait, no—wait, the area element in 2D is sqrt(det g) dx dy. Wait, no, the determinant itself is (g_xx * g_yy - g_xy²) which in this case is [32/(4 - r²)]². So the square root of the determinant is 32/(4 - r²), because sqrt of something squared is the absolute value, but since the denominator is positive within the domain, it's just 32/(4 - r²).

Wait, so the area element dA is (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy, where r² = x² + y². But dx dy is the area element in the x-y plane, right? So to find the area, we need to integrate dA over all x and y where the metric is defined.

But what's the domain of x and y? The denominator 4 - x² - y² must be positive to have real values, so 4 - r² > 0 → r² < 4 → r < 2. So the x and y are such that x² + y² < 4. So that's a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

Wait, but that's the domain. So the
