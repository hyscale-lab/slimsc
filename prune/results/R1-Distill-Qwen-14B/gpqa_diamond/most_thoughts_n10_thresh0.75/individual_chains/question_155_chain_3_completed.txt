Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

So, the question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, denoted as ΔP_z. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). Right, so I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared for the given state.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ℏ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). And the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which I think are the standard basis vectors since P_z is diagonal in that basis.

First, let me write down the state vector. Let me denote it as |ψ⟩. So,

|ψ⟩ = [ -1/2,
          1/sqrt(2),
          -1/2 ]^T

Wait, no, actually, the first element is -1/2, the second is 1/sqrt(2), and the third is -1/2. So yeah, that's our state. 

Now, to find the expectation value of P_z, ⟨P_z⟩, I need to compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩. Since P_z is a diagonal matrix, this should be straightforward. Let me write down P_z's matrix form again.

P_z matrix:
[ ℏ     0       0     ]
[ 0     0       0     ]
[ 0     0    -ℏ ]

So, each diagonal element is ℏ, 0, -ℏ. Wait, no, wait. The first row is (ℏ, 0, 0), second row is (0,0,0), third row is (0,0,-ℏ). So, the diagonal elements are ℏ, 0, -ℏ.

So, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding P_z eigenvalue, weighted by the square of the amplitude. Because when the basis is the eigenbasis, the expectation value is just the sum of |c_i|^2 * λ_i, where λ_i are the eigenvalues.

Let me compute that. The components of |ψ⟩ are:

c1 = -1/2
c2 = 1/sqrt(2)
c3 = -1/2

So, |c1|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4
|c2|^2 = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2
|c3|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4

The eigenvalues are ℏ, 0, -ℏ.

So, ⟨P_z⟩ = |c1|^2 * ℏ + |c2|^2 * 0 + |c3|^2 * (-ℏ)
= (1/4)*ℏ + 0 + (1/4)*(-ℏ)
= (1/4 - 1/4) * ℏ
= 0 * ℏ
= 0

Wait, that's zero. Interesting. So the expectation of P_z is zero.

Next, I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the square of each diagonal element.

So, P_z² has diagonal elements (ℏ)^2, 0^2, (-ℏ)^2. So, that's ℏ², 0, ℏ².

So, ⟨P_z²⟩ is |c1|^2*(ℏ)^2 + |c2|^2*(0)^2 + |c3|^2*(ℏ)^2
= (1/4)*ℏ² + 0 + (1/4)*ℏ²
= (1/4 + 1/4) * ℏ²
= (1/2) * ℏ².

So, ⟨P_z²⟩ = (ℏ²)/2.

Now, the uncertainty is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). We have ⟨P_z⟩=0, so ⟨P_z⟩² is zero. So,

ΔP_z = sqrt( (ℏ²/2) - 0 ) = sqrt(ℏ²/2) = ℏ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ℏ/sqrt(2), which matches this result.

Alternatively, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me double-check the calculations.

The state is |ψ⟩ with components:

c1 = -1/2 → |c1|^2 is 1/4.

c2 = 1/sqrt(2) → |c2|^2 is 1/2.

c3 = -1/2 → |c3|^2 is 1/4.

So, when we compute ⟨P_z⟩, we're multiplying each |ci|^2 by the corresponding eigenvalue.

Eigenvalues for P_z are ℏ (for c1), 0 (c2), and -ℏ (c3).

So, (1/4)*ℏ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ℏ) = (1/4 -1/4)ℏ = 0. Correct.

For ⟨P_z²⟩, the eigenvalues squared are ℏ², 0, ℏ².

So, (1/4)*ℏ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ℏ² = (1/4 +1/4)ℏ² = 1/2 ℏ². So sqrt(1/2 ℏ²) is ℏ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

So the uncertainty is ℏ/sqrt(2), which is option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix form of $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar, 0, -\hbar$ along the diagonal:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |c_1|^2 \cdot \hbar + |c_2|^2 \cdot 0 + |c_3|^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]

where $|c_1|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4$, $|c_2|^2 = (1/\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/2$, and $|c_3|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4$. Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix $P_z^2$ is obtained by squaring the eigenvalues of $P_z$:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |c_1|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |c_2|^2 \cdot 0 + |c_3|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting $|c_1|^2 = 1/4$, $|c_2|^2 = 1/2$, and $|c_3|^2 = 1/4$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, we have:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
