Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

Let me start by understanding what the question is asking. The key point is that each spectrograph can observe stars up to a certain apparent V magnitude. ESPRESSO can handle stars brighter than 17 V mag, and HIRES up to 16 V mag. Wait, no, waitâ€”ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, meaning V <17? Or wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh wait, in astronomy, lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So if a star's V magnitude is smaller than 17, it's brighter, so ESPRESSO can observe it. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with V brighter than 16 mag, so their V <16.

Wait, no, no. Let me clarify. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. So, brighter means lower magnitude. So, any star with V <17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, stars with V <16 can be observed.

Wait, but the question is which stars can be detected with both spectrographs. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be less than 17 for ESP
