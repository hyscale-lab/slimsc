Okay, I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of all this. But let's take it step by step. So, the question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck.

Hmm, I remember that these spectrographs have different capabilities. From what I've read before, ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait, brighter is a lower magnitude, right? So lower numbers are brighter. So ESPRESSO can see stars up to V=17. But HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. Oh, wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 can be observedâ€”so that means apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17, because higher magnitudes are fainter. Because 'brighter than 17' would be magnitude 16 or lower. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so up to 16 mag or lower.

Wait, no, wait. The question says, for ESPRESSO, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh, wait, no. Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. Oh, no, no: "brighter than X" in magnitude terms means lower numbers. So
