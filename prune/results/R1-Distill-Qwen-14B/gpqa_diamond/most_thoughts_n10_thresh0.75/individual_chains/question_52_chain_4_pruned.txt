Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, it's about stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots on the star affect the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the star normally has a Teff of 6000 K when no spots are present. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, how does that work? Oh right, spots are cooler regions, so when they cover part of the surface, the average temperature decreases. But what's the effect on the photosphere?

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). The ratio decreases when the star has spots. And we need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when there are no spots compared to when there are spots.

I remember from my studies that in stellar atmospheres, the ratio of populations in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2-E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.

Wait, but since the transition corresponds to a particular wavelength, that must relate to the energy difference between the levels. Using the relation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is wavelength. The given wavelength is 1448 Å, which is 1448 Angstroms or 0.1448 nanometers.

So the energy difference ΔE = hc/λ. But when we plug this into the Boltzmann factor, it'll be (ΔE)/(k T) = (hc)/(λ k T).

Wait, so the ratio n2/n1 depends on temperature as exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

But wait, in the problem, the ratio is n1/n2, or n2/n1? The question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Let's think: when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K). So the ratio is higher when there's no spots, or lower?

Wait, the ratio when the star has spots is lower. So when the star is cooler (spots present), the ratio (n1/n2 or n2/n1?) is lower.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify.

Suppose the star has a higher Teff when no spots (6000 K) and lower when spots (5500 K). The question says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when T goes down, the ratio decreases.

Assuming the ratio is n1/n2. Let's see.

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), but wait, wait, no. Wait, the Boltzmann equation is n_i = n_j * (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if
