Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

Alright, the question is about stars with and without spots. So when a star has spots, like sunspots, its overall effective temperature changes. In this case, when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the effective temperature drops from 6000 K to 5500 K. But wait, that seems like a big drop. Oh, but wait, maybe the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. Yeah, I remember that sunspots are darker and cooler regions.

The main part of the question is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. So the ratio is n1/n2, right? And this ratio changes when the star has spots. They observed that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when there are spots, n1/n2 is lower than when there are no spots.

Wait, the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes. So we need to compare the ratio without spots to the ratio with spots. So factor = (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

But wait, what determines the ratio n1/n2? Oh right, in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, E_i and E_j are the energies, and T is the temperature.

So for two energy levels, level 1 and level 2, let's say level 1 has lower energy than level 2 (so E1 < E2). Then the ratio would be n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T) ). Wait, no, because E1 is lower, E_i - E_j would be negative, so the exponential becomes exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ), which is positive.

Wait, but wait, in the problem, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. That's about 1448 Angstroms. Let me think, 1448 Å is in
