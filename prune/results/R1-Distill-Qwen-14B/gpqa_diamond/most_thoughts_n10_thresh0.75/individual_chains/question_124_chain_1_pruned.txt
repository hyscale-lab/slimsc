Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, let me try to break it down. Alright, the setup is that particles are being collided at the center of a spherical detector. They produce new particles that travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, specifically with a Lorentz factor of around 20 on average. 

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? Yeah, gamma equals the total energy divided by the rest mass energy, and for ultra-relativistic particles, gamma is much larger than 1. So that's given as 20, and the particles are fast-decaying. So they don't live long and just move until they decay, I suppose.

The problem says that on average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector's inner walls. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. So the question is asking, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls? So we need to find a new gamma value where 2/3 of the particles make it to the detector walls instead of 1/3.

Hmm, why does the fraction change? I think it's about the speed and the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector walls. If particles are moving faster, they can cover the distance in less time, which might influence whether they decay before reaching the wall. So the decay length probably plays a role here.

Wait, decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. The formula for decay length is L = gamma * c * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime of the particle, and gamma is the Lorentz factor. Right, because from the lab frame, the lifetime is dilated by gamma, so the particle lives longer and can travel further.

So, if a particle's decay length is longer than the detector's radius, it's more likely to decay before reaching the wall. Wait, no, wait. If the decay length is longer, that means it can travel a longer distance before decaying, so particles with longer decay lengths are more likely to reach the detector walls, because they don't decay as quickly. Wait, I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, let me think again. The decay length L is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. If L is longer than the radius of the detector, then a particle has a higher chance of decaying before reaching the
