Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about the elemental abundances in two stars. Hmm, I remember that when they give abundance ratios like [Si/Fe], it's the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of those elements compared to the Sun. Right, the brackets mean log base 10 of (element ratio divided by Sun's ratio). 

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, I need to find [n_Si1 / n_Si2]. 

Let me jot down the given data:

For Star_1:
- Mass = 1.5 solar masses.
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So, [Si/Fe] = log10(n_Si1 / n_Fe1) - log10(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) = 0.3.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So, [Fe/H] is the log of (n_Fe1 / n_H1) divided by (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) equals 0. That means n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

For Star_2:
- Mass = 1.2 solar masses.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. So, [Mg/Si] = log10(n_Mg2 / n_Si2) - log10(n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) = 0.3.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0. So, n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun.

Wait, and what's the solar photospheric composition? Given:

12 + log10(n_Fe/n_H)_sun =7.5. So, log(n_Fe/n_H) =7.5 -12= -4.5. So, n_Fe/n_H = 10^(-4.5).

Similarly, 12 + log10(n_Mg/n_H)_sun =7. So, log(n_Mg/n_H) =7-12= -5. So, n_Mg/n_H_sun =10^(-5).

Wait, but to get the ratios between elements, like [n_Si1 / n_Si2], I think I need to relate each star's silicon abundance to another element.

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe express each star's silicon in terms of hydrogen, then find the ratio.

Starting with Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3. Which is log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) - log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) =0.3.

So, n_Si1 / n_Fe1 = 10^(0.3) * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun).

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So, n_Fe1 / n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

So, n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1.

But wait, n_H1 is the number density of hydrogen in Star_1. Similarly for Star_2.

But I'm not sure about the exact star's hydrogen abundances, but maybe I can relate their silicon relative to hydrogen.

Wait, maybe I can express n_Si1 in terms of n_H1.

Because from [Fe/H]_1=0, which is (n_Fe1/n_H1) = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun). So, n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1.

Then, [Si/Fe]_1 = log10( (n_Si1 / n_Fe1) / (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) ) = 0.3.

So, (n_Si1 / n_Fe1
