Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem here. Let's see what it's about. Alright, the question is about determining the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as a star with spots. Hmm.

Wait, the setup is that the star has a hemisphere covered in dark spots. The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. But wait, the star's total area is a sphere, so only one hemisphere is spotty, but each hemisphere has spots covering 20% of its surface.

But the key is that the brightness variation observed is similar to what an exoplanet would cause. So, when the planet transits in front of the star, it blocks some of the star's light. The variation depends on the area blocked relative to the star's total area.

Right, so the idea is to compare the two scenarios: one where spots cause the variation, and the other where a planet does. We need the amplitude of the variation caused by an exoplanet to match that caused by the spots.

Wait, but in the problem, the star isn't covered by spots, so we're to calculate the planet's radius. Oh, wait, the problem says, "if the star was not covered by spots!", so we have to imagine the same observed variation is caused by a planet instead.

So first, I should calculate the change in brightness due to the spots. Then, compare that to the change caused by
