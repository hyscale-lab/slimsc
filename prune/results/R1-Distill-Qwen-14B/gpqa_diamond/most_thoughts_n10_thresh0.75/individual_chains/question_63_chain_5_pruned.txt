Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused about where to start. Let me read it again.

The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that's absorbed so the molecule moves to the next state with the lowest possible energy. 

The given data are masses Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The options are various momenta, so I need to calculate which one is correct.

Hmm. I remember that in molecular spectroscopy, transitions involve both vibrational and rotational energy changes. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state, which is v=0. But when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can either change vibrational states or rotational states.

Wait, the problem says it's switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think that's the next higher energy state, but what's the nature of that state? I think in the rigid rotor model, you have quantized rotational levels, and in the vibration model, quantized vibrational levels. But when the molecule is in its fundamental state, perhaps it's the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So when it absorbs a photon, it could go to the next vibrational state or the next rotational state. Which one requires less energy?

I remember that in diatomic molecules, the vibrational energy levels are usually quantized as (n + 1/2) ħω, where ω is the angular frequency. The fundamental state is n=0. The next vibrational state would be n=1. The energy difference between these is ΔE_vibrational = (1 + 1/2)ħω - (0 + 1/2)ħω = ħω. 

On the other hand, rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, and J is the rotational quantum number. The ground state for rotation is J=0. The next state would be J=1, so the energy difference is E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = B*(1)(2) - 0 = 2B. 

So which energy difference is smaller? It depends on the values of B and ω. But I don't know B yet. Let me think about how to find B.

The rotational constant B is given by (ħ)/(2 I), where I is the moment of inertia. I is μ R², and μ is the reduced mass. The reduced mass μ is (Mx My)/(Mx + My). 

Let me compute μ first. Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Wait, but we need to convert that into kilograms because Planck's constant has units in kg·m²/s.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's calculate that. 1.818 * 1.6605 is roughly 3.018e-27 kg.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R is 2e-10 m.

So I = μ R² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2. Let's compute that. (2e-10)^2 is 4e-20 m². So I = 3.018e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2072e-46 kg·m².

Then B = ħ/(2I). The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So B = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1.2072e-46) → let me compute denominator: 2.4144e-46. So B ≈ 1.05457e-34 / 2.4144e-46 ≈ approximately 4.367e11 s^-2.

Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check calculations. I think I might have made a mistake.

Wait, let me redo I: 

μ = (20 * 2) / (22) amu = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ approx 3.018e-27 kg.

R = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 * 4e-20 → 1.2072e-46 kg·m². 

Then B = ħ/(2I) = (1.05457e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1.2072e-46 kg·m²) → denominator is 2.4144e-46. So 1.05457e-34 / 2.4144e-46 ≈ approximately 4.368e+11 s^-2. 

That's the rotational constant B. Now, the energy for rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is 2B. Because E_rot(J=1) is B *1*(1+1) = 2B, and E_rot(J=0) is 0.

So the energy difference for rotation is 2B = 2 * 4.368e11 ≈ 8.736e11 J? Wait no, since B is in units of s^-2, and the energy is in joules.

Wait, B is in 1/s², so 2B is in 1/s². But energy is (ħ²)/(something), so perhaps I should compute it correctly.

Wait, E_rot = B J (J+1). For J=0, E=0. For J=1, E=2B. So the energy difference is 2B, which is in J.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, B is in Joule·s²? Let me think again. Because E_rot is (ħ²)/(2I) * J (J+1). Because, E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) J (J+1), so the rotational constant B is (ħ²/(2I)). So B has units of J·s²? Or wait, let's compute.

Wait, ħ has units J·s. I is kg·m². So ħ²/(2I) → (J² s²)/(kg m²). Let's see: J is kg·m²/s². So, J² is kg² m^4 / s^4. Multiply by s² gives kg² m^4 / s^2. Divide by kg m² → gives kg m² / s². Which is J, because J is kg m²/s². So B has units of J.

Wait, that makes more sense. So, the rotational energy is in J. But earlier I thought B was 4e11 s^-2, but that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in unit conversion.

Wait, let me recalculate B again carefully.

I = μ R² = (3.018e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2072e-46 kg·m².

ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s.

B = ħ²/(2 I) → (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.2072e-46) → Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (since 1e-34 squared is 1e-68).

Denominator: 2 * 1.2072e-46 = 2.4144e-46.

So B ≈ (1.112e-68) / (2.4144e-46) → approximately 4.607e-23 J.

Wait, that makes more sense because B is in J. So the energy for the rotational transition is 2B = 2 * 4.607e-23 J ≈ 9.214e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational transition energy is ħ ω. Let's compute that.

ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s. ω is 4e14 rad/s. So ħ ω = 1.05457e-34 * 4e14 ≈ 4.218e-
