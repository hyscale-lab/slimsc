Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Wait, what's the fundamental state? Oh right, I think that refers to the lowest energy state, like the ground state where both rotation and vibration are at their lowest levels. So, the molecule is in the ground vibrational state and the ground rotational state. Now, when it absorbs a photon, it moves to the next lowest state.

Wait, but how does that transition happen? In the quantum rotation model, the energy levels are quantized. For rotation, the energy levels are given by something like E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For vibration, the energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w, where v is the vibrational quantum number.

In the fundamental state, both v and J are at their lowest. So v=0 (vibronic ground state) and J=0 (rotational ground state). But when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions. But what's the next lowest state? There are a couple of possibilities: either it could increase the vibrational state, or the rotational state, or maybe both.

Wait, the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So that would be the state with the smallest possible energy increment. So what's the smallest
