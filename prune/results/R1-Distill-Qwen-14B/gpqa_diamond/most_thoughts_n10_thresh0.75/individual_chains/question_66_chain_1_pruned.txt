Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that when you're dealing with effective field theories, certain symmetries are important because they constrain the possible operators you can have.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Let me think about each one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think that's a fundamental symmetry in relativity. Effective theories should respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory. Since the Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, SMEFT, which is a low-energy limit, should too. So all operators must preserve Lorentz symmetry. So option 1 is correct.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Because SMEFT is a field theory, it should respect all the Poincare symmetries. So operators should be invariant under Poincare transformations. But wait, the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators. Since Poincare includes Lorentz, and all operators have to respect Lorentz, but do they also have to respect Poincare? I think yes because field theories generally have Poincare symmetry. So option 2 is correct as well.

Now, CP symmetry. CP is Charge conjugation plus Parity. The Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry, right? There's CP violation in the CKM matrix. So SMEFT operators might include terms that violate CP. So I don't think all operators in SMEFT must respect CP. Therefore, option 3 is not necessarily required.

CPT symmetry is different. I remember that in quantum field theory, CPT is a fundamental symmetry. That is, every operator must respect CPT symmetry because it's part of the structure of the theory. So option 4 is correct.

Putting it all together, the operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait about Poincare. Because the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory but also Poincare-invariant because it's a field theory. So all operators must be Poincare-invariant. So yes, 1 and 2 are correct.

Wait, but the options are options A)1,2; C)1,2,4; D)1,3,4. So
