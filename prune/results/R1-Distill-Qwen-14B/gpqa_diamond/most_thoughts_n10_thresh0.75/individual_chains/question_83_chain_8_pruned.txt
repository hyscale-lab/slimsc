Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

First, I need to remember some concepts about titrations and buffer solutions. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so this is a weak acid-strong base titration. 

Let me break this down into parts: the initial dilution, then the titration.

Part 1: Initial Dilution
The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L), and it's 0.05 M. When we dilute it with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.040 L). 

So, the concentration after dilution can be calculated using M1V1 = M2V2. 

M1 = 0.05 M, V1 = 0.020 L, V2 = 0.040 L.

M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 * 0.020) / 0.040 = (0.001) / 0.040 = 0.025 M.

Wait, let me double-check that. 0.05 * 0.02 is 0.001 moles. Volume is doubled, so concentration is halved. So yes, 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Part 2: Titrating with NaOH
We're titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. So, the first thing is to find out the equivalence point.

Equivalence Point Calculation:
At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid initially.

Moles of acetic acid initially: M = 0.025 M, V = 0.040 L. Moles = 0.025 * 0.040 = 0.001 mol.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. So, moles NaOH = 0.1 * V = 0.001. So, V = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But wait, the question is about 25% titration. So, 25% of the way to the equivalence point. So, 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added.

So, for both the 25% point and the equivalence point, I need to calculate the pH.

Let me tackle each part separately.

First, the 25% titration point.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added. Let's find the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Since acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacts with NaOH (a strong base) in a 1:1 ratio, the moles of CH3COOH and its conjugate base (CH3COO^-) can be found.

Initial moles of CH3COOH: 0.001 mol (from earlier). When we add 0.00025 mol of OH-, it reacts to form 0.00025 mol of CH3COO^- and reduces the CH3COOH to (0.001 - 0.00025) = 0.00075 mol.

So, now the solution is a buffer solution containing both acetic acid and its conjugate base. The total volume is initial solution (40 cm³) + 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So, 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

The concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L = approximately 0.017647 M.
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M.

The pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

First, calculate pKa. Given Ka = 1.85e-5. So, pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)).

Wait, pKa is -log(Ka). So, pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let's compute that.

Log(1.85) is approximately 0.267 (since log(2)=0.301, log(1.8)=0.2553, so 1.85 is about 0.267). So, 5 orders of magnitude: pKa ≈ 4.737.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. Let
