Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, it's about a diatomic molecule modeled with the quantum rotation-vibration model or the non-rigid rotor model. The question is about what momentum a photon should have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state.

Alright, the molecule is in its fundamental state. Wait, wait, what's the fundamental state? Oh right, I think in the context of a diatomic molecule, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the first vibrational level (v=0) and the lowest rotational state, which is usually the ground rotational state, maybe J=0 or J=1? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Oh wait, for a rigid rotor, the ground state is J=0, but the non-rigid rotor model might have a different approach. But I think the basics are similar regarding the energy levels.

So the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I'll assume is the lowest vibrational and rotational state. Now, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I think that means it should go to the next higher energy state. But wait, in molecules, transitions can involve changes in both vibrational and rotational energy. Let me think about the selection rules.

For diatomic molecules, the selection rules for vibrational transitions are Δv = ±1. For rotational transitions, it's ΔJ = ±1. But wait, when a photon is absorbed, it can cause a change in either vibrational or rotational energy, or both. But the problem is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, the fundamental state is the lowest possible vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0 or J=1?), so maybe the next state would be either increasing v or J.

Wait, but if the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the next higher state, which could involve either a vibrational transition to v=1, or a rotational transition, say J=1.

But the question is about what momentum the photon should have. So I need to find the energy of the photon that causes the transition.

But wait, the problem gives me the angular frequency of vibration, w = 4e14 rad/s. So the vibrational energy
