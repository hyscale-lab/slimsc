Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule switching energy states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. So I remember that in such models, the molecule's energy comes from both rotational and vibrational states. Oh right, the diatomic has atoms X and Y with given masses and a bond length R.

The molecule is in its fundamental state, so that's the lowest energy state. We need the photon momentum when it absorbs a photon to switch to the next lowest energy state. Wait, but what does that mean exactly? I think the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next state would be the next possible higher state. But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions.

Wait, but when a photon is absorbed, it can cause a transition from the ground state to an excited state. I think the transition could be either vibrational, rotational, or both. But the problem says the photon's momentum is such that the molecule switches to the next lowest possible energy state. So I'm guessing it's the smallest possible energy increment. That would probably be a transition that's allowed by selection rules.

Wait, I remember that in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For a non-rigid rotor, the bond length can change, which complicates things, but I think the problem is still manageable.

But wait, the question is about the photon's momentum. Momentum p is related to energy E via E = p c, but wait, that's for electromagnetic waves, like photons. Oh right, because photons carry momentum equal to E/c. So if I can find the energy of the photon, then I can find its momentum.

So the energy the molecule absorbs must be the energy difference between the initial and final states. The initial state is the fundamental (v=0, J=0). The next possible state—what's the next lowest? It could be either a rotational transition (J=1) from J=0, or a vibrational transition (v=1) from v=0, but which requires less energy.

Wait, let's calculate the energies. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (v + ½) h ν, where ν is the frequency. The rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant.

So the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next possible state could be either v=1, J=0 (just vibrational transition) or v=0, J=1 (rotational transition). To find the next lowest energy, we need to see which transition has lower energy.

What's the formula for B? I think B is given by ħ²/(2 I), where I is the moment of inertia. And I is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

Let me compute the reduced mass μ first. Masses are Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Oh wait, I should convert that into kg because standard units are in SI.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg. Let me compute that: 1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.017, so 3.017e-27 kg.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 20 amu and 2 amu. So Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg. Let me calculate that: 1.818 * 1.6605 is approx 3.017, so 3.017e-27 kg.

The moment of inertia I = μ R². R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m. So I = 3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

Calculating (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m². So I = 3.017e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

Now, B is ħ²/(2 I). ħ is h/(2pi), but I'll use ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.2068e-46) )= 1.112e-68 / 2.4136e-46 ≈ 4.61e-23 J.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 2 * 1.2068e-46 is 2.4136e-46.

So 1.112e-68 / 2.4136e-46 = (1.112 / 2.4136) ) * 1e-22 (since 68-46=22). 1.112/2.4136 is approximately 0.4608. So B ≈ 0.4608e-22 J = 4.608e-23 J.

Now, the energy difference for a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is ΔE_rot = B [ J(J+1) - (J-1)J ] = B [ J=1:1*2 - J=0:0 ] = 2B. So ΔE_rot = 2B = 2 *4.608e-23 = 9.216e-23 J.

For a vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1: ΔE_vib = h ν (v=1: (1 + ½) ) - (v=0: (0 + ½) ) )= h ν (1) - (1/2 h ν) ? Wait, no: the energy levels are E_v = (v + ½) h ν. So the transition from v=0 to v=1 is E_vib = (1 + ½) h ν - (0 + ½) h ν = (3/2 - 1/2) h ν = h ν. So ΔE_vib = h ν.

Given ν = w/(2π), because angular frequency ω is 2π times frequency ν.

Wait, no: ω is angular frequency. So ν = ω/(2π). So ω=4e14 rad/s, so ν = 4e14 / (2π) ≈ (4e14)/(6.283) ≈ ~6.366e13 Hz.

h is Planck's constant ≈6.626e-34 J·s.

So ΔE_vib = h ν = 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 ≈ approximately 4.217e-20 J.

Now, compare ΔE_rot and ΔE_vib. ΔE_rot is 9.216e-23 J, and ΔE_vib is 4.217e-20 J. Oh, so the rotational transition requires much less energy. So the photon would cause a transition from J=0→J=1, since that's the next possible state with the lowest energy.

Wait, but wait. The question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. So fundamental state is the lowest vibrational and rotational state: v=0, J=0. The next state would be the next possible state, which could be either J=1, v=0 (rotational) or v=1, J=0 (vibrational). Since the rotational transition requires less energy, the photon would need to provide that.

So the photon's energy is ΔE = 9.216e-23 J. Then, since E_photon = p_photon * c, the momentum is p = E/(c).

So c is the speed of light ≈3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.216e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = (9.216e-23) / (3e8 ) = 3.072e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 3e-31. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the rotational energy levels more accurately. The energy levels for rotation are E_rot = B J (J+1). So from J=0 to J=1, the change is E_rot_final - E_rot_initial = B*(1*2) - B*(0) )= 2B.

Wait, yeah, that's correct. So ΔE_rot = 2B = approx 9.216e-23 J.

But let me compute B again. Let's re-calculate to make sure.

I = μ R².

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = approx 3.017e-27 kg.

R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. So R² is 4e-20 m².

So I = μ R² = 3.017e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

Then, B = ħ²/(2 I).

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.2068e-46) ) = 1.112e-68 / 2.4136e-46 ≈ approximately 4.608e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.216e-23 J.

c = 3e8 m/s.

So p_photon = E / c = 9.216e-23 J / 3e8 m/s.

Compute that: 9.216e-23 / 3e8 = (9.216/3) )e-31 = 3.072e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are in the 1e-28 to 1e-27 range. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I confused the rotational energy with something else. Alternatively, perhaps the question involves the molecule making a transition from the ground state to the next state, which might be a combination of rotational and vibrational.

Wait, but the problem states "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the one with the smallest possible energy increase. So if the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibr
