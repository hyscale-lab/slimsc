Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me think about what's being asked. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. But wait, what's the structure of the starting material?

Wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Oh, wait, that's probably a typo. Maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene? Oh wait, no, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Or perhaps "d" stands for something else. Oh, wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Because sometimes in the numbering, the positions are 1,2,4. Wait, but the way it's written is 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe the "d" stands for another substituent. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Alternatively, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,3-dimethylbenzene. Hmm, maybe I should think about the structure more carefully.

Wait, perhaps the compound is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, which has substituents at positions 1 (b
