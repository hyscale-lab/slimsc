Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e and negligible mass. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places, and choose the right option from A to D.

Hmm, so I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think this involves calculating the potential energy of a system of charges. Since all the charges are the same and we're dealing with potential energy between them, I should probably use Coulomb's law for point charges.

Wait, potential energy in an electrostatic system is the energy stored due to the configuration of charges. For point charges, the potential energy is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. But because of the way potential energy works, each pair contributes to the total.

In this case, we have 13 charges. One is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of the 12 is 2 meters from P, but what about their distances from each other?

Wait, wait. The problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So they're all on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P. But since they're identical charges, they'd repel each other. However, the problem says the system's minimum energy. So perhaps the charges are arranged in a way that the potential energy is minimized.

Wait, but for point charges, the system's potential energy is minimized when the charges are as far apart as possible. But in this case, the 12 charges might be arranged in a regular pattern on a sphere, perhaps like the vertices of an icosahedron or something. But maybe for the purposes of this problem, we don't need to calculate their mutual distances because we only have their distance from the central charge.

Wait, the problem says each of the 12 is 2 meters from P. The 13th is at P. So each of the 12 is at a distance r = 2 m from the 13th charge. So each of the 12 contributes to the potential energy due to their interaction with the 13th
