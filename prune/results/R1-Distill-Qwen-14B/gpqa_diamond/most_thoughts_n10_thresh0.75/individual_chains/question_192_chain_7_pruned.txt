Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to wrap my head around it. Hmm, let's see. The setup is a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down.

So, there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's radius is r, which is smaller than R, so it's completely inside the conductor. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. Now, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Also, l and L are both larger than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, so the conductor is uncharged initially. But when you put a charge inside the cavity, how does that affect things? Oh right, I remember that when a conductor encloses a charge, the charges in the conductor redistribute themselves. But since the conductor was uncharged before, placing a charge inside the cavity would induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. When a conductor surrounds a charge, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge opposite to the enclosed charge, right? But since the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge equal to the enclosed charge. Or wait, no. Wait, let me correct that. The conductor was initially uncharged, so when you put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's inner wall) will induce a charge of -q. Then, because the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance. So the total charge on the conductor is zero, but it's divided into +q on the outer surface and -q on the inner. But wait, wait a second: the conductor's net charge was zero, so the induced charges must be such that the sum is zero. So yes, inner surface has -q and outer has +q, so sum is zero. 

But wait, the point P is outside the conductor. So when we're considering the electric field at P, what matters is the charge distribution outside P's location. Since P is outside
