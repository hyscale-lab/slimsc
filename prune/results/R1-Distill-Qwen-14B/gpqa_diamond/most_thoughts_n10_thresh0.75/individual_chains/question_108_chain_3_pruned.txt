Okay, so I have this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small, I guess meaning m is small in magnitude. I need to compare the paramagnetic coupling term's expectation value ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE, which corresponds to a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. The options are whether ⟨H⟩ is much greater than, much less than, equal to, or just greater than ΔE.

First, I should probably figure out what the paramagnetic coupling term is. Paramagnetism arises from the interaction of a magnetic moment with an external magnetic field. The energy associated with this interaction is given by the Zeeman effect, right? So the Hamiltonian for this interaction is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment.

Wait, the magnetic moment μ for an electron is given by μ = -gμ_B m * (some direction, probably along the magnetic field here since B is along Oz). Oh wait, the magnetic quantum number m is small, so m is around 0, ±1, etc., but since m is small in magnitude, maybe m is like 0 or ±1. But let's think about how this affects the energy.

The energy levels due to the Zeeman effect split into levels proportional to m. So each m state has an energy shift. The paramagnetic coupling term's expectation value would be proportional to m times some constants. But wait, in the problem, it's asking about ⟨H⟩, which is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. So for each state, ⟨H⟩ would be proportional to m times B. 

But wait, the question is comparing this ⟨H⟩ to the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The transition energy is the energy difference between two energy levels, like between n=1 and n=2, or something else. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which I think is the Balmer series. Let me recall: the Balmer-alpha line is around 0.486 micrometers, which corresponds to a transition from n=2 to n=1, but wait, no, that's Lyman. Wait no, Balmer series is transitions ending at n=2. So Balmer-alpha is n=3 to n=2, right? Because Lyman series is n=1, Balmer is n=2, etc.

But wait, the exact value might not be critical here since the problem is about orders of magnitude. Let me calculate the transition energy ΔE. The Rydberg formula could help. Or maybe the energy levels of hydrogen can be approximated by ΔE = hc / λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

Wait, but for hydrogen, the energy levels are given by E_n = - (μ_e * e^4) / (8ε_0²h²) * 1/(n²), which can also be written as E_n = -13.6 eV / n². The transition energy is the difference between two
