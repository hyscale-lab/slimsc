Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and calibration curves. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I remember that qPCR is used to quantify the amount of a specific DNA or RNA by amplifying it. The process involves a calibration curve which relates the Ct values to the initial amount of nucleic acid.

So the scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He used serially diluted samples with three technical replicates each. The efficiency was 100%, which is perfect because that means each cycle doubles the target. The R² was 1, which is a perfect correlation, so the data should fit the curve perfectly. The slope was -3.3. Wait, I think the slope in a qPCR curve relates to the efficiency. The formula I remember is that the slope (m) is related to the efficiency (E) by the formula m = -log10(E) / log10(2). So if efficiency is 100%, E is 1. That would make m = 0? Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Let me think again. Oh right! The standard formula is that the slope is -3.3219 if the efficiency is 100% because log10(2) is about 0.3010, and 3.3219 is approximately 10 divided by 3 times log10(2). Wait, perhaps I should calculate it. E = 1, so log10(E) is 0. So m = - log10(E)/log10(2) → which would be 0. Hmm, but in the question, the slope is -3.3. Wait, that doesn't add up. Maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Oh wait, maybe the slope is calculated differently. Oh wait! I think the standard equation for a qPCR calibration curve is Ct = -3.3219*(log10(initial copies)) + intercept. So the slope is -3.3219 when efficiency is 100%. So here, the slope is -3.3, which is close to that. So that makes sense. So the scientist's data fit a perfect curve, which is why R²
