Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I need to understand what each spectrograph can observe. The question states that ESPRESSO can detect stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait, no, actually, the brighter stars would have lower magnitudes. So if a star's V magnitude is brighter than 17, that means it's magnitude is less than 17. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes mean brighter objects. So ESPRESSO can observe stars where V_mag < 17.

HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so V_mag <16. Therefore, a star that's observable by both must have apparent V magnitude less than 16 because that's the stricter condition. Because if a star is brighter than 16, it's definitely brighter than 17, so it can be seen by both.

Now, I need to calculate each star's apparent V magnitude and see which ones are below 16.

Let's go through each star one by one.

Star1:
- Absolute V magnitude (Mv) is 15.5 mag. The distance is 10 pc. Wait, but absolute magnitude is how bright it would appear at 10 pc. So if it's at 10 pc, the apparent magnitude (mv) is the same as Mv. So mv = 15.5.

ESPRESSO can see down to 17, so 15.5 is brighter than 17, so yes. HIRES can see down to 16, so 15.5 is brighter than 16, so yes. So Star1 can be observed by both.

Wait, but wait. That's only if there's no extinction. The question mentions Star3 and Star4 have E(B-V) which affects their apparent magnitudes. Oh, right, so I have to account for dust extinction (interstellar absorption) for those stars.

Wait, no, because the question says for each star, whether it's observed by either spectrograph. So for each star, I have to calculate its apparent V magnitude, considering any extinction, and then see whether
