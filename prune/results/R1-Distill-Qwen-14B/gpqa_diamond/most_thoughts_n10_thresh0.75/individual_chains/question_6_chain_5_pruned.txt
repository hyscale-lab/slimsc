Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ.

Hmm, wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the potential often determines the form of the energy levels. So I need to figure out what kind of potential this is and then apply the appropriate solution method.

Let me break down the potential. The first term is (1/2)kr², which looks familiar. That's the potential for a harmonic oscillator, right? Because the standard 2D harmonic oscillator has V(r) = (1/2)mω²r², but wait, in this case, the term is (1/2)kr². So maybe k is like mω²? Hmm, not sure if that's important right now.

The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Oh, cos squared theta suggests some angular dependence. Wait, in polar coordinates, variables are r and θ. So this potential depends on both r and θ. But how do I handle that?

Wait, maybe I can rewrite the potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates to see if it's separable. Because when the potential is separable, the problem can be solved by treating each coordinate separately.

So in polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Let me see:

The first term is (1/2)kr², which is (1/2)k(x² + y²).

The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Since cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x²/(r²) = x²/(x² + y²). So substituting that in, the second term becomes (3/2)k(x²)/(x² + y²) * (x² + y²), because r² is x² + y². Wait, wait, let me recheck that.

Wait, the second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. So substituting cosθ = x/r, we get cos²θ = x² / r². Then, r² cos²θ = x². So the second term becomes (3/2)k x².

Wait, wait! So the entire potential V(r, θ) is the sum of two terms: (1/2)kr² and (3/2)kr x². Wait no, because r² is x²+y². Let me recompute.

Wait, the first term is (1/2)kr² = (1/2)k(x² + y²). The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ = (3/2)k (x² + y²) (x²/(x² + y²)) )= (3/2)k x².

So the total potential V is (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2 k + 3/2 k)x² + (1/2 k)
