Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that in polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian for a particle in 2D can be written in terms of r and θ. The general form of the Hamiltonian is something like H = (-ħ²/(2m)) (1/r ∂/∂r (r ∂/∂r) + 1/(r²) ∂²/∂θ²) ) + V(r,θ). Right?

So the potential here has two terms: (1/2)kr² and (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let me break that down. The first part, (1/2)kr², looks familiar. Oh, that's the potential for a harmonic oscillator in radial direction, right? Because for a 1D harmonic oscillator, V = ½ mω² x², which is similar when expressed in terms of r.

The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, that's a function of θ multiplied by r². Wait, in polar coordinates, sometimes we can separate the Hamiltonian into radial and angular parts. If the potential can also be separated, then maybe the problem can be solved by treating the radial and angular parts separately.

But wait, looking at the potential, the first term is purely radial (depends only on r), and the second term depends on r² and cos²θ. So perhaps it's better to express cos²θ in terms of cos(2θ), because that might make the potential separable or simplify the angular part.

Because cos²θ can be written using the double-angle identity: cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that, the second term becomes (3/2)kr² * (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let me compute that: (3/2)*(1/2) kr² (1 + cos2θ) = (3/4) kr² (1 + cos2θ). So putting it together, the potential becomes V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² (1 + cos2θ). Let me expand that: ½ kr² + 3/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ.

Wait, ½ plus 3/4 is (2/4 +3/4)=5/4. So V(r,θ) = (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ. Hmm, so the potential now has two terms. One is radial (proportional to r²), and the other has a cos2θ dependence.

So the overall potential is V(r,θ) = A r² + B r² cos2θ, where A is 5/4 k and B is 3/4 k. But wait, perhaps we can think of this as a combination of two potentials: one being a simple harmonic oscillator in r, and the other involving angular terms.

Wait, but the Hamiltonian in polar coordinates includes the kinetic terms, which are already in terms of r and θ. The angular part of the Hamiltonian is the ( -ħ²/(2m r²) ) * (∂²/∂θ²) term, and the potential
