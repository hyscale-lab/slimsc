Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of reactions with aromatic compounds. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, they checked using TLC and saw the reactant spot diminish, with two new spots. So, the reaction is probably leading to two products.

First, I need to figure out what the structure of the starting material looks like. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me draw that out. The benzene ring is connected via an ether linkage (-O-) to a butenyl group. The butenyl is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So that's a four-carbon chain. Let's count: position 1 is the one attached to the oxygen. Then, position 2 has two methyl groups, and there's a double bond between 3 and 4. So the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, but the butenyl is but-3-en-1-yl, which means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, but butenyl is four carbons. So it's CH2-CH2-CH=CH? No, wait. Let me see: The butenyl group is -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- but with a double bond. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, actually, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH=CH2? No, wait, butenyl is four carbons: positions 1,2,3,4. So but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond at 3, so between C3 and C4. So it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between 3 and 4? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, but butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- ? No, wait,
