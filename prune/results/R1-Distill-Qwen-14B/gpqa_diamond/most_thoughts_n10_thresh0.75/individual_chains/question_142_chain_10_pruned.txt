Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located in the qubits space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through this.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, what's a pure state versus a mixed state? Oh right, a pure state is a single ket vector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, while a mixed state is a statistical mixture of pure states, so it's a density matrix that can't be written as a single outer product.

So looking at this ρ, it's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) multiplied by 1/2. That looks like a mixture of the states |0⟩ and |1⟩, each with equal probability. So this is a mixed state, right? Because it's an equal probability of being in state 0 or state 1. 

Now, the question is about its geometrical position in the qubit space. I think qubit space can be represented as a Bloch sphere. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of qubit states, where each point on or inside the sphere corresponds to a possible state of a qubit.

Wait, how does a density matrix fit into this? I remember that for a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere, or inside it, depending on whether it's a pure or mixed state. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

So for the Bloch vector, a pure state |ψ⟩ would have a density matrix ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. The Bloch vector r is then (x, y, z), where x, y, z are determined by the components of ψ. For example, |0⟩ is (1,0,0) and |1⟩ is (0,0,1), right? Or wait, maybe |0⟩ is (1,0,0) and |1⟩ is (-1, 0, 0)? Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. Oh, no, wait, the Bloch sphere is defined in
