Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral structures are one of the seven crystal systems. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. 

The given data is the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait, interatomic distance—that's the distance between atoms along the lattice parameter, right? So in a cubic system, the lattice parameter 'a' would be the interatomic distance. But wait, rhombohedral isn't cubic, so the lattice parameter might not be the same as the interatomic distance? Or is it?

Wait, no, in a rhombohedral structure, the lattice parameters a, b, c are all equal, and the angles α, β, γ are all the same. So in this case, a = b = c = 10 Angstroms, and each angle is 30 degrees. 

The question is about the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I remember the formula for interplanar distance d is given by d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... something involving the angles? Oh wait, I think the general formula for d in a rhombohedral system is different from the cubic one because of the angles.

Wait, let me think. In a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But for rhombohedral, because the angles are not 90 degrees, the formula gets more complicated. I think
