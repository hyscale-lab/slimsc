Okay, so I have this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that each spectrograph has different brightness limits. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, so that's up to 17 mag. Wait, no, wait, brighter than 17? Wait, wait. Because in astronomy, lower magnitude numbers mean brighter. So if a star has a V magnitude of, say, 16, that's brighter than a star with 17.

So ESPRESSO can observe up to V magnitude 17. But wait, the wording says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So, does that mean it can only see stars with V less than or equal to 17? Because if a star is brighter (smaller magnitude), it's easier to see. So for example, a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17, so if ESPRESSO can observe V up to 17, that would mean stars with V up to 17 can be detected, because brighter is better. So a star with V=17 is at the limit. So, any star with V ≤17 can be observed by ESPRESSO.

HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, V ≤ 16. Because stars brighter than 16 are V <16, but wait, wait. Wait, the wording is 'brighter than 16 V mag can be observed'. So, same logic: stars with V magnitude less than or equal to 16 would be observed by HIRES.

So the key is: the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤17 for ESPRESSO, and ≤16 for HIRES. So each star must satisfy both conditions to be detected by both spectrographs.

Now I need to look at each star and calculate their apparent V magnitudes, then see if they are ≤17 and ≤16.

But wait, the stars have either their absolute magnitude given or their apparent magnitude. For the ones with absolute magnitude, I need to calculate the apparent magnitude using distance modulus. For the ones with E(B-V), I need to correct for extinction (interstellar dust which makes stars appear dimmer and redder), which affects the apparent magnitude.
