Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the potential energy of a system involving a charge and a conducting sphere. Let me start by understanding what's given and what's being asked.

The problem says: a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. We need to find the net potential energy of this system. The options are A to D, each giving a different formula.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with potential energy in electrostatics, especially with conductors, image charges come into play. Also, since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero. That probably means any induced charges on it will adjust to maintain that zero potential.

Wait, so the setup is a point charge q outside a conducting sphere. The sphere is grounded, so any induced charges will adjust such that the sphere remains at zero potential. I think that the image charge method is the way to go here. The image charge technique is used to find potentials and fields due to charges near conductors.

In the case of a conducting sphere, when a charge q is placed outside it, an image charge appears inside the sphere. The image charge q' would be negative if the sphere is neutral. But wait, wait. Since the sphere is grounded, the charges on it can adjust. So maybe the sphere's induced charges are such that the image charge isn't the usual case.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. For a conducting sphere not connected to anything, an external charge q induces charges -q' on the outer surface. But since the sphere is grounded, it can exchange charges with the earth. So, when the charge q is placed near the sphere, the induced charges on the sphere's surface adjust so that the sphere's potential is the same as the ground, which is zero.

But how does that affect the potential energy?

Potential energy of the system usually comes from the work done in assembling the charges. Here, we have the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, but since the sphere is grounded, any induced charges would be determined by the condition that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So the induced charges would adjust such that the potential on the sphere is zero.

But when calculating potential energy, I think it's the work done to bring the charges into their positions. So the system consists of the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, perhaps only the work done by q in bringing the induced charges is considered.

Alternatively, maybe the potential energy is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential at its surface is zero, which might simplify things.

Wait, another approach: The potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. But in this case, the sphere is a conductor, so all its induced charges are on the surface. The potential energy would then be the energy due to the external charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

But how to model the induced charges? For a conducting sphere, the image charge method says that the charge q would produce an image charge q' at a certain position inside the sphere, such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. Wait, no, when the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero. So the image
