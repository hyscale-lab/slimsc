Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about particle physics and decay modes of a boson. I remember from my studies that bosons like the photon or the Higgs can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. 

The question gives me an interaction Lagrangian: L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think that's the Yukawa interaction term. The Yukawa interaction is responsible for things like the Higgs coupling to fermions, right? So this boson X is interacting with fermions via a Yukawa coupling.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So I need to figure out what particles it can decay into. The possible decays are the fermion-antifermion pairs that are kinematically allowed. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different possibilities.

I remember that for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because energy and mass are related via E=mc², so the rest mass energy has to be enough to create the pair.

So first, I need to know the masses of all the possible fermions that X can decay into. Let me list the fermions and their masses:

- Electron (e⁻): mass about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ⁻): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ⁻): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): around 2.2 MeV (0.0022 GeV)
- Down quark (d): about 4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)
- Strange quark (s): ~95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
- Charm quark (c): ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV

Wait, but X has a mass of 6 GeV. So the maximum mass a single fermion can have is 3 GeV each because 2*m < 6 GeV. So any fermion with mass up to 3 GeV can be a decay product.

Looking at the fermions, the tau is 1.777 GeV, which is under 3 GeV. The bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3, so X can't decay into b quarks because 2b would be about 8 GeV, which is more than X's mass. Same for top quarks—they're way too heavy.

Wait, but wait! Wait a minute: I think I made a mistake. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So the fermion pair must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV. So each fermion's mass should be less than 3 GeV.

So let's list all fermions with mass less than 3 GeV:

- Electron: 0.0005 GeV
- Muon: 0.105 GeV
- Tau: 1.777 GeV
- Up: 0.0022 GeV
- Down: 0.0047 GeV
- Strange: 0.095 GeV
- Charm: 1.27 GeV
- Bottom: 4.5 GeV (too heavy)
- Top: way too heavy.

So X can decay into pairs of any of these except bottom and top.

Now, which fermions are in the possible decay options?

Looking at the options:

Option A: includes b bbar, which is 4.5 GeV each. So 2*4.5 =9 GeV, which is more than X's 6 GeV. So this decay is not allowed. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: includes c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau pair, mu pair, e pair. Let's check their masses.

Charm is 1.27 GeV. So 2c would be 2.54 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into c cbar.

Same for tau: 2*1.777=3.554 GeV, which is under 6, so allowed.

Muons: 0.21 GeV (2*0.105), allowed.

Electrons: negligible, allowed.

So option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But wait, what about the bottom quark? Wait, no, option B doesn't have b. So B is possible.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t. But top quark is way too heavy, so can't decay into t tbar. So option C is wrong.

Option D: includes b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. The b's are 4.5 GeV each. 2*4.5=9>6, so decay into b bbar is not allowed. So option D is incorrect.

So which options are left? Only option B includes the allowed fermions and excludes the too-heavy ones.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Wait, does the Lagrangian affect which fermions X can decay into? The Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So this implies that X couples to all the fermions f listed in the Lagrangian.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the interaction term is written as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation. Maybe f is a generic fermion field, but maybe in this case, the coupling is only to certain fermions.

Wait, perhaps the interaction term is written as -λ_f (v + X) ψ̄_f ψ_f. So for each fermion f, the coupling λ is different. So in this case, the model allows X to couple to any fermion f as long as λ_f is non-zero. So for the decay to be possible, the coupling must exist for the respective fermion.

But the problem doesn't specify which fermions have non-zero λ. So perhaps we can assume that X can couple to all the known fermions. Or maybe the problem is just about the kinematics, regardless of coupling.

Wait, but the question is about the kinematically allowed decays, so it's about whether the energy is sufficient, regardless of whether the coupling exists. Because even if the coupling exists, if the mass isn't enough, it can't decay. Conversely, even if the coupling exists, if the mass is sufficient, the decay is allowed.

Wait, but the problem gives the interaction Lagrangian as written, so we must consider all fermions that the Lagrangian couples to. Or is it that the Lagrangian is a generic one, and the fermions available are all possible ones?

Wait, actually, the problem statement just gives a general form, not specific to certain fermions. So I think the assumption is that X can couple to any fermion, so the decay possibilities are determined purely by the mass.

So, going back, the allowed fermions are all those with mass less than 3 GeV. So the possible fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, and c.

So any pair of these would be allowed, as long as the sum is less than 6 GeV.

Wait, but the possible decay products are listed in the options as X → something. Each option lists possible decay channels.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Are all these allowed? Let's check the masses:

c cbar: 1.27 * 2 = 2.54 GeV <6 → allowed.

s sbar: 0.095 *2=0.19 <6 → allowed.

u ubar: 0.0022 *2=0.0044 → allowed.

d dbar: 0.0047 *2=0.0094 → allowed.

Tau pair: 1.777 *2=3.554 <6 → allowed.

Mu pair: 0.105 *2=0.21 → allowed.

e pair: negligible → allowed.

So all the decays in option B are allowed. But looking at the options, let me check what each option says.

Option B is X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So that's all the allowed fermions except for the bottom and top, which are too heavy.

But wait, wait. Let me check the tau mass again. Tau is about 1.78 GeV, so 2*1.78 is about 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So that's allowed. So tau pair is allowed.

So the correct answer should include all these. So looking back at the options, option B is that.

Wait, but option D includes b, which is too heavy. So option D is incorrect.

So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but wait. Wait another thing: the possible fermions X can decay into include any pair, regardless of whether they are quarks or leptons. So the decay can be into any of these particles as long as the mass allows.

So the correct answer is option B.


To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, we analyze the possible fermion-antifermion pairs it can decay into. For a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the total mass of the fermion-antifermion pair must be less than or equal to the boson's mass. This means each fermion's mass must be less than half the boson's mass (\( m_X / 2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).

### Fermion Masses and Allowed Decays:
1. **Electron (\( e^- \))**: \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), negligible compared to 3 GeV. Allowed.
2. **Muon (\( \mu^- \))**: \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \approx 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \). Allowed.
3. **Tau (\( \tau^- \))**: \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.554 \, \text{GeV} \). Allowed.
4. **Up quark (\( u \))**: \( m_u \approx 0.0022 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_u \approx 0.0044 \, \text{GeV} \). Allowed.
5. **Down quark (\( d \))**: \( m_d \approx 0.0047 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_d \approx 0.0094 \, \text{GeV} \). Allowed.
6. **Strange quark (\( s \))**: \( m_s \approx 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_s \approx 0.19 \, \text{GeV} \). Allowed.
7. **Charm quark (\( c \))**: \( m_c \approx 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \approx 2.54 \, \text{GeV} \). Allowed.
8. **Bottom quark (\( b \))**: \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \approx 9.0 \, \text{GeV} \). Not allowed, as \( 9.0 > 6 \, \text{GeV} \).
9. **Top quark (\( t \))**: \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \). Not allowed, as \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

Thus, the allowed fermion-antifermion pairs are \( e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-, \tau^+\tau^-, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c} \).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV.

Answer: B
