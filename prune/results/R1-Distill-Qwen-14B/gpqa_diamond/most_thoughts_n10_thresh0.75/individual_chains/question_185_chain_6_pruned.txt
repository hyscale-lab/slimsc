Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Let me think step by step how to approach it.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. Hmm, σ here are the Pauli spin matrices, right? And n is a unit vector, so it's pointing in some arbitrary direction. ε is an energy constant.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are vectors, so σ · n would be the dot product. That means it's σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z.

I remember that for a spin-½ particle, the eigenvalues of the spin component in any direction are ± ħ/2. But wait, the Hamiltonian here is proportional to the Pauli matrices. So the eigenvalues of H should be related to that.

The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1 for each component. But when you take their dot product with a unit vector n, it's like projecting them onto that direction. So σ · n should have eigenvalues ±1 because each Pauli matrix does, regardless of direction since n is a unit vector.

So H = ε (σ · n) would then have eigenvalues ε multiplied by ±1. So that would be ±ε each. Wait, but wait. The Pauli matrices are each multiplied by n components, but since n is a unit vector, the magnitude of σ · n is the same as each individual Pauli matrix's magnitude. So the eigenvalues should be ±ε.

Looking at the options, option B says ±ε. Option C has ħ/2 factors,
