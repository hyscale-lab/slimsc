Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution with EDTA. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. 

The question says the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. They’re asking for the concentration of free calcium ions. 

Wait, what do I remember about complexes and dissociation constants? Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The formation constant, K, tells us how stable the complex is. A higher K means the complex is more stable.

So the reaction here is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The K for this reaction is given as 5x10^10. 

But wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. That means the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we need to find [Ca²+].

Assuming that the solution is ideal, so activity coefficients are 1. So the expression for K would be K = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2-]. 

Since it's a 1:1 complex, the stoichiometry is 1. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote the change as x. So when the complex dissociates, it releases x moles of Ca²+ and x moles of EDTA^4-. 

So, [CaEDTA^2-] would be 0.02 - x. But wait, since K is so large (5e10), the dissociation x should be very small compared to 0.02. So 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. That simplifies things.

So plugging into the K expression:

K = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / 0.02 ≈ 5e10.

But wait, the problem is that EDTA is a polydentate ligand, but in solution, it's usually in various protonated forms. Oh, but the question says pH is ideal, so I guess the EDTA is in the correct form (the deprotonated one) to form the complex. So we
