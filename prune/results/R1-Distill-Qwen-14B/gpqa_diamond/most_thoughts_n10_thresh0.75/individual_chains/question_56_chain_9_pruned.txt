Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between states. Let me try to think it through step by step. 

The question is about a state |3,0,0⟩ decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions happen based on certain selection rules. The selection rules for dipole transitions are important here. 

So, the selection rules for dipole transitions in hydrogen are: 
- Δl = ±1 (change in angular momentum by 1)
- Δm = 0, ±1 (change in magnetic quantum number by 0, ±1)

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The final state is |1,0,0⟩. So n goes from 3 to 1, which is a change of Δn = -2. 

But since each transition is a dipole transition, each step can only change n by 1, right? Because each transition can only change n by ±1. So the decay must happen in two steps: 3 → 2 →1. 

Wait, that makes sense. So the first transition would be from n=3 to n=2, and then from n=2 to n=1. Now, what about the angular momentum changes? For each transition, l must change by ±1. 

The initial state has l=0. So the first transition (n=3 to n=2) must change l to 1, because 0 → 1. Then, the second transition (n=2 to n=1) must change l from 1 to 0. So that's allowed. 

So the possible intermediate states are |2,1,m⟩ where m can be -1, 0, +1. 

But the options given seem to pick specific m values. Let's look at the options. 

Option A says |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and probability 1/3. 

Option B: |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ with 1/4. 

Option C: |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ with 1/4. 

Option D: I think the first part is missing a |, but I'll assume it's |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩ and then to |1,0,0⟩ with probability 2/3. 

Wait, but what about the possible m transitions? The initial m is 0. In the first transition, m can change by 0, ±1. So from m=0, possible m values are -1, 0, +1 in the intermediate state. 

So in the first step, transitioning from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, m can be -1, 0, +1. 

Now, for each possible m, what are the transition probabilities? 

The probability for a transition is related to the square of the matrix elements in the dipole approximation. The transition probability amplitude is proportional to the matrix element ⟨f| r |i⟩, where r is the position operator. 

But I'm not exactly remembering the exact formula. I think the transition probability for each dipole transition depends on the change in m. 

Wait, for each step, the change in m can be 0, +1, or -1. So for each possible m, the probability might be different. 

I remember that when m changes by 0, the matrix element involves a spherical harmonic Y_{l',m'}, and the integral of Y_{l,m} multiplied by Y_{1,Δm} (since dipole has l=1) multiplied by Y_{l',m'}, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. 

Alternatively, another approach is to remember that the transition probability depends on the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or something similar. 

Wait, I recall that the transition probability from a state |n,l,m⟩ to |n’=n±1, l±1, m’⟩ is given by certain selection rules, and the probability is proportional to certain factors. 

In particular, for each transition, the probability is proportional to the square of the number of possible ways m can change. 

So for the initial state |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, the possible m's are -1, 0, +1. 

The number of possible transitions for each m depends on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. 

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding l=0 and l'=1 (dipole) would require that for each transition, m can change by 0, ±1. 

Wait, maybe another approach. The dipole operator is proportional to rY_{1,m}(θ,φ). The matrix element for the transition is ⟨f| Y_{1,m} |i⟩, where |i⟩ is initial and |f⟩ is final. 

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩, so Y0^0. The final state is |2,1,m⟩, so Y1^m. The matrix element would be ∫ Y1^m* Y1^0 Y0^0 dΩ. 

Wait, but wait. The dipole operator is r Y_{1}^m, and in the matrix element, it's the product of Y_{l=1}^m, Y_{l_initial}, and Y_{l_final}. 

Alternatively, the matrix element is ⟨2,1,m_f | r·Y_{1}^m |3,0,0⟩. 

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of possible transitions and the associated integrals. 

The integral ∫ Y_{l', m'}* Y_{1, m} Y_{l, m} } dΩ. 

For this integral to be non-zero, certain selection rules must be met. 

But perhaps a better way is to remember that the transition probability is proportional to the product of the squares of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. 

Wait, for a transition from l=0 to l=1, the possible m's are -1, 0, +1. 

The number of possible m's in the intermediate state would affect the probability. 

Each possible m in the intermediate state contributes a certain amount to the total probability. 

The total probability would be the sum of the probabilities for each possible m. 

So for the first transition, from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, m can be -1,0, +1. 

Each of these m values will have a certain probability, and their squares sum up to the total. 

Wait, I think that for each m, the probability is proportional to (2 - |m|) for l=1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the probability is determined by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which for the transition from l=0 to l=1 is only non-zero when the m's match. 

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 (which has m=0) and l=1 to get l=1. So the coefficients are non-zero only when m_final = m_dipole + m_initial. 

Wait, perhaps that's getting more complicated than I can handle. 

Alternatively, I remember that the transition probability for each m is given by ( (2l' +1)/( (2l+1)(2L+1) )) * (something with Wigner 3j symbols), but I'm not entirely confident. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the possible transitions and their probabilities. 

In the first transition, from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1. The m can change by -1, 0, +1. 

So for each possible m in the intermediate state, the transition probability to that state is a certain value. 

The total probability for all possible m's would sum to 1. 

Wait, but wait: the question isn't about the total probability, but
