Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll think it through.

The question says the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by this Lagrangian term: L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I should parse that correctly. Oh right, it's probably a Yukawa coupling kind of term. The structure looks like a Yukawa interaction where the boson X couples to fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So the question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

Wait, kinematically allowed means that the decay products' rest masses must be less than the mass of X, right? So each fermion pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because in particle decays, the rest mass of the parent must be at least equal to the sum of the rest masses of the decay products.

So the boson X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs (like a virtual photon decaying into electron-positron). The possible fermions are quarks and leptons. But each has their own mass, so I need to think about which fermions have a mass less than 6 GeV.

But wait, looking at the options, the fermions are like quarks (like u, d, s, c, b, t) and leptons (e, mu, tau). But the top quark has a mass around 173 GeV, so that's way above 6 GeV. So X can't decay into top quarks because 2*m_t is way bigger than 6 GeV. So any decay option with t t-bar is impossible.

Wait, but in the given options, option C includes t t-bar. So that one can't be correct because the mass is 6 GeV, which is way less than 2*mt.

So, any decay products with a fermion pair where each has a mass over 3 GeV would be impossible. Because 2*m_fermion must be ≤ 6 GeV, so m_fermion ≤ 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait, some fermions are much lighter
