Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think this through step by step. I remember that decays of particles depend on their mass and the masses of the particles they can decay into. 

The problem says that the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So I need to figure out which fermion pairs it can decay into. The Lagrangian given is L = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm not super clear on the exact details of the Lagrangian, but I think what's important here is the interaction term involving X and the fermions. It looks like X couples to fermions, so X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

So, the possible decay products are any fermion and its antiparticle, provided that the sum of their masses is less than the mass of X. Because for a decay to be allowed kinematically, the mass of the parent particle must be greater than the sum of the masses of the decay products.

Wait, but each fermion has its own mass. Let's think about the masses of the known fermions. 

Leptons: Electrons are about 0.0005 GeV, muons are about 0.105 GeV, taus are around 1.78 GeV. 

Quarks: Up and down are the lightest. Their masses are around a few MeV, so way less than 1 GeV. The strange quark is about 100 MeV, but wait, maybe I should double-check. Wait, no, I think the strange quark is around 100 MeV, which is 0.1 GeV. The charm quark is about 1.5 GeV, the bottom quark is around 4.5 GeV, and the top is way heavier, like 173 GeV. 

So the boson X is 6 GeV. Let's look at possible fermion pairs:

1. For a fermion pair like b quark and anti-b: each b is about 4.5 GeV, so two would be 9 GeV. Oh, wait, 4.5 + 4.5 is 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So that decay is not allowed. So X cannot decay into b bbar, right? Because 6 is less than 9.

Wait, wait, but wait. Wait, I'm getting confused. The mass of the X is 6 GeV, but each b quark is about 4.5 GeV. So for X to decay into b and anti-b, the sum would be 4.5 +4.5 =9 GeV. Since 6 <9, that's not possible. So the decay X→b bbar is not allowed. So any option that includes b bbar is incorrect. Looking at the options, option A includes b bbar, option D includes b bbar. So those can be eliminated.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, sometimes particles can be produced even if the sum is higher because of kinetic energy, but no, for a decay, the rest mass of the parent must be at least the sum of the rest masses of the decay products. Because in the rest frame, the decay products have to have enough energy for their rest mass. So yes, X can't decay into b bbar.

So the options that include b bbar (A and D) are not the right ones.

Now, let's look at the other options. The possible decay products would be fermions with mass m where 2m ≤6 GeV. Because each fermion is m, and two of them would need 2m ≤6 → m ≤3 GeV.

So which fermions have mass less than or equal to 3 GeV?

Let's
