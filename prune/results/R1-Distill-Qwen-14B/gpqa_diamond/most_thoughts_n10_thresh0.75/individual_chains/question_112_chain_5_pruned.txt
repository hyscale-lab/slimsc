Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about an electron in a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator, whose matrix representation is given by Aij. The elements are such that Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and zero otherwise. Also, find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, let's think about the state |alpha>. It's proportional to this combination, so I should probably normalize it. The general approach for these problems is to find the normalized state and then compute the probabilities for each eigenstate.

The state is given as (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. To normalize, I need to compute the inner product of this state with itself and then divide by its square root to get the normalized state.

So the inner product is (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i). Let me calculate that.

(1+i)(1-i) = (1)(1) + (1)(-i) + (i)(1) + (i)(-i) = 1 -i +i -i². Which simplifies to 1 - (-1) = 2.

Similarly, (2-i)(2+i) = (2)(2) + (2)(i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(i) = 4 + 2i -2i -i². i squared is -1, so it's 4 - (-1) = 5.

Wait, that's just the dot product for each term. But wait, the state is a sum of two terms, so the overall norm is the sum of the squares of their magnitudes. So |1+i|² is (1^2 +1^2) )= 2. And |2 -i|² is (2^2 + (-1)^2) =4 +1=5. So the total norm is 2 +5=7. So the normalized state is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, the operator whose matrix is given. Its elements Aij are hbar/2 if i ≠ j, zero otherwise. So this is a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin-½ particles (up and down states).

Let me write out the matrix. For a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are hbar/2. So the matrix A is:

[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says Aij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and zero otherwise. So the (1,1) and (2,2) elements are zero. The others are hbar/2. So the matrix is:

[ 0        hbar/2      ]
[ hbar/2    0         ]

So this is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. Hmm, what does this operator represent? It looks like the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if we multiply by hbar/2, we get this matrix.

Wait, right. So operator A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. Because multiplying by a scalar doesn't change the eigenstates, just the eigenvalues.

The eigenstates of Pauli X are |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

Wait, but wait: in the question, the operator's matrix is given as Aij = hbar/2 for i≠j. So that's correct.

Now, the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of operator A. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>?

Wait, yes. So, the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes when the state |alpha> is expressed in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

So first, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the probabilities by finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A, and then projecting |alpha> onto these eigenvectors.

But wait, since A's matrix is Pauli X times hbar/2, and as such, its eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, with eigenvalues ± hbar/2, respectively. So in this case, the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Wait a second, let me double-check that. The Pauli X matrix has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So when we multiply by hbar/2, the eigenvalues become (hbar/2)*1 = hbar/2 and (hbar/2)*(-1) = -hbar/2.

So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, with eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the probability that |alpha> is
