Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down. 

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C, which gives a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Let me start by visualizing each step.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. KOH is a strong base, especially in such high heat. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons in a diamond structure. When heated with a strong base like KOH, I think this is an E2 elimination. The two Br groups are on adjacent carbons, so the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of an alkene. Since it's a dihalide, this would likely form an alkyne? Wait, no, E2 leads to alkenes. Wait, but wait, in certain conditions, maybe it forms a diene? Or perhaps, considering the structure of adamantane, maybe it's a bridge elimination.

Wait, when you have vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons), treating with a strong base like KOH can lead to elimination reactions. The mechanism is dehydrohalogenation, which forms an alkene. So, the product would be 1,3-dibromoadamantane losing two HBr molecules to form an alkene. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a bicyclic compound; the elimination would form a bridge. Alternatively, perhaps it's a more complex structure.

Wait, perhaps the product is adamantane with a double bond. Let me think. The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When KOH is used, each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. Wait, bridgehead elimination? Oh, wait, but bridgehead alkenes are generally not possible due
