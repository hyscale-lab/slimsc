Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay probabilities. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think through this.

The question says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Wait, does that mean after 100 minutes, 32% of the atoms have decayed? Or that each atom has a 32% chance to decay within that time? I think it's the latter because it's the probability for each individual atom. So it's about the probability that a single atom decays within a certain time.

So the decay follows an exponential model. The formula I remember is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where N(t) is the number remaining after time t, N0 is the initial amount, λ is the decay constant, and t is time.

But wait, the probability that the atom has decayed by time t is 1 - e^(-λt). Because N(t)/N0 is the fraction remaining, so the fraction decayed is 1 - that.

So the given probability is 32% (0.32) within 100 minutes. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). I can rearrange that to find λ.

Let me calculate that. Rearranging, e^(-λ*100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides: ln(0.68) = -λ*100. So λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Calculating ln(0.68): I think ln(0.5) is about -0.693, and 0.68 is a bit higher, so maybe ln(0.68) is around -0.385. Let me check: ln(0.68) = approximately -0.38566. So λ is 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the question is, after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed yet. So what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, wait. So the total time would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, the question is about the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

Ah, right, because it's conditional probability. So the probability that the atom decays between t=50 and t=200 (150 minutes later). So the way to calculate this is: P(50 < t < 200) = P(t <200) - P(t <50). Which is [1 - e^(-λ*200)] - [1 - e^(-λ*50)] = e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200).

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The probability that the decay happens after 50 minutes but before 200 is the same as the probability that it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes, minus the probability it hasn't decayed by 200 minutes. Because if it hasn't decayed by 50, the chance it decays in the next 150 is the chance it decays before 200. So [1 - (probability it hasn't decayed by 200)] minus [1 - (probability hasn't decayed by 50)]?

Wait, maybe another approach. The probability that the decay occurs after time t1 but before t2 is equal to the survival probability up to t1 multiplied by the probability of decaying between t1 and t2.

Alternatively, the formula is P(t1 < t < t2) = [1 - e^(-λ t2)] - [1 - e^(-λ t1)] = e^(-λ t1) -
