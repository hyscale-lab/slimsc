Okay, so I've got this question here about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the size of the planet's orbit.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same minimum mass detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. But Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1's period is P1, P2 is 3*P1? No, wait, no, the question says Planet_1's period is three times shorter, meaning P1 is shorter, so P2 is longer. Oh wait, no, no, wait. If Planet_1 has a shorter period, that means it's orbiting closer to its star. So, P1 is smaller than P2. Because orbital period is related to the distance via Kepler's third law.

The host stars have the same radii. But the mass of Planet_1's host star is twice that of Planet_2's. So, M1 = 2*M2. But both stars have the same radius, R. I remember that for the transit probability, the main factors are the size of the planet compared to the star and the size of the orbit.

Wait, the probability of transit (P) is given by the formula P = R_planet / (R_star * a), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait no, that's not quite right. Let me think. Oh, right, the probability is actually the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the area of the star's disk, multiplied by the probability that the orbital plane is aligned such that the transit occurs. But the exact formula I think is P = (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (e * sin i)), but for circular orbits (e=0), it's undefined? Wait, no, perhaps the probability is P = (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (a)), but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the geometry.

The transit probability depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit to the star. More precisely, the probability is proportional to the ratio of the planet's orbital radius (a) over the sum of the star's radius and the planet's radius. But I think the approximate formula for the transit probability is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a)) ... Wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the solid angle, but wait, perhaps it's more about the alignment. Let me think again.

Another approach: the transit probability P is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a)), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, I've read that P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s + R_p) / a )^2. Hmm, I might be getting this wrong. Wait, I think I should refer to the basic concept.

The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our viewpoint. The probability
