Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through step by step.

The question is about two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives us their minimum masses and orbital periods. Wait, but the problem says they have the same masses. Oh, right, same minimum masses, but that probably doesn't affect the transit probability directly. Oh wait, no, the transit probability depends more on the geometry of the system, not the mass. So the mass being the same might not matter for this particular calculation.

The key factors for transit probability are the relative sizes of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. The probability increases when the planet's orbit is more likely to edge-on relative to our line of sight. But how do we calculate that?

I remember that the probability P of a planet transiting its star is roughly given by the formula P â‰ˆ (R_p / a)^2 * (some factor), but wait, I think the exact formula is P = (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star / a. Wait, no, wait. Transit probability is the ratio of the size of the star (or the planet's orbit) to the distance at which the planet's orbital plane is aligned edge-on. Oh wait, no, I think the probability is roughly (R_star / a) multiplied by another factor related
