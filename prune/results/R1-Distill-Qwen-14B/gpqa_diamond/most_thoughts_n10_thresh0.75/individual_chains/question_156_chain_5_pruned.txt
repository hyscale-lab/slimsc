Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this organic chemistry problem. Let me try to break it down step by step. I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. So, the question involves two reactions of (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA, followed by treatment with aqueous acid.

Wait, so both reactions are done under the same conditions, just the starting alkene is different in geometry. Let me think about what happens in each reaction.

First, Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA. I know that mCPBA adds an epoxide group across the double bond. The reaction is an electrocyclic opening, right? Wait, no, mCPBA causes an epoxidation, which is a peracid reacting with the alkene in a syn addition. So the double bond becomes an epoxide. Now, since the starting alkene is (E), the geometry of the double bond affects where the oxygen atoms add.

Wait, no, wait. mCPBA adds across the double bond to form an epoxide. For an (E) alkene, the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite each other. So when the epoxide forms, the resulting structure would have the oxygen atoms added to the same face, which is the syn addition.

After the epoxidation, the reaction is followed by aqueous acid. Oh, wait, I think when epoxides are treated with aqueous acid, they undergo acid-catalyzed ring opening. In acid conditions, the epoxide ring opens via a carbocation mechanism. Since the epoxide is symmetric? Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in the middle? Wait, no. Let me think. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in the 4 position. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 but with the double bond between carbons 4 and 5. Wait, but regardless of that, when the epoxide is formed, the structure would have the oxygen in between the two middle carbons.

Wait, no, for oct
