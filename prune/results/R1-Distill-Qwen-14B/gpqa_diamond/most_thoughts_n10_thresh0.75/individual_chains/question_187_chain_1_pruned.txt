Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think through it.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Paranal. The question is about whether each star reaches a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel in an hour. So, I need to figure out how each star's brightness affects the S/N.

Wait, the stars in the options have different distances and absolute magnitudes. Absolute magnitude is the brightness if they were at 10 parsecs away. So, I need to calculate their apparent magnitudes as seen from Earth because that determines how bright they appear to us. Brighter stars (lower magnitude) will have higher S/N.

The formula for converting absolute magnitude to apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d), where d is the distance in parsecs. Wait, no, I think it's m = M + 5 log10(d) - 5, because the formula is m = M + 5(log10(d) - 1). So, that's m = M + 5 log10(d) -5.

So for each star, I'll compute their apparent magnitude. Then, I can figure out their flux, which relates to the S/N. But I'm not exactly sure how that relates to the S/N ratio. Oh right, the S/N depends on the photon flux from the star. Higher flux means higher S/N.

Wait, but I remember that the S/N per pixel is related inversely to the star's apparent brightness. Or is it directly? Hmm. Wait, lower apparent magnitude (brighter) will mean the star is brighter, so more photons, so higher S/N. So I need to find out which stars have an apparent magnitude that allows an S/N â‰¥10 in an hour.

I also need to know what the ESPRESSO spectrograph's sensitivity is. But I don't have exact numbers. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the typical limiting magnitudes for such instruments. 

Wait, from what I recall, ESPRESSO has a certain sensitivity limit. Let me think. The ESPRESSO instrument is designed for very high
