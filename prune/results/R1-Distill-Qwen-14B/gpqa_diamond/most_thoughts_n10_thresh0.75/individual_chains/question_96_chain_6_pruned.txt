Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about black holes and entropy. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think through them.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and it's located at a distance d = 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are A to D, each with different powers of ten.

Hmm, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area, specifically the area of the event horizon. The formula I think is S = (k c^3 A)/(4 ħ G), where k is Boltzmann's constant, c the speed of light, A the area, ħ the reduced Planck constant, and G the gravitational constant. Wait, I think another way to write the entropy formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), but I might have mixed up some constants. Alternatively, I've heard the formula written as S = (k_B A c^3)/(4 ħ G) * (1/4π), but maybe that's the same thing. Wait, no, the standard formula I remember is S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G) * (1/(4π))? Or maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, I think the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G) * (k_B), because I've heard that the entropy is proportional to the area (A) of the event horizon. So maybe it's S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G) * (something). Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact formula, but since I can't, I'll proceed with what I think.

Wait, I think the correct formula is S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G) * (1/(4π))?) Or maybe it's S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G) * (1/(4π))? Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again. From what I remember, the entropy S of
