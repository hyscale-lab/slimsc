Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ and asks about its geometrical position in qubits space. The options are A to D, each with different coordinate vectors. I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (not a pure state).

The given ρ is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right! I think that's the density matrix for a completely mixed state of a qubit. Because when you have |0><0| and |1><1| each multiplied by 1/2, it averages out to something like a maximally mixed state.

But wait, I'm supposed to find its geometrical position in qubit space. I think qubit states can be represented as vectors in 2D space, but density matrices are 2x2 matrices. Oh, right, but to visualize them geometrically, maybe we can map them to Bloch vectors?

The Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. For pure states, the Bloch vector has length 1, pointing from the origin to the surface of the sphere. For mixed states, the vector is inside the sphere, with the length representing the purity.

The density matrix for a pure state |ψ> is |ψ><ψ|. For a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture. In this case, the given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let's calculate it.

Let me write out the matrices. |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then, multiplying by 1/2, ρ becomes (1/2) * I, where I is the 2x2 identity matrix. So ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

I remember that the Bloch representation of a density matrix ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector. Let's see: if ρ is (I)/2, then the equation becomes (I/2) = (I + r·σ)/2. Multiplying both sides by 2, I = I + r·σ. Subtracting I from both sides gives r·σ = 0. 

The Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So r·σ = r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. For this sum to be zero, each component must be zero. So r_x = 0, r_y = 0, r_z = 0. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That's the origin.

Wait, but is that correct? Because the density matrix is a completely mixed state, which corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere. Because any pure state is on the surface, and a completely mixed state is in the center. So yes, the Bloch vector is zero.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state of a qubit. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For any density matrix, the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is related to the density matrix by the formula:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli matrices. For the given \( \rho \), we have:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I.
\]

Substituting this into the formula, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{2} I = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right).
\]

Subtracting \( \frac{1}{2} I \) from both sides gives:

\[
\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0.
\]

This implies that the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) must be zero, as the Pauli matrices are linearly independent. Therefore, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is at the origin of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the vector \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \).

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) \( \mathbf{r} = (1, 1, 0) \)**  
**B) \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 1) \)**  
**C) \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \)**  
**D) \( \mathbf{r} = (1, 1, 1) \)**  

The correct choice is **C**, as the Bloch vector is zero for a maximally mixed state.

Answer: C
