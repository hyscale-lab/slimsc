Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem to solve. Hmm, it's about a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal and all angles equal, but I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, right, a rhombohedral crystal is a type of hexagonal crystal system? Or wait, no, I think it's part of the cubic system. Wait, no, rhombohedral is its own system, right? Or maybe it's a subclass. Well, regardless, the key here is to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

The problem states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each. Oh wait, wait, interatomic distance—does that refer to the lattice parameter a, or is it the distance between atoms in some other arrangement. Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the lattice parameter a is the interatomic distance because each atom is at the corner, and the edge length is the distance between adjacent atoms. So for a simple cubic, a is the interatomic distance. But in other structures, like BCC or FCC, the interatomic distance is different. But wait, this is a rhombohedral crystal—so perhaps it's a primitive lattice where the atoms are at the corners, so a would be the interatomic distance. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me think. The problem says interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, so I'll assume that a is 10 A.

Wait, no, wait. In
