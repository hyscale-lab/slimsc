Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about interplanar distances in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is related to the crystal structure and the Miller indices of the plane. The question gives me the interatomic distance, which I think is the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice, right? But wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the lattice parameters might not all be the same. 

Wait, the problem states that the crystal is rhombohedral, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. Oh, right, in a rhombohedral system, all the edges are of equal length, a, and all the angles are equal, so that makes it a special case. So the lattice is cubic but with distorted angles. 

The interatomic distance they've given is 10 Angstrom. I'm assuming this is the lattice parameter 'a' because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice constant. So a = 10 Angstrom here. 

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that the interplanar distance d_{hkl} can be calculated using the formula involving the reciprocal of the lattice vectors. The formula I think is d = (1/√( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - ... )) something with the cosines of the angles between the lattice vectors. 

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by:

1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) * [ (1 + cos α cos β cos γ ) - (cos α (k^2 + l^2) ) - (cos β (h^2 + l^2) ) - (cos γ (h^2 + k^2) ) ) ] 

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the Miller indices and the structure factor. Alternatively, I think there's a formula that's more straightforward for cubic systems, but rhombohedral isn't exactly cubic. 

Wait, another approach: For a cubic crystal, the interplanar distance is given by d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But in a rhombohedral system, since the angles aren't 90 degrees, the formula is a bit different.
