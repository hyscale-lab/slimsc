Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again.

The system's state at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, those are the elements of the state vector. But wait, in quantum mechanics, state vectors are usually unit vectors, right? So the components squared should add up to 1. Let me check: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, that's 6, which is bigger than 1. So maybe the state isn't normalized. Hmm, perhaps I should normalize it later, or maybe the measurements will take that into account.

The operators for observables P and Q are given as matrices. For P, the matrix is:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).

Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

And Q's matrix is diagonal: first row [1,0,0], second [0,0,0], third [0,0,-1]. So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. That makes sense because it's diagonal, so the eigenvalues are on the diagonal.

The question is: If we measure P first, then Q, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q?

Wait, no. Wait the question says, measure Q just after P. So the sequence is measure P, then measure Q. And we're looking for the probability that P=0 and Q=-1.

Hmm, how do measurements work in quantum mechanics? Well, when you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. The probabilities are determined by the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the state and each eigenstate.

So first, I need to find the possible outcomes of measuring P. Because P is an observable, its eigenvalues are the possible outcomes. Then, the state after measuring P will be an eigenstate of P. Then, measuring Q on this new state will give me the probabilities for Q's outcomes.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the combined measurement, but I think the process is that each measurement affects the state.

Wait, no, measuring P first, then Q. So the order is P then Q.

So the steps are:

1. Start with the initial state vector. Wait, but the given state is (-1, 2,1). Let me write that as a column vector: ψ = [ -1; 2; 1 ].

But as I noted earlier, the norm is sqrt(6), so it's not normalized. So perhaps I should normalize it first.

So the normalized state is ψ = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.

Wait, unless the problem assumes that the state is already normalized, but given that the squared sum is 6, I think normalization is needed.

So ψ = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.

Now, the first measurement
