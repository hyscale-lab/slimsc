Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The K for the complex is given as 5x10^10, and the temperature is 25°C. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It binds metal ions like calcium, forming a complex. The complex formation is an equilibrium, right? So the K here is the formation constant, which tells us how strong the complex is.

The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Since it's a 1:1 complex (I think Ca-EDTA is usually in a 1:1 ratio), the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

Wait, but in solution, the complex dissociates a bit. So the concentration of free Ca²+ ions would be determined by the K value. The higher the K, the more the complex forms, so the free ions should be low.

The formula I think I need is K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). But wait, if the solution initially has only CaEDTA, then the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA would be very low. But I think I need to find [Ca²+], given the K and the initial concentration.

Wait, another approach: the formation constant Kf is given by Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). So, if I assume that the initial concentration of CaEDTA is 0.02 M, and the dissociation is negligible, then [CaEDTA] is approximately 0.02 M.

But wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA. So, the total concentration of Ca²+ from the complex is 0.02 M, but since it's a complex, the free [Ca²+] would be much less.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration is the sum of all species: [CaEDTA] + [Ca²+] + [EDTA]
