Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy of a nucleus moving at a certain speed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The question says: What is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Oh wait, nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So Li-6? Because lithium usually has 3 protons, so if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6 (3 protons +3 neutrons). So the mass number A is 6.

I remember that the energy in particle accelerators is usually the kinetic energy, but wait, no, sometimes it's the total energy. I need to clarify that. Because when you talk about the energy of a particle in a collider, it's often the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the question says "energy of the RHIC", which I think refers to the kinetic energy imparted to the ions. Or maybe it's the total energy? Hmm, maybe I should consider both.

The speed is given as 0.96c. So I'll need to calculate the total energy, which would be gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So let me compute that first.

v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is... Well, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right? 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me double-check. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So 1/sqrt(0.0784) is 1
