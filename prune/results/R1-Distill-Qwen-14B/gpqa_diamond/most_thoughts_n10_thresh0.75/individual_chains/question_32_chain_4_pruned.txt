Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, the question is asking for the energy of the RHIC such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, Li is lithium. So Li with 3 neutrons—that would be lithium-6, right? Because lithium usually has 3 protons. So if there are 3 neutrons, the atomic mass number A is 3 + 3 = 6. So we're dealing with a ^6Li nucleus.

I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, the energy of a particle is given by the total energy formula. Oh right, the total energy E is gamma times m c squared. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity. Since the speed is given as 0.96c, I can calculate gamma using that.

Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Let me calculate v squared first. 0.96c squared is (0.96)^2 c², which is 0.9216 c². So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Taking the square root of that, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

But wait, let me be precise. Let me compute it step by step to avoid mistakes. So v = 0.96c. Then v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c². 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

So the total energy E is gamma * m * c². But what's the mass m here? It's the rest mass of the lithium nucleus. The mass of ^6Li: I think the approximate mass can be found using the atomic mass. For example, the atomic mass of ^6Li is about 6 atomic mass units (u). Oh wait, but I need the exact value in kg or some unit that can be converted into energy with c².

Wait, I remember that 1 u is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So 6 u would be 6 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg = approximately 9.9632344e-27 kg.

But wait, maybe it's easier to use the mass in terms of u and then use the conversion factor to GeV. Because 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So 6 u would be 6 * 931.5 = 558
