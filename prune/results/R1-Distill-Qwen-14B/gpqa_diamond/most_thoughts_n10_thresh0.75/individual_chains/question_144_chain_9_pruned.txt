Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. I remember that mesons are particles made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are unstable particles, right? So they decay quickly.

The question asks for the mean decay distance. Hmm, I think the mean decay distance depends on how long the particle lives on average. The longer it lives, the farther it can travel before decaying. So I need to find the lifetime first, and then multiply by the speed to get the distance.

The given data is:
- Production energy E_X = 8 GeV
- Mass m_X = 1.2 GeV
- Width Γ_X = 320 MeV

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the production energy. Oh, right, in particle physics, when a particle is produced, its energy is determined by the interaction. But for calculating decay properties, maybe the mass is more important than the production energy. Because the width is related to the mass and the lifetime.

I remember that the natural linewidth (Γ) is connected to the particle's lifetime (τ) via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. Here, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy (ΔE), and the lifetime τ is the uncertainty in time (Δt). So Γ * τ ≈ ħ.

Wait, more precisely, the relation is Γ = ħ / τ̄, where τ̄ is the mean lifetime. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, I'm mixing units here. I need to be careful with the units because everything has to be consistent. Let's get the constants straight. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, but in particle physics, we often use ħ, which is h/(2π). So ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

But wait, the width is given in MeV. So I need to convert Γ into units of energy, and then into units compatible with ħ.

Alternatively, I think there's a formula that relates decay width, lifetime, and speed. The mean decay length (L) is given by L = c * τ * β γ, where β is v/c and γ is the Lorentz factor.

Wait, but I'm not sure
