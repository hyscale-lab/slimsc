Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question is about. The reaction is acid-catalyzed, and the starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Hmm, what does that product look like? I think cyclohexylidenemethyl would be like a cyclohexene group attached to a methylene group, connected to the pyrrolidine. So maybe it's some kind of ring expansion or addition.

Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine is a cyclic amine. Pyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with four carbons and one nitrogen. So 3-methylpyrrolidine would have a methyl group on the third carbon of the ring. Now, the product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached to the 1-position. So the nitrogen in the pyrrolidine probably is getting a substituent.

I remember that acid-catalyzed reactions involving amines can lead to various things like alkylation, acylation, or maybe even forming enamines or something like that. Wait, but the product here seems to have a cyclohexene as part of a substituent. Maybe it's a ring-forming reaction, like a ring expansion.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a conjugate addition. Or perhaps a Friedel-Crafts alkylation? No, Friedel-Crafts is for arenes. Hmm. Or maybe it's a Baylis-Hillman type reaction
