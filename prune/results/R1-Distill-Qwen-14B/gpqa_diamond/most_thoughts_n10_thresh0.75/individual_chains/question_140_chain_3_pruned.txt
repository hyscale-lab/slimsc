Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms that, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Another part mentions that when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially because of its analog.

Hmm, I think I should start by identifying each component. Let's list the clues:

1. Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y. That makes me think of metals reacting with acids. Violent reactions could be when metals like sodium, potassium, or maybe magnesium react with water or acids.

2. Gas W: molecule has equal protons and neutrons. So, the molecular formula would have the same number of p and n. Let's think about possible gases. H2O? No, because H has 1 proton and O has 8. Wait, H2O's molecule: H (1p, 0n) and O (8p, 8n). But each H has 1, so total protons are 2, neutrons are 8. Not equal. What about CO2? No, because CO2 is C (6p, 6n) and O2 (each O is 8p, 8n). Wait, but the molecule itself would have C and two O's. So for CO2, total protons:6 + 16=22. Neutrons:6 (C) + (16*2)=48. So 22 vs 48, not equal. Another idea: maybe NH3? No, because N has 7p, H has 1 each. So NH3: 14p, 14n (each N has 7n, H has 0). Wait, but NH3 has 14 protons and 14 neutrons? Let me see: Nitrogen has 7p, 7n. Each H has 1p, 0n. So NH3 has 7+3*1=10 protons, and 7*1 (from N) + 3*
