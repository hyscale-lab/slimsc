Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

So, the problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams, was heated to 200°C without air. Then, a mixture of gases formed, which was passed through some tubes. The first tube has anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, the second is a Ca(OH)2 solution, and the third has red-hot copper. The weights increased in tubes 1 and 3 by 3.60g and 0.80g respectively. Tube 2 didn't change. Then, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure.

The question is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm. Let me try to break this down.

First, the setup: the mixture of A and B is heated, and gases are produced. The gases pass through three tubes, each reacting in a different way.

Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous. When it absorbs water, it gains weight. So the increase of 3.60g is likely due to water (H2O) being absorbed. So the gas that reacted here is probably water vapor. But wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong drying agent, so the gas must be water. So the first reaction is the absorption of H2O by Mg(ClO4)2.

Tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas didn't cause a change, maybe it wasn't absorbed. Or perhaps the gas wasn't acidic? Or it was a neutral gas. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like CO2, but Ca(OH)2 would react with CO2 to form CaCO3 and water. But since there's no change, perhaps the gas doesn't react, or the reaction is not happening. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something inert, but I'm not sure.

Tube 3: red-hot copper. The gas passed through here caused an 0.80g increase, and CuO was formed. So the gas must have been something that reacts with copper. Maybe CO (carbon monoxide), because CO reacts with Cu at high temperatures to form CuO and carbon. Alternatively, it could be H2, but that might not make much sense here. Let me think: when CO passes through hot copper, it can oxidize. The reaction would be 2 Cu(s) + CO(g) → 2 CuO(s) + C(s). So the mass increase would be due to the oxygen in CO combining with copper. Let me calculate the mass of CO that reacted.

The mass increase in tube 3 is 0.80g. Let's see: the reaction is Cu + CO → CuO + C.

The molar masses: Cu is about 63.55 g/mol, O is 16, C is 12.

Wait, but for the reaction: 2 Cu + CO → 2 Cu
