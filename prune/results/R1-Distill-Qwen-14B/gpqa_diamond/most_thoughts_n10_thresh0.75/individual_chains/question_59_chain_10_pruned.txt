Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Hmm, let me start by reading the question again.

The problem says: Determine the pH of the solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D.

Wait, right, when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So first, I think I need to figure out how much of each acid and base we have, and then see what's left after the neutralization.

Let me break it down. The solutions are:

1. CH3COOH: which is acetic acid, a weak acid.
2. HCl: a strong acid.
3. Ba(OH)2: a strong base.

So, when these are mixed, the HCl (strong acid) and Ba(OH)2 (strong base) will react completely. The acetic acid might not react as much because it's weak, but I'll have to see if the strong acid and base neutralize each other, affecting the acetic acid.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the reaction. The strong acid (HCl) and strong base (Ba(OH)2) will react first. Because both are strong, they'll neutralize each other completely. Then, any excess from that reaction will react with the weak acid.

So, first step: find the moles of H+ from HCl and the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH^-.

HCl dissociates completely into H+ and Cl^-.

I'll calculate the moles:

Molarity = moles / liters, so moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters).

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles of HCl. So, it gives 0.08 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of OH-.

Now, the H+ and OH- will react: H+ + OH- â†’ H2O.

The moles of H+ are 0.08, and OH- is 0.18. So OH- is in excess. How much excess?

0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- left after neutralization.

Wait, but wait. Is that correct? Because HCl is a strong acid and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, they will completely neutralize each other to produce water. So, the H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2 will neutralize each other, and any excess will
