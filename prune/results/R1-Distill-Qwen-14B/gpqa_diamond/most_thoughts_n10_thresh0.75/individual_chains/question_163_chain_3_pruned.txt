Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution using a strong monobasic acid. They want to know the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid needed and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A, B, C, D with different volumes and pH values.

First, I should probably figure out the reaction that happens when Fe(OH)3 is treated with a strong acid. Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, and when it reacts with an acid, it should form a salt and water. Since the acid is monobasic, like HCl, it should donate one H+ ion. The reaction would be something like:

Fe(OH)3 + HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups, each reacting with one H+ from the acid. So the balanced equation should be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O

Yes, that makes sense. So one mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with three moles of HCl.

Next, I need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 we're dealing with. The mass is 0.1 grams. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + 3*(16 +1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51=106.85 g/mol.

Wait, wait, maybe I should calculate that more accurately. Let's see: Fe is 55.845, O is 16.00, H is 1.008. So each OH- is 16.00 + 1.008 =17.008. So Fe(OH)3 is 55.845 + 3*(17.008) = 55.845 + 51.024 = 106.869 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol, approximately 9.358e-4 mol.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of HCl, the moles of HCl needed would be 3 * 0.0009358 ≈ 0.0028074 mol.

But wait, the acid solution is 0.1 M. So the volume needed can be found by moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). Rearranging, Volume = moles / Molarity.

So Volume = 0.0028074 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028074 L = 28.074 cm³.

Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04. Option B is 30.09, which is a bit higher. So perhaps the initial calculation is right, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the molar mass?

Wait, let me recalculate the molar mass of Fe(OH)3.

Fe: 55.845 g/mol

Each OH group: 17.008
