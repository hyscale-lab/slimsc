Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let's see. The Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n, where σ is the Pauli vector, n is a unit vector, and ε is an energy constant.

Wait, Pauli spin matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, each of which are 2x2 matrices. The σ · n term would be the dot product of the Pauli vector with the unit vector n. So σ · n = σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z. 

The Hamiltonian H is then given by ε times this dot product. So H = ε (σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z). 

I remember that for any Pauli matrix σ_i, the eigenvalues are ±1. But wait, when you have a linear combination of them, like a · σ where a is a vector, what's the eigenvalue then?

Oh right! The eigenvalues of a matrix of the form a · σ (where a is a vector) are just ±|a|. Because the Pauli matrices are traceless and have eigenvalues ±1. So when multiplied by a vector a, the eigenvalues become ± the magnitude of a. 

Wait, in this case, the Hamiltonian is ε times (σ · n). So maybe I should think of it as H = (ε) (σ · n). Let me see, σ · n is a matrix, and its eigenvalues would be ±1 because n is a unit vector. Because |n|=1, so the magnitude of the vector (which is |n|) is 1. So the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1.

But then H is ε multiplied by that matrix. So the eigenvalues of H would be ε multiplied by the eigenvalues of σ · n. So they should be +ε and -ε. 

Wait, that makes sense. Because if the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1, multiplying by ε gives eigenvalues of ±ε. So the eigenvalues of H are ε and -ε.

Looking at the options, option B is +ε and -ε. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait. Pauli matrices are multiplied by factors in the Hamiltonian. So let me double-check. Suppose the Pauli vector is σ, and the Hamiltonian is H = ε σ ·
