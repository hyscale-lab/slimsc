Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. The question says a light beam is going through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. We need to find the speed of the light relative to the lab frame.

Wait, I remember that when a medium is moving, the speed of light in that medium as observed from outside can be affected by the motion of the medium. But I'm not exactly sure how.

So normally, in a stationary glass, the speed of light is c/n. But when the glass is moving, does that change? I've heard about the concept of relativity here. Oh right, Einstein's theory of relativity. But wait, I'm not sure about the specifics.

In classical mechanics, velocities just add up. Like, if the glass is moving at v and the light is moving at v_light in the medium, then in the lab frame, the light's speed would be v_light + v, or something like that. But wait, light's speed in vacuum is always c, regardless of the source's motion. But this is in a medium, so maybe the speed is different.

Wait, but in a medium, the speed is c/n. So when the medium is moving, does that affect the speed as observed? Or does the medium's motion affect how the light propagates?

Hmm, I think in relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. You can't just add them like in classical mechanics because that would exceed the
