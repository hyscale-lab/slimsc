Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that compounds A and B are treated separately with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. This treatment produces two different diketones. I need to figure out which starting materials A and B are from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that when certain functional groups are treated with nitrous acid (from NaNO2 and HCl), specific reactions can occur. Oh wait, sodium nitrite and HCl usually form nitrous acid (HNO2), which is a source of the nitronium ion (HONO+). But wait, I think the conditions also involve water, so maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction?

Wait, another thought: some reactions involving ketones and nitrous acid under acidic conditions. Or maybe it's related to the formation of diketones. I'm a bit confused. Let me think about what reactions produce diketones from other compounds.

Oh, wait! I think this is about the Stephen reduction, but no, that's for converting ketones to alkanes. Or maybe it's about the formation of ketones from something else. Alternatively, maybe it's about the Beckmann rearrangement, but that's for oximes into amides. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the treatment might be leading to the formation of a diketone. So, perhaps the starting materials are alcohols that undergo some kind of oxidation or elimination.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting materials are cyclic ketones. Because, when treated with HCl, NaNO2, and H2O, perhaps they undergo some kind of ring-opening or rearrangement. But I'm not quite sure.

Wait, I think I remember that when a cyclic ketone, like cyclohexanone, is treated with nitrous acid under certain conditions, it can form a diketone. Or maybe I'm mixing it up with something else.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are alcohols that are adjacent to a carbonyl group. For instance, if you have a secondary alcohol next to a ketone, then treatment with nitrous acid could lead to elimination, forming a carbonyl group. Wait, that makes sense because nitrous acid is a mild oxidizing agent in some contexts.

Wait, think about the reaction: when an alcohol is next
