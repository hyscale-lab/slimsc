Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Hmm, let me read it again. The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. And they provided some bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. The options are A, B, C, D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, wait. Enthalpy of formation usually refers to the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, I think the formula for calculating this would involve breaking all the bonds in the reactants (which are elements) and forming the bonds in the product.

But wait, the problem gives me bond energies, not the reverse. Oh right, bond energies are the energies required to break bonds. So, the formula for enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) using bond energies is: ΔHf = (sum of bond energies of reactants) – (sum of bond energies of products) multiplied by their stoichiometric coefficients. Or wait, no, maybe it's the other way around because the reaction is from elements to compound.

Wait no, the enthalpy of formation is calculated by taking the total energy needed to break all bonds in the elements (which are in standard form, like H2 and O2, etc.) and then subtract the energy released when the bonds in the compound form.

In this problem, the compound is made up of carbon and hydrogen. So,
