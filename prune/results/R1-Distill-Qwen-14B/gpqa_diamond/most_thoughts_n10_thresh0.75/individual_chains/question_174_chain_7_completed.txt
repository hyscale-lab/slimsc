Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on relativity and nuclear physics, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says that an atomic nucleus with mass M is at rest and has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M.

So, the initial nucleus is at rest, which means the total momentum should be conserved. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum since the initial momentum is zero.

The question is about finding the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the one calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

First, I think I need to find the rest masses of the two fragments. Let's denote the rest mass of the lighter fragment as m. Then the heavier one will be 2m. The sum of their rest masses is m + 2m = 3m, and this is 99% of M. So 3m = 0.99 M → m = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M. So the lighter fragment has mass 0.33 M, and the heavier is 0.66 M.

Wait, M is the initial mass, but M's rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So, initial energy is just the rest mass energy, 300 GeV, because it's at rest.

After fission, the two fragments have rest masses 0.33 M and 0.66 M. But their total rest mass is 0.99 M, so the remaining 1% of M must be converted into kinetic energy or other forms, perhaps some binding energy or other products? But the problem says nothing else is produced, just two fragments, so maybe energy is released as their kinetic energy.

Wait, the problem says the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M, so the rest mass of the two together is 0.99 M. So the initial rest mass was 100% M, so the mass difference is 0.01 M. That mass difference would correspond to the energy released, which goes into kinetic energy. Because in nuclear reactions, the mass defect is converted into energy via E=mc².

So the total energy released would be 0.01 M * c². But since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total energy of the two fragments (their rest energies plus kinetic energies) must equal the initial rest energy plus the binding energy released. Wait, no, when the nucleus splits, the rest mass might decrease, so total energy would be conserved.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of conservation of energy and momentum.

Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta.

Let me denote the masses as m1 and m2. m1 is 2 times m2. Wait, wait. The problem says one fragment is twice as massive as the other. So if m2 is the lighter one, m1 = 2 m2. So m1 = 2m2.

Sum of rest masses: m1 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M. So m1 = 0.66 M.

So m1 is 0.66 M, m2 is 0.33 M.

The initial nucleus has rest mass M, so initial energy is Mc² = 300 GeV.

After fission, the total rest energy of the two fragments is (0.66 M)c² + (0.33 M)c² = 0.99 M c². So the total rest energy is 0.99 times the initial. So the energy released is the initial rest energy minus the sum of the rest energies of the two fragments. So the energy released is (M c² - 0.99 M c²) = 0.01 M c² = 3 GeV (since M c² is 300 GeV, 0.01 *300 GeV =3 GeV).

This 3 GeV is the total kinetic energy of the two fragments. Because in the rest frame, after the fission, the nucleus's rest energy is gone, and the two fragments have their rest energies plus kinetic energy. But wait, no, the initial nucleus had M c², and after fission, the fragments have (0.66 M c² + 0.33 M c²) = 0.99 M c² as their rest energy. So the difference is 0.01 M c², which must be the sum of their kinetic energies.

So the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fragments is 3 GeV.

Wait, that's 3000 MeV. But the options are in the MeV range, so that makes sense.

Now, the problem asks for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. Since the two have different masses, their speeds will be different.

Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum is zero. So m1 v1 = m2 v2, but in opposite directions. So perhaps m1 v1 = - m2 v2 → v1 = -(m2/m1) v2.

Wait, but for momentum conservation, the momentum of fragment 1 is p = m1 v1, fragment 2 is p' = m2 v2. Since the total is zero, m1 v1 = - m2 v2 → v1 = -(m2/m1) v2.

But this is in non-relativistic terms, but perhaps relativistic effects are important here since the kinetic energy is a significant fraction of the rest mass energy.

Wait, the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, but the kinetic energies are only 3 GeV, which is 1% of the rest mass energy. So perhaps non-relativistic approximation is okay, but the question is asking for the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1.

Wait, but even 3 GeV is a lot for a nucleus, I think. Wait, 1 GeV is about 1.6 billion electron volts. For a nucleus with a rest mass of hundreds of MeV, 3 GeV would be 3000 MeV, which is about 10 times the rest mass of a typical nucleus. Hmm, wait, the rest mass of the initial nucleus is 300 GeV, which is 300,000 MeV. So the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, which is 1% of the rest mass. So maybe relativistic effects are negligible, but perhaps the problem wants us to consider the difference between the relativistic and non-relativistic calculations.

Wait, the problem says to find the difference between the correct T1 and the T1 calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. So perhaps T1 is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, which is T1.

In any case, let's proceed.

So since the sum of the kinetic energies is 3 GeV, let me denote T1 as the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, and T2 as the kinetic energy of the lighter one. So T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

We need to find T1. But how?

We can use the conservation of momentum and kinetic energy.

Wait, but since the nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So, p1 = momentum of fragment 1 (mass m1) = sqrt(2 m1 T1) ... wait, wait, no. The non-relativistic expression for momentum is p = sqrt(2 m T), but that's not exactly correct. Actually, in non-relativistic terms, kinetic energy T is (p²)/(2m). So p = sqrt(2 m T).

But when relativistic effects are considered, the momentum is related to the kinetic energy via p = gamma m v, and gamma is (1 - v²/c²)^(-1/2).

Alternatively, the relativistic expression for kinetic energy is T = (gamma - 1) m c².

But perhaps it's easier to work in terms of energy and momentum.

Each fragment's energy is E1 = m1 c² + T1, E2 = m2 c² + T2.

Momentum: p1 = p, p2 = p (since opposite directions, the momenta have equal magnitude but opposite directions).

So, p1 = sqrt( (E1/c² )² - (m1 c)² ), from the relativistic energy-momentum relation E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

Similarly for p2: p2 = sqrt( (E2/c² )² - (m2 c)^2 ).

But since p1 = p2 (in magnitude), we can set:

sqrt( (E1/c² )² - (m1 c)^2 ) = sqrt( (E2/c² )² - (m2 c)^2 )

Squaring both sides:

(E1/c² )² - (m1 c)^2 = (E2/c² )² - (m2 c)^2

Multiply through by c^4:

E1² - (m1 c² )^2 c² = E2² - (m2 c² )^2 c²

Wait, maybe I messed up the units there. Alternatively, let's write it more carefully.

Wait, E² is (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So,

E1² = (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2

E2² = (p c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2

Because the magnitudes of p are the same for both.

So E1² - (m1 c² )² = E2² - (m2 c² )².

But E1 = m1 c² + T1, and E2 = m2 c² + T2.

So:

(m1 c² + T1)^2 - (m1 c²)^2 = (m2 c² + T2)^2 - (m2 c²)^2

Expanding both sides:

Left side: m1² c^4 + 2 m1 c² T1 + T1² - m1² c^4 = 2 m1 c^2 T1 + T1²

Right side: m2² c^4 + 2 m2 c² T2 + T2² - m2² c^4 = 2 m2 c^2 T2 + T2²

So,

2 m1 c² T1 + T1² = 2 m2 c² T2 + T2²

But we also know that T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

Wait, but this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.

Alternatively, perhaps considering the energy released, which is 3 GeV, and the fact that the more massive fragment would have less kinetic energy than the lighter one, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. Wait, more massive fragment would have lower speed for the same momentum. Because p = m v. So if m is larger, v is smaller.

Since the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v², the more massive fragment would have less kinetic energy if they have the same speed, but since in our case, their speeds are different, perhaps the more massive one has less speed but more mass, so it's unclear which has more kinetic energy.

Wait, but let's think: higher mass but lower velocity. So maybe the lighter fragment has higher velocity and thus higher kinetic energy.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think in terms of non-relativistic mechanics.

In the non-relativistic case, the two fragments' velocities are related by their masses. Since m1 = 2 m2,

m1 v1 = m2 v2 → 2 m2 v1 = m2 v2 → v2 = 2 v1.

So the lighter fragment is moving twice as fast as the heavier one.

Then, the kinetic energies are (1/2 m1 v1²) and (1/2 m2 (2 v1)^2) = (1/2 m2) *4 v1² = 2 m2 v1².

So T1 (for m1) is (1/2)(2 m2) v1² = m2 v1².

T2 (for m2) is 2 m2 v1².

So T1 + T2 = 3 m2 v1² = 3 GeV.

So,

3 m2 v1² = 3 GeV → m2 v1^2 = 1 GeV.

Now, T1 is m2 v1^2 = 1 GeV.

Wait, but that can't be right because then T2 would be 2 GeV, and T1 + T2 = 3 GeV, which adds up.

So in the non-relativistic case, T1 is 1 GeV.

But wait, that's a lot. Because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, which is 10^3 MeV. But the options are in single digits of MeV. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps using relativistic considerations, the kinetic energy would be different.

Wait, but the initial approach may have a mistake because the energy released is 3 GeV, but the rest mass of the initial nucleus is 300 GeV. So 3 GeV is 1% of the initial rest energy. So perhaps relativistic effects are negligible, and the non-relativistic approximation is close enough. But the problem is asking for the difference between the correct and classical T1.

Wait, but according to the non-relativistic approach, T1 is 1 GeV. But the options are in the MeV range. So maybe I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units. Let me re-examine.

Wait, M is the initial mass, and its rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So M c² = 300 GeV.

The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 0.99 M, so 0.99 M c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.

So the energy released is 300 - 297 = 3 GeV, which is the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fragments.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m1) is 1 GeV, and the lighter (m2) is 2 GeV.

But 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, which is way larger than the options given (options are A) 2, B)5, C)10, D)20 MeV). So something's wrong here.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me re-express the problem.

Wait, the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So (m1 + m2) = 0.99 M.

But M c² is 300 GeV. The rest masses of the fragments are m1 c² and m2 c².

So the sum of their rest energies is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.

The initial rest energy is 300 GeV, so the kinetic energy (sum) is 3 GeV.

So in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energies would be T1 and T2, with T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

But in the non-relativistic case, using the earlier approach, I found T1 =1 GeV. But the options are in MeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the non-relativistic calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should express m1 and m2 in terms of M.

m1 = 2 m2.

m1 + m2 = 3 m2 =0.99 M → m2= 0.33 M.

So m1= 0.66 M.

The initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum is zero.

In non-relativistic terms, the velocities of the fragments can be found using conservation of momentum.

Let me denote the velocity of the heavier fragment (m1) as v, and the lighter (m2) as u.

Since momentum is conserved, m1 v = m2 u → (0.66 M) v = (0.33 M) u → u = 2 v.

Now, the kinetic energy of each fragment is (1/2) m v².

So T1 = (1/2) m1 v² = 0.5 * 0.66 M * v².

T2 = 0.5 * m2 u² = 0.5 * 0.33 M * (2 v)^2 = 0.5 * 0.33 M *4 v² = 0.5 * 0.33 *4 * M v² = 0.66 M v².

So T1 + T2 = 0.33 M v² + 0.66 M v² = 0.99 M v².

But this sum is equal to 3 GeV. So,

0.99 M v² = 3 GeV.

But M c² is 300 GeV, so M = (300 GeV)/(c²).

Wait, so M v² = (300 GeV / c²) * v².

Putting that into the equation: 0.99 * (300 GeV / c²) * v² = 3 GeV.

Simplify: (0.99 *300 GeV) * v² / c² = 3 GeV.

0.99 *300 =297 → 297 GeV * v² / c² =3 GeV.

Divide both sides by GeV: 297 * v² / c² =3 → v²= (3 c²) / 297 → v²= c² / 99.

So v= c / sqrt(99) ≈ c /9.9499.

So now, T1= 0.5 *0.66 M v².

M v² = (300 GeV / c²) * (c² /99) )= 300/99 GeV = 100/33 GeV ≈3.03 GeV.

So T1=0.5 *0.66 * (300 GeV /c²) * (c² /99) )= 0.5 *0.66 * (300 /99) GeV.

Compute: 0.5 *0.66 =0.33.

0.33 * (300/99) = 0.33 * (10/3) )= (0.33 *10)/3= 3.3/3=1.1 GeV.

Wait, that's about 1.1 GeV. But the options are in MeV. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So 1.1 GeV is 1100 MeV, which is way larger than the options, which are up to 20 MeV.

Hmm, so perhaps the initial assumption that the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M is correct, but perhaps I made a mistake in the non-relativistic approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the relativistic calculation and compare it to the non-relativistic.

Wait, but the problem says to find the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1.

Wait, perhaps in the classical approach, the kinetic energy is 1 GeV, but the relativistic calculation gives a different value, and the difference is, say, 10 MeV. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy released is 3 GeV, and that's the sum of the kinetic energies. So each fragment's KE is a portion of 3 GeV.

Wait, but maybe I should consider the relativistic correction. Let's think about it.

Another approach: since the fragments are moving, their total energy is the sum of their rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The initial nucleus has rest energy 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is sum of the two fragments' rest energies plus their kinetic energies.

But because the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum must be zero, so the two fragments have equal and opposite momenta.

So, using conservation of energy and momentum.

Let me denote:

m1 = 0.66 M

m2 = 0.33 M

E1 = m1 c² + T1

E2 = m2 c² + T2

p1 = p, p2 = p (since opposite directions, so p2 = -p1)

So,

E1² = (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2

E2² = (p c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2

Also,

E1 + E2 = initial energy = 300 GeV.

Wait, initial energy is 300 GeV, yes.

So,

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

Sum of rest energies after fission is 0.99 M c² = 297 GeV.

So,

E1 + E2 = 297 GeV + (T1 + T2) = 300 GeV.

So, T1 + T2 =3 GeV, same as before.

So, E1 = m1 c² + T1 = 0.66 M c² + T1

E2 = 0.33 M c² + T2

So,

E1 + E2 = 0.66*300 GeV + 0.33*300 GeV + T1 + T2.

Which is 198 GeV + 99 GeV +3 GeV =300 GeV, which matches.

Now, using the energy-momentum relation for each fragment:

(E1)^2 = (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2

(E2)^2 = (p c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2

Subtracting the two equations,

E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1^2 - m2^2) c^4

But E1^2 - E2^2 = (E1 - E2)(E1 + E2)

So,

(E1 - E2)(300 GeV) = (m1^2 - m2^2) c^4

Compute m1^2 - m2^2.

m1 =0.66 M → m1^2 =0.4356 M²

m2=0.33 M → m2^2=0.1089 M² → m1^2- m2^2=0.3267 M².

So,

(E1 - E2)(300 GeV) = (0.3267 M²) c^4.

But M c²=300 GeV → M c^2 =300 GeV → M=300 GeV/(c²)

So, M² c^4 = (300 GeV/(c²))^2 *c^4 = (300 GeV)^2 * c^0 → (90000 GeV²).

So,

(E1 - E2)(300 GeV) = 0.3267 * (90000 GeV²) → 0.3267 *9e4 GeV² =29403 GeV².

So,

(E1 - E2) = (29403 GeV²) / (300 GeV) )= 98.01 GeV.

So E1 = E2 +98.01 GeV.

But E1 + E2 =300 GeV → E2 +98.01 + E2=300 → 2 E2=201.99 → E2≈100.995 GeV.

Then E1 =300 -100.995=199.005 GeV.

So,

E1 =199.005 GeV = m1 c² + T1 → T1= E1 -m1 c².

m1 c²=0.66*300 GeV=198 GeV.

So,

T1=199.005 -198 =1.005 GeV =1005 MeV.

Similarly, E2=100.995 GeV.

m2 c²=0.33*300=99 GeV → T2=100.995-99=1.995 GeV.

So T1=1005 MeV, T2≈1995 MeV → sum is 3000 MeV=3 GeV, which matches.

So the correct T1 is approximately 1005 MeV.

Now, what would the classical (non-relativistic) calculation give us for T1?

In the non-relativistic case, earlier calculation found T1=1 GeV=1000 MeV.

So the difference between correct T1 and classical T1 is 1005 MeV -1000 MeV =5 MeV.

Wait, that's 5 MeV.

Looking at the options, option B is 5 MeV.

So the answer should be B.


To solve the problem, we analyze the nuclear fission process using conservation of energy and momentum. The initial nucleus has a rest mass energy of 300 GeV and undergoes fission into two fragments, one twice as massive as the other. The sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass, meaning the energy released during fission is 1% of the initial rest mass energy, or 3 GeV. This energy is converted into the total kinetic energy of the two fragments.

### Step 1: Rest Masses of the Fragments
Let the rest mass of the lighter fragment be \( m_2 \). The heavier fragment then has a rest mass \( m_1 = 2m_2 \). The total rest mass of the two fragments is \( m_1 + m_2 = 3m_2 = 0.99M \), where \( M \) is the initial mass of the nucleus. Solving for \( m_2 \), we find:

\[
m_2 = \frac{0.99M}{3} = 0.33M, \quad m_1 = 0.66M
\]

### Step 2: Energy Released and Kinetic Energy Distribution
The initial rest energy of the nucleus is \( M c^2 = 300 \, \text{GeV} \). After fission, the total rest energy of the two fragments is:

\[
m_1 c^2 + m_2 c^2 = 0.66M c^2 + 0.33M c^2 = 0.99M c^2 = 297 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

The energy released is:

\[
\Delta E = M c^2 - (m_1 c^2 + m_2 c^2) = 300 \, \text{GeV} - 297 \, \text{GeV} = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

This energy is entirely converted into the kinetic energy of the two fragments, so:

\[
T_1 + T_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 3: Conservation of Momentum
Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. Let the velocities of the two fragments be \( v_1 \) and \( v_2 \). Conservation of momentum gives:

\[
m_1 v_1 = m_2 v_2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v_2 = \frac{m_1}{m_2} v_1 = 2v_1.
\]

### Step 4: Non-Relativistic Kinetic Energy
In the non-relativistic approximation, the kinetic energy of a fragment is given by \( T = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \). Using the relation \( v_2 = 2v_1 \), the kinetic energies of the two fragments are:

\[
T_1 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2, \quad T_2 = \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2 = \frac{1}{2} m_2 (2v_1)^2 = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_1^2 = 2T_1'.
\]

Here, \( T_1' \) is the kinetic energy of the lighter fragment. Since \( T_1 + T_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \), we have:

\[
T_1' + 2T_1' = 3 \, \text{GeV} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3T_1' = 3 \, \text{GeV} \quad \Rightarrow \quad T_1' = 1 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Thus, the kinetic energy of the heavier fragment in the non-relativistic approximation is:

\[
T_1 = 1 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 5: Relativistic Kinetic Energy
In the relativistic case, the total energy of each fragment is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy:

\[
E_1 = m_1 c^2 + T_1, \quad E_2 = m_2 c^2 + T_2.
\]

Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation \( E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 \), and the fact that the total momentum is zero, we solve for \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \). The calculations show that the heavier fragment's kinetic energy is slightly higher than the non-relativistic value. Specifically, the correct \( T_1 \) is approximately \( 1005 \, \text{MeV} \), while the non-relativistic value is \( 1000 \, \text{MeV} \).

### Step 6: Difference Between Relativistic and Non-Relativistic \( T_1 \)
The difference between the correct \( T_1 \) and the non-relativistic \( T_1 \) is:

\[
\Delta T_1 = 1005 \, \text{MeV} - 1000 \, \text{MeV} = 5 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The difference between the correct \( T_1 \) and the non-relativistic \( T_1 \) is **5 MeV**.

ANSWER: B
