Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question says that we're trying to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this, and also determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given, so I need to calculate both the volume and pH, then match them to the options.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I think I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 we're dealing with. Fe(OH)3 has a molar mass that I can calculate. Iron (Fe) has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol, oxygen (O) is 16 g/mol, and hydrogen (H) is about 1 g/mol. So Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + 3*(1 + 16) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51= 106.85 g/mol.

Given that we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3, the number of moles would be mass divided by molar mass. So moles = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me double-check that calculation. 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.0009359, so about 9.36e-4 moles.

Now, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, and when it dissolves in an acid, it should react. The reaction would be between Fe(OH)3 and the strong acid, likely HCl or H2SO4, but since it's monobasic, probably HCl. The reaction equation would be Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

Wait, but wait. Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and it's not very soluble in water. So in order to dissolve it, you need to add an acid to react with it. The acid (H+) will react with the hydroxide ions (OH-) from Fe(OH)3, converting them into water.

So the moles of H+ needed would be 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3, because each Fe(OH)3 molecule provides 3 OH- ions, and each OH- will react with one H+.

So moles of H+ required = 3 * 9.36e-4 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

But wait, the acid is 0.1 M. So the volume of acid needed can be found using the formula: moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So Volume = moles / Molarity.

So Volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, but wait, is that all?

Wait, no, because the total volume of the solution is 100 cm³. So when we add the acid, the total volume becomes 100 cm³ plus the volume of the acid added. But wait, if the acid's volume is much smaller than 100 cm³, maybe it's negligible? Or do I need to account for it?

Hmm. If the volume of acid added is, say, 28 cm³, then the total solution volume would be 100 +28=128 cm³. But when calculating the concentration of Fe^3+ and H+ ions, perhaps we can consider the dilution.
