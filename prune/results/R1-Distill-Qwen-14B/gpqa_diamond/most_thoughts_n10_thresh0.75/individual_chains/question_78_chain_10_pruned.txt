Alright, so I've got this question about electromagnetic potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that when a charge is moving, it not only produces electric fields but also magnetic fields. And these are related to the scalar and vector potentials, respectively.

Wait, the question mentions the scalar potential V and the vector potential A. Right, for a static charge, the scalar potential is straightforward like Coulomb's law: V = q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated because of relativity and the fields' dependence on velocity.

So, the setup: the charge is moving with a trajectory s(t), and we're considering the fields at a point r at time t. The field is generated at an earlier time tr, and d is the vector from where the field was generated to the observation point r.

Wait, d is the vector from the point where the field was generated (at tr) to the observation point r. So, I think that means d = r - s(tr). Because s(tr) is where the charge was at time tr, and then the field propagates to r, so the distance is |d|.

But when the charge is moving, the potentials might involve the velocity of the charge at the time tr. Because the magnetic field depends on the current, which involves the charge's velocity.

I recall that for a moving charge, the scalar potential can be a bit tricky. The scalar potential V is generally given by the Coulomb potential, but when the charge is moving, it might not just be 1/r anymore because of the motion. Wait, but in the options, option B has V as Coulomb's law. So perhaps for the scalar potential in the static case, it still holds, but the vector potential comes into play for the magnetic part.

Wait, no, because even the scalar potential for a moving charge can have a correction. Oh, right, I think when the charge is moving, the scalar potential can have a term that includes the velocity, but maybe in some gauge it remains similar to the static case. But I might need to think about the retarded potentials.

Ah, right! retarded potentials. So for a moving charge, the potentials at a later time (t > tr) are found using the retarded time tr, where tr = t - |
