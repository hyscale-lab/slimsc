Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let me think about what I know.

Parallax is a measure of distance to a star. The closer the star, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger. Because parallax is the apparent shift in position when observed from two points in orbit (like Earth's orbit around the Sun). So the formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), right.

Now the question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. Suppose stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform in what sense? Are they uniformly distributed in space, so the number density is the same everywhere? Or are they uniformly distributed on the sky, meaning same number per solid angle?

Wait, the question says "uniformly distributed in the sky." Hmm, so perhaps it's about their spatial density on the celestial sphere. If stars are uniformly distributed, then the number per unit area on the sky would be constant.

But wait, how does that relate to parallax? Parallax depends on distance. So the number of stars with a certain parallax would depend on how the distances are distributed. But if stars are uniformly distributed in space, that's different. Wait, the question says "uniformly distributed in the sky," which I think refers to angular distribution, not spatial density. Like, same number per unit solid angle.

Wait, maybe I should approach it from geometry. The parallax (p) is 1/d, where d is distance
