Okay, so I've got this question about an aromatic compound and its NMR spectrum. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question says it's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbons in total. Wait, a benzene ring is 6 carbons, so the substituents must add up to 2 more carbons, right? Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Benzene is 6 carbons, so if the molecule has 8 carbons total, the substituents add 2 more carbons. So the di-substituted benzene would have two substituents, each adding a certain number of carbons.

Wait, but wait, if it's a di-substituted benzene, each substituent is a group attached to the ring. So for each substituent, let's think: how many carbons they contribute. For example, if one substituent is a methyl group (CH3), that's one carbon. Another substituent could be a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester or something.

But the question also says the FTIR shows a carbonyl group. So there's a C=O somewhere. So maybe one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, like an acetyl group (COCH3), or another possibility.

Wait, but wait. The ring has 8 carbons in total. So the benzene is 6, plus substituents. So substituents add 2 carb
