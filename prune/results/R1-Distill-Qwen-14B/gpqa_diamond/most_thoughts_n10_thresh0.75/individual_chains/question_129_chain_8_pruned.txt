Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to walk through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about identifying compound E in a reaction sequence. The steps are as follows:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are some hints provided. Let's start by breaking down each step and see what we can figure out.

First, let's look at hint a). It says that compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in the Wittig reaction. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting an ylide with an aldehyde or ketone. So, if compound A reacts with a ylide to form that product, then A might be a carbonyl compound—either an aldehyde or ketone.

Looking at the product: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The substituents on the cyclopentane are at positions 1,2, and 4. The group at position 4 is a propan-2-ylidene, which is a substituent with a double bond. So, the ylide would have added a CH2-CH(CH3) group as an alkene.

Wait, the product structure is a cyclopentane ring with substituents. Position 4 has a propylidene group (propan-2-ylidene), which is CH2-C(CH3)=. So, the starting material A must have a carbonyl group that, upon reacting with the ylide, forms that substituent.

So, let's think: when a Wittig reagent reacts with a ketone or aldehyde, it forms an alkene. The structure of the product suggests that the carbonyl in A was at a certain position. Maybe A is a cyclic ketone because the product is a substituted cyclopentane with a double bond.

But wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So, the cyclopentane has two methyl groups at 1 and 2 positions, and a propan-2-ylidene group at position 4.

If the Wittig reagent is adding a CH2-CH(CH3) group as a double bond, then the carbonyl in compound A must have been adjacent to a cyclopentane ring. Alternatively, perhaps A is a cyclic ketone, like cyclopentanone, but substituted.

Alternatively, perhaps A has a carbonyl group that, when the Wittig reagent adds, forms the double bond in the product. Let me try to draw this.

Suppose compound A is a cyclopentanone derivative. The Wittig reaction would replace the carbonyl oxygen with an alkene. So, if A is, say, 4-oxocyclopentane (which is cyclopentanone), then reacting with a ylide like CH2-PPh3=CHCH(CH3), the Wittig would form a double bond.

Wait, but the product has a propan-2-ylidene group, which is CH2-C(CH3)=. So, the ylide would have a structure like (CH2)2C(CH3)−PPh3+ etc. When it reacts with the carbonyl group in A, it would form a new double bond.

Wait, another approach: perhaps A is a cyclic ketone, like cyclohexanone, but that would probably lead to a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps A is a cyclopentanone substituted with methyl groups.

Wait, in the product, the cyclopentane has methyl groups at 1 and 2, so
