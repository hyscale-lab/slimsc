Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are also some hints provided, so I should pay attention to those.

First, let's outline the reactions:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

The options given are four different ketones. So, likely, E is a ketone. Let's think about each step.

Starting with compound A reacting with HCN. HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups. So, A must have a carbonyl, like a ketone or aldehyde. When a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. So compound B would be a cyanohydrin, which is a secondary alcohol with a cyano group attached.

Next, compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That's a hydrogenation catalyst. So what happens when a cyanohydrin is hydrogenated? The cyanide group (CN) is a good leaving group, but wait, in this case, it's attached to a carbon adjacent to an alcohol group. Wait, no, hydrogenation would typically reduce double bonds. Hmm, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, another possibility: if compound B is a nitrile. Oh wait, no, HCN adds to a carbonyl to form a cyanohydrin, which would have an -OH and -CN on adjacent carbons. So the structure would be something like R-C(OH)-CH2-CN? Or maybe R-C(OH)-R'-CN, depending on the starting compound.

Wait, but when you reduce a cyanohydrin, perhaps the -CN group is converted. Wait, hydrogenation usually adds H2 across double bonds. So if B has a double bond, like maybe after the addition of HCN, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's more straightforward. Let's think about the reaction steps again.

A → B: HCN addition → B is a cyanohydrin (so has an alcohol and nitrile group)
B → C: Hydrogenation. Wait, H2 with Pd usually reduces triple bonds, double bonds, and maybe nitriles. So if B has a nitrile (CN), maybe hydrogenation would reduce it to an amine? Wait, no, reducing CN with H2 and a catalyst like Pd would give CH2NH2 or something, but that's more like using H2/Ni or other catalysts. Alternatively, if B's structure has a nitrile, then C would have an amine group. But then in the next step, the reaction with HNO2 (which is nitrous acid) typically reacts with amines to form diazonium salts, which then undergo decomposition.

Wait, but let me think about each step again.

1. A + HCN → B: A is a ketone (since IR of A shows strong peak at 1750, which is typical for a ketone carbonyl). So B
