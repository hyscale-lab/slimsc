Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are multiple steps involved, and some hints provided. Let's go through each part carefully.

First, let me list out the reactions:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

And the hints:

a) A reacts with a phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) IR of A has a peak at ~1750 cm^-1, and E has a peak at ~1715 cm^-1.

The options are four different ketones, so I'm assuming E is a ketone.

Let me start by analyzing the hints and each reaction step.

Hint b: A's IR shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1. That's typical for a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde. But since A is reacting with HCN, which usually forms a cyanohydrin, perhaps A is a ketone. Wait, if A is a ketone, then reacting with HCN would add a cyanide group adjacent to the carbonyl, forming a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, if A were an aldehyde, HCN would also add, but aldehydes are less common in such reactions compared to ketones. But let's think about each step.

Step 1: A + HCN → B. So, if A is a ketone, then B is a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation involves adding a CN group to the carbonyl. So for example, if A is cyclopentanone, adding HCN would give a structure where the CN is attached to the adjacent carbon.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. So, hydrogenation of what? B is a cyanohydrin, which has a CN group. Hydrogenation of nitriles (CN) typically reduces them to CH2NH2, but wait, under hydrogenation with Pd, perhaps the nitrile is hydrogenated to an amine? Or maybe the nitrile is reduced to an amine group. Alternatively, if B has a double bond as part of the cyanohydrin structure, perhaps that's being hydrogenated. Wait, cyanohydrin adds a CN group and would have a new alcohol group adjacent. Wait, no, let me think again. Wait, when a ketone reacts with HCN, the mechanism is that the carbonyl oxygen attacks the HCN, leading to a tetrahedral intermediate, which then loses water to form the cyanohydrin. So the structure would have a hydroxyl group and a CN group on adjacent carbons. So, for example, if A is cyclohexanone, B would be 3-cyano-2-hydroxycyclohexane or something similar.

Wait, but then in step 2, B is hydrogenated. Let's see. If B is a secondary alcohol (from the OH group) and a nitrile group, then under hydrogenation with H2 and Pd, the nitrile would be reduced. Nitriles upon hydrogenation typically form amines. So, R-CN + H2 → R-CH2-NH2. But wait, that's under certain conditions, like using H2 and a catalyst like Raney Ni or Pt. Alternatively, sometimes the nitrile is hydrogenated to a primary amine. So perhaps compound C would have an amine group.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is of an alpha-hydrogen elimination, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation is of an alkene. Wait, but
