Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transition probabilities. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the |3,0,0⟩ state decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules.

Wait, right, the selection rules for dipole transitions. I think the main ones are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh, and Δn can be any integer except zero, but in this case, it's a two-step transition from n=3 to n=1, which would require two steps. Because you can't go from 3 to 1 in a single dipole transition since that would require Δn = -2, which isn't allowed. So it has to go through an intermediate state.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0 (s orbital), m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. So the decay path must involve two transitions. Each step must follow the selection rules.

First, from n=3, l=0 to some intermediate state. Since l can only change by ±1, the first transition would have to go to l=1. So the intermediate state must have l=1. The possible m values for the intermediate state can be m = 0, ±1 because Δm can be 0, ±1.

Wait, so the first transition from |3,0,0⟩. So the initial m is 0. The possible m after transition would be m=0, +1, or -1. But wait, the first transition could go to l=1, so the possible states would be |2,1, m⟩ where m is -1,0,+1.

Wait, no. Because n can decrease by 1 in each step? Let's think. The initial n is 3. The next step must go to n=2, because going from 3 to 1 would require a two-step process. So from n=3 to n=2, and then from n=2 to n=1.

So first transition: 3,0,0 → 2, l=1, m=?.

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. For the first transition, the selection rules apply. So l can go from 0 → 1 (Δl=+1). So the intermediate state is |2,1, m⟩. What can m be? The initial m is 0, so m can change by 0, ±1. So m can be -1, 0, +1.

So the possible intermediate states are |2,1, -1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, |2,1, +1⟩.

Then from the intermediate state, we have to go to the final state |1,0,0⟩. So for the second transition, the selection rules apply again. The intermediate state is |2,1, m⟩.

In the second transition, n goes from 2 to 1 (Δn=-1). The l must change by ±1, so from l=1 to l=0 (Δl=-1). So that's allowed.

Now, for the m values: the intermediate state's m can be -1, 0, or +1. The final state's m is 0. So from m_initial to m_final, what changes are allowed?

The selection rule is Δm = 0, ±1. So for each possible intermediate m, what's allowed?

Let me consider each case:

1. Intermediate state |2,1, +1⟩: To reach m=0, the change is -1. So Δm = -1. That's allowed. So the transition from m=+1 → 0 is possible.

2. Intermediate state |2,1, 0⟩: To reach m=0, Δm=0. Allowed.

3. Intermediate state |2,1, -1⟩: To reach m=0, Δm=+1. Allowed.

So all three intermediate states can lead to the final state. So the decay paths are:

3→2 (l=0→1, m=0→0, +1, -1) and then 2→1 (l=1→0, m= any of the three → 0). So each first step has 3 possibilities, and each second step has 1 possibility (since each intermediate state goes to a unique final state).

Wait, but the question is about the transition route and probability. The options give specific routes. So the problem is probably about the possible routes that are allowed, and the probabilities.

Wait, but the question says it's a two-dipole transition. So two
