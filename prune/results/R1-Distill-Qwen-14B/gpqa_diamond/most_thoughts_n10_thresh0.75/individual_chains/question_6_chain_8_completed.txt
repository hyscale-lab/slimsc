Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says there's a particle of mass m moving in two dimensions with a potential V(r, θ) given by (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. They're asking for the energy spectrum, and there are four options to choose from.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when dealing with potentials in two dimensions, especially in polar coordinates, it's often useful to separate variables or look for separable solutions. The potential here seems to have two parts: a term that depends only on r, and another that depends on both r and θ. Let me factor that.

So, V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I can factor out kr², which gives V = kr² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ]. Wait, perhaps I can write this as a sum of two terms. Maybe each term can be handled separately.

Wait, maybe it's easier if I rewrite the potential. Let me think: 1/2 is (3/2 - 1/2), but that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps think of the potential as a sum of radial terms and angular terms. Wait, no, because the angular part is multiplied by r squared as well.

Wait, maybe the potential can be expressed in terms of a harmonic oscillator in radial direction plus some angular component. Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be written as a sum of a purely radial term and another term involving cos²θ.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to complete the square or find a way to express this potential in terms of other potentials. Let me think about the angular part. Remember that cos²θ can be written in terms of cos(2θ) via the double-angle formula. Because cos²θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2. So substituting that in:

V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² * [ (1 + cos 2θ)/2 ]

Let me compute that. So, (3/2) times [ (1 + cos 2θ)/2 ] is (3/4)(1 + cos 2θ). So:

V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos 2θ.

Adding the first two terms: (1/2 + 3/4) kr² = (5/4) kr². So, V becomes:

V(r, θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos 2θ.

Hmm, so that's (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos 2θ. Wait, perhaps I can factor kr² further. Alternatively, perhaps this can be written as the sum of two terms, each of which resembles a harmonic oscillator.

Wait, another approach: the potential can be thought of as a central potential plus an angular-dependent term. But in two dimensions, maybe it's easier to write this in polar coordinates and see if the problem separates.

The time-independent Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates is:

[- (ℏ²)/(2m) (1/r ∂/∂r (r ∂ψ/∂r) ) + (1/(r²)) ∂²ψ/∂θ² + V(r,θ) ] = E ψ.

Plugging in V(r,θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos 2θ, the equation becomes:

[- (ℏ²)/(2m) (1/r ∂/∂r (r ∂ψ/∂r) ) + (1/(r²)) ∂²ψ/∂θ² ] + [ (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos 2θ ] ψ = E ψ.

Wait, but this looks complicated because of the cos 2θ term. Let me rearrange the equation:

[ - (ℏ²)/(2m) (1/r ∂/∂r (r ∂ψ/∂r) ) + (5/4) kr² ψ ] + [ (1/(r²)) ∂²ψ/∂θ² + (3/4) kr² cos 2θ ψ ] = E ψ.

Hmm, perhaps the potential can be expressed as a sum of a purely radial term and another term that depends on cos2θ. But for the Schrödinger equation to separate into radial and angular parts, the potential needs to have terms that make this separation possible. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a coordinate transformation or a change of variables that allows the equation to separate.

Alternatively, perhaps think about whether the problem is separable. Let me suppose that ψ(r, θ) = R(r) Θ(θ). Then, substituting into the Schrödinger equation, each term would contribute to the equation.

Let me try plugging ψ = R(r) Θ(θ) into the equation. Then, the derivatives would be:

∂ψ/∂r = R’ Θ,

∂²ψ/∂r² = R'' Θ,

∂²ψ/∂θ² = R Θ''.

Substituting into the equation:

- (ℏ²)/(2m) [1/r (d/dr)(r R') ) ] Θ + (1/r²) R Θ'' + (5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos 2θ) R Θ = E R Θ.

Dividing both sides by R Θ, we get:

- (ℏ²)/(2m) [ (1/r) (d/dr)(r R') ) / R ] + (1/(r² R)) Θ'' + (5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos 2θ) = E.

Hmm, but this doesn't look separable because of the cos2θ term, which couples θ and r. Because the right-hand side is E, a constant, and the left has terms that mix r and θ.

Wait, perhaps I can rearrange the equation. Let me write it as:

[ - (ℏ²)/(2m) (1/r) d/dr (r dR/dr ) / R + (5/4) kr² ] + [ (1/(r² R)) Θ'' + (3/4) kr² cos 2θ ] = E.

But the term with cos2θ is (3/4) kr² cos2θ, which complicates things because it depends on θ. That might suggest that the problem isn't straightforwardly separable, so perhaps another approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a change of variables. Let me think: the potential has a cos2θ term, which suggests that the problem might be symmetric under rotations by π/2, which is 90 degrees. So perhaps using a coordinate system that includes u = cosθ or something like that.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the potential can be rewritten as a sum of a central potential plus a perturbation. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach here.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the potential can be expressed as a sum of terms that each are separable in polar coordinates. Let me think: The term (5/4) kr² is a purely radial term, and the term (3/4) kr² cos2θ is an angular term. But perhaps there's a way to express this angular part in terms of other variables.

Wait, I remember that in some cases, the presence of a cos(nθ) term can lead to the angular part of the problem being solved by Bessel functions or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to switch to a different coordinate system, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps this problem can be related to the isotropic harmonic oscillator in two dimensions, which usually has a potential V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². But here, the potential is more complicated with an angular component.

Wait, another thought: the potential is V(r,θ) = kr² [ 1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ ]. Let me write that as V(r,θ) = kr² [ (3/2) cos²θ + 1/2 ].

Alternatively, perhaps this can be written as V(r,θ) = kr² (3/2 cos²θ + 1/2 ), which is kr² times (3 cos²θ +1)/2. Hmm, but how does that help?

Wait, I know that in two dimensions, the isotropic harmonic oscillator has energy levels En = (n_x + n_y + 1) ℏω, where ω = sqrt(k/m) if the potential is (1/2)k(r²x + r²y) = (1/2)k r². But in our case, the potential isn't isotropic because it depends on θ. So the angular part complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps we can make a change of variables from (r, θ) to some other coordinates to make the potential separable. Let me think: perhaps using u = cosθ, but that might complicate the equation further.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the potential can be split into two parts, each of which is a harmonic oscillator in different directions. For example, perhaps the potential can be written as a sum of a radial term and a term involving cos2θ, which might correspond to another direction.

Wait, let me think about expressing the potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates. In two dimensions, r² = x² + y², and cosθ = x/r. So, cos2θ = 2 cos²θ -1 = 2(x²/r²) -1. Hmm, substituting that into V(r,θ):

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² (2x²/r² - 1/2) ?

Wait, wait, actually, cos2θ = 2 cos²θ -1, so cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So, let me re-express the potential again.

Wait, earlier we had V(r,θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

So, perhaps it's better to think of this as a sum of a purely radial term and a term proportional to cos2θ.

Alternatively, perhaps using u = r² cos2θ. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can think of this as a perturbation on the radial harmonic oscillator. But I'm not sure if that's the case, because the angular term might not be small.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a different coordinate system, such as prolate spheroidal coordinates, but I'm not familiar with that.

Wait, perhaps another approach: think of the potential as a sum of two terms, each involving x and y. Let me expand cos2θ in terms of x and y.

Since cos2θ = (x² - y²)/(x² + y²) = (x² - y²)/r². So,

V(r,θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² * (x² - y²)/r².

Simplify that: the r² in the denominator cancels with the r² in the numerator. So,

V(r,θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) k (x² - y²).

So, that's interesting. So the potential can be written as V(r,θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4)k x² - (3/4)k y².

Wait, let me compute that again. Because cos2θ = (x² - y²)/r², which when multiplied by kr² gives k (x² - y²). So 3/4 kr² cos2θ equals (3/4) k (x² - y²).

So adding to the 5/4 kr²:

V(r,θ) = 5/4 kr² + (3/4)k (x² - y²).

Hmm, that's V = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k x² - (3/4)k y².

Wait, but r² = x² + y², so 5/4 kr² = (5/4)k (x² + y²).

So substituting that:

V = (5/4 k (x² + y²)) + (3/4 k x²) - (3/4 k y²).

Let me combine like terms:

x² terms: (5/4 + 3/4)k x² = (8/4)k x² = 2k x².

y² terms: (5/4 - 3/4)k y² = (2/4)k y² = (½)k y².

So V(x,y) = 2k x² + (½)k y².

Wait, that's a big simplification! So the potential is separable into x and y directions.

So V(x,y) = 2k x² + (½)k y².

So, this is a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in the x and y directions. Because in each direction, the potential is (1/2) m ω² x², but here the coefficients are different.

Wait, let me think about the standard form. The potential for a harmonic oscillator in each direction is (1/2) m ω² r_i², where r_i is the coordinate (x or y). So the potential in x is V_x = (1/2) m ω_x² x², and similarly for y.

But in our case, the potential is V = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

So, comparing, we can find ω_x and ω_y.

For x: (1/2) m ω_x² = 2k → ω_x² = 4k/(m) → ω_x = 2√(k/m).

For y: (1/2) m ω_y² = (1/2)k → ω_y² = k/m → ω_y = √(k/m).

So the particle is subject to a harmonic oscillator potential in x with frequency 2ω, and in y with frequency ω, where ω = sqrt(k/m).

The energy levels for a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator are given by E = (n_x + n_y + 1) ℏ ω, but that's when the frequencies are the same. But in this case, the frequencies are different.

Wait, in a two-dimensional isotropic HO, the energy levels are E = (n_x + n_y + 1) ℏ ω, where ω is the same for both directions. But when the frequencies are different, the energy becomes E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x + (n_y +1/2) ℏ ω_y.

Wait, that makes sense. Because each direction's oscillator contributes (n_i +1/2) ℏ ω_i.

So in our case, ω_x is 2√(k/m) and ω_y is √(k/m).

So, E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x + (n_y +1/2) ℏ ω_y.

Substituting ω_x and ω_y:

E = (n_x +1/2) ℏ (2 sqrt(k/m)) ) + (n_y +1/2) ℏ (sqrt(k/m)).

Let me factor out sqrt(k/m) * ℏ:

E = ℏ sqrt(k/m) [ (n_x + 1/2) * 2 + (n_y + 1/2) * 1 ].

Expanding inside the brackets:

= [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ].

Wait, wait, 2(n_x + 1/2) is 2n_x +1. And (n_y + 1/2) is n_y + 1/2.

So adding them: 2n_x +1 +n_y +1/2 = 2n_x +n_y + 3/2.

So E = ℏ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2).

Wait, but looking at the options, I need to check.

Option C is E = (2n_x +n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m). So that matches what I got.

Wait, but wait: let me check again. The energy expression is E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y.

Given ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m), and ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So,

E = (n_x + 1/2) * ℏ * 2 sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

= [2(n_x +1/2) + (n_y +1/2)] * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Expanding: 2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

Yes, that's correct. So the energy is E = (2n_x +n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Looking at the options, option C is E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m). So the correct choice should be option C.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \). The goal is to determine the energy spectrum.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Potential Simplification**:  
   The potential is rewritten using the trigonometric identity \( \cos^2(\theta) = \frac{1 + \cos(2\theta)}{2} \). Substituting this into the potential gives:  
   \[
   V(r, \theta) = \frac{5}{4}kr^2 + \frac{3}{4}kr^2 \cos(2\theta).
   \]  
   This form reveals a purely radial term and an angular term proportional to \( \cos(2\theta) \).

2. **Coordinate Transformation**:  
   The angular term \( \cos(2\theta) \) suggests a transformation to Cartesian coordinates. Using \( \cos(2\theta) = \frac{x^2 - y^2}{r^2} \), the potential becomes:  
   \[
   V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
   \]  
   This represents a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions.

3. **Frequencies in Each Direction**:  
   The potential is compared to the standard harmonic oscillator form \( V_i = \frac{1}{2}m\omega_i^2r_i^2 \), where \( \omega_i \) is the angular frequency in the \( i \)-direction.  
   - For \( x \)-direction: \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).  
   - For \( y \)-direction: \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).

4. **Energy Levels**:  
   The energy spectrum for a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with different frequencies is given by:  
   \[
   E = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y,
   \]  
   where \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are non-negative integers. Substituting \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \) and \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), the energy becomes:  
   \[
   E = \hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right).
   \]

5. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing the derived energy expression with the given options, it matches **Option C**:  
   \[
   E = (2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The energy spectrum for the given potential is best described by **Option C**.
