Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully. The task is to identify a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using the given spectroscopic data. The options are four different organic compounds, each with a benzene ring structure, I think. 

First, I'll look at the data provided. The IR data shows strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹. Those are usually indicative of N-H stretches, like in amides or amines. Also, there's a strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹, which suggests a carbonyl group, maybe an ester or amide.

Moving on to the 1H NMR data. There are several peaks here:
- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating for 3H. That's probably a CH3 group attached to an oxygen, like an ethyl group (OCH2CH3). The triplet makes sense because the CH3 is next to a CH2.
- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): A broad singlet for 2H. Broad signals often come from NH groups, but in this case, since it's 2H, maybe it's an OCH2 group. Or maybe it's adjacent to an electronegative atom. Wait, but the IR suggested N-H, so maybe this is an NH2 group. But wait, in the options, I need to see if any have an NH2. Let me check the options later.
- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): A quartet integrating for 2H. Quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring groups. Maybe it's adjacent to another CH2 group. Like if it's part of an ester group, like OCH2CH3. Wait, but the 1.20 is the CH3, so maybe 4.5 is the OCH2.
- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Two doublets, each 2H. This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. So the protons on the aromatic ring are split into two sets, each as doublets. That would happen if the substituents are at the para positions. For example, if the ring has two substituents in para positions, like two groups attached to opposite carbons.

Now, let me think about the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. The degree of unsaturation can help. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0, so it's (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2. Wait, N is 1. So 2*9=18, +2=20. 20 -11=9, +1=10. 10/2=5 degrees. So that's likely a benzene ring (3 degrees for the ring), a carbonyl (another degree), and maybe an ester group or amide. So that adds up.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is a benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. Benzamide means a CONH2 group. Structure would be O=C(NH2)-benzene-OCH2CH3 at position 3. Wait, no, benzamide is usually O=C(NH2)-Ph. So 3-ethoxy would be OCH2CH3 at position 3 on the benzene ring. So the substituents would be OCH2CH3 and CONH2 at meta positions. Then the aromatic protons would be... Wait, if there are two substituents on the ring, they're meta, so the H NMR would show more complex splitting. But our NMR shows two doublets, which suggests two sets of equivalent protons. Hmm, if the substituents are para, like in para positions, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So maybe this is not the case for option A, since the substituents are meta. Alternatively, if the substituents are para, like in option D, maybe.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONH2. So the structure would be HCO-NH-Ph-OCH2CH3. Wait, no, it's N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, so the formamide is attached to the benzene. The structure is Ph-OCH2CH3 with the formamide group (HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3). Wait, no, wait. Formamide is RCONH2. So in this case, the NH2 is replaced by the aryl group. So the structure is HCONH-(Ph-OCH2CH3). The substituents on the benzene would be OCH2CH3 and NHCOH. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, the benzene has an ethoxy group at position 4 and the formamide is attached to the nitrogen. So the substituents on the benzene are OCH2CH3 and NHCOH (formamide). So the aromatic protons would be in a para arrangement, leading to two doublets. The IR would have N-H (amide) and a carbonyl at around 1720. So that fits.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-, but wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO- as an ester? So
