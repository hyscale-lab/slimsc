Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The question says X is a meson resonance. I remember that mesons are particles made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are like unstable particles, right? They decay quickly. So the problem is asking for the mean decay distance of this meson.

Given data: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with different distances in meters.

Wait, I think the mean decay distance has to do with the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula I remember is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ), but wait, there's a relation involving the width Γ as well.

So, the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy ΔE is Γ, and the uncertainty in time Δt is τ. The principle states that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

So, Γ * τ ≈ ħ. Therefore, τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Once I have τ, I can find the mean decay distance, which is v * τ. But wait, what's v here? Oh, because the meson is produced with some energy, I need to find its velocity.

The particle's energy is given as E_X =8 GeV, and its rest mass m_X=1.2 GeV. So, I can find the velocity using the relativistic energy formula.

The total energy E is related to the rest mass energy and momentum via E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². But I'm working in units where c=1, so E² = p² + m².

Wait, but we're using GeV and such, so I should probably convert everything into appropriate units at some point.

First, let's find the velocity. Let me compute the momentum p. From E² = p² c² + m² c^4. Since E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². Wait, wait, actually, when E is in GeV, and m is in GeV/c², then E squared is in (GeV)^2, and m squared is (GeV/c²)^2 * c^4 = (GeV)^2.

So, E² = p² c² + m² c^4 → (8 GeV)^2 = p² c² + (1.2 GeV)^2 → p² c² = (64 - 1.44) (GeV)^2 → p² c² = 62.56 GeV² → p = sqrt(62.56) GeV/c.

What's sqrt(62.56)? Let me compute that. 8² is 64, so sqrt(62.56) is just a little less than 8. Let me calculate:

62.56 → sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 (since 7.91^2 = 62.5681, which is close enough).

So p ≈7.91 GeV/c.

Now, the momentum p is also equal to gamma m v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, m is rest mass, and v is velocity. So p = gamma m v. But maybe a better approach is to find the velocity in terms of E and m.

The relativistic gamma is gamma = E/(m c²), but since we're using E in GeV and m in GeV/c², with c=1, this simplifies to gamma = E/m.

So gamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 ≈6.6667.

Wait, 8 divided by 1.2 is 6.666... (because 1.2 * 6.666 is 8). So gamma is about 6.6667.

The velocity beta is v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)). So let me compute that.

1/gamma squared is 1/( (8/1.2) )^2 → (1.2/8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Take the square root of that: sqrt(0.9775)= approximately 0.9887.

So beta ≈0.9887. So v ≈0.9887 c. Let me keep a few decimal places for accuracy, but maybe it's better to use exact expressions.

Alternatively, another way to find beta is beta = p c / E. Because p c is momentum times c, which is in GeV. So p c = 7.91 GeV, E is 8 GeV. So beta =7.91 /8 = approx 0.98875. Same as before. So that's correct.

So v is approximately 0.98875 c.

Now, the lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. But Γ is given as 320 MeV. I need to convert units so everything is in compatible units.

Wait, Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So ħ is about 6.582e-25 GeV s.

Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So τ ≈ ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) → 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute 6.582 / 0.32. 0.32 *20 is 6.4, 0.32 *20.56875 → 6.582 because 0.32 * 20 =6.4, 0.32 * 0.56875=0.182, so 6.4 +0.182=6.582.

So 6.582 /0.32= 20.56875.

So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 seconds? Wait, no, because 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582/0.32) e-25 → 20.56875e-25 s.

Wait, no, 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s → 2.056875e-24 s.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, the mean decay distance is v * τ. So v is approximately 0.98875 c, and τ is 2.056875e-24 s.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So distance L = v * τ = 0.98875 * c * τ.

Let me compute this step by step.

c =3e8 m/s.

So L = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute the constants first.

0.98875 * 3e8 = 2.96625e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s: 2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

Let me compute 2.96625 * 2.056875 ≈ ?

2.96625 * 2 =5.9325, 2.96625 *0.056875= approximately 0.1684.

So total approx 6.099.

So 6.1e-16 meters? Wait, because 1e8 * 1e-24 is 1e-16.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.96625 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.

Compute 2.96625 * 2.056875:

Let me compute 2.96625 * 2 =5.9325.

2.96625 * 0.056875:

Let me compute 0.056875 is 56875/1e6 = but perhaps better to compute 2.96625 * 0.05 = 0.1483125.

2.96625 * 0.006875 = let's see: 0.006875 is 1/144, so 2.96625 /144 ≈0.02059.

So adding 0.1483125 +0.02059 ≈0.1689.

So total is 5.9325 + 0.1689 =6.1014.

So 6.1014e-16 meters.

Wait, so L≈6.1014e-16 m.

Looking at the options:

Option A:5.0223 *1e-16 m

Option D:4.0655 *1e-16 m

Hmm, but wait, did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately without approximating.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate each step with exact numbers.

Let me recompute the decay length.

Compute beta = p
