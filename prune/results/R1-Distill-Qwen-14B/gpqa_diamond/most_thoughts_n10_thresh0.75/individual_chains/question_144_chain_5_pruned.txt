Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, it's about meson resonance and decay distance. I remember mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're made up of a quark and an antiquark. Okay, the question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV.

Wait, mean decay distance. I think that has to do with how far the particle travels before decaying. Oh right, I remember something about the particle's lifetime and velocity. So the decay distance would be the product of the particle's lifetime and its velocity, right? Like, distance = velocity × time.

But wait, how do I find the lifetime? Oh, right! The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the uncertainty principle. The formula is Γ ≈ ħ / τ, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is usually in units involving eV·s. I'll have to convert units properly.

So let's get into the steps. First, calculate the lifetime τ. Then find the velocity of the meson. Then multiply velocity by τ to get the mean decay distance.

Wait, but the velocity... How do I find that? I think I can use the relativistic energy relation. The total energy E is related to the rest mass and momentum. The meson is produced with energy 8 GeV, which is much
