Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But let's take it step by step. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle moving in a two-dimensional potential. 

The potential given is V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, interesting. I remember that in quantum mechanics, potentials like these can sometimes be solved by separating variables or by using certain coordinate systems. Since the potential depends on r and θ, I think polar coordinates are probably the way to go here.

Wait, the potential looks like it's made up of two terms. The first term is (1/2)k r², which reminds me of a harmonic oscillator potential because the standard harmonic oscillator in 2D has a potential of (1/2) m ω² r². Oh wait, but here the potential is (1/2)k r², so I guess k would be related to m and ω squared somehow. But maybe that's not too important right now.

The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, cos²θ. I think this might be expressible in terms of some angular momentum operator or something related to the angular part of the problem. Wait, because in polar coordinates, the kinetic energy involves the Laplacian which includes terms in 1/r and derivatives with respect to θ. But I'm getting a bit ahead of myself.

Let me think. The overall approach for such problems is usually to separate the Schrödinger equation into radial and angular parts. So after writing the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates, we can separate the variables and solve for the energy eigenvalues.

But wait, maybe the potential can be rewritten in a way that makes the separation easier. So, V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor out the r²: V= k r² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ]. Hmm, that's (k r²) multiplied by [ (1 + 3 cos²θ)/2 ].

Wait, another thought. The term with cos²θ can be expressed using a double-angle identity. Because cos²θ is (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So let's substitute that: 3/2 cos²θ = 3/2 * (1 + cos 2θ)/2 = 3/4 (1 + cos 2θ). So the entire potential becomes V = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos 2θ. Wait, let me compute that:

Original V: (1/2 + 3/2 cos²θ) * (k r²). So substituting cos²θ as (1 + cos2θ)/2 gives:

(1/2) * kr² [1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 ]

Wait, no, wait. Let me recompute:

V = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ.

Expressing cos²θ as (1 + cos2θ)/2:

So, V = (1/2)kr² + (3/2) kr² * [ (1 + cos 2θ)/2 ]

Simplify that: (1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² (1 + cos2θ
