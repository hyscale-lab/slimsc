Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

Alright, the problem is about binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. There are five such compounds known. The substances A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 are involved in various reactions. My goal is to find the molecular weight range of A4 based on the given information.

Let me break down each part to see what I can figure out.

First, the substances:

A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. I remember that when certain compounds decompose, they can release elements. For example, maybe A1 is a compound that breaks down into a lower oxidation state and F2.

Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so being oxidized by another substance is interesting. I'm thinking maybe A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizer, but it's already an element—so perhaps A1 is a compound that can act as an oxidizing agent.

Next, A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y. So A3 is YF_x, some fluorinated form of Y. Also, A3 can interact with xenon. Hmm, perhaps it's another oxidizing agent as well.

Then, by adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is obtained. Wait, adding Y to A4's solution gives A5. Also, in water, A5 decomposes into two substances. I'm not exactly sure what that means yet.

Let me think about possible elements Y. The problem says binary compounds with fluorine. Common elements that form multiple binary fluorides include elements like sulfur, chlorine, iodine, maybe phosphorus or others. Wait, but Y is the other element. Let's consider Y as maybe chlorine? Or perhaps another halogen.

Wait, but let me think about A1 first. A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. So the decomposition reaction would be something like A1 → A2 + F2. Let's consider the possible compounds.

If A1 is a fluoride, decomposing into another fluoride and F2. For example, say if Y has a higher oxidation state in A1. Let me think: for example, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) decomposes? Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A1 is ClF3, which could decompose into ClF and F2? I'm not certain about that.

Wait, another thought. Maybe A1 is a compound that upon heating (293 K isn't that high, but maybe it's unstable) decomposes. For example, perhaps it's some kind of perfluoride or a compound with a high oxidation state.

Wait, if A1 decomposes into A2 and F2, and the oF (oxidation number of F) in A2 is 31.96%. Wait, wait, that's probably a typo because oxidation states are integers. Oh wait, perhaps oF is the oxidation state. So A2 has F in a particular oxidation state.

Wait, the question says "ɷF=31,96%". Hmm, maybe that's the oxidation state. Wait, 31.96% is approximately 32%, which is close to 32, but that's not an oxidation state. Oh wait, no, 31.96% might be a way of writing the oxidation number as 3.196, but that's not possible because oxidation states are integers. Hmm, maybe it's a mistake, but perhaps 31.96% of the compound is fluorine. Or maybe it's the oxidation state of F.

Wait, maybe that's the percentage composition by mass. So fluorine makes up 31.96% of A2. Let me check: the atomic weight of fluorine is about 19. So if
