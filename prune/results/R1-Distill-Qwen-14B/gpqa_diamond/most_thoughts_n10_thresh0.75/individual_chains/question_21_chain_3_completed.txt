Okay, so I've got this chemistry multiple-choice question about isomers, specifically about tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question has two parts, A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism. The options are given as A, B, C, D, each pairing choices for A and B.

First, let me break down what tautomerism and optical isomerism mean.

Tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift between different structures (tautoforms) by the movement of a hydrogen atom and the corresponding shift of double bonds. For example, in ketones and aldehydes, but more commonly in compounds like sugars where there's a carbonyl group and an adjacent hydroxyl group. If the molecule can't undergo such a shift, it doesn't show tautomerism.

Optical isomerism, on the other hand, happens when a compound has a chiral center, meaning it has a carbon atom attached to four different groups. If such a center exists, the compound can have enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, leading to optical activity.

Now, the compounds given are:
For part A: benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.
For part B: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

Let me tackle part A first. Which of the two doesn't show tautomerism.

Benzoquinone is C6H4O2, right? It has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. Wait, but quinones generally have conjugated carbonyl groups. Do quinones undergo tautomerism? Hmm. Tautomerism usually involves shifting between enol and keto forms. But in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is conjugated with the ring. If the structure is such that there's no adjacent hydroxyl or hydrogen that can shift, then maybe it can't tautomerize. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can tautomerize? Or maybe it's the other compound that can't.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: this is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So, the structure is O=C-(CH2) around the ring. Each ketone is at every other carbon. Now, can this compound undergo tautomerism? For tautomerism, you usually need a hydrogen alpha to a carbonyl. In cyclohexane trione, each carbonyl is adjacent to CH2 groups. So, each carbonyl has two CH2 groups attached. Wait, but those CH2 groups are between the carbonyls. Wait, the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2-? No, wait, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is 1,3,5 positions, so the ring has three ketones with two carbons in between each. So each ketone is at every other position. So each carbonyl is attached to two CH2 groups, perhaps. So, each carbonyl is O=C-(CH2) groups. Wait, but the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2, but that would make 6 carbons. So each ketone is on a carbon with two CH2 groups next to it.

In such a case, the carbonyl groups are separated by two CH2 groups. So, do any of them have alpha hydrogens? Because for tautomerism, you need a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl that can shift.

In 1,3,5-trione, each ketone is on a carbon that's connected to two CH2 groups. So each CH2 group is between two ketones. Wait, no: the structure is 1,3,5; so positions 1,3,5 have carbonyls, and positions 2,4,6 are CH2. So each carbonyl is at position 1,3,5, and the adjacent carbons (2,4,6) are each CH2. So each of the carbonyl carbons is attached to two CH2 groups. So, each CH2 is adjacent to two carbonyls? Wait, no. Wait, in the ring, each carbonyl is connected to the next via two CH2 groups. So, for example, position 1 is a carbonyl, position 2 is CH2, position 3 is carbonyl, etc. So each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 on each side, but those CH2 groups are each adjacent to another carbonyl. So, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl are CH2 groups. So each of these CH2 groups is attached to two carbonyls. That means the alpha carbons (the CH2) don't have any hydrogens that can shift to form an enol. Because the alpha carbons are each CH2, so they have two hydrogens each. Wait, but in a cyclic structure, can those hydrogens shift?

Wait, tautomerism requires the movement of a hydrogen from an alpha position to the carbonyl group, leading to a shift in the double bond. For example, in the keto-enol tautomerism of sugars, an alpha hydrogen moves, causing the double bond to shift.

If the compound in question has no alpha hydrogens available for such a shift, then it can't tautomerize. So, in benzoquinone, the structure is two carbonyl groups attached to a benzene ring. Each carbonyl is on a benzene carbon, so the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring. So, each carbonyl in benzoquinone is attached to a benzene ring. Therefore, the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring, which is sp² hybridized. So, the alpha positions are part of the aromatic ring. In that case, there are no alpha hydrogens because the adjacent carbons are aromatic and don't have hydrogens attached. Wait, no. Wait, the structure of benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. So, each carbonyl is attached to a benzene carbon. For example, in para-benzoquinone, the carbonyls are at positions 1 and 4. So, each carbonyl is on a carbon that is double-bonded to the ring, so those carbons are sp² hybridized. So, they have two other double bonds to the ring and one to the oxygen. So, no hydrogens attached to the carbonyl carbons. The adjacent carbons in the ring have hydrogens, but they're part of the aromatic ring. So, can a hydrogen from the ring shift to form an enol? Probably not because the aromatic ring's structure is rigid, and the necessary conjugation might not allow that. So benzoquinone might not show tautomerism.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups on the ring. Each ketone is at 1,3,5 positions. The adjacent carbons (2,4,6) are CH2. Each of those CH2 groups has two hydrogens. So, for each carbonyl, the adjacent carbon has two hydrogens. So, each of these CH2 groups is alpha to a carbonyl. So, could these hydrogens shift, causing tautomerism?

Wait, but the ring is cyclohexane, so it's a six-membered ring, not aromatic. So, the adjacent CH2 groups are each attached to a carbonyl. So, each of those CH2 groups has two hydrogens. So, the alpha carbons (the CH2) have hydrogens that could potentially shift.

So, could cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione undergo tautomerism? Let me think. In a cyclic ketone, if there are alpha hydrogens, then tautomerism is possible. For example, cyclohexanone can undergo keto-enol tautomerism because it has alpha hydrogens. So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, having three ketone groups with alpha hydrogens, would have tautomerism. Or wait, does the presence of multiple ketones prevent tautomerism?

Wait, no. Each of the CH2 groups between the ketones would have alpha hydrogens. So, perhaps the molecule can lose a hydrogen from one of those CH2 groups, adjacent to a carbonyl, leading to a conjugated double bond somewhere else.

Wait, but in the trione, all three carbonyls are present. So, if a hydrogen from one CH2 group is removed, that would create a double bond, but where? Because it's a cyclic structure, maybe the double bonds can shift between the carbonyls. But wait, if all three carbonyls are present, is there a possibility to form an enol?

Alternatively, perhaps the ring is such that the necessary conjugation for tautomerism isn't possible. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think again.

Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups on a benzene ring. No alpha hydrogens because the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring, which doesn't have hydrogens on the carbonyl carbon. So, benzoquinone can't undergo tautomerism. So, if part A is about which doesn't show tautomerism, then A is benzoquinone.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, in benzoquinone, the carbons next to the carbonyl are part of the ring. So, those carbons (the ones attached to the carbonyl) are part of the benzene ring. Benzene is a planar structure, so the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl are sp² hybridized. Each of these carbons has a double bond to the ring, so they can't have any hydrogens attached. Because in a carbonyl group (C=O), the carbon is bonded to O, and in the ring, it's double-bonded to the adjacent carbons. So, the carbonyl carbon in benzoquinone is connected to two other carbons in the ring (each double-bonded), and one O. So, no hydrogens on the carbonyl carbon. The adjacent carbons (the ring carbons) are also sp², so they each have one hydrogen. Wait, no. In benzene, each carbon has one hydrogen. So in benzoquinone, the substituted carbons (with the carbonyl groups) would lose a hydrogen because they're connected to the O. So, their structure would have two double bonds to the ring and one to O. So, the adjacent carbons in the ring would have their own hydrogens.

Wait, but the question is about alpha hydrogens. The alpha carbon is the one adjacent to the carbonyl. So, in benzoquinone, the alpha carbons are part of the ring and have no hydrogens attached because they're double-bonded. So, there are no alpha hydrogens. So, no tautomerism.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione's adjacent carbons (the ones between the ketones) are CH2, each with two hydrogens. So, each of these CH2 groups is alpha to a carbonyl. So, each of these has alpha hydrogens, which can undergo tautomerism. So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would show tautomerism.

Wait, but the question is which does NOT show tautomerism. So, between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the one that doesn't show tautomerism is benzoquinone. So, A is benzoquinone, which is option D or B.

Wait, the options are:

A) A = cyclohexane..., B = methyl...
B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl...
C) A = cyclohexane..., B = dimethyl...
D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl...

So, for part A, the correct answer is A is benzoquinone. So, looking at the options, B and D are possible for part A.

Now, moving to part B. The compounds are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate. Which one shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism arises when a compound has a chiral center. Alternatively, if a compound has a plane of symmetry, it won't have optical isomers. So, I'll need to check if either of these compounds has a chiral center.

First, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's draw its structure. It's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The formula is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the structure is: 

CH3
|
C(OH)
|
COOCH3

Wait, no. 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl group on the second carbon. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-? Wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, no, wait: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then, the ester would be where the -OH of the acid is replaced by an OCH3 group. Wait, no. Wait, the esterification would be between the acid and methanol. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the structure.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the carboxylic acid is on the third carbon (the end), and the hydroxyl is on the second.

So, structure: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So, the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So, the carbons are: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Let me number them: 1 (CH3), 2 (CH(OH)), 3 (COOCH3).

So, the central carbon (carbon 2) has the following groups: a CH3, an OH, a COOCH3, and a CH2 from carbon 3. Wait, no. Wait, carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH3,
- Carbon 3: COOCH3,
- OH group,
- and a hydrogen?

Wait, no. Carbon 2 in 2-hydroxypropanoate would have:

- One bond to CH3 (carbon 1),
- One bond to COOCH3 (carbon 3),
- One OH,
- And one more bond. Wait, wait. Wait, the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

- CH3 (carbon 1),
- COOCH3 (carbon 3),
- OH,
- and a hydrogen? Because it's CH(OH).

Wait, that would make four groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So, the four groups attached to carbon 2 are: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. That's four different groups. So, carbon 2 is a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. The structure of fumarate is (Z)-butenedioic acid. So, dimethyl fumarate would be the diester, with two methyl ester groups.

Structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, more accurately, it's CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, the structure is:

           O
           ||O
CH2-C-(COOCH3)2

Wait, no. Let me correct. The structure of fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So, the structure is CH2CH2 with the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides.

Wait, another approach: the structure of dimethyl fumarate is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3. No, wait, fumarate is (E)-butenedioate, so the structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let's think about butenedioic acid. Butenedioic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's succinic acid. Wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is HO2C-CHCH2-COOH, but wait, no. Wait, no, maleic acid is (Z)-HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH. Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, fumaric acid is (E)-HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH. Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, maleic acid is (Z)-HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait that's not correct. Maleic acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on adjacent carbons and a double bond. Fumaric acid is the (E) diastereomer of maleic acid, so it's HO2C-CH=CH-COOH with the substituents opposite each other.

So, dimethyl fumarate would have the two ester groups (COOCH3) on each end of the double bond. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-(COOCH3), but with a double bond. Wait, no. I think the correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

So, the molecule is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, the double bond is between the first and second carbons, with the two COOCH3 groups on the second carbon. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3
But with a double bond, so it's CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Now, looking at this structure, does it have any chiral centers? Let's see. The central carbon (the one with the double bond) is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups. Wait, the structure is: CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, each of the carbons with the double bond (the CH2 and the CH) — no, wait, in a double bond, the substituents are on each end. Let me number the carbons:

1       2       3
CH2-CH2-COOCH3 ?

Wait, no, the structure of fumarate is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, carbon 1: CH2-, carbon 2: CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, carbon 2 is connected via a double bond to carbon 1 (CH2). So, carbon 2 is double-bonded to CH2 and also connected to two COOCH3 groups.

Wait, carbon 2 is CH with two COOCH3 groups attached. So, the structure around the double bond is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. C2 is connected to two COOCH3 groups and the double bond to C1. So, C2 has two identical groups (two COOCH3), a double bond (so in a trigonal planar arrangement), and a single bond to C3 (which is CH2? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about whether the molecule has any chiral centers.

In dimethyl fumarate, the structure is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

So, the double bond is between the two carbons. The left carbon (C1) is CH2, the right carbon (C2) is CH connected to two COOCH3 groups.

So, C2 has two identical groups (the two COOCH3 are the same), a double bond to C1, and a single bond to C3 (which is CH2? No, wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, so C2 is connected to two COOCH3 groups and the double bond to C1 (CH2).

Wait, but in this structure, C2 has the following groups: two COOCH3, one double bond to CH2, and perhaps another single bond. Wait, no, in a double bond, each carbon is bonded to two other atoms via double bond. So, C1 is CH2 with a double bond to C2, which is CH connected to two COOCH3 groups.

So, for C2, it's connected via double bond to C1, and via single bonds to two COOCH3 groups. But wait, that's only three bonds. Oh wait, no. Each carbon in a double bond has two substituents besides the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is (COOCH3)2C=CH2. So, the central carbon (C) is connected to two COOCH3 groups, a double bond, and a CH2 group. But wait, that can't be right. Maybe it's CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

So, C1 is CH2, C2 is C connected to two COOCH3 and a double bond to C1. So, C2 has a double bond (so two bonds) to C1, and two single bonds to COOCH3. So, that's only three bonds, which isn't possible. So, perhaps the correct structure has each of the two COOCH3 groups attached to the same carbon (C2), which is double-bonded to C1 (CH2). So, C2 has:

- Two COOCH3 groups,
- A double bond to C1 (CH2),
- And another single bond to something else.

Wait, no. Let me try again. The structure is CH2-CH2, but with a double bond. Wait, maybe I should look it up, but I can't. Alternatively, think about the possibility of stereoisomerism.

If the structure has a double bond and the substituents on each end are different, then it can have geometric isomerism (cis or trans), but that's not optical isomerism. Optical isomers arise from chirality (presence of a chiral center), not from planar or double bonds.

So, for dimethyl fumarate, does it have any chiral centers?

Looking at the structure, each of the carbons in the double bond has two substituents. For example, in CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, the CH2 group is connected to two Hs and the double bond, while the CH group is connected to two COOCH3 groups and the double bond. But in this structure, each of those carbons is connected to two identical substituents. So, the CH2 has two Hs, and the CH has two COOCH3. So, neither of these carbons is a chiral center because each has two identical substituents. Therefore, there are no chiral centers in dimethyl fumarate, so it cannot exhibit optical isomerism.

On the other hand, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (the central carbon), so it can exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait a second. What about the possibility of another chiral center in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate? Let me re-examine. The structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So, the carbons are:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, carbon 2 has CH2 groups, but no, wait. Let me write it clearly:

Structure: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (CH3),
- Carbon 3 (COOCH3),
- OH,
- and H.

So, four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, H. So, yes, it's a chiral center. Therefore, it has optical isomerism.

So, part B is about which of the two (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate) shows optical isomerism. From the above analysis, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does, while dimethyl fumarate doesn't.

So, part B's correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Now, putting it all together.

Part A: the compound that doesn't show tautomerism is benzoquinone.

Part B: the compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option D: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate. So, B is incorrect for part B.

So, the correct option is B.

Wait, no. Wait, option B says for B, it's methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. That's correct. So, the answer would be option B.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the compounds based on their ability to show tautomerism and optical isomerism.

### Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism?
- **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two carbonyl groups on a benzene ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are part of the aromatic ring and are sp² hybridized. These carbons do not have alpha hydrogens, which are necessary for tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.
- **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups on a six-membered ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are CH₂ groups, which have alpha hydrogens. These hydrogens can shift, allowing the compound to undergo tautomerism. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

From this, **benzoquinone** is the compound that does not show tautomerism.

### Part B: Which compound shows optical isomerism?
- **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, COOCH₃, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, allowing the compound to exhibit optical isomerism.
- **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure of this compound is CH₂=CH(COOCH₃)₂. The carbons in the double bond are sp² hybridized and do not have four different groups attached. Therefore, this compound does not have a chiral center and cannot exhibit optical isomerism.

From this, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** is the compound that shows optical isomerism.

### Final Answer:
Combining the results from both parts:
- **A = benzoquinone**
- **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**

The correct option is **B**.

Answer: B
