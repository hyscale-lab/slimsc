Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule's transition when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, let me break down what I know.

The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and it absorbs a photon to switch to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

First, the given data:
- Mass of X (Mx) = 20 amu
- Mass of Y (My) = 2 amu
- Bond length (R) = 2 angstroms
- Angular frequency (Ï‰) = 4e14 rad/s

Wait, the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. So, initially, the molecule is in the ground state, and a photon is absorbed to move to the next state with the lowest energy. But wait, molecules have both rotational and vibrational energy levels.

In the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is probably the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). When a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next possible state. But I'm a bit confused about whether the transition is purely vibrational or a combination of rotation and vibration.

Wait, the question is about switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think the molecule would first increase its vibrational state or maybe its rotational state. But in the non-r
