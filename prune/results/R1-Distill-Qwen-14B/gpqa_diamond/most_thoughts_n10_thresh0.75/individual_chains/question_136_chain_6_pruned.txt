Okay, so I have this vector calculus problem here. Hmm. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere. The vector field f(r) has a magnitude of 1/r² and only has a radial component. So, f is a radial vector field that decreases with the square of the distance from the origin.

Wait, right, I remember that divergence is a measure of how much a vector field spreads out or converges at a point. So, if the field is spreading out, the divergence is positive, and if it's converging, it's negative. But in this case, since the field's magnitude is 1/r², which decreases as r increases, I'm thinking that the field is spreading out as you move away from the origin, but maybe the divergence is different.

Wait, wait. I think I should compute the divergence of this vector field explicitly. Since the field is radial and depends only on r, I can use the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates. The divergence of a radial vector field F(r) in spherical coordinates is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F(r)). Is that right? Because in spherical coordinates, the divergence for a vector field with only the radial component F_r is (1/(r²)) * d/dr (r² F_r).

So here, F_r is 1/r². Let me plug that into the formula. So, F_r = 1/r². Then the term inside the derivative is r² * F_r = r² * (1/r²) = 1. So, d/dr of 1 is zero. Which means the divergence of f is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin.

Wait, but wait. The divergence is zero except at r=0, where the function might not be defined. Because at r=0, 1/r² is not defined; it's infinite. So the divergence is zero everywhere else, but the origin is a point where the vector field has a singularity.

So, when I compute the volume integral of the divergence over the sphere of radius R, it's the integral of zero over the entire volume except possibly at the origin. But in calculus, a single point doesn't contribute to the integral because it's a zero volume. So the integral should be zero, right?

But wait, I remember something about Gauss's Law in electromagnetism. There, the divergence of E is rho/epsilon_0, and the integral of divergence E over a volume is the enclosed charge. Oh right! If the divergence is zero everywhere except a point (the origin), then the integral would be the charge enclosed, which is the delta function at the origin. But wait, in this problem, the vector field isn't necessarily an electric field, but the principle that the integral of the divergence is equal to the flux through the boundary (Gauss's theorem) still applies.

Wait, Gauss's theorem (also called the divergence theorem) says that the integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume V is equal to
