Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. 

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, their orbits are circular. 

The host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. Wait, but same radius? Interesting. So, higher mass star but same radiusâ€”maybe it's a main-sequence star, but if the other is slightly evolved, perhaps a subgiant or something. But same radius, so that aspect doesn't change the transit probability immediately.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. So I need to calculate the transit probability for each and see which is higher.

Transit probability, as I recall, depends on the planet's orbital distance and the sizes of the star and planet. The formula is something like (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, but I might be mixing it up. Wait, no, the probability is the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the area of the star's disk, but corrected by the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. Oh wait, no, the geometric probability is actually (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, but I think it's more about the relative size. Wait, no, let me think again. 

The geometric probability of a transit is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, but actually, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet). Because the planet needs to be in the right orbital plane, so the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recall the formula.

Oh right, the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a_planet) * (1 + (R_planet / R_star)), but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, that term is negligible
