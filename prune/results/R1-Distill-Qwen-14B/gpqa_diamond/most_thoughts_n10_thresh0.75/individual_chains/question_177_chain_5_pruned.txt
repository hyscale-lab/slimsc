Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about the luminosities of two stars. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, but wait, what's the relevance of mass here? Oh, perhaps it's a red herring because the problem is about luminosity, which primarily depends on radius and temperature. So I'll probably ignore the mass unless it's relevant elsewhere.

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. Since the λ_max is the same for both stars, that means their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is same, then T must be same since b is a constant. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem says they have the same λ_max, so same T. Got it.

Now, the radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh, right! Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, its emitted light gets blueshifted or redshifted, which changes the observed wavelength. But wait, in this problem, when they determine the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest, do they account for the Doppler shift? Because if Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s, that would affect the observed λ_max.

Wait, that's a key point. So, if the star is moving, the observed λ_max isn't the same as the emitted λ_max. So the astronomers' measurements are in the observed frame, not the rest frame of the star. So if Star_2 is moving towards us (since the radial velocity is 700 km/s—assuming positive velocity is moving away?), then the observed λ would be shorter than the emitted. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if a star is moving away from us, the light is redshifted—so λ increases. If moving towards us, blueshifted—λ decreases.

But the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Wait, but if Star_2 is moving and Star_1 is not, then their rest frame λ_max would be the same, but the observed λ_max would differ due to Doppler shift. Or perhaps I've got it backwards.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the rest frame λ_max. Let me think. Let's say that in Star_1's rest frame, the λ_max is λ1, and Star_2's rest frame is λ2. But because Star_2 is moving, the observed λ2_observed is different. But the problem says the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So perhaps I need to calculate their rest temperatures, considering Doppler shift.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to structure it.

The peak wavelengths observed are the same. So observed λ_max for both is same. But the stars might
