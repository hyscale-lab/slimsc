Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The well has a length L. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. The answer should be in terms of E, where E is given as (pi² ħ²)/(2mL²). 

Hmm, I remember that in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy of a single particle is E_n = n² * E, where n is the principal quantum number, right? So each particle's energy depends on the square of its state number.

But wait, these particles are identical and have spin-1/2. Oh, right, spin-1/2 particles are fermions. So they obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which means no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. So I need to consider how the fermions fill up the energy levels.

In a 1D well, each energy level can hold a certain number of particles based on their spin states. Since each particle is spin-1/2, each quantum state (defined by n and the spin) can hold two particles — one with spin-up and one with spin-down. So for each energy level n, the maximum number of particles is 2.

Wait, wait, is that right? Because spin-1/2 has two possible spin states, so each energy level can hold two fermions. Oh right, yes, that's correct. So for each n, two particles can be placed.

So with four particles, how do they fill up the levels?

Let me think. The ground state would have the lowest possible energy, so we fill the lowest energy levels first. The first energy level is n=1. It can hold two particles. Then the next, n=2, can hold two more. So four particles would fill n=1 and n=2, each with two particles. So the ground state configuration is n=1 filled (2 particles) and n=2 filled (2 particles).

Wait, but wait, what about the energy? Each particle's energy is n² E. So for the ground state, all four are in the lowest possible states. So the system's total energy would be the sum of each particle's energy.

But wait, no. Wait, no! I think I'm getting confused. The system's energy is the sum of the energies of each particle. So each particle in n=1 has energy 1² E, so 1E each, two particles: 2E total from n=1. The two particles in n=2 each contribute 4E, so 2 * 4E =8E. So total energy is 2E +8E=10E for the ground state.

Wait, but the options don't have 10E as the first option. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) 30E, 39E, 50E
B)4E, 10E,50E
C)4E,10E,15E
D)10E,15E,
