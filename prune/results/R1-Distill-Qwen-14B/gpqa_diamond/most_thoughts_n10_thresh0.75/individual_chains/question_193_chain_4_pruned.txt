Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, that part is a bit tricky. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, or N ∝ 1/plx^5. Right.

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance (r). So, I think they want to know the relationship between N and r, where r is the distance. The options are various powers of r.

Wait, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So if the distance r increases, parallax decreases.

So, if N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/r (since r is distance), substituting that in, N would be proportional to r^5. Because plx = 1/r, so 1/plx is r. So 1/(plx^5) is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. That would make the number of stars increase with the fifth power of distance.

Wait, but wait. The question says "per unit range of distance", so are they asking about the density of stars, like the number per unit volume or something? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, the question is about how the number of stars in that region varies with distance. So as the distance increases, how does the number change? So if N is proportional to r^5, that's a steep increase. But wait, the options are about how the number changes with r, so if N ∝ r^5, then the number increases as r^5. So looking at the options, option B is ~r^5.

But wait another thing. Let me think about the relation between parallax and distance. Parallax plx is in arcseconds, and distance d is in parsecs, and plx = 1/d. So if d increases, plx decreases. So when plx is small, d is large.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5) = d^5. Because plx =1/d, so 1/plx^5 = d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question says "number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So as plx decreases (distance increases), N increases as plx^-5. Which is the same as d^5, because plx^-1 is d.

So, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. So as r (distance) increases, N increases by r^5. So the answer should be option B.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the question is considering how the number of stars is distributed in terms of distance, like a density. Like, the number per unit distance.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of volume. The number of stars per unit volume in a spherical shell at distance r would depend on the volume. Wait, but the question says the number varies as 1
