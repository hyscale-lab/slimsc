Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, so the number of stars (N) is proportional to 1/plx^5. Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So higher parallax means closer stars, and lower parallax means they're farther away.

Wait, the formula given is N ‚àù 1/(plx)^5. So as plx increases (meaning closer stars), the number of stars increases as well. But we're interested in how the number of stars changes with distance, not parallax.

Since parallax is plx = 1/distance (well, I think parallax in arcseconds is roughly 1 over distance in parsecs). So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance. Oh wait, wait, actually, plx is in arcseconds, and distance is in parsecs, so plx (in arcsec) = 1 / distance (parsecs). So plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs.

So if plx = 1/r, then 1/plx is r. So substituting plx in terms of r, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/( (1/r) )
