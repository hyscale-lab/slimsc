Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, a chemist found an unnamed white solid, and we've got some spectral data to analyze. The options are four different compounds: A, B, C, D. I need to figure out which one it is based on the given data.

Let's start by looking at the mass spectral information. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. There's also a peak at m/z 158 with 32% intensity. I remember that molecular ion peaks can suggest the molecular formula, and the presence of an M+2 peak (like 158 here) might indicate the presence of a halogen because Cl typically adds two mass units. So 158 is M+2, which suggests Cl is present in the molecule. So the molecular weight is probably 156, and Cl is one of the substituents.

Next, the IR data. There's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR often indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group. Now, the position of the carbonyl can help determine what functional group we're dealing with. A peak around 1720 is typical for a carboxylic acid (since they are usually around 1700-1725), or maybe an ester or acid chloride. Wait, but for carboxylic acids, the carbonyl is usually a bit lower, around 1700. Acid chlorides have higher carbonyl peaks, around 1800 maybe? Or wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, if it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1740-1760. Hmm.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm. That's a strong indication of an -OH proton from a carboxylic acid. Because aldehydic protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, and carboxylic OH is much broader and appears around 10-12. But wait, in the options, I see 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid as options B and D. Also, option A is a benzaldehyde with a hydroxyl group, which would be an aldehyde and a hydroxyl (maybe a phenol or something else). Option C is phenyl chloroformate, which is an acid chloride.

Looking at the NMR signals: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H) probably is the -COOH proton. So that would suggest a carboxylic acid. So options B and D have that. Option C is an acid chloride, which wouldn't have an -OH proton, but maybe an -O- in the chloroformate. So let's see: if it's a chloroformate, the structure would be Cl-CO-O-Ph. Wait, but phenyl chloroformate would have a carbonyl O connected to Cl and OPh. But in that case, the NMR wouldn't have an -OH signal because it's an acid chloride. So the 11 ppm peak suggests a carboxylic acid, not a chloride.

Then, the other NMR signals: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H). For aromatic protons, this looks like a para-substituted benzene. Because the two doublets each have 2H, that would mean it's a para-substituted ring. So, if the substituents are in the para positions, like Cl and COOH, or Cl and COCl (but then the NMR wouldn't have the OH peak).

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl and COOH in para positions on benzene.

Option D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid. So Cl and COOH are ortho.

In the NMR, for para substitution, the two protons adjacent to the substituents would be a pair of doublets. For example, if the substituents are in para positions, each adjacent pair would be deshielded and split into a doublet. So the NMR peaks would each have 2H, as in the data given.

If the substituents were ortho (like option D), I think the splitting would be different. For ortho substitution, perhaps the protons would be more complex, maybe a triplet or something else. Alternatively, maybe the integration would change. But given the data here, it's two doublets each integrating to 2H, which suggests that the substituents are para.

So for the NMR, that would fit with a para-substituted benzoic acid, so option B.

Looking back at the mass spec. The molecular ion is at 156. Let's calculate the molecular weight for 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Chlorine adds 35.5, so C7H5ClO2 would have a molecular weight of (12*7) + (5*1) +35.5 + (16*2) = 84 +5 +35.5 +32= 156.5. Hmm, but the molecular ion is at 156, which is an exact mass. Wait, maybe it's M+ and M+2? Because Cl has a natural abundance of about 3% for the M+2 peak.

Wait, the molecular ion is at 156 (100%), and a peak at 158 (32%), which would correspond to M+2 due to Cl. So the molecular formula must include Cl. So for 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Its molecular weight is approximately 156.5, but in mass spec, the peaks are usually rounded. Alternatively, maybe the molecular ion is at 156, so the actual molecular weight is 156. Let me compute the exact mass.

Carbon is about 12.01, H is 1.008, Cl is 34.97, O is 16.00.

So, C7H5ClO2: (7*12.01) =84.07, (5*1.008)=5.04, (34.97)=34.97, (2*16)=32. So sum is 84.07 +5.04=89.11 +34.97=124.08 +32=156.08. So the molecular ion is at 156, which makes sense. The M+2 peak is 158, which would be due to Cl (since the next isotope is Cl-35 being about 75% abundant and Cl-37 about 25%, so the M+2 peak would be 32% as given. So that fits with the presence of Cl in the molecule.

So the molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2. So the options B, D, and A have Cl.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is benzoic acid with Cl in para.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Cl and COOH are ortho.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That would have a Cl in meta, a hydroxyl, and an aldehyde group. But then the NMR would have a different pattern because of the aldehyde proton and the OH.

Wait, the NMR doesn't show any signals around 9-10 ppm, which would be the aldehyde. The only aldehyde-related signal would be a singlet around 9-10. But the NMR data has 11.0 ppm, which is more like a carboxylic acid. So that would rule out option A, which is a benzaldehyde with a hydroxyl.

Option C: phenyl chloroformate. That would be Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the structure is O=C(O-Ph)-Cl. The NMR wouldn't have an -OH because it's an acid chloride, but there might be a broad peak in IR from the O-Cl, but I'm not sure. Also, the IR carbonyl peak for acid chloride would be higher than 1720. Wait, I think acid chlorides have carbonyl peaks around 1800 cm^-1. So if in the IR the peak is at 1720, which is lower than that, it might not fit. So perhaps that's not option C.

So, putting it all together: the IR shows a broad peak (OH), strong peak at 1720 (carbonyl of a carboxylic acid), the NMR has a singlet at 11 ppm (COOH), and two doublets in aromatic region (para substitution). The mass spec has M at 156 and M+2 at 158 (Cl). So the structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, which is option B.

Wait, but let me double-check. What about the NMR aromatic region for 4-chlorobenzoic acid? The ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. The substituents are Cl and COOH in para positions. So the ring would have two sets of two equivalent protons each. The protons ortho to COOH would be more deshielded. Let me think, the COOH is a strong electron-withdrawing group, so the protons next to it would be downfield-shifted. In 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the protons adjacent to COOH (positions 3 and 5) would be deshielded, and the protons adjacent to Cl (positions 2 and 6) would be less deshielded but still affected.

Wait, but in the NMR, the downfield proton would be at 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), and the other would be at 7.72 (d, 2H). So the more deshielded protons are at 8.02, which are next to the COOH group. That makes sense because the COOH is a strong EWG, so those protons would be more deshielded and appear downfield.

So the NMR data fits with the para-substituted benzoic acid. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.


The problem involves identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%) and an M+2 peak at m/z = 158 (32%) suggest the presence of a chlorine atom, as chlorine isotopes contribute to the +2 mass. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹, indicative of an O-H stretch, and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group, likely from a carboxylic acid. 

The ¹H NMR data includes a singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H), which is consistent with the proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Additionally, two doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H) suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring, as the two sets of equivalent protons are split into doublets due to coupling in a para-disubstituted benzene. 

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde):** Contains an aldehyde group, which would show a proton signal around 9-10 ppm in the NMR. Since no such signal is observed, this option is ruled out.
- **Option B (4-Chlorobenzoic acid):** Contains a para-substituted benzene with Cl and COOH groups. The NMR signals match the expected splitting for a para-substituted aromatic ring, and the IR and mass spectral data align with this structure.
- **Option C (Phenyl chloroformate):** Contains an acid chloride group, which would not produce an -OH signal in the NMR. Additionally, the IR carbonyl peak for an acid chloride typically appears at a higher wavenumber (~1800 cm⁻¹), inconsistent with the given data.
- **Option D (2-Chlorobenzoic acid):** Contains an ortho-substituted benzene. The NMR signals for an ortho-substituted aromatic ring would not match the observed two doublets, making this option unlikely.

The spectral data, including the molecular ion peak, M+2 peak, IR carbonyl and O-H stretches, and the NMR signals, are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. 

Answer: B
