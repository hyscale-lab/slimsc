Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound it is based on the spectral data. Let's take it step by step.

The question says the chemist found a white solid, so I'm thinking it's an organic compound, probably something with a benzene ring since the options are all chlorinated aromatic compounds.

Looking at the mass spec first. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is 100%, so that's the molecular weight. Then there's another peak at m/z 158 at 32%. Hmm, that's 2 units higher. That makes me think about possible adducts or maybe isotopic peaks. Wait, chlorine has a significant natural abundance (about 75% for the 35Cl and 25% for 37Cl). So if the molecular ion is at 156, which includes a Cl, then the M+2 peak (156 +2) would be from Cl-37. But wait, the molecular ion is M, so M is 156. Then M+2 at 32% might be the Cl isotope. So the molecular formula probably has one Cl.

Now, the IR. A broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 suggests there's an -OH group. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is likely a carbonyl. So maybe a carboxylic acid or an ester or something like that. Wait, a carboxylic acid has a broad O-H stretch and a strong carbonyl. Alternatively, an ester would have a carbonyl around 1720, but the O-H would be a sharp peak if it's something else. Wait, but the broad peak in IR could be an -OH from a phenol or a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

- 11.0 ppm (s, 1H): That's a strong deshielded proton. For a carboxylic acid, the -OH proton is usually around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak, but here it's a singlet. Hmm, but wait, it's a singlet and sharp? Or could it be an aldehyde proton? No, an aldehyde is usually around
