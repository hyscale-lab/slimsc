Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Optical activity means a compound can rotate plane-polarized light. From what I remember, this happens when a compound has chiral centers, which are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. But wait, are there other factors? Oh right, some compounds can also be optically active if they have a plane of symmetry or other elements that might make them achiral even if they have stereocenters. Hmm, like if there's a plane of symmetry, the molecule isn't chiral.

Alright, let's go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, structure time. The molecule is CH2=CH-C(Cl)(CH3)? No, wait, wait. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: the double bond is between C1 and C2. So structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. 1-chloro would be Cl on C1: ClCH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be CH2Cl-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 1-chloro is Cl attached to the first carbon. So structure is ClCH2-CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro is ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, but that's butane, not butene. Hmm, maybe the structure is Cl on the first carbon of the double bond. So CH2Cl-CH2CH2CH3? No, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me try again.

Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, so it's CH2Cl-CH2CH2CH3? No, but in the case of but-1-ene, the structure
