Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem says a chemist performs two reactions. Reaction 1 uses (E)-oct-4-ene treated with one equivalent of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene under the same conditions. Both go to 100% completion. Then the products are combined and run on both standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns. I need to figure out what the HPLC chromatograms will show.

Hmm. mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, right? It's a peracid, commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation of alkenes... so when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it adds an epoxide group across the double bond.

Wait, but wait. The reaction of mCPBA with an alkene forms an epoxide, and then when treated with aqueous acid, the epoxide undergoes ring-opening. Oh right, in acidic conditions, epoxides typically open via a mechanism where the acid protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. The ring opens with the attack of a water nucleophile.

But wait, wait! The initial reaction is the epoxidation. So for each starting alkene, E and Z, the epoxide formation would produce specific diastereomers or maybe enantiomers?

Let me think about Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene. Structure is CH2CH2 on each end, with a double bond in the middle. The E isomer has the two methyl groups (or wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on both sides of the double bond. Wait, no. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait no. Let me clarify.

Wait, octene is eight carbons. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, actually, I think I should draw it. Let's see:

Structure of (E)-oct-4-ene: The molecule is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. I think I'm confusing the structure.

Wait, no. Oct-4-ene has the double bond between carbons 4 and 5. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that doesn't sound right. Wait, perhaps oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that doesn't have a double bond. Wait, no. Wait, no, I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, oct-1
