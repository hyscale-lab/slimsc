Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Since beta is 1/(kT), but I guess I can treat it as a variable for this calculation.

Each spin S_i is ±1. So for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I remember that each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 each being +1 or -1.

So, the first step is to list all possible states and calculate the energy for each, then sum the exponentials of -βE for each state.

But wait, that's a bit tedious, but manageable because there are only 8 states.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a smarter way by looking for symmetry or possible groupings. Let me think about the energy expression.

E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me denote each term as S_i S_j. Each product S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1 because S_i and S_j each are ±1. When two spins are the same, their product is +1; when different, -1.

So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can take different values. Let me consider how many terms are +1 and how many are -1 in the sum. Each S_i S_j term contributes either +1 or -1.

Let me denote the sum as (number of +1 terms) - (number of -1 terms) multiplied by 1, because each +1 adds 1, each -1 subtracts 1. Since there are 3 terms total, the sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 depends on how the spins are arranged.

Let me think about the possible cases based on the number of matching spins.

Wait, another approach: the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be rewritten as (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) all divided by 2. Because (a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + ac + bc). So, (ab + ac + bc) = [ (a+b+c)^2 - (a² + b² + c²) ] / 2.

Since each S_i is ±1, S_i squared is 1. So S1² + S2² + S3² = 3. So the sum becomes [ (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 -3 ] / 2.

So E = -J * [ ( (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 -3 ) / 2 ].

Wait, that might simplify things. Let me compute E in terms of M = S1 + S2 + S3.

So E = -J/2 [ M^2 - 3 ].

So E = (3J/2) - (J M^2)/2.

Hmm, so the energy depends on M, which is the total magnetization, which can take values -3, -1, +1, +3.

Because each S_i is ±1, their sum M can be 3 (all +1), 1 (two +1, one -1), -1 (two -1, one +1), or -3 (all -1).

So for each possible value of M, how many states have that M? Let me think.

- M=3: all spins up. Only 1 state.

- M=1: exactly two up, one down. How many ways? The -1 can be in any of the three positions, so 3 states.

- M=-1: two -1, one +1. Similarly 3 states.

- M=-3: all three -1. One state.

So for each M, number of states is 1,3,3,1.

So the partition function Z is the sum over all possible M of (number of states with M) multiplied by exp( -β E ), where E is given by (3J/2) - (J M^2)/2.

Wait, but wait: E is given by -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ] = -J * sum. So, when I substituted M, I got E = (3J/2) - (J M^2)/2.

But the partition function uses exp(-β E), right? So let me compute each term.

Z = sum_{M} (number of states with M) * exp( -β E )

So for each M:

For M=3:

E = (3J/2) - (J*(3)^2)/2 = (3J/2) - (9J/2) )= (-6J/2) = -3J.

So exp(-β E) = exp( 3J β )

Number of states with M=3 is 1.

So contribution: 1 * exp(3J β )

M=1:

E = (3J/2) - (J*(1)^2)/2 = (3J/2 - J/2) = (2J/2) = J.

So exp(-β E) = exp( -J β )

Number of states:3. Contribution: 3 * exp( -J β )

Similarly for M=-1:

E is same as M=1 because M^2 is same. So for M=-1, E= J. So same contribution: 3*exp(-J β )

M=-3:

E = (3J/2) - (J*(3)^2)/2 = same as M=3, so E = -3J. So exp(-β E) is exp(3J β )

So contribution: 1 * exp(3J β )

Putting it all together:

Z = [1 * exp(3J β )] + [3 * exp(-J β )] + [3 * exp(-J β )] + [1 * exp(3J β )]

Simplify the terms:

1 + 1 = 2 terms of exp(3Jβ ), so 2 exp(3Jβ )

3 +3 =6 terms of exp(-Jβ ), so 6 exp(-Jβ )

So Z = 2 exp(3Jβ ) + 6 exp(-Jβ )

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option B is Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ )

Yes, that's exactly what I have.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure that I didn't make any mistake in the energy expression.

Wait, another approach: let me calculate the energy for each possible state.

Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 being +1 or -1. There are 8 states. Let me list them and compute E for each.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to do this for each state.

Hmm, but considering that each spin is either +1 or -1, maybe I can compute the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each possible state.

But that's 8 states, which might be manageable.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the number of pairs that are aligned (i.e., same sign) versus anti-aligned.

Because each term S_i S_j is +1 if same, -1 if opposite.

So each term in S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 contributes +1 for same, -1 for different.

So the sum would be 3 - 2N, where N is the number of pairs that are opposite (since each opposite pair contributes -1, which is -1 for each term. So 3 terms, each either 1 or -1. Let N be the number of -1 terms. So sum is (3 - N*2).

Wait, because each of the 3 terms can be +1 (if same) or -1 (if different). So if N terms are -1, the sum is (3-N) *1 + N*(-1) = 3 - N -N = 3 - 2N.

So E = -J * (3 - 2N) = -J*(3) + 2J N.

Wait, wait, that's E = -3J + 2J N.

Wait, that's a different approach. So E depends on N, the number of anti-aligned neighboring pairs. So when N=0, all pairs aligned: E = -3J. If N=1, one pair anti-aligned: E = -3J + 2J = -J. If N=2: E= -3J +4J= J. N=3: E= -3J +6J=3J.

So each state has a certain number of anti-aligned pairs, N can be 0,1,2,3.

So for each possible N, how many states have N anti-aligned pairs?

Wait, but it's a bit tricky because the spins are in a triangle. Each spin is connected to two others. So each state can have N anti-aligned edges.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of each state as a configuration of S1, S2, S3.

Let's list all 8 possible states:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1.

Compute the terms:

S1S2=+1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=+1. Sum =3. E= -J*(3) = -3J.

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum= 1-1-1= -1. E= -J*(-1) = J.

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum= -1 +1 -1 = -1. E= J.

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1. Sum= -1 -1 +1 = -1. E= J.

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.

S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1. Sum= -1 -1 +1 = -1. E= J.

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum= -1 +1 -1 =-1. E= J.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum= 1-1-1= -1. E= J.

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

Sum=1+1+1=3. E= -3J.

Wait, but looking at all these states, I have:

- Two states (state 1 and 8) with E=-3J.

- The other six states (2-7) have E=J.

So the partition function Z is sum of exp(-β E) for each state.

So for E=-3J: each of these two states contributes exp(3J β). So total from these is 2 exp(3J β).

For E=J: each of the six states contributes exp(-J β). So total from these is 6 exp(-J β).

So Z = 2 exp(3J β) + 6 exp(-J β).

Which matches option B: Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ).

Wait, but let me look at the options again.

Option A: Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ) → No, because the exponents are opposite.

Option B: Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ) → Yes, matches.

So the correct answer is option B.


To find the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), each of which can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), we start with the energy expression:

\[
E = -J \left( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \right).
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the energy
The energy depends on the pairwise products \( S_i S_j \), which can be \( +1 \) (if spins are aligned) or \( -1 \) (if spins are anti-aligned). The sum \( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \) can take values \( 3, 1, -1, -3 \), depending on the number of aligned pairs. This leads to the following possible energies:

- If all pairs are aligned (\( S_1 S_2 = S_1 S_3 = S_2 S_3 = +1 \)), \( E = -3J \).
- If two pairs are aligned and one is anti-aligned (\( S_1 S_2 = S_1 S_3 = +1, S_2 S_3 = -1 \), or similar), \( E = -J \).
- If one pair is aligned and two are anti-aligned (\( S_1 S_2 = +1, S_1 S_3 = -1, S_2 S_3 = -1 \), or similar), \( E = J \).
- If all pairs are anti-aligned (\( S_1 S_2 = S_1 S_3 = S_2 S_3 = -1 \)), \( E = 3J \).

### Step 2: Count the number of states for each energy
For three spins, there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states. The number of states corresponding to each energy is:

- \( E = -3J \): 2 states (all spins aligned or all spins anti-aligned).
- \( E = -J \): 0 states (not possible with three spins).
- \( E = J \): 6 states (two anti-aligned pairs and one aligned pair).
- \( E = 3J \): 0 states (not possible with three spins).

### Step 3: Compute the partition function
The partition function is given by:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{states}} e^{-\beta E}.
\]

Substituting the contributions from each energy level:

- For \( E = -3J \): Each of the 2 states contributes \( e^{3J\beta} \), so the total contribution is \( 2e^{3J\beta} \).
- For \( E = J \): Each of the 6 states contributes \( e^{-J\beta} \), so the total contribution is \( 6e^{-J\beta} \).

Thus, the partition function is:

\[
Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
Comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) (incorrect, as the exponents are reversed).
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) (correct, matches the derived result).
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect, wrong exponents).
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect, wrong coefficients and exponents).

### Final Answer:
The correct partition function is \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
