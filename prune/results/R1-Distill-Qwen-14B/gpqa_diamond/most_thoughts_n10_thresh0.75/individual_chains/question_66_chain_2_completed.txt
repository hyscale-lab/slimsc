Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which of the given symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are A) 1,2; B) 3,4; C) 1,2,4; D) 1,3,4.

Wait, so SMEFT is an effective field theory that extends the Standard Model. Effective theories usually incorporate higher-dimensional operators that are compatible with the underlying symmetries of the theory. So, the operators in SMEFT must respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model itself, right?

Let me recall the symmetries of the Standard Model. The SM has Lorentz symmetry, which encompasses rotations and boosts. It also has gauge symmetries, like SU(2) and U(1), but the question isn't about those. Then there's the Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. But wait, is Poincare symmetry automatically included in Lorentz? Because Lorentz includes boosts and rotations, and Poincare adds translations. But in quantum field theory, all interactions are local, so I think Poincare symmetry is part of the foundation.

CP symmetry is a combination of charge conjugation and parity. The SM doesn't respect CP symmetry in general. For example, CP violation is observed in certain processes. But do the operators in SMEFT have to respect CP? I don't think so. Because SMEFT includes higher-dimensional operators, which can break CP if necessary. Like, the Wilson coefficients can have both CP-even and CP-odd terms, so operators might not all preserve CP. Or wait, does the theory as a whole require the operators to have CP symmetry? I think that's not necessarily the case. So operators don't have to respect CP symmetry.

CPT symmetry is a big one. The SM respects CPT, right? Because all local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theories must respect CPT. So CPT is a fundamental symmetry. Therefore, any operator in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

So let's reevaluate the options. The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. So which of 1,2,3,4 are always required.

1. Lorentz: Yes. Operators must be Lorentz scalars or form part of a tensor that transforms covariantly. So they must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. Poincare symmetry: Well, Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. But in any effective theory, operators are typically written as local operators, so they must be invariant under translations, which are part of Poincare. So yes, operators must respect Poincare symmetry.

3. CP symmetry: No, because operators can have terms that violate CP. For example, the SM includes operators that violate CP, like certain four-fermion interactions. So SMEFT allows for operators that don't respect CP.

4. CPT: Yes, because the theory must respect CPT, as per quantum field theory requirements.

So looking at the options, the correct symmetries that must be respected are 1,2,4.

Wait, wait. Wait, does Poincare symmetry have to be respected by the operators? Because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, which is part of the Poincare group. So operators must be Poincare-invariant. So 2 (Poincare) is correct.

So the required symmetries are 1,2,4. Let me check the options.

Option C says 1,2,4. Option C is A) 1,2; B) 3,4; C) 1,2,4; D)1,3,4.

So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but I thought Poincare is a larger symmetry than Lorentz. But in reality, in SMEFT, the operators are local and Lorentz-invariant. So they must be Poincare-invariant, because they're part of a Lorentz-invariant theory built on a Poincare-invariant spacetime.

Wait, but wait another point. Is Poincare symmetry automatically respected if Lorentz and translation symmetries are? Because operators in SMEFT are written in a way that is invariant under the SM symmetries, which include Poincare.

So the correct answer is that 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT) must be respected. Which is option C.

Wait, but wait another thought. Do all operators have to respect Poincare? Because the theory is Poincare-invariant, so all terms in the Lagrangian must be Poincare-invariant. So yes, the operators must respect Poincare.

So the correct answer is option C.


The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). SMEFT is an effective field theory that extends the Standard Model (SM) and incorporates higher-dimensional operators. These operators must respect the same fundamental symmetries as the SM itself.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This symmetry, which includes rotations and boosts, is fundamental to relativistic quantum field theories. Operators in SMEFT must transform covariantly under Lorentz transformations, so Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry with translations. Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory and operators are local, they must also respect Poincaré symmetry. This is because the theory is formulated on a Poincaré-invariant spacetime.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). The Standard Model does not respect CP symmetry in general (e.g., CP violation is observed in certain processes). SMEFT allows for operators that violate CP symmetry, so CP symmetry does not need to be universally respected.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry, which combines charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal, is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. All operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry, as it is a requirement for any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). This corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
