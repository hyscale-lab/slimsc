Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

The problem says that particles are being collided at the center of a spherical detector. They produce new particles that move at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reach the detector's inner walls. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm. So I think this has to do with the lifetime of the particles and how far they travel before decaying. Since they're moving at relativistic speeds, time dilation comes into play. The higher the Lorentz factor, the longer the lifetime as seen in the lab frame.

Wait, the key here is probably the proper lifetime of the particles. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by the Lorentz factor gamma. So the particles will travel a greater distance before decaying because they live longer.

Let me think about the first scenario. The Lorentz factor is 20, and one third of them reach the detector walls. The detector's radius is 30 meters. So the particles that reach the wall are those that don't decay before traveling 30 meters.

The distance a particle can travel before decaying depends on its speed and lifetime. For a given particle, the probability of decaying before traveling a certain distance depends on how much time that distance takes, relative to its lifetime.

Wait, another approach: the particles have a proper lifetime tau. The lab frame sees their lifetime as gamma * tau. The distance they can travel is velocity v multiplied by the time they live. So L = v * (gamma * tau). But since they are ultra-relativistic, v is approximately c. So L ≈ c * gamma tau.

But wait, gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is given by gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). For ultra-relativistic speeds, v ≈ c, so gamma is large.

But how does this relate to the number of particles reaching the detector walls?

The problem states that at gamma ~20, on average one third reach the wall. So maybe we need to find the gamma such that two-thirds reach the wall.

Wait, perhaps it's about how much time the particles have to reach the detector. If they decay before reaching the detector, they don't reach the wall. The fraction that reaches the wall depends on the probability that the particle's lifetime is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall.

The proper lifetime is tau. The time in the lab frame is gamma tau. The time it takes for the particle to reach the detector is t = distance / speed. The distance is 30 meters, speed is about c (~3e8 m/s). So t = 30 / (3e8) = 1e-7 seconds.

So the particle will reach the detector if its lifetime (gamma tau) is longer than t. The probability that it doesn't decay before reaching is P = 1 - exp
