Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model extension and the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I remember that the Standard Model has various particles and their Lagrangians, and when we extend it, we add more particles like singlets or other scalars.

The Lagrangian given here has several terms. Let's see, the first term is i times the conjugate of N_R gamma^mu partial_mu N_R. Oh right, that's the Dirac term for a fermion. Since N_R is a singlet, it doesn't carry any color or charge, so it's like a right-handed neutrino maybe? Or another heavy fermion.

Then there's (1/2)(∂^μ ϕ)^2, which is the kinetic term for the scalar ϕ. The next term is |D^μ S|^2, which means S is a scalar doublet because it's in the covariant derivative. So S must be a charged scalar, perhaps?

The term -y_i/2 ϕ bar(N_{iR})^c N_{iR}^c looks like a Yukawa coupling. Wait, the conjugate of N means it's a left-handed field? Or maybe because it's a singlet, the chirality isn't as important. But this term suggests that ϕ is coupling to these singlet fermions N_iR. So when ϕ gets a vev, it might give mass to the N's.

Then there's another term -g_{iα} bar(N_{iR}) L_α S. L is the lepton doublet, right? So this term is like a Yukawa interaction where N interacts with leptons and the scalar S. Oh, so S could be a scalar that gives mass to charged leptons or something like that.

The potential V(ϕ, S, H) must be where the spontaneous symmetry breaking happens. Wait, but the text mentions <ϕ>^2 = x² + v², and <h> = v. Hmm, maybe ϕ is a singlet scalar, and H is another scalar field that gets a vev v. But in the potential, which fields are involved? The model includes ϕ, S, and H, so perhaps H is another doublet or a singlet.

The question is about the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H2. Pseudo-Goldstone bosons arise when a symmetry is spontaneously broken but not completely. For example, in the Standard Model, the Higgs mechanism breaks the gauge symmetry, and the Higgs field has a component that's the Goldstone boson which becomes the longitudinal mode of the W and Z bosons. But sometimes when there are multiple scalar fields, there can be additional Goldstone bosons, but some might be eaten by the gauge bosons, and the others become physical Higgses.

Wait, but in the Standard Model, the Higgs is a doublet, so the Goldstone modes are absorbed. In extensions,
