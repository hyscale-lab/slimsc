Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is to identify a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using the provided spectroscopic data. The options are A, B, C, and D. Let me break down the information given.

First, looking at the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X (halogens) are zero, so plugging in the numbers: (2*9 + 2 -11 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = (10)/2 = 5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That suggests a structure with either five rings, five double bonds, or a combination. More likely, a couple of rings and some double bonds. For example, a benzene ring (which is 3 DoU) plus maybe an ester group (which has a double bond) and perhaps an amide or something else.

Now, looking at the IR data: strong to medium bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are likely N-H stretches. Amides usually show N-H stretches in that region. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is probably a carbonyl group. Could be an ester (which typically around 1730-1740), but maybe a bit lower if it's an amide. Alternatively, a ketone or aldehyde, but given the molecular formula and options, probably an ester or amide.

The 1H NMR data is next. Let's list the peaks:

1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H. That's probably a CH3 group attached to something that splits it into a triplet. Commonly, this is a CH3CH2 group, like an ethyl group. So maybe an ethyl ester or ethyl amide.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad suggests maybe an -NH group, but considering the integration is 2H, maybe something else. Alternatively, perhaps an OCH2 group, but the shift is a bit low for that. Alternatively, an NH adjacent to an oxygen, but I'm not too sure.

4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H. Quartet with 2H. Quartet suggests coupling with a neighboring group that has two protons. So maybe this is the CH2 connected to an ethyl group. Like in an ester group: OCH2CH2... Wait, but the triplet at 1.20 is the CH3 of ethyl, so the quartet at 4.5 would be the adjacent CH2. So that fits with an ethyl ester. So maybe the structure has an ethyl group attached via an ester.

Then, the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm as a doublet (d) for 2H, and 8.0 ppm as another
