Okay, so I have this question about redshift and detecting quasars using optical telescopes. Let me think through it step by step.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We need to find the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Hmm, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum for the quasar itself. But when the quasar's light passes through a cloud of neutral hydrogen, the hydrogen absorbs at its own rest wavelength, which is 1216 Angstroms. So when the cloud is moving away (due to the expansion of the universe), this wavelength is redshifted.

Wait, but wait. The quasar emits light, and the hydrogen cloud is between us and the quasar. So the light we receive from the quasar comes through the cloud. The cloud absorbs at 1216A, but when the cloud is moving with the expansion of the universe, this wavelength shifts. So the absorption line we observe is at a longer wavelength than 1216A if the cloud is moving away.

Now, for optical telescopes, what's the limit? I think optical telescopes can't see into the ultraviolet because the atmosphere absorbs those wavelengths. So if the redshifted Lyman alpha line is in the optical range, the quasar can be detected. But if it's still in the UV, ground-based telescopes can't see it because the atmosphere blocks it.

So the condition is that the redshifted wavelength must be in the optical range. Let's think about what the redshift z would need to be for 1216A to be shifted into optical.

Optical wavelengths are roughly from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). Let me convert 1216 Angstroms to nanometers. 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216A is 121.6 nm. That's in the ultraviolet. So if the cloud has a redshift z, the observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + z).

We want lambda_obs >= 400 nm (the start of optical). So:

121.6 nm * (1 + z) >= 400 nm.

Divide both sides by 121.6:

1 + z >= 400 / 121.6 ≈ 3.292.

So z >= approx 2.292. 

Wait, but wait a second. The question asks for the lower limit on the redshift for the objects to be detectable. So the minimum z where the Lyman alpha line is just entering the optical. So z would be around 2.29, which is about 2.3.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is just a bit higher than 2.29. Option D is 1.9, which is lower. Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation?

Let me double-check. 1216 Angstrom is 121.6 nm. We want this to be in the optical, say 400 nm or longer. So 400 = 121.6*(1+z). So 1+z = 400/121.6 ≈ 3.292, so z ≈ 2.292. So the minimum z is just over 2.29.

Looking at the options, the closest one is option C) 2.4. But wait, another thought: perhaps the minimum z is when the Lyman alpha line is just at the start of what the telescope can observe. Maybe the quasar's own emission is in the optical, but the absorption line is in the UV. Oh, wait, no, because the question is about detecting the quasar through the absorption. Or, perhaps I'm confusing the sources.

Wait, no. The quasar emits, but the hydrogen cloud causes absorption. So the quasar's light is absorbed at Lyman alpha. For us to detect that absorption, the absorbed wavelength must be in the observed range of the telescope. So if the cloud is at a high enough redshift that 1216A is shifted into the optical, then we can observe the absorption line. If it's still UV, we can't, because the atmosphere blocks UV.

So the lower limit is when the Lyman alpha line is at 400 nm, which gives z≈2.29. So the minimum z is just over 2.29, so the lowest possible option is 2.4, which is option C.

But wait, another angle: sometimes, people consider that optical telescopes can't see beyond certain wavelengths. For example, the ground-based telescopes have a cutoff around 300 nm (but that's still UV). So if the Lyman alpha line is at 300 nm or longer, it's in the UV, which can't be observed from the ground. So the cutoff is higher.

Wait, no, I think optical is considered up to about 700 nm. So perhaps we need to see when the Lyman alpha line is in the visible (like say 400 nm and above). So the calculation was correct before.

So the minimal z is about 2.29, so the answer would be the smallest option higher than that. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. So option C is 2.4, which is the next higher than 2.29. But wait, 2.29 is between 2 and 3. So if the options are 2.4 and 2.9, but wait, in our case, the options are A)3, C)2.4, which is the next step.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should be that the observed wavelength is in the visible (say, 4000 Angstroms is 400 nm, which is visible violet). So 1216*(1+z) = 4000 Angstrom.

Wait, wait, I think I confused the units earlier. Let me re-calculate:

1216 Angstrom = 121.6 nm. Optical range is about 400-700 nm. So 400 nm is the lower limit of optical. So setting:

lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z) = 4000 Angstrom? Wait no, 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. Oh wait, no. Wait, 1 nm is 10 Angstroms, so 400 nm = 4000 Angstroms? Wait no, wait. 1 nm = 10 Angstroms. So 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1 nm = 100 Angstroms. Oh wait, no. 1 nm is 10 Angstroms. Because 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 1216 Angstrom = 121.6 nm. 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in the unit conversion. Let me correct:

1 Angstrom (Å) = 0.1 nm.

So 400 nm = 4000 Angstroms.

1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is in the far UV.

So, for the Lyman alpha line to be in the optical (say, 400 nm or 4000 Angstroms), we have:

lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z) = 4000 Angstroms.

So 1 + z = 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.292.

z ≈ 2.292.

So the minimum z is approximately 2.29. So the lower limit is about 2.29, so any z >= 2.29 would allow the Lyman alpha line to be observed in the optical.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is just above 2.29, so that's the lower limit. Option D is 1.9, which is below 2.29, so anything below that would put the Lyman alpha line in the UV, which isn't observable from the ground.

Wait, but wait another point: what about the quasar's own emission lines? The quasar emits light, and if it's at a high redshift, then its own visible emission lines (like Lyman alpha) could be redshifted into the infrared or beyond, making them hard to observe. But the question is about detecting the quasar through the absorption of the hydrogen cloud.

Wait, no, the question is about detecting the quasar by observing the absorption line in the hydrogen cloud. So, the presence of the absorption line at a certain wavelength tells us about the cloud's redshift. If the cloud's redshift is such that the Lyman alpha line is in the optical, then the absorption can be detected.

So if the cloud has a redshift z_cloud, then the Lyman alpha is 1216*(1+z_cloud) Angstrom.

We need 1216*(1+z_cloud) >= 4000 Angstroms (which is 400 nm, the lower limit of optical).

So, 1 + z_cloud >= 4000 / 1216 ≈3.292 → z_cloud >= 2.292.

Thus, the lower limit would be just above 2.29. Among the options, the smallest z that is higher is 2.4 (option C), which is the answer.


To determine the lower limit on the redshift of objects such that the Lyman alpha absorption line (rest wavelength ~1216 Å) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the redshifted wavelength of the absorption line. Optical telescopes can observe wavelengths in the range of approximately 400–700 nm (or 4000–7000 Å). For the Lyman alpha line to be detectable, its redshifted wavelength must fall within this range.

The redshifted wavelength is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot (1 + z)
\]

Here, \(\lambda_{\text{emit}} = 1216 \, \text{Å}\), and we require \(\lambda_{\text{obs}} \geq 4000 \, \text{Å}\) (the lower limit of the optical range). Substituting these values:

\[
1216 \cdot (1 + z) \geq 4000
\]

Dividing through by 1216:

\[
1 + z \geq \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.292
\]

Solving for \(z\):

\[
z \geq 3.292 - 1 \approx 2.292
\]

Thus, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately \(z \geq 2.29\). Among the given options, the smallest value greater than 2.29 is \(z = 2.4\). Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift for the objects to be detectable with optical ground-based telescopes is approximately 2.4.
