Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question. Let's see what the question says. Hmm, astronomers observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(parallax)^5. Wait, parallax is usually denoted as 'p', so N ∝ 1/p^5.

Now, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. So I need to find how N depends on distance r. Parallax and distance are related, right? I remember that parallax p is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is p = 1 / (distance in parsecs). So if distance r increases, parallax p decreases.

Wait, let's get that straight. Parallax equation: p (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So p = 1/r, where r is in parsecs. So r = 1/p. Therefore, p is inversely proportional to r.

So since N is proportional to 1/p^5, I can substitute p in terms of r. Let's do that.

N ∝ 1/(p)^5. But p = 1/r, so 1/p = r. So 1/p^5 would be (1/p)^5 = r^5.

Wait, wait, let me check that substitution again. Let's compute 1/p^5. Since p = 1/r, then p^5 = (1/r)^5 = 1/r^5. So 1/p^5 is 1/(1/r^5) =
