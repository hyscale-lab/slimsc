Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE) of an electron given the uncertainty in its position (Δx) and its speed (v). Hmm.

First, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is involved here. The principle states that you can't simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute certainty. The formula I recall is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, another version I remember is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Or maybe it's for energy and time uncertainty. Wait, the question is about position and momentum, so the first formula is probably the right one.

But wait, the question is asking about the uncertainty in energy (ΔE), not momentum. So maybe I need to relate momentum to energy somehow. Oh right, for a particle moving at non-relativistic speeds, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), where p is momentum and m is mass. Since the electron is moving at v = 2e8 m/s, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light (which is about 3e8 m/s), but wait—wait, 2e8 is two-thirds the speed of light. Hmm, does that mean relativistic effects are important here? Because electrons have rest mass around 9e30 kg, so their kinetic energy at such speeds might not be negligible. Wait, but maybe the problem expects a non-relativistic approach since it's a basic question.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the approximation for non-relativistic momentum. Let's proceed with that for now, unless I hit a snag.

So, let me outline the steps:

1. Use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle to find the uncertainty in momentum (Δp).

2. Then, use the momentum-energy relation to find the uncertainty in energy (ΔE).

Wait, but wait. The Heisenberg principle gives Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So the minimum uncertainty would be when Δp is approximately ħ/(2Δx). So Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx).

But wait, the exact value is Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx), so the minimum is ħ/(2Δ
