Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

So, the question is about three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They have circular orbits and were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variation. I remember that TTV is a method used to detect exoplanets by observing changes in the timing of a planet's transit as it passes in front of its star. But maybe that's more background than I need here.

The key data provided are the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3. So, Planet1's temperature is 1.4 times Planet2's, and Planet2's is 2.3 times Planet3's. 

Then, the mass ratios: Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. So Planet2 is a bit heavier than Planet1, and Planet3 is a bit heavier than Planet2. Wait, but 1.35 means Planet2 is 1.35 times Planet3's mass? Wait, no, the ratio is Planet2/Planet3 is 1.35, which would mean Planet2 is 1.35 times more massive than Planet3. So Planet3 is less massive than Planet2, and Planet1 is a bit less than Planet2 as well.

Wait, no, wait. If the mass ratio of Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, that means Planet1 is 1.15 times the mass of Planet2. Or is it the other way around? Wait, the wording is: "the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15". Hmm, sometimes ratios can be ambiguous. So, if it's Planet1/Planet2 = 1.15, then Planet1 is more massive. Alternatively, it could be Planet2/Planet1 =1.15, meaning Planet2 is more massive. Hmm, but in the context, I think it's probably Planet1 to Planet2, so Planet1 is 1.15 times the mass of Planet2. Similarly for the others.

But wait, the question is about the orbital period. So I need to relate the mass of the planets to their orbital periods. But I'm a bit confused because the orbital period of a planet depends on the mass of the star it's orbiting and the semi-major axis of its orbit. Oh wait, but all three planets are in the same system, so they all orbit the same star. So the mass of the star is the same for all. So their orbital periods would depend mainly on their semi-major axes.

Wait, but the question gives me temperature ratios. So equilibrium temperature relates to the distance from the star. Because the equilibrium temperature is given by the formula:

Te = T_star * ( (L_star / (16 * pi * sigma * a^2) ) )^(1/4)

Wait, no, the more commonly used formula is Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), assuming the star's radius is R_star and it's a blackbody. Alternatively, the formula is Te = T_star * ( (1 - albedo) / (2(1 + e)) )^(1/4), but for circular orbits, e=0, so it's ( (1 - albedo)/2 )^(1/4) times T_star multiplied by the inverse square root of the distance a.

Wait, I think the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital radius. Because the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance, and equilibrium temperature is the fourth root of flux (since flux is sigma T^4). So T ∝ (L/(16 pi a^2))^(1/4) → T ∝ (1/a^2)^(1/4) → T ∝ 1/√a. So if planet A has Te1 and planet B has Te2, then Te1/Te2 = sqrt(a2/a1).

So, in this problem, the equilibrium temperatures are given, and albedo is the same (0.3) for all. So the T ratio depends only on the orbital distances.

So for Planet1 and Planet2, T1/T2 = 1.4 ≈ sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Similarly, for Planet2 and Planet3, T2/T3 ≈ 2.3 = sqrt( a3 / a2 )

Wait, because higher temperature would mean closer to the star, so Planet1 is hotter than Planet2, so Planet1 is closer, a1 < a2. So the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt(a2/a1) → 1.4 = sqrt(a2/a1) → a2/a1 = (1
