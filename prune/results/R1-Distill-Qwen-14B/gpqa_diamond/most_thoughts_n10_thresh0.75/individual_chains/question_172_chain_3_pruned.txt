Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let me read it again. Oh right, the question is about the excitation of iron atoms in two stars and how that relates to their effective temperatures.

So, the setup: Star_1 has iron atoms twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to Star_2. The energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles in energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution.

The Boltzmann equation relates the population of two energy levels to the temperature. The formula is (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). Here, n_i and n_j are the number of particles in states i and j. g_i and g_j are the statistical weights. E_i and E_j are their respective energies.

In this case, the energy difference is given as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. Let's say the excited state is higher in energy, so E_i is higher than E_j. So, for Star_1, the ratio n1_i/n1_j is 2, because Star_1 has twice as excited as Star_2. Wait, wait, no—wait, the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, the population of the specific higher energy level is twice that of Star_2's in the same level.

Wait, no, actually, the question says the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2. So, for a specific energy level, say level i, in star_1, the number of excited atoms (n1) is twice that of star_2 (n2). Wait no, the question states that the excitation is twice, so perhaps the ratio is n1_i / n1_j = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j) ?

Wait, no, perhaps I should think differently. For each star, the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state (n_i) to the ground state (n_j) is determined by the Boltzmann factor. So for Star_1: n1_i / n1_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE
