Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's take it step by step. The question involves a reaction scheme with several steps, and I need to figure out what compound E is. 

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints provided. Let's look at them.

Hint a) says that when compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are usually involved in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting aldehydes or ketones with ylides. So, compound A must be either an aldehyde or ketone because that's what the Wittig reaction typically reacts with.

Looking at the product of the Wittig reaction: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be the ylid part. So, the starting ylide is from propan-2-ol, I think. The product has a cyclopentane ring with substituents. Let me imagine the structure. The cyclopentane has methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, and a substituent at position 4 which is a propan-2-ylidene group. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be like the ylid, which in the product would become a double bond. Oh wait, no, the ylid is adding to the carbonyl, so maybe the product has a double bond adjacent to the cyclopentane.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopentane ring where the substituents are from the ylid. Let me think about the structure. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be a substituent with a double bond, like CH2-C(CH3)= group? Or maybe it's the part that was the ylid, so perhaps the product is a substituted cyclopentene?

Wait, maybe I should draw this out. So, the Wittig reaction takes the carbonyl group (from A) and replaces it with a double bond. So if A is a ketone, say cyclopentanone with some substituents, the Wittig would add a new group, creating an alkene.

But the product is a cyclopentane with substituents and a propan-2-ylidene group. Wait, maybe the product is more like a cyclopentane ring with a substituent that's a propenyl group, specifically at position 4.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic compound, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to think about the structure of the product. 

The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let
