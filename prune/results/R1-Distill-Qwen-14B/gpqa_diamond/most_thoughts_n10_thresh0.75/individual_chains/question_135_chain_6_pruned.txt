Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the decay of a boson. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I remember that the Lagrangian usually tells us about the interactions between particles. So here, X is interacting with the fermion fields ψ_f.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So I need to find all the possible decay channels of X into fermion-antifermion pairs. The options given are A, B, C, D, each listing different fermion pairs.

I think the key here is to determine which fermions have a mass such that their rest mass is less than or equal to half of X's mass. Because, in particle physics, for a particle to decay into a pair of particles, the mass of each particle must be less than half the mass of the original particle. That's because each daughter particle must have some kinetic energy as well.

So, the mass of X is 6 GeV. Half of that is 3 GeV. So the mass of each fermion in the decay products must be less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Now, let me list the fermion masses I know. I think the masses (in GeV) of the known fermions are approximately:

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~0.003 GeV (but wait, this is the current quark mass, which is much lower)
- Down quark (d): ~0.004 GeV
- Strange quark (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.13 GeV
- Top quark (t): ~173 GeV

Wait, but wait a second. When we talk about a fermion pair, like quarks, we have to consider their rest mass because the interaction term here is with ψ_f, which are Dirac fermions. So the mass of each ψ_f (fermion) must be such that twice their mass is less than or equal to the mass of X.

So, for each fermion f, m_f * 2 ≤ 6 GeV → m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So let's go through each fermion:

- Electron: m=0.0005 GeV → definitely allowed.
- Muon: m=0.105 GeV → allowed.
- Tau: m=1.777 GeV → allowed (since 1.777 <3).
- Up quark: 0.003 → allowed.
- Down quark: 0.004 → allowed.
- Strange quark: 0.095 → allowed.
- Charm quark: 1.27 → allowed (since 1.27 <3).
- Bottom quark: 4.13 → 4.13*2=8.26 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So can't decay into b bbar.
- Top quark: way too heavy, about 173 GeV. So no way for X to decay into t tbar.

So the possible fermion pairs X can decay into are: e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but wait another thing—quarks. Since X is a boson, can it decay into quark-antiquark pairs? Because in reality, particles like the photon or Z boson can decay into quark pairs because they are color-neutral. But wait, the X here is a boson field. But the question is about allowed decays, so from a kinematic standpoint, as long as the mass is sufficient, it's allowed.

So for quarks, each pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to X's mass. So for each quark, check m_quark *2 ≤6 GeV.

So for u quark: 0.003 *2 =0.006 ≤6 → allowed.
Similarly, d, s, c: c is 1.27 → 2.54 ≤6 → allowed.

So, the possible fermion pairs are:

e+ e-,
μ+ μ-,
τ+ τ-,
u ū,
d d̄,
s s̄,
c c̄.

Wait, but in the options, the pairs are written as, for example, e+ e^-.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ū, d d̄, τ τ, e e, etc. But wait, I just determined that b is 4.13 GeV, so 4.13*2=8.26>6. So b bbar is not allowed. So option A includes b and s, u, d, tau, e. But including b is incorrect because 4.13*2>6. So option A is not correct.

Option B: c cbar, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So masses: c is 1.27, which is okay. So B's options are all ≤3 GeV. So that seems correct.

Option C: includes t tbar, which is 173 GeV way over 3. So C is wrong.

Option D: includes b and tau, but no c. Wait, D's options are b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But b is not allowed. So D is incorrect.

Wait, wait, let me double-check. Option B says c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, so B includes c cbar, which is allowed (1.27 <3). So all the fermions in B are allowed.

But wait, let me check the Lagrangian again. The interaction is given as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So the interaction is with X, and the Yukawa coupling. So the fermions that have a Yukawa interaction with X can decay.

Wait, but perhaps the fermion must have a non-zero Yukawa coupling. For example, perhaps the fermions that can interact are those that have a non-zero λf. So the problem statement says the interaction is with fermions f, but perhaps it's possible that only certain fermions have a non-zero coupling.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify which fermions are involved. The Lagrangian is written as -λf ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. So for each fermion f, there's a coupling term. So all fermions f can interact with X.

Wait, but maybe in reality, particles like the top quark have very large Yukawa couplings, but perhaps the problem is assuming that any fermion can interact as long as the mass allows.

But in the problem statement, the interaction is given, but perhaps it's written as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So for each fermion f, the interaction term exists.

But in reality, for the decay X → f fbar, the matrix element depends on the coupling. But the question is about kinematics, not about the strength of the coupling. So for the question, it's just about whether the fermion is light enough.

So, the allowed fermion pairs are those where each fermion's mass is ≤ 3 GeV. So the list is e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A includes b, which is 4.13, so 2*m=8.26>6 → not allowed. So A is wrong.

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu
