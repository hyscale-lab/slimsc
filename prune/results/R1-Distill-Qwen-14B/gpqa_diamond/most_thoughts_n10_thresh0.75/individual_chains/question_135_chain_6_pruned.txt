Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particle decays, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The problem says that the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions is given by the Lagrangian L(y) = -λ f ψ̄ f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and the question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different possible decay channels. I need to pick which one is correct.

Hmm, so first, I remember that particles can decay into other particles if the energy (mass) of the boson is enough to create the daughter particles. Since X is a boson, it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs because the interaction term involves ψ and ψ̄.

The general rule is that the sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the decaying particle. So, for X → f f̄, the mass of X must be at least 2 * m_f, where m_f is the mass of the fermion.

Wait, but wait. What's the mass of X? It's 6 GeV. So each fermion pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. So each fermion's mass needs to be ≤ 3 GeV, because 2 * m_f ≤ 6 GeV → m_f ≤3 GeV.

Wait, but not all fermions have the same mass. Let me think about the masses of the known fermions. In the Standard Model, the quarks and leptons have the following approximate masses (in GeV/c²):

- Up quark (u): ~0.004 (so negligible)
- Down quark (d): ~0.008
- Strange quark (s): ~0.095
- Charm quark (c): ~1.27 (approx)
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.1-4.7 (around 4.5 GeV)
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV
- Electron (e): ~0.0005
- Muon (μ): ~0.105
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV

So, for a decay product f f̄, the sum 2*m_f must be ≤6 GeV.

Let me calculate 2*m_f for each possible fermion:

- u: 2*0.004 = 0.008 GeV → way below 6. So allowed.
- d: 2*0.008=0.016 → allowed.
- s: 2*0.095=0.19 → allowed.
- c: 2*1.27≈2.54 → allowed.
- b: 2*4.5=9 → which is more than 6, so not allowed. So X can't decay into b b̄.
- t: 2*173=346 → way too big, so no.
- e: 2*0.0005=0.001 → allowed.
- μ: 2*0.105=0.21 → allowed.
- τ: 2*1.777≈3.554 → which is less than 6 GeV. So τ+τ- is allowed.

So the possible fermion pairs are: u, d, s, c, e, μ, τ. Wait, but what about the top quark? Oh, no, because its mass is way too high.

Wait, but the interaction term given in the Lagrangian is -λ f ψ̄ f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps the index f here represents the type of fermion involved. So the term suggests that X couples to fermions f. So whatever fermions are present in the theory can be decay products.

But wait, the question is about the kinematically allowed decays, not about whether they are possible via the given interaction. But in the Lagrangian, X is coupled to the fermion fields, so it can decay into those fermions as long as the mass allows.

So the possible fermion pairs are s, c, u, d, τ, and the leptons e, μ, τ.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ−, e+e−.

But wait, b has mass about 4.5 GeV. So 2*m_b is about 9 GeV, which is more than X's mass (6 GeV). So decay into b and b̄ is not allowed. So option A includes b, which is wrong. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+e−.

Wait, wait, B includes c, s, u, d, τ, mu, e. So all these are allowed, because 2*1.27=2.54, which is ≤6.

Yes, B includes all allowed fermions except the bottom and top. So B could be a candidate.

Wait, but looking at option B: Oh wait, the option says "c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−." All of these would have 2*m_f ≤6 GeV except possibly the tau.

Wait, tau is 1.777 GeV, 2*1.777=3.554, which is less than 6. So it's allowed.

So B includes all possible fermions except b and t.

Wait, but the possible quarks are u, d, s, c. Because b is too heavy. So option B doesn't have b, which is correct. So X can't decay into b b̄.

Similarly, what about the tau? Since 2*m_tau is 3.55 GeV, which is less than 6, so tau pair is allowed.

So the possible decay channels are:

s s̄, c c̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+e−.

So looking at the options, option B includes all these except for the tau, wait no, option B includes tau.

Wait, option B says: c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e-.

Yes. So B is the correct option.

Wait, but let's check the other options. Option C includes t and tau and others. But t is way too heavy, so C is wrong.

Option D: includes b, which is too heavy, so D is wrong.

Option A includes b as decay, which is not allowed.

So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but wait a moment. Are
