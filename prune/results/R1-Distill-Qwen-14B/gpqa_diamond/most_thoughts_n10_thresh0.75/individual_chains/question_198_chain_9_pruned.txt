Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. We're given the stability constants for the different cobalt thiocyanato complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, what's a stability constant again? Oh right, it's the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex ion. So, for each complex, the β value tells us how stable it is. Higher β means more stable.

The complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n, where n is 1, 2, 3, 4. So, the first complex is [Co(SCN)]+, the second [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+), then [Co(SCN)_3]^0, and [Co(SCN)_4]^(2-). Or something like that. But the exact charges might not matter here, since we're dealing with ratios.

The problem is asking specifically about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think the blue ones are the ones with two SCN- ligands. Oh, wait, wait! Wait, no. Wait, I remember that the different Co(SCN)_n complexes have different colors. The blue ones are usually the [Co(SCN)_6]^3- complex, but wait, that's for Co(III), maybe? Hmm, but the question says dithiocyanato, which would be two SCN- per Co, so [Co(SCN)_2]. But wait, wait, I'm getting confused. I think the blue complexes are the ones with more SCN-? Or am I mixing this up with another metal?

Wait, the problem says "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." So, it must be the [Co(SCN)_2]^(something) complex. But I'm not 100% sure about the color. But maybe that's not the main point—maybe the question is about the fraction of the Co species that are in the form of [Co(SCN)_2]^something.

But wait, the problem is about all the cobalt-containing species. So, in solution, cobalt can exist as free Co^2+, or as complexes with 1, 2, 3, or 4 SCN- ions. We have to calculate the fraction of Co that's in the form with two SCN- ligands.

The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, but what does each β correspond to? Typically, the β for a complex [M(L)_n] is the formation constant, Kf, which is [ML_n]/([M][L]^n). So for β1, that's the formation constant for [Co(SCN)]^+, right? So for each n, the βn is the stability constant for the n-th complex.
