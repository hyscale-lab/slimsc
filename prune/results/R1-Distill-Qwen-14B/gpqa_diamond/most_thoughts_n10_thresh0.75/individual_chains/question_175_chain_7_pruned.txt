Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that there's an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and the angle theta. The maximum power is A, and we're supposed to find the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees and the possible form of f.

Hmm, right. I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation, and the radiation pattern depends on the angle theta from the axis of oscillation. For a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is a function of cos(theta), something like proportional to (1 + cos^2(theta)) or similar? Or wait, no, wait. Dipole radiation has a specific angular distribution. Let me think.

Oh right, for a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern in the far field is given by the dipole radiation formula. The power per unit solid angle, or the radiation intensity, is proportional to (1 + cos²(theta)). So the maximum occurs when cos(theta) is 1 or -1, which is along the axis (theta=0 or 180). But wait, in that case, the maximum is when theta is 0 degrees, right?

Wait, but in this problem, the maximum power is A. So the question is, what fraction of this maximum is radiated at theta=30 degrees? So we need to find f(theta=30)/A.

So first, the angular dependence. The function f(theta) for a dipole is proportional to (1 + cos²(theta)). So let's compute f at theta=30 degrees.

Wait, cos(30 degrees) is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866. So cos^2(theta) would be (3/4) here. So 1 + (3/4) is 7/4? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, no. Because the maximum of the dipole pattern is when theta=0, right? Because cos(theta)=1, so 1 + 1 = 2. So when theta is 30 degrees, cos(theta) is sqrt(3)/2, so cos^2(theta)=3/4. So 1 + (3/4)= 7/4? No, wait, no. Wait, 1 + (3/4) is 7/4? Wait, no, 1 is 4/4, plus 3/4 is 7/4, but wait that can't be because the maximum is 2, which is 8/4. So wait, perhaps I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, no, for dipole radiation, the intensity pattern is (1 + cos²(theta)) divided by something, right? Let me think. Wait, the dipole radiation formula for the intensity is proportional to (2/3) * (p^2 omega^4)/(c^6 r^2) * (1 + cos²(theta)). Wait, I'm not sure about the constants, but the angular part is (1 + cos²(theta)).

Wait, so when theta is 0, cos(theta) is 1, so 1+1=2. At 90 degrees, cos(theta) is 0, so it's 1. So the maximum is 2, and it's symmetric around the axis.

Wait, but in this problem, the maximum power is A. So the function f(theta) must have its maximum at theta=0. Therefore, f(theta) reaches maximum A at theta=0.

So the question is, when theta=30 degrees, what's the fraction of A? Let's compute that.

f(theta) is proportional to (1 + cos^2(theta)). So the maximum is 2, and at theta=30, it's 1 + (3/4) = 7/4. Wait, but wait, that's 1.75, which is less than 2, which makes sense. So the fraction would be (7/4)/2 = 7/(8) ? No, wait no, because f(theta) is the value at theta=30, and the maximum is A.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The function f(theta) is (1 + cos²(theta)), but scaled by some constants to have a maximum of A. So when theta is 0, (1 + 1 )=2, but that's equal to A. So the function can be written as f(theta) = A * (1 + cos²(theta))/2.

Because when theta is 0, (1 +1)/2 = 1, so f(theta) becomes A.

Wait, wait, no. Let me clarify. Let's say that f(theta) = constant * (
