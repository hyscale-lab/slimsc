Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution and the radiation it emits. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me think about what I know.

The question says the charge distribution is spheroidal and oscillating, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and θ, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A. The question is asking about two things: the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees and the possible form of f(λ,θ).

I remember that for dipole radiation, the power radiated is proportional to the square of the acceleration, but I'm not sure about the exact dependence. Also, the radiation pattern for a dipole has a specific angular dependence. Oh right, the radiation from a dipole is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the axis, which is the transverse direction. So, the intensity varies with the angle θ as sin²θ. Wait, no, wait. I think for a dipole, the radiation pattern in the far zone (radiation zone) has an intensity that varies with (1 + cos²θ)/2. But wait, no, that's the angular distribution for the electric field. Let me think again.

Wait, no, I might be mixing things up. The electric field of a dipole varies as (1 + cos²θ) in some cases, but the power radiated, which is related to the intensity, I think depends on the square of the electric field. Or maybe it's the intensity. Wait, let's get this straight.

Power per unit solid angle (intensity) for dipole radiation: I think the formula is something like I ∝ ( (d²q)/(dt²)^2 ) * (sin²θ) / r^2, but wait, actually, in the far field (radiation zone), the intensity is proportional to sin²θ. Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the radiation pattern for a dipole. The radiation is maximum in the equatorial plane, which is θ = 90 degrees. So the intensity should be highest there.

The intensity pattern for a dipole is usually given by I ∝ sin²θ. So the maximum occurs at θ=90 degrees, where sinθ is 1. So the
