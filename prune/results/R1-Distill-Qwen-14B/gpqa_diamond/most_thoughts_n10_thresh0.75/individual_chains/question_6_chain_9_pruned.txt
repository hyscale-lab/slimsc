Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r² cos²θ. Hmm, interesting. I remember that in quantum mechanics, when dealing with potentials, especially in two dimensions, sometimes it's helpful to go into polar coordinates because the problem might have some symmetry.

Wait, the potential here has two terms. The first term is (1/2)k r², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential. Because, I recall the harmonic oscillator potential is (1/2) m ω² x², but in polar coordinates, the radial part would be (1/2)k r², right? So that's the first part. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, that term seems to depend on the angle θ. So maybe the potential has some angular dependence, which could complicate things.

I think I remember that for potentials that can be expressed in terms of r² and r² cosθ, it might be separable into radial and angular parts. Wait, cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity. Because cos²θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2. So substituting that into the potential, V(r,θ) becomes (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let's compute that.

Wait, wait. Let me compute each term. The first term is (1/2)k r². The second term is (3/2)k r² multiplied by [ (1 + cos2θ) / 2 ] because cos²θ is (1 + cos2θ)/2. So that would make the second term (3/2)k r² * (1/2) (1 + cos2θ) ). Wait, no, wait: let's compute it step by step.

V(r,θ) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

Expressing cos²θ as (1 + cos2θ)/2, the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (1/2
