Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a particle of mass m moving in two dimensions under a potential V(r, θ) given by (1/2)kr² plus (3/2)kr² cos²θ. We're supposed to find the energy spectrum from the given options.

Hmm, okay. I remember that in quantum mechanics, especially in two-dimensional systems, the potential's form often suggests whether the problem can be separated into simpler parts. So maybe I need to see if this potential allows for separation of variables in the Schrödinger equation.

Let me think about the form of the potential. V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I can factor out kr²: so it becomes V(r,θ)= kr² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ]. Wait, that's kr² times [ (1 + 3 cos²θ)/2 ].

Wait, let's rearrange that. 1/2 is (1/2), and 3/2 cos²θ. So the potential is a function of r and θ, but perhaps it can be rewritten in a way that allows the Schrödinger equation to separate into radial and angular parts.

I remember that for a central potential (which depends only on r), the solution is straightforward because the problem is spherically symmetric. But here, the potential depends on θ as well, so it's not central. That complicates things because the symmetry is broken.

Wait, but maybe the potential can be expressed in terms of a function that's separable into r and θ terms. Let me see: V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Hmm, so each term is a product of terms in r and terms in θ.

Wait, let me factor out kr². So it's kr² [ (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ ]. So that's kr² multiplied by a function of θ. So the potential is not spherically symmetric, but it's still separable because it can be written as a product of functions each dependent on only r or θ.

Wait no, because each term in V(r,θ) is a product of r² and a function of θ. So perhaps the potential can be rewritten as a sum of terms that are products of functions of r and θ, allowing the separation of the Schrödinger equation.

Wait, but for the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates (r, θ in 2D), the equation is:

[- (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r ∂/∂r (r ∂ψ/∂r) ) - (ħ²/(2m r²)) ∂²ψ/∂θ² ] + V(r, θ) ψ = E ψ.

If the potential can be written as V(r) + W(θ), then the equation becomes separable. But in this case, V(r,θ) is r² times a function of θ. So I'm not sure if it's separable.

Wait, perhaps the potential can be rewritten as a function that is a sum of terms each of which is a product of r² and a function of θ. Let me see:

V(r, θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ = kr² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ ].

Hmm, maybe we can factor this in a way that allows for a product of functions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can make a substitution to simplify this.

Wait, another approach: in 2D polar coordinates, sometimes it's helpful to use a transformation to other coordinates if the potential has certain symmetries. For instance, if the potential depends on cosθ, it's symmetric under θ → -θ, but not rotationally symmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express the potential in terms of a shifted angle, or in terms of a new variable. Let me think, maybe an angular variable substitution.

Wait, another thought: the term with cos²θ can be expressed using double-angle identity. Cos²θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2. So substituting that in, V(r,θ) becomes:

(1/2
