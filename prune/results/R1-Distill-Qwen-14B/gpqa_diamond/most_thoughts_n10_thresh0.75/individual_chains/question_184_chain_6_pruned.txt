Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the synthesis of a specific compound: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. We're starting with benzene, and we need to choose the correct sequence of reactions from the given options A to D.

First, I'll try to draw the structure of the target molecule mentally. Benzene ring with substituents. Positions are numbered such that the tert-butyl is at position 2, ethoxy at 1, and nitro at 3. Wait, actually, benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent. So the substituents are in the ortho, para positions relative to each other. Wait, let's clarify:

Wait, numbering: the substituents are at positions 1, 2, 3 on the benzene ring. So it's 1-ethoxy, 2-t-Bu, and 3-nitro. So the substituents are at 1, 2, and 3â€”so they are meta to each other? Wait, no. Let me count: benzene is a ring where each substituent is adjacent to the others. So position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is t-Bu, and position 3 is nitro. So the substituents are each adjacent, meaning 1,2,3 are in a row. So the substituents are in the meta positions relative to each other? Hmm, not sure about the exact positions, but perhaps that's not as important as the order of reactions.

The target molecule has three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. So, we need
