Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the question is about binary star systems. There are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The period is the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. So, system_1's period is longer than system_2's.

Then there's spectroscopic observations. For system_1, the two stars show sinusoidal variations in radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. So, system_1's velocities are smaller compared to system_2's.

The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. We're to consider the mass of each system as the sum of the two stars' masses.

Hmm, I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity curves are related to the masses of the stars. The more massive star will have a smaller velocity because the center of mass is closer to it. So, the velocity amplitude is inversely proportional to the mass.

Wait, right, the formula I think is that the velocity amplitude (K) is given by ( (M_secondary / (M_primary + M_secondary) ) ) multiplied by the orbital velocity, but maybe more accurately, the velocities are inversely proportional to the masses.

Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula K = (v) * (M_secondary / (M_primary + M_secondary)), where v is the orbital velocity of the center of mass in the system. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Alternatively, the two stars orbit their common center of mass, so their velocities are in a ratio equal to the inverse of their mass ratio.

Let me think. The masses are inversely proportional to their velocities. So if one star is more massive, it moves slower. So if system_1 has stars with velocities 10 and 5 km/s, the mass ratio would be 5:10, which is 1:2. Wait, because the velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses. So if star A has velocity v1 and star B has v2, then M1/M2 = v2/v
