Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's try to unpack it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator A is represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay, which is given as c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right? And S has a specific form.

Wait, so S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row is (0, -i), the second is (i, 0). I remember that Pauli matrices have similar structures. Oh right, S looks like the Pauli Y matrix. Because the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is probably the Pauli matrix σy.

So Ay is c multiplied by σy. Since c is h/(4π), then Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy. Now, the problem is asking about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0. So let's compute that.

Ay is (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me write that matrix explicitly. So each element of σy is multiplied by c. So the elements are:

Ay = [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]]

Wait, because c is h/(4π), so when we compute the determinant, let's proceed.

The matrix Ay - a I would be:

[
[-a, -i c],
[i c, -a]
]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c). Let's compute that.

First term is a^2. Second term: (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c^2 = (i^2 is -1, so -i * i = -(-1) = 1) times c². So that's (i * -i) c² = 1 * c². So determinant is a^2 - (c²) * (i * -i) ?

Wait, wait, perhaps I should calculate it correctly. The determinant is (top left * bottom right) minus (top right * bottom left).

So (-a)(-a) = a².

Then, the other part is ( -i c ) * ( i c ) = (-i)(i) c². What's (-i)(i)? Let's compute: -i * i = -(i²) = -( -1 ) = 1. So that's 1 * c².

So the determinant is a² - (1 * c²) = 0.

So equation: a² - c² = 0 → a² = c² → a = ±c.

So the eigenvalues are a = +c and a = -c.

Wait, c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π).

Hmm, looking at the options, let's see what they say about the eigenvalues.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). Wait, but the eigenvalues for Ay are real? Because the matrix Ay is Hermitian? Wait, is it?

Wait, Ay is given as (h/(4π)) * S. S is the Pauli Y matrix. The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, right? Because σy† = σy. So Ay is c times a Hermitian matrix, so Ay is Hermitian. Therefore, its eigenvalues should be real. So any option that suggests eigenvalues with non-zero imaginary parts is incorrect.

So looking at the options, option A has eigenvalues with imaginary parts, so that's wrong. Option B also has imaginary parts, so that's wrong. So only options C and D are left.

Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm, since A is the angular momentum operator, the square of A (A²) commutes with all components, including Az and Ay. So the eigenfunctions of A² and Ay would be simultaneous eigenfunctions. So the eigenfunctions of Ay should also be eigenfunctions of A². But what about Az? Well, in quantum mechanics, the components of angular momentum don't commute, so the eigenfunctions of Ay and Az are not the same. So C's statement is correct: the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² (since A² commutes with Ay), but not of Az.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix Ay. Hmm, not sure what that exactly means. Basis functions for the matrix operator? The eigenvectors form a basis for the space, yes. But the statement is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps D is incorrect because the eigenfunctions are specific to Ay, not the basis functions of the operator. Or perhaps it's correct because the operator's eigenvectors form a basis. I'm not entirely certain, but let's think more.

So from the eigenvalue calculation, the eigenvalues are real and are ±h/(4π). So looking at the options, options A and B can be dismissed because their eigenvalues have imaginary parts.

So the correct statements must be between C and D.

So, for the problem, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

As I thought earlier, since A² commutes with Ay, they share eigenfunctions. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². However, since Ay and Az don't commute, they don't share eigenfunctions. So C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. The basis functions for a 2x2 matrix would be the standard basis vectors, like (1,0) and (0,1). But the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of Ay are specific vectors. For example, if the eigenvectors are |+> and |->, they form a basis. So maybe D is correct. But I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, the matrix Ay is 2x2, so it's in a two-dimensional Hilbert space. The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) would be two vectors that form a basis for the space. So D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That sounds correct. Because these eigenvectors could serve as a basis for the space the operator acts on.

But wait, the matrix Ay is a 2x2 matrix. The operator acts in a two-dimensional space. The eigenvectors would form a basis for that space, so D would be correct.

Wait, but I'm now a bit confused because both C and D seem plausible. Let me re-examine the options.

Let me see the problem statement again. It says during the calculation, which statement is correct.

Wait, perhaps we should also compute the eigenvectors. Let's do that.

Eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π).

Let's find eigenvectors for a = c, where c = h/(4π).

So Ay - a I = [[-c, -i c], [i c, -c]].

We can write the equations:

(-c) φ1 - i c φ2 = 0
i c φ1 - c φ2 = 0

Let me simplify. From the first equation: (-c) φ1 -i c φ2 = 0 → (-φ1 -i φ2) = 0 → φ1 = -i φ2.

So the eigenvector can be written as φ = [φ1; φ2] = [-i φ2; φ2].

So choosing φ2 = 1, the eigenvector is (-i, 1). Similarly, for a = -c, the equations would yield φ1 = i φ2, so the eigenvector is (i, 1).

So the eigenvectors are proportional to (-i, 1) and (i, 1).

So these are the eigenfunctions.

Now, looking at option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Well, the matrix operator is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. So D is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought C was correct. Now I'm not sure. Let me re-examine the options.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

A² is the square of the angular momentum, which is the Casimir operator. It commutes with all components, so any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². But for Az, since [Ay, Az] = iħ A... something. So they don't commute, so eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So C is correct.

So both options C and D are correct statements?

Wait, but I can't have both being correct in the options. Let me read the options more carefully.

Option C: The eigenfunction can be eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

Wait, maybe all the options are incorrect except one. Let me think again.

The eigenfunctions of Ay are specific vectors. For a 2x2 operator, the eigenvectors are the basis vectors of the space. So D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So yes, they form a basis. So D is correct.

But then, what about option C? C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct, but not of Az, which is also correct. So C is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct statements, but looking back at the options, I can only choose one.

Wait, let me look again at the options.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A². So that's correct, as I explained. But then, the second part says but not of the Z-component, Az. So that's also correct. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That is also correct, because for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors (eigenfunctions) form a basis.

Wait, but in the problem, the matrix is given, and the statement is about whether the eigenvectors are the basis functions of the matrix. I think that's correct. Because the basis functions are the standard basis vectors, but the eigenvectors can form another basis.

Wait, but in this case, the operator's matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvectors are two vectors that form a basis. So the matrix's basis is the standard basis. But the eigenvectors form another basis, perhaps.

So the statement in D is that the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator. I'm not entirely sure what that implies, but perhaps it's correct.

But going back to the options, the correct statements are C and D?

Wait, but the problem is a multiple-choice question, and only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that both C and D are correct. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem is about the operator Ay. The eigenvectors are φ, which are the basis functions for the matrix operator Ay. So if the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors are a basis for the 2D space. So D is correct.

But earlier, I thought C is correct as well. So why?

But the problem is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the question is about which statement is correct in general, during the process of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Let me consider each option:

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary parts. We found they are real, so A is wrong.

Option B: same issue, eigenvalues are real, so B is wrong.

Option C: eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct, and not of Az, which is correct. So C is correct.

Option D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. So for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

Wait, but the options can't both be correct. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, what about the fact that the eigenfunctions are the basis for the space, but the matrix's basis is a different thing. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps the matrix operator's basis refers to its own basis, like its own eigenvectors. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator. That might be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement in D is not correct. Because the basis functions of the matrix operator would refer to the standard basis vectors, but the eigenvectors could form another basis. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps D is making a different statement. It says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator Ay. So if Ay is represented in the eigenbasis, then the eigenvectors are the basis vectors. So in that case, yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator in that representation. So D is correct.

Wait, but in this case, the matrix is given in the standard basis. So the eigenvectors are not the standard basis vectors, so the basis functions of the operator would be the standard basis. So the statement D is incorrect because the eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors, not necessarily the basis functions of the operator. Unless you change the basis.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about what each option says.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Yes, because A² commutes with Ay, so any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². But Az doesn't commute, so eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az.

So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

Well, the basis functions (vectors) of the operator's space are the standard basis. But the eigenfunctions are specific vectors. So the eigenfunctions are not the same as the basis functions (unless the operator is diagonal in that basis). So D may not be correct.

Wait, but in the problem, the matrix operator is given in the standard basis. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are not the same as the standard basis vectors. So the statement in D is incorrect because the eigenfunctions are not the basis functions of the matrix operator (they form a different basis). The basis functions of the matrix operator are the standard basis vectors (e.g., [1;0] and [0;1]).

So D would be incorrect because the eigenfunctions are eigenvectors, not the standard basis.

Therefore, the correct statement is option C.


The problem involves the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), represented as a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix with the form:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The task is to determine which statement about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( A_y \) is correct.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( A_y \) is Hermitian because \( S \) is Hermitian, and \( c \) is a real constant. Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are real.
   - Solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \), the eigenvalues are found to be \( a = \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). Thus, the eigenvalues are real, and any option suggesting imaginary parts for the eigenvalues (e.g., options A and B) is incorrect.

2. **Option C:**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \).
   - \( A^2 \) is the square of the angular momentum operator and commutes with all components of angular momentum, including \( A_y \). Therefore, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \). This makes option C correct.

3. **Option D:**
   - The eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \).
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are specific vectors in the \( 2 \)-dimensional Hilbert space. While they form a basis for the space, they are not the standard basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \), which are typically the standard basis vectors \( (1, 0) \) and \( (0, 1) \). Thus, option D is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is option C, as the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \).
