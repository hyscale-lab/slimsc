Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy it provides to a nucleus. Hmm, the question is asking for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons. How many neutrons does it have normally? Oh, wait, the problem says it's Li with 3 neutrons, so that would make it Li-6 because Li normally has 3 protons and 3 neutrons (total mass number 6). So the nucleus is Li-6, which means it's a heavy ion with a certain mass.

Now, the key is to find the energy the RHIC imparts to this nucleus to make it move at 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, their kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² as it is in classical mechanics. Instead, we use the relativistic kinetic energy formula.

The relativistic kinetic energy (K) is given by:
K = (gamma - 1) * m0 * c²
where gamma is the Lorentz factor, m0 is the rest mass of the particle, and c is the speed of light.

Gamma is calculated as gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's plug that in.

Let me compute v²/c² first. v is 0.96c, so v² is (0.96)^2 c². So v²/c² is (0.96)^2.

Calculating 0.96 squared: 0.96 * 0.96. Let me do that. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So v²/c² = 0.9216.

Then, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

Now, take the square root of that: sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Hmm, wait, 0.28 times 3.5714 is about 1. So yes, gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but wait. Let me calculate it more accurately. 0.28 is 28/100 = 7/25. So 1/(7/25) is 25/7, which is approximately 3.57142857. So gamma is 25/7 or approximately 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy (m0 c²) for the Li-6 nucleus. Wait, what's the mass of Li-6? The atomic mass of lithium-6 is about 6.0141 grams per mole. Oh wait, but in kilograms, that's 6.0141e-3 kg/mol. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the molar mass is 6.0141 atomic mass units (u) per Li-6 atom. Because 1 u is approximately 1.660539e-27 kg. So for one Li-6 nucleus, the mass m0 is 6.0141 u * 1.660539e-27 kg/u.

Let me compute that. 6.0141 * 1.660539e-27.

First, 6 * 1.660539e-27 = 9.963234e-27 kg.
0.0141 * 1.660539e-27 = approximately (0.01 * 1.660539e-27) + (0.0041 * 1.660539e-27)
0.01 * 1.660539e-27 = 1.660539e-29 kg
0.0041 * 1.660539e-27 ≈ 6.808e-30 kg
Adding those together: 1.660539e-29 + 6.808e-30 = about 2.3413e-29 kg.

So total m0 is approximately 9.963234e-27 + 2.3413e-29 = 9.963234e-27 + 0.023413e-27 = (9.963234 + 0.023413) e-27 = 9.986647e-27 kg.

But wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately:

6.0141 * 1.660539e-27 = ?

Let me compute 6.0141 * 1.660539:

6 * 1.660539 = 9.963234
0.0141 * 1.660539 ≈ 0.023413.

So sum is 9.963234 + 0.023413 = 9.986647.

So m0 is 9.986647e-27 kg.

Wait, but wait, the exact value can vary based on precise mass data. But for this problem, perhaps we can approximate it as 6 u, which is 6 * 1.66e-27 kg = 9.96e-27 kg. But perhaps using 6.0141 u is better for accuracy.

But let me proceed with the exact value for better calculation.

So m0 c². Let me compute that. m0 is 9.986647e-27 kg, c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So m0 c² = 9.986647e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

Compute (3e8)^2: 9e16 m²/s².

So 9.986647e-27 kg * 9e16 m²/s² = 9.986647e-27 *9e16 = 9.986647 *9 * 1e-11.

9.986647 *9 = approximately 89.8798.

So 89.8798e-11 J. Wait, 1e-11 J is 10^-23 J.

Wait, but 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J, so let me convert Joules to eV.

m0 c² = 89.8798e-11 J = 89.8798e-11 / 1.60218e-19 eV.

Calculate 89.8798e-11 / 1.60218e-19 = (89.8798 / 1.60218) * 1e8.

89.8798 / 1.60218 ≈ 56.08.

So 56.08 * 1e8 eV = 5.608e9 eV = 5.608 GeV.

Wait, that can't be right because 1 u is about 0.9315 GeV/c², so 6 u would be approximately 5.589 GeV. Oh, yes, so that's consistent. So m0 c² is approximately 5.608 GeV.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation:

Each u is about 0.9315 GeV/c². So 6.0141 u is 6.0141 * 0.9315 ≈ ?

6 * 0.9315 = 5.589 GeV.

0.0141 * 0.9315 ≈ 0.0131 GeV.

So total is about 5.6021 GeV.

So m0 c² ≈ 5.6021 GeV.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated using kg and converted, I got 5.608 GeV. Hmm, slight discrepancy due to approximation. So I'll proceed with the more accurate 5.6021 GeV.

So now, the kinetic energy K is (gamma - 1) * m0 c².

We have gamma = 25/7 ≈3.5714.

So gamma minus 1 is 3.5714 -1 = 2.5714.

So K = 2.5714 * 5.6021 GeV.

Calculating that:

5.6021 * 2.5714.

Let me compute step by step.

5 * 2.5714 =12.857.

0.6021 *2.5714 ≈ 1.552.

So total is approximately 12.857 +1.552 =14.409 GeV.

Wait, that's the kinetic energy. So the total energy (kinetic plus rest) is gamma*m0 c², but the RHIC's energy would be the kinetic energy, I think. Or wait, sometimes colliders specify their energy as the kinetic energy, but sometimes as the total energy. Hmm, I need to be careful here.

Wait, the question says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)". From what I remember, in colliders, the energy usually refers to the kinetic energy provided to each ion, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, sometimes the total energy (gamma*m0 c²) is considered the energy. But let me think about the formula.

In particle physics, the energy given by the collider is usually the kinetic energy. Because the rest mass is the rest energy, and the kinetic part is what's provided by the collider.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the definition. The kinetic energy is (gamma-1) m0 c². The total energy is gamma m0 c². So if the question is about the energy imparted by RHIC, which is the kinetic energy, then our calculation is 14.409 GeV.

But looking at the options, let me see:

Options:
A) 18.475 GeV
B)23.069 GeV
C)20.132 GeV
D)21.419 GeV.

Hmm, my calculation gives about 14.4 GeV, which is not among the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the total energy (gamma * m0 c²), not the kinetic energy. Let me recalculate that.

Gamma is 25/7 ≈3.5714.

m0 c² is about 5.6021 GeV.

So gamma * m0 c² =3.5714 *5.6021 GeV.

3.5 *5.6021 ≈ 19.607 GeV.

0.0714 *5.6021 ≈ 0.399 GeV.

So total is approximately19.607 +0.399=20.006 GeV.

Which is about 20 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's close but not exact. Let me compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me re-calculate gamma.

v =0.96c.

v²/c² =0.96²=0.9216.

1 - v²/c²= 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28. So 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 3.57142857.

So gamma =3.57142857.

So gamma =25/7 ≈3.57142857.

So gamma * m0 c² =3.57142857 *5.6021 GeV.

Let me compute this accurately:

First, 3 *5.6021 =16.8063.

0.57142857 *5.6021 = ?

0.5 *5.6021=2.80105.

0.07142857 *5.6021 ≈0.4011.

So 2.80105 +0.4011=3.20215.

Total gamma*m0 c² is 16.8063 +3.20215=20.00845 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.008 GeV.

But the options for C is 20.132 GeV, which is slightly higher.

Hmm, perhaps my approximation of m0 c^2 is off. Let me recalculate m0 c^2 more accurately.

Li-6 has a mass of 6.0141 u.

1 u = 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.0141 u *931.5 MeV/c²/u = ?

6 * 931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.0141 *931.5 ≈13.13 MeV.

So total is 5602.13 MeV, which is 5.60213 GeV.

So m0 c² =5.60213 GeV.

So gamma * m0 c²= (25/7) *5.60213.

Compute 25/7=3.57142857.

3.57142857 *5.60213 =?

Let me compute 3 *5.60213=16.80639.

0.57142857 *5.60213.

0.5 *5.60213=2.801065.

0.07142857 *5.60213=?

0.07 *5.60213=0.3921491.

0.00142857 *5.60213≈0.00799.

So 0.3921491 +0.00799=0.400139.

Total for 0.57142857 *5.60213≈2.801065 +0.400139=3.201204.

So total gamma*m0 c²=16.80639 +3.201204=20.007594 GeV.

So approximately 20.0076 GeV. The options given are:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

So our calculation is about 20.0076 GeV, which is closest to option C (20.132 GeV), but why is there a discrepancy? Did I make a mistake in calculating gamma?

Wait, maybe I miscalculated gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v =0.96c.

v²= (0.96)^2 c² =0.9216 c².

So 1 - v²/c² =1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)= 0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more precisely without approximating sqrt(0.0784) as 0.28. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) accurately.

Wait, 0.28^2 is 0.0784, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So no, that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using m0 as the rest mass, but in reality, the mass might be different for a heavy ion. Wait, no. The rest mass is the same whether it's a nucleus or ion.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Let me recalculate the kinetic energy.

Kinetic energy K = (gamma -1)*m0 c².

gamma is 3.57142857.

gamma -1=2.57142857.

Multiply by m0 c²=5.60213 GeV.

So 2.57142857 *5.60213 = ?

2 *5.60213=11.20426.

0.57142857 *5.60213 = same as before, 3.201204.

So K=11.20426 +3.201204=14.40546 GeV.

But none of the options are close to 14.4 GeV. So this suggests that perhaps the question is asking for the total energy, which is about 20 GeV.

But in the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. My calculation gives 20.0076 GeV, which is about 20.008 GeV. Close to 20.01, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is higher than I thought. Let me double-check the exact mass.

The exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.0141 atomic mass units (u). So 6.0141 u.

Each u is 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So m0 =6.0141 *1.6605390666e-27 kg.

Let me compute that precisely.

6.0141 *1.6605390666e-27:

= (6 +0.0141) *1.6605390666e-27

=6*1.6605390666e-27 + 0.0141 *1.6605390666e-27.

6 *1.6605390666e-27 =9.9632343996e-27 kg.

0.0141 *1.6605390666e-27 = (0.01 *1.6605390666e-27 ) + (0.0041 *1.6605390666e-27 )

0.01 *1.6605390666e-27 =1.6605390666e-29 kg.

0.0041 *1.6605390666e-27 =6.708202e-30 kg.

Adding these together: 1.6605390666e-29 +6.708202e-30 = (1.6605390666 +0.6708202 )e-29 = 2.331359286e-29 kg.

So m0 =9.9632343996e-27 +2.331359286e-29 = 9.9632343996e-27 +0.02331359286e-27 = (9.9632343996 +0.02331359286 )e-27 =9.98654799246e-27 kg.

So m0 =9.98654799246e-27 kg.

Then, m0 c² =9.98654799246e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

(3e8)^2 =9e16 m²/s².

So m0 c² =9.98654799246e-27 *9e16 =8.987893193214e-10 J.

Convert Joules to eV:

1eV =1.602176634e-19 J.

So m0 c² =8.987893193214e-10 J /1.602176634e-19 J/eV.

= (8.987893193214e-10 ) / (1.602176634e-19 ) eV.

Calculate this division:

8.987893193214e-10 /1.602176634e-19 = (8.987893193214 /1.602176634 ) * 1e9.

Calculate 8.987893193214 /1.602176634 ≈5.60855.

So m0 c²=5.60855e9 eV =5.60855 GeV.

Wait, so m0 c² is about 5.60855 GeV. So earlier calculation correct.

So gamma is 3.57142857.

gamma * m0 c²=3.57142857 *5.60855 GeV.

Let me compute this.

3 *5.60855 =16.82565 GeV.

0.57142857 *5.60855.

0.5 *5.60855=2.804275.

0.07142857 *5.60855 ≈0.400.

So 2.804275 +0.400 =3.204275.

So total gamma * m0 c²=16.82565 +3.204275=20.0299 GeV.

Approximately 20.03 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma*m0 c² more precisely.

gamma=25/7=3.5714285714285714.

m0 c²=5.60855 GeV.

So 25/7 *5.60855 = ?

25 *5.60855 =140.21375.

140.21375 /7 =20.0305357 GeV.

So approximately 20.0305 GeV.

Wait, but option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 0.1 higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the mass.

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is not 6.0141 u. Wait, let me double-check the exact mass of Li-6.

The exact atomic weight of lithium-6 is about 6.014141 u.

So m0 =6.014141 u.

So m0 c² =6.014141 *931.5 MeV.

6 *931.5 =5589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

0.014141 *931.5 ≈13.16 MeV=0.01316 GeV.

Total m0 c²=5.589 +0.01316=5.60216 GeV.

Hmm, so m0 c² is 5.60216 GeV.

So gamma*m0 c²=3.57142857 *5.60216.

3 *5.60216=16.80648.

0.57142857 *5.60216 = ?

Let me compute 0.57142857 *5.60216.

5.60216 *0.5 =2.80108.

5.60216 *0.07142857 ≈0.400.

So 2.80108 +0.400=3.20108.

So total gamma*m0 c²=16.80648 +3.20108=20.00756 GeV.

Approximately 20.0076 GeV.

But the options don't have that exactly. Option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the charge state of the ion. Wait, the problem states X is Li with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6. But in the collider, ions are typically charged, so perhaps it's Li-6 with a charge. For example, Li+ would have a +1 charge, meaning it lost an electron. But the mass wouldn't change much, so perhaps that's not the issue.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the gamma. Let me compute gamma again.

v=0.96c.

gamma=1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 ) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Wait, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, 0.96^2 =0.9216.

1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28.

So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 *5.60216 GeV=?

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.60216.

3 *5.60216 =16.80648.

0.57142857 *5.60216.

0.5*5.60216=2.80108.

0.07142857 *5.60216=?

5.60216 *0.07=0.3921512.

5.60216 *0.00142857 ≈0.007999.

So 0.3921512 +0.007999≈0.40015.

So 2.80108 +0.40015=3.20123.

So 3.57142857 *5.60216 ≈16.80648 +3.20123=20.00771 GeV.

So about 20.0077 GeV.

The option closest is C)20.132 GeV, but that's higher by about 0.124 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the mass. Let me check another source.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is 0.96c, and I should use the exact formula for gamma.

Wait, perhaps the error is that I've used the speed as 0.96c, but perhaps I should have used v=0.96c in the relativistic formula without approximation.

Wait, but I did that. Gamma is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the kinetic energy in the lab frame, but I think that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nucleus is being accelerated to 0.96c, so the kinetic energy is as calculated, but the question is referring to the total energy. So 20.007 GeV is approximately 20 GeV. But the options don't have that except for option C at 20.132.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is precise, and the correct answer is option C, but I must have made a miscalculation in the mass.

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is 6.014142 u, which gives m0 c²=6.014142 *931.5 MeV.

Let me compute that accurately.

6.014142 *931.5 = ?

6 *931.5=5589.

0.014142 *931.5= 13.163 MeV.

So total is 5589 +13.163 =5602.163 MeV=5.602163 GeV.

So m0 c²=5.602163 GeV.

So gamma=25/7=3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 *5.602163 = ?

Let me compute this precisely:

3.57142857 *5.602163.

Let me compute 3 *5.602163=16.806489.

0.57142857 *5.602163.

Compute 0.5 *5.602163=2.8010815.

0.07142857 *5.602163.

Compute 5.602163 *0.07 =0.39215141.

5.602163 *0.00142857 ≈0.0079994.

So 0.39215141 +0.0079994=0.40015081.

So 0.5 *5.602163=2.8010815.

Adding 0.40015081 gives 3.20123231.

Total gamma*m0 c²=16.806489 +3.20123231=20.007721 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.0077 GeV.

But none of the options match this exactly. So perhaps the correct option is not here, but since option C is the closest, perhaps I made an error in considering the exact mass.

Wait, perhaps the nucleus is not Li-6 but Li-7? Because the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li has 3 protons. So Li-6 is 3 protons +3 neutrons. Oh wait, no, the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, wait. Let me clarify:

Wait, the problem states "X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons."

Wait, wait. Li normally has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that's a total mass number of 6. So yes, it's Li-6.

So I think I have to proceed with the calculations as before. So the energy is approximately 20.0077 GeV, which is about 20.008 GeV. The options given don't include this exact value, but option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher by about 0.124 GeV. Maybe I made a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately, without approximating sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

Wait, let's compute sqrt(0.0784) precisely. Let me compute 0.28^2=0.0784, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So no error there.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma with more decimal places.

Wait, let me compute 1/sqrt(0.0784) more accurately.

Wait, since 0.0784 is 784/10000, sqrt(784)=28, so sqrt(784/10000)=28/100=0.28.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.5714285714...

So no error there.

Hmm, perhaps the problem intended to use a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the speed is not 0.96c, but 0.96 times the speed of light, so my approach is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question refers to the kinetic energy, but perhaps m0 c² is calculated differently. Let me think: sometimes, in particle physics, the mass is the rest mass, but the energy might be given as the total energy (gamma m0 c²) rather than the kinetic energy.

But in our calculation, the total energy is about 20.008 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132 GeV), but not exactly.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the mass of Li-6. Let me check the exact value.

Looking up the exact mass of lithium-6: According to reliable sources, the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.014142 u. So m0 c²=6.014142 u *931.5 MeV/u = 6.014142 *931.5 MeV.

Calculating that:

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.014142 *931.5 MeV= approx 13.16 MeV.

So m0 c²=5589 +13.16=5602.16 MeV=5.60216 GeV.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a more precise value of c or perhaps the calculation is expecting higher precision. Let me compute gamma*m0 c² with higher precision.

gamma=3.5714285714285714...

m0 c²=5.60216 GeV.

So 3.5714285714285714 *5.60216 = ?

Let me compute:

3.5714285714285714 *5.60216.

Compute 3.5714285714285714 *5 =17.857142857142856.

3.5714285714285714 *0.60216 = ?

Compute 3.5714285714285714 *0.6 =2.1428571428571428.

3.5714285714285714 *0.00216= approx 0.007708333333333334.

So 0.6 gives 2.1428571428571428.

0.00216 gives 0.007708333333333334.

So 0.60216 gives 2.1428571428571428 +0.007708333333333334=2.150565476190476.

So total gamma*m0 c²=17.857142857142856 +2.150565476190476=20.00770833333333 GeV.

So approximately 20.0077 GeV.

Looking at the options again, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV, which is 0.124 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the energy is given per nucleon. No, the RHIC accelerates entire nuclei, not individual nucleons.

Another approach: perhaps the problem expects the use of the relativistic energy formula without considering the mass as accurately as I have. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses m0 as the mass in kg without converting to GeV correctly. Wait, no, I think I did that correctly.

Hmm, maybe I should check option C.

Option C is 20.132 GeV.

20.132 GeV minus 20.0077 GeV is about 0.1243 GeV.

Which is 124.3 MeV difference. That's significant. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy. Let me recompute.

Kinetic energy K = (gamma-1) m0 c².

Gamma=3.57142857.

Gamma-1=2.57142857.

2.57142857 *5.60216 GeV=?

2 *5.60216=11.20432.

0.57142857 *5.60216≈3.20123.

Total K=14.40555 GeV.

Which isn't close to any of the options.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is referring to the total energy (gamma * m0 c²) but I'm miscalculating the number.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the speed is 0.96c, but kinetic energy is in the lab frame, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approximation for gamma. Let me try using a more precise value of sqrt(1 -v²/c²).

Wait, computing gamma more accurately.

v=0.96c.

v²/c²=0.9216.

1-v²/c²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=3.57142857.

Wait, perhaps using more precise calculation with more decimal places could yield a slightly different result.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the formula:

K = ( (v/c)^2 ) / ( 2 * (1 - v/c) ) ) * m0 c².

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct formula is (gamma-1) m0 c².

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that gamma is calculated as (1/(1 -v/c))^(1/2), but perhaps I made a miscalculation in exponents somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is being considered as the mass of a single nucleon. No, the nucleus is Li-6, which is a collection of nucleons.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the non-relativistic kinetic energy formula, which would be (1/2) mv². Let me see what that would give.

But that would be highly incorrect for v=0.96c, but just to check:

m0=5.60216 GeV/c².

v=0.96c.

Non-relativistic K=0.5 *m0 c²*(v²/c²).

v²/c²=0.9216.

So K=0.5 *5.60216 *0.9216.

0.5 *5.60216=2.80108.

2.80108 *0.9216≈2.583 GeV.

Which is way below the options, so that's not it.

Hmm, I'm stuck. According to my calculations, the correct answer should be approximately 20.008 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of a slightly different gamma calculation. Let me think, perhaps using more precise computation without early rounding.

Compute gamma:

gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 )=1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So that's precise.

Hmm, perhaps the problem uses a different approximation for sqrt(0.0784). Wait, perhaps 0.28 is an approximation, and the actual value is slightly different.

Wait, let's compute sqrt(0.0784) precisely. Let's compute it as a decimal.

0.28^2=0.0784, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

So no error there.

Wait, perhaps the miscalculation is elsewhere. Let me recount all steps:

1. Identify nucleus: Li-6, mass 6.014142 u.

2. m0 c²=6.014142 u *931.5 MeV/u =5.60216 GeV.

3. v=0.96c → gamma=3.57142857.

4. Total energy=gamma * m0 c²=3.57142857 *5.60216=20.0077 GeV.

None of the options match exactly. So perhaps the intended answer is option D)21.419 GeV? No, that's higher.

Wait, perhaps the speed is 0.98c instead of 0.96c, but the question says 0.96. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated gamma.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem uses the formula E = gamma m0 c², and the question is correct, but the options have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but I must choose the closest one.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute with more precise numbers.

Wait, perhaps the exact value of gamma*m0 c² is 20.0077 GeV, which is not listed, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV, which is 0.1243 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I should consider whether the problem is using the rest mass of the proton plus neutrons, but that seems unlikely since the nucleus is treated as a whole.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy in the center-of-mass frame, but the question doesn't specify that.

Hmm, I'm not seeing another approach. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but my calculation yields approximately 20.008 GeV. The options don't have that, but perhaps with more precise calculations, it rounds to 20.008 GeV, which is closest to option C.

Wait, let me see the options again:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma with more precise numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator for sqrt(0.0784) more accurately.

Wait, sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

So no, that's correct.

Hmm.

Another idea: perhaps the problem uses the speed as 0.96c, but the kinetic energy is given, not the total energy. But as earlier calculations showed, the kinetic energy is about 14.4 GeV, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the total energy, which we've calculated as about 20.008 GeV. Since option C is 20.132 GeV, perhaps the intended answer is C, but I'm not sure why there's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma*m0 c² with more decimal precision.

gamma=3.5714285714285714.

m0 c²=5.60216 GeV.

Multiplying precisely:

3.5714285714285714 *5.60216.

Let me compute:

3.5714285714285714 *5.60216.

3 *5.60216 =16.80648.

0.5714285714285714 *5.60216.

Compute this as:

0.5714285714285714 *5 =2.857142857142857.

0.5714285714285714 *0.60216 =0.3443061224489796.

So total 2.857142857142857 +0.3443061224489796=3.201448979591836.

So 3.5714285714285714 *5.60216=16.80648 +3.201448979591836=20.0079289796 GeV.

So approximately 20.0079 GeV.

Hmm, still not matching any option. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but given the options, the closest is C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects the use of a different approach, such as considering the ion's charge. For example, the charge could influence the energy required. But I'm not sure how that would apply in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the total relativistic energy, which is what I have calculated, but I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the speed isn't 0.96c but 0.96 times the speed of light in a different unit system. No, that shouldn't matter because the formulas are unit-agnostic as long as you're consistent.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for an error in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using the exact formula without approximating. Let me try that.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

Compute (0.96)^2=0.9216.

1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

That's correct.

Hmm, another thought: perhaps the problem is referring to the energy in the center-of-mass frame, but I don't think that's the case because the question states the speed is 0.96c, implying the lab frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass in a different way, such as using the average mass of the nucleons. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I should use the reduced mass or something else, but I don't think that's applicable here.

In conclusion, based on my calculations, the correct energy is approximately 20.008 GeV, which isn't one of the options. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV, but I'm not sure why there's a discrepancy. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is C, given the options.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation for gamma*m0 c².

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the mass.

Let me compute m0 c² as 6.014142 u *931.5 MeV/u.

6.014142 *931.5 = ?

6 *931.5=5589.

0.014142 *931.5= 0.014142 *931.5= let's compute:

0.014142 *900=12.7278.

0.014142 *31.5=0.445203.

So total 12.7278 +0.445203=13.173 MeV.

So m0 c²=5589 +13.173=5602.173 MeV=5.602173 GeV.

Gamma=3.57142857.

3.57142857 *5.602173 = ?

3 *5.602173=16.806519.

0.57142857 *5.602173=?

0.5 *5.602173=2.8010865.

0.07142857 *5.602173=0.400151.

So 2.8010865 +0.400151=3.2012375.

Total gamma*m0 c²=16.806519 +3.2012375=20.007756 GeV.

Approximately 20.0078 GeV.

Which is 20.0078 GeV. So option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 0.1242 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the use of a different value for c or other constants. For example, perhaps using c=3e8 m/s or another approximation. Or perhaps using a different value for the atomic mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the exact formula for kinetic energy.

K = (gamma -1) * m0 c².

gamma=3.57142857.

K=2.57142857 *5.602173 GeV.

2.57142857 *5.602173.

2 *5.602173=11.204346.

0.57142857 *5.602173=3.2012375.

So K=11.204346 +3.2012375=14.4055835 GeV.

Which is again, not close to any options.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but my calculation doesn't support that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation.

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is not 6.014142 u, but a different value. Let me check a precise source.

Upon checking, the exact mass of Li-6 is indeed 6.014142 u. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the total energy in the center-of-mass frame, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the total energy as the sum of rest mass and kinetic energy, which is the same as gamma * m0 c².

Hmm. I'm not seeing another way. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but my calculation suggests it's approximately 20.008 GeV. Since that's not an option, perhaps I have to choose the closest one, which is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B)23.069 GeV, but that's much higher.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of gamma.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the speed as a fraction of c in a different way.

Wait, let me compute gamma as 1/sqrt(1 -v²/c²) with v=0.96c.

v² = (0.96)^2 c² =0.9216 c².

1 -v²/c² =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be in a certain unit or requires a different approach.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Based on the calculations, the correct energy is approximately 20.008 GeV, which is closest to option C)20.132 GeV, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass energy multiplied by gamma and then considering the charge. For example, if the ion is charged, perhaps the energy is higher. But that doesn't make sense because the charge doesn't affect the mass or the kinetic energy imparted.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon and then multiplying by the number of nucleons. But for a Li-6 nucleus, there are 6 nucleons (3 protons, 3 neutrons). So let me compute that.

Total energy per nucleon would be E_total /6.

But that would lower the energy, which doesn't match the options.

No, that can't be right because the entire nucleus is accelerated, not individual nucleons.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the total energy of the entire RHIC setup, but I think that's unlikely.

In conclusion, despite my best efforts, I can't reconcile the calculation with the options provided. However, based on the options given and the closest match to my calculation, I would select option C)20.132 GeV, but I'm not entirely confident.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) required to accelerate a lithium-6 nucleus (Li-6) to a speed of \( v = 0.96c \), we use relativistic energy principles. The total energy imparted to the nucleus is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where:
- \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( m_0 c^2 \) is the rest energy of the nucleus,
- \( v = 0.96c \) is the speed of the nucleus.

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \))
The speed \( v = 0.96c \) implies:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
\]

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28
\]

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the rest energy (\( m_0 c^2 \))
The mass of the Li-6 nucleus is \( 6.014142 \, u \), where \( 1 \, u = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Thus:

\[
m_0 c^2 = 6.014142 \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV} = 5602.173 \, \text{MeV} = 5.602173 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy (\( E \))
The total energy is:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.602173 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:
- \( 3 \times 5.602173 = 16.806519 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( 0.5714 \times 5.602173 \approx 3.201238 \, \text{GeV} \).

Adding these together:

\[
E = 16.806519 + 3.201238 = 20.007757 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated total energy is approximately \( 20.0078 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the provided options:
- \( \text{A) } 18.475 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( \text{B) } 23.069 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( \text{C) } 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( \text{D) } 21.419 \, \text{GeV} \),

the closest match is \( \text{C) } 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \). While the calculated value is slightly lower (\( 20.0078 \, \text{GeV} \)), it is the most reasonable choice given the options.

### Conclusion
The energy of the RHIC required to accelerate the Li-6 nucleus to \( 0.96c \) is closest to **20.132 GeV**.

Answer: C
