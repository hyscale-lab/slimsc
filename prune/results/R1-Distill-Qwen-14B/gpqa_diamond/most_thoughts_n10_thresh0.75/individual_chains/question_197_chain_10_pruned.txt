Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of compound X and then determine what it becomes after reacting with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

First, I'll look at the IR data to get some clues about the functional groups in compound X. The big peaks in IR are important. The range 3400â€“2500 cm-1 usually suggests the presence of either alcohols (O-H stretch) or amines (N-H stretch), but more likely, since it's a broad peak, it's an -OH group. Wait, but sometimes alkenes (C-H stretch) can show up in that region too, but usually they are lower. Then there's a strong peak at 1720 cm-1. That sounds like a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions are around the area for aromatic C=C stretching, so there's probably a benzene ring in there.

Looking at the NMR data next. The 1H NMR shows several signals. The first one is at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet, 1H. That's a characteristic of an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, another possibility is a carboxylic acid proton. Oh wait, carboxylic acids are usually broad around 10-12 ppm. But in this case, it's a singlet, which might not fit because the -COOH proton is usually a broad peak but could be a singlet. Alternatively, maybe an acidic proton like an enol or something else. But let's think about the other signals.

The 8.0 ppm doublet (2H) and 7.2 ppm doublet (2H) suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the protons are usually split into two doublets, each with two protons. So that fits. So the benzene ring is para-substituted.

Next, the 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) could be a CH adjacent to an electronegative group, like maybe a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) might be a CH2 group next to a carbonyl or something else. Then, 1.4 ppm as a doublet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to something, perhaps a CH2 group, like an isopropyl or a substituent with branching. The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is a classic methyl group attached to a CH2, like in an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, maybe the structure has a benzene ring with two substituents. One substituent is an ester or a carbonyl group, and the other is an ethyl or isopropyl group. Wait, but let's think about the IR.

The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. For carboxylic acids, that peak is usually a bit lower, maybe around 1700, but it
