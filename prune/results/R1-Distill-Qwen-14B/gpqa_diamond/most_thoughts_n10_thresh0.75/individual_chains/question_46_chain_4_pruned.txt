Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene.

Hmm, Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions, right? Oh wait, olefin metathesis is where the catalyst causes the breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds. Grubbs is good for ring-closing metathesis and also for cross metathesis. But in this case, since we have a mono-alkene, maybe it's a ring-closing situation?

Wait, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₂CH3? No wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene would be CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH2? No, wait, pent is five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But wait, when it's 3-methylpent-1-ene, the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2? Wait, let me think. The parent chain is five carbons, with a double bond starting at 1. So numbering from 1 to 5, the double bond is between 1 and 2. Then, the substituent is a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, that can't be right because that would make it 3-methylpent-1-ene as CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

Structure: CH₂=CH–CH(CH₂CH3)–CH2–? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me count again.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene: the parent chain is 5 carbons (pent), with a double bond from C1 to C2 (1-ene). The methyl group is on C3. So the structure is CH₂=CH–CH(CH3)–CH₂–CH3. Wait, no, that can't be because that would be six carbons. Wait, no, wait. Pent is five carbons, so 3-methylpent-1-ene must have
