Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a process used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I need to think carefully.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, that's the non-quantum version. It's the Maxwell equations and stuff. I don't think regularization applies here because regularization is a quantum field theory concept. In classical theories, you don't have the same issues with divergences because you're not dealing with the same mathematical structures as in quantum theories. So maybe D doesn't require regularization.

Option C is QED. I'm pretty sure QED requires regularization. Because when you calculate loop diagrams, like electron self-energy or photon vacuum polarization, you get divergent integrals. Regularization is a way to handle those infinities. So QED does need regularization.

Option B is QCD. QCD is the theory of the strong force. It also has problems with divergences, especially because of things like the Landau pole problem. Wait, no, Landau poles are more about the running of coupling constants. But in QCD, calculations can lead to divergences, so they must use regularization methods. But I think QCD is asymptotically
