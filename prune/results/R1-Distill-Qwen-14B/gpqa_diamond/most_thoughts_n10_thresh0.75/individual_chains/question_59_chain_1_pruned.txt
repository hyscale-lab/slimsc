Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, HCl, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should figure out the total amount of each substance after mixing. The volumes are given in milliliters, so I'll need to calculate the moles of each component because concentrations are molarities (moles per liter). 

Let me list out the given data:

1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH. Acetic acid is a weak acid.
2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl. That's a strong acid.
3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. That's a strong base.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

I think the first step is to calculate the moles for each solution.

Starting with CH3COOH. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.1 mol/L × 0.5 L = 0.05 mol.

Then HCl: 0.2 mol/L × 0.4 L = 0.08 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 mol/L × 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. But since each mole gives 2 OH-, the total OH- is 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 mol.

Now, when you mix acids and bases, the H+ from the acids will react with OH- from the base. So the net reaction would involve H+ and OH- neutralizing each other.

Wait, but wait: HCl is a strong acid, so it'll fully dissociate into H+ and Cl- ions. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely. But for the neutralization part, I think I should consider the H+ from both acids.

The H+ comes from both CH3COOH and HCl. HCl is strong, so it contributes 0.08 mol of H+. CH3COOH is weak, but for initial neutralization, I think I can consider all of its H+ as available because when mixed with a strong base, maybe it's deprotonated. Hmm, no, wait. Maybe not. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial neutralization between the H+ and OH- is more important, and then any excess H+ or OH- will determine the pH.

So, let's sum up the H+ and OH-.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.
Total H+ from CH3COOH: 0.05 mol. Wait, but wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully donate H+. So when calculating the initial neutralization, should I account for that?

Hmm, perhaps the approach is to consider all the H+ from the
