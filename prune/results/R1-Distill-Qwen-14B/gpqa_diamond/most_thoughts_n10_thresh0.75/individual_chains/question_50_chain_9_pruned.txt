Okay, so I've got this question about Feynman diagrams and loop calculations in quantum field theory. Hmm, I remember that the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the order of the process in perturbation theory. Each loop typically adds a factor of the coupling constant and also introduces some factors from integrals, like from the propagators.

The question gives me a formula: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. I need to figure out how many loops the diagram has based on this.

Wait, I think that the general form of the amplitude for a Feynman diagram involves terms like (coupling constants)^n * (loop integrals). Each loop contributes a factor of (4pi)^something and also introduces a 1/(16pi^2) factor from the loop integration in 4 dimensions (since the integral over loop momentum in 4D has a (4pi)^2 factor, and when you regularize, you might have factors like 1/(4pi)^epsilon in dimensional regularization, but I'm not entirely sure about that part).

The given expression has 1/(4pi)^6. Let's think about how many loops that would come from. For each loop, in 4 dimensions, the integral typically gives a factor of (4pi)^2 multiplied by some gamma functions or other terms, but when you have multiple loops, each loop adds another (4pi)^2. So for two loops, it would be (4pi)^4, and three loops (4pi)^6. Wait, but wait, wait. Let me think again. No, perhaps each loop contributes a (4pi)^2 in the denominator if we're using dimensional regularization. Because each loop integral in D dimensions would have 1/( (2pi)^D ) from the momentum integration, but for each loop, you have an integral that contributes a factor like 1/( (4pi)^2 ) times some other factors.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to remember that the general formula for the amplitude after loop integrals often includes (4pi)^{L} in the denominator, where L is the number of loops. Or is it the other way around? Because in the loop integral, each loop in 4 dimensions would contribute a factor of (4pi)^2. Wait, perhaps each loop contributes a factor of (4pi)^2 in
