Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which I think is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C, which I remember is standard conditions, so maybe activity coefficients are considered 1, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

The problem also gives the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. I think these are important because phosphate species depend on the pH of the solution, which is influenced by these KAs.

So, orthophosphate ion is PO4^3- right? But wait, H3PO4 can lose protons in steps. So, the species present would be H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, I believe.

But wait, the solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let's think about what these salts dissociate into.

KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So, each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate (with some water of crystallization). When it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So each mole of Na2HPO4 gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So the solution initially contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Now, phosphate ions can undergo hydrolysis. The question is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions. But wait, how much of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will convert to PO4^3-?

I think the solution is a buffer solution because it contains two adjacent phosphate species: H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The buffer resists pH changes, but in this case, we might need to calculate the pH first and then use it to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but the problem is about orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-. So, perhaps we can model the hydrolysis of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- into PO4^3-.

Wait, no. Let me think. The phosphate species in solution are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. Both can act as acids or bases.

H2PO4^-
