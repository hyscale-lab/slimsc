Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question says that two compounds, A and B, are treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. This treatment produces two different diketones. I need to find out which starting materials A and B are, based on the options given.

Hmm, I remember that when certain compounds react with HCl, NaNO2, and water, it's probably related to diazotization and then some kind of cyclization or substitution. Wait, that sounds like the formation of a carbocation or maybe a ring-forming reaction. Oh wait, I think the reaction here is the formation of a diketone, which involves the formation of a carbonyl group. 

Wait, the reagents are hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. Oh right, that's the HNO2/HCl conditions. That usually is involved in the production of nitrous acid, which can lead to diazotization of amines. Wait, but wait, in the context of carbonyl chemistry, I think there's another reaction. Oh right! The Stephen reduction maybe? Or maybe it's the formation of a gem-diol from a ketone? Wait, wait a second. Oh, wait, another thought: maybe it's the Beckmann rearrangement? No, that's for oximes. Or is it the formation of a carbonyl via some elimination?

Wait, perhaps it's about the formation of a diketone from a diol. Oh! Right! I remember that when 1,2-diols (vicinal diols) are treated with a strong acid like HCl, they can undergo a pinacol rearrangement. The pinacol rearrangement involves the dehydration of a 1,2-diol to form a carbonyl group. Wait, but wait, in the pinacol mechanism, the diol (pinacol) loses water to form a carbocation, which then rearranges to form a ketone or aldehyde. Oh wait, but in this case, the products are diketones. So that would imply that each starting material is a diol that rearranges into a diketone?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The products are diketones, which have two ketone groups. So each starting material must have two -OH groups in positions that, upon reaction, form two ketones.
