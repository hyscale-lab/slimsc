Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that a particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions under a potential V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²(θ). I need to find the energy spectrum, which means I have to determine the possible energy levels the particle can have.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when dealing with potentials, especially in two dimensions, it's helpful to separate the variables and see if the problem can be broken down into simpler parts. Often, potentials can be expressed in polar coordinates because the problem has spherical symmetry, or some variation of it.

Looking at the potential here: V(r,θ) has two terms. The first term is (1/2)kr², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential, but in two dimensions. The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²(theta). Wait, cos²(theta) can be expressed using a double-angle identity: cos²(theta) = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So substituting that in, the second term becomes (3/2)kr² * (1/2)(1 + cos(2θ)) = (3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos(2θ). So the entire potential V becomes:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos(2θ)
= [ (1/2) + (3/4) ] kr² + (3/4)kr² cos(2θ)
= (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos(2θ)

Wait, that's interesting. So the potential is split into a radial part and an angular part. The radial part is (5/4)kr², and the angular part is (3/4)kr² cos(2θ). Hmm, but wait, the angular part is actually part of the potential that depends on θ, which complicates things because it makes the potential not purely radial anymore.

Wait a minute, no. Wait, because the potential now has a term that varies with θ, meaning it's not spherically symmetric. That complicates the problem because the angular part can't be separated as simply as in a purely radial potential.

But wait, maybe I can separate this into radial and angular components in a way that allows for separation of variables in the Schrödinger equation. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the
