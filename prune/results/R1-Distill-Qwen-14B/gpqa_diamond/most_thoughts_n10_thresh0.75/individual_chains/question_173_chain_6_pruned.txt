Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons and uncertainty. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says an electron is moving along the x-direction with a speed v of 2*10^8 m/s. The uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I'm supposed to find the minimum uncertainty in the energy, ΔE. The options are A to D, all around 10^-16 to 10^-18 J.

Wait, right, this is related to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. I remember that the principle states that you can't precisely know both the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously. The more precisely you know one, the less precisely you can know the other.

The formula I think is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, no, actually, the exact form depends on the version. Some sources say Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2, others might use Δx Δp ≈ ħ/2 for an estimate. Since the question asks for the minimum uncertainty, I think we'll take Δp as ħ/(2Δx), or maybe just ħ/(Δx) for an approximate calculation.

But wait, the problem is about energy uncertainty. Oh right, the energy uncertainty is related to the momentum uncertainty through the relation ΔE ≈ Δp * v, if the velocity is roughly constant. Or wait, maybe it's more precise to use the relativistic relation, but for an electron moving at 2e8 m/s, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light (since speed of light is about 3e8 m/s), so v = 2/3 c. Hmm, that's getting into relativistic speeds, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here because the problem might be expecting a non-relativistic approach.

Wait, let me think again. The electron's speed is 2e8 m/s. Let me compute that in terms of c. c is about 3e8 m/s, so 2e8 is about 2/3 c. So maybe relativistic effects are not negligible, but the problem might want us to proceed with non-relativistic calculations. Because without more info, maybe we can just compute using the non-relativistic kinetic energy formula.

So, the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv²
