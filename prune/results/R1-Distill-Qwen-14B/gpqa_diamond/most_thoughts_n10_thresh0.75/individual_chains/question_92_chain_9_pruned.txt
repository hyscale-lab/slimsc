Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, the compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That's a mouthful. Let me try to break this down.

Wait, the question gives me some bond energies. Enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh right, atomization is breaking all bonds in an atom, so for carbon, that's the energy to turn it into gaseous atoms. Then there are bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H. Oh, right, bond energies are the energy required to break a bond in the gas phase.

So the problem is about the enthalpy of formation, which is the change when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. The formula for calculating enthalpy of formation using bond energies is to take the bond energies of the reactants (elements) and subtract the bond energies of the products (the compound). Or wait, maybe it's the reverse. Let me think: the enthalpy of formation is the energy released when bonds are formed. So, if I sum the bond energies of the bonds broken (reactants) and subtract the bond energies of the bonds formed (products), I get the enthalpy change.

Wait, no. The formula is: ΔH°f = Σ (Bond energies of reactants) - Σ (Bond energies of products). But wait, I think I have it backwards. Because when bonds are broken, you're adding energy, and when bonds are formed, you're releasing. So the correct equation is: Enthalpy of formation is the sum of the bond energies of the bonds broken (reactants) minus the sum of the bond energies of the bonds formed (products). So that would be ΔH°f = Σ(reactant bonds) − Σ(product bonds). If the result is positive, it's endothermic; if negative, exothermic.

Wait, no, wait. Another way to think about it: the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula:

ΔHf° = Σ [ (atoms in elements) ] - Σ [ (bonds in molecule) ]

Wait, no. Alternatively, for the molecule, the enthalpy of formation is calculated by considering the energy required to break all the bonds in the reactants (elements) and the energy released when forming the bonds in the product. So it's the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the sum of the bond energies of the product's bonds. Because you're taking the elements, breaking their bonds (which requires energy), and then forming the compound's bonds (which releases energy). So the overall enthalpy change is the sum of the reactant bond energies minus the product bond energies.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of a simpler example. Take H2 and O2 forming H2O. The bond energies are H-H: 100, O=O: 496. The product is H-O and O-H bonds. Each H2O molecule has two H-O bonds, each with bond energy, say, 460. So for one mole of H2O:

Reactants: 1 H2 (1 bond), 0.5 O2 (0.5 bonds). So sum reactant bonds: (1*100) + (0.5*496) = 100 + 248 = 348 kJ.

Products: 1 mole H2O has 2 H-O bonds. So sum product bonds: 2*460 = 920 kJ.

Wait, but wait, the reaction is H2 + ½ O2 → H2O. So, the bond energies of the reactants are H-H and O=O. The bonds in the product are H-O. So, the energy needed to break the reactant bonds is 348 kJ. The energy released when forming product bonds is 920 kJ. So the overall enthalpy change is 348 - 920 = -572 kJ. Which is the enthalpy of formation of H2O. But wait, H2O's enthalpy of formation is more than that. Hmm, maybe I'm using wrong numbers here. Oh well, perhaps the exact numbers aren't important for this thought process.

In any case, for the given problem, the compound is made of carbon and hydrogen. So the elements are H2 and C (graphite?), but wait, since the question gives the atomization enthalpy of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol, maybe that's the energy to turn solid carbon into gaseous atoms.

Wait, the formula for the enthalpy of formation using atomization and bond energies is:

ΔHf°(molecule) = [ (n_C × ΔH°atomization of C) + (n_H × (½ × bond energy of H-H)) ] − Σ (bond energies of all bonds in the molecule).

Wait, no. Let me think again. The general approach is:

ΔHf° = [ (sum of atomization energies of all atoms) ] − [ (sum of all bond energies in the molecule) ]

Wait, no. Because when you form a molecule, you're starting from elements in their standard states—so for carbon, it's likely graphite, and for hydrogen, it's H2 gas. So to form the compound, you first have to atomize all the carbon atoms and break the H-H bonds.

So the steps are:

1. Break all the bonds in the elements to get atoms. For carbon, each C atom comes from C(s) to gaseous C atoms, which requires 100
