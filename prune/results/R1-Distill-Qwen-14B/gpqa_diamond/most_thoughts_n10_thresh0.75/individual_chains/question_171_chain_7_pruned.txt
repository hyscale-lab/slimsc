Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions. Hmm, I need to figure out the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer for six different benzene derivatives. Let's see. 

The substances are numbered 1 to 6, and each undergoes an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. Only one monobromo derivative is formed. The question is about the para-isomer's yield. I remember that in such reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring direct the incoming electrophile either ortho/para or meta, based on their nature.

So, each substituent affects the position where the bromine adds. For example, activating groups like -NH2 (but that's not here), -OH, -OCH3, etc., are strong activating and ortho/para directors. Deactivating groups are meta directors. 

Wait, the substituents here are: 

1) CH3 (methyl) — an activating group because it's an alkyl group. So, it's an o/p director.
2) COOEt (ester group) — the carbonyl makes it a deactivating, meta-directing group. Because esters are electron-withdrawing, right? So meta.
3) Cl — chlorine is a bit tricky. It's slightly deactivating due to the electronegativity, but it's ortho/para directing because of the lone pairs. So it's a meta director only? Wait no, wait. Chlorine is deactivating because it's more electronegative than carbon, but the lone pairs can donate electrons through resonance. Wait, no, wait. The inductive effect is stronger. So Cl is deactivating, but since it has lone pairs, it's ortho/para director. So Cl directs to o/p, but is deactivating.
4) NO2 (nitro group) — that's a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So the ring is deactivated, and the substituent directs incoming electrophiles to the meta position.
5) C2H5 (ethyl) — similar to methyl. An activating, o/p director.
6) COOH (carboxylic acid) — that's a strong deactivating group. The -COOH is electron-withdrawing. So it's a meta director.

Wait, so the substituents and their directing effects:

1. CH3: activating, o/p
2. COOEt: deactivating, meta
3. Cl: deactivating but o/p (but wait, isn't Cl a strong o/p director despite being deactivating? Because its lone pairs can participate in resonance, but inductive effect is stronger so overall deactivating. So it's o/p directing.
4. NO2: deactivating, meta
5. C2H5: activating, o/p
6. COOH: deactivating, meta

Wait, but wait, for substituent 3, Cl is an ortho-para director but deactivating. So when bromine is added, where will it go? 

Now, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, the proportion of the para product. The more the substituent directs to para, the higher the percentage of para isomer.

But wait, in some cases, steric hindrance might play a role. For example, if the substituent is bulky, the para position might be less accessible than the ortho. Or maybe not, since the substituent is on the ring, and the incoming electrophile adds to the ring.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer in the product. So, if a substituent is a meta director, the para product won't form much. Because the incoming Br goes meta to the substituent.

Wait, but let me think: for each substituent, where will the Br add?

Let me list each:

1) CH3: activates, so the ring is more reactive. The Br will come in ortho, para. But wait, the substituent is CH3, which is an activating group, so the ring is reactive. So when Br adds, it'll
