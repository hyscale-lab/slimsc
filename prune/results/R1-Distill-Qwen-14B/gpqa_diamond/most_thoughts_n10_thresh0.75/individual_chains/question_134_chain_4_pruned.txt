Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the problem says we're mixing 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water. The enthalpy change for these reactions is usually exothermic, so the enthalpy should be negative.

Wait, but how do I approach this when there are three different solutions? I think I need to figure out the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base. Then, determine which one is the limiting reagent because that will dictate how much reaction occurs.

Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's find the moles of H+ from each acid.

Starting with HCl: HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+. The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. So moles of HCl = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 mol.

Next, H2SO4: Sulfuric acid is a strong acid but it's diprotic, so each mole gives 2 moles of H+. The volume is 300 mL, which is 0.3 L. Molarity is 0.3 M. Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. Since each H2SO4 gives 2 H+, the H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

So total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Now, the base is Ba(OH)2. Barium hydroxide is a strong base; each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. The volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Molarity is 0.5 M. So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so moles of OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol.

Wait, neutralization is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the reaction is between H+ and OH-.

But wait, I should consider the total H+ and total OH-.

Total H+ is 0.28 mol, OH- is 0.2 mol.

So which is the limiting reactant? H+ is more than OH-, so OH- will run out first. So all 0.2 mol of OH- will react, and some H+ will remain.

The reaction is:

H+ + OH- → H2O

The enthalpy change for this reaction is usually given as the enthalpy of neutralization. For strong acids and bases, it's often around -57 kJ per mole of H2O formed. Wait, but sometimes it's given per mole of H+ neutralized. Let me think: the standard enthalpy of neutralization (ΔHn) is usually the enthalpy change when one mole of water is formed from the neutralization of an acid by a base. So for each mole of H+ and OH- reacting, it's about -57 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait, I think the value is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ neutralized. Because, for example, when 1 mole of HCl reacts with 1 mole of NaOH, it produces 1
