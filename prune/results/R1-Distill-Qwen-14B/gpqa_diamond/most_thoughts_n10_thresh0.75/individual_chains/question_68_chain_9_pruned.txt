Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin 1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, spin 1/2 particles... I remember they can be electrons or something similar. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment after the magnetic field changes direction.

Let me try to visualize what's happening. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction. The particle's magnetic moment, mu, is gamma times S_z, and it's aligned with the field. So the particle is in a state where its spin is along the same direction as the magnetic field. I think in this case, the energy levels are quantized. For spin 1/2, the possible S_z values are ± ħ/2. But since the field is along Z, the energy depends on S_z.

Then, the magnetic field is suddenly turned off. Oh, wait, so the field is zero for a moment. But then another one is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. So the field changes direction from Z to Y, but same strength. Now, the particle's magnetic moment is subject to this new field. 

The question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillating. So initially, when the field was along Z, the z-component of the moment was static because the system was in an eigenstate of S_z. But when the field changes to Y, the direction of the magnetic field changes, so the Hamiltonian changes.

Wait, the Hamiltonian when the field is applied along a direction is proportional to the magnetic moment in that direction. So the initial Hamiltonian before the field change is H_initial = -γ B S_z (maybe with some constants, but the key is proportional to S_z). After the field is turned off and turned on along Y, the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -γ B S_y. 

But wait, the problem says the magnetic moment is mu = γ S_z. Hmm, so mu is proportional to S_z. But when the field changes direction, the magnetic moment will start precessing about the new field direction. So the time evolution of the spin state will cause the expectation value of S_z to oscillate.

The scenario is similar to the problem when a spin is in a magnetic field that suddenly changes direction. The system will precess around the new field direction, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

So, the particle was initially in an eigenstate of S_z (since the field was along Z). After the field changes to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y. Because eigenstates of S_z are not eigenstates of S_y, the state will evolve in time, leading to oscillations in observables.

The key is to find the frequency of these oscillations. For a spin-½ particle, the energy levels when the field is along Y would be at ±(γ B ħ/2) (since S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2; wait, no, S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2 multiplied by something? Wait, the eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2, I think. Because S is in units of ħ. So S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the energy difference between the two states is 2*(γ B ħ/2) = γ B ħ. )

Wait, the energy levels for a spin in a magnetic field along Y would be E = -γ B S_y. So for each spin state, E = ± γ B (ħ/2), right? Because S_y for spin up along Y is +ħ/2, and spin down is -ħ/2. So the energies are E_+ = + (γ B ħ/2), E_- = - (γ B ħ/2). The energy difference ΔE is E_+ - E_- = γ B ħ.

The frequency of oscillation in expectation values comes from the energy difference between states, because the time evolution is governed by e^(-i E t / ħ). So the transition frequency between the two states would be ω = ΔE / ħ = (γ B ħ) / ħ = γ B. But wait, that's the frequency of transitions between the states. But wait, the oscillation in the expectation value of S_z would be governed by the time dependence of the state, which involves terms like e^{-i ω t}, leading to oscillations at frequency ω.

So the oscillation frequency of the expectation value of S_z should be (ΔE) / ħ = γ B. But wait, I'm not so sure. Let me think again. Because the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z, which is not the same as an eigenstate of S_y. So the state after the field change will evolve over time, leading to a time-dependent expectation value for S_z.

The energy levels are E_+ and E_-, so the time evolution of the state will involve terms with these energies. The oscillation frequency between the two states would be (E_+ - E_-) / ħ, which is (γ B ħ) / ħ = γ B. So the frequency should be γ B. But wait, another angle: the Larmor frequency.

Wait, when the magnetic field is along Y, the precession frequency is given by the Larmor frequency. The Larmor frequency is ω = γ B. Because the precession is around the magnetic field direction, which is Y in this case. So the component of the spin in the direction perpendicular to the field (like Z) would oscillate with this frequency.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because Larmor frequency is generally omega = γ B. So maybe the frequency of oscillation of the z-component is omega = gamma B. So looking at the options, option B is gamma*B, option A is half that.

Wait, but another way. Let me think about the time evolution. The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z. After the field is turned on along Y, the state is a superposition of the eigenstates of S_y. The time evolution under the Hamiltonian H = -γ B S_y (or maybe it's positive, I might have gotten the sign wrong, but it's proportional to S_y).

Wait, the exact form of the Hamiltonian is H = mu · B, and mu is given as gamma S_z. Oh wait, no. Wait, the magnetic moment of the particle is mu = gamma S, perhaps? Or maybe mu is in the direction of the spin. Wait, in the problem statement: mu = gamma S_z. So the magnetic moment is aligned along the Z-direction when the
