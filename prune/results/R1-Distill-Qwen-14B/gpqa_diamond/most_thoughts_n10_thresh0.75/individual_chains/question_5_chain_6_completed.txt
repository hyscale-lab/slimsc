Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the problem is about.

The question is asking about calculating the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue corresponding to this eigenvector is +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like this often relate to angular momentum. And since the eigenvalue is ħ/2, that makes me think of spin-1/2 particles, like electrons or muons.

The operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So P is a vector operator, and the components are 2x2 matrices. I think the operator P is actually the spin operator for a spin-½ particle, which would be ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices. Let me recall the Pauli matrices: σ_x has elements [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y has [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So yeah, that matches the given components for P_x, P_y, and P_z. So P is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices, meaning P = (ħ/2) σ, where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices.

The direction n is arbitrary but in the x-z plane. So n can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) or maybe another parametrization. Wait, wait, in spherical coordinates, any direction in the x-z plane would have φ=0, so maybe it's better to say that direction n lies in the x-z plane, so its angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and φ=0. So the direction n is along (x and z), so the unit vector can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that.

But the question is about the eigenvector of the operator P along this direction n. So the operator in the direction of n would be P·n, right? Because for a vector operator, the component along a direction is the dot product with the unit vector in that direction. So the operator we're interested in is (P·n), and we want its eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, but wait: the eigenvalue of the operator P·n is ±ħ/2. Since the eigenvalue here is +ħ/2, we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the spin-up state along direction n.

So the first thing I need to do is construct the matrix for P·n. Since P is the spin operator, P·n = (ħ/2)( σ·n ). So σ·n is the sum of the Pauli matrices multiplied by the components of n. Let's denote n as (n_x, 0, n_z), since it's in the x-z plane. Wait, no: wait, the direction is in x-z, so n has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), I think. Because when θ=0, it's along +z, and θ=π/2, it's along +x. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, and n_y=0.

So, P·n would be (ħ/2)( σ_x n_x + σ_z n_z ). Since n_y is zero, the σ_y term doesn't contribute.

Now, writing that out: σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So,

P·n = (ħ/2) [ n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Which simplifies to:

= (ħ/2) [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

Because the (1,1) element is n_z * 1, (1,2) is n_x * 1, (2,1) is n_x * 1, and (2,2) is -n_z * 1.

Wait, because:

n_x * σ_x gives:
n_x * [ [0,1], [1,0] ]
Which is:
[ [0, n_x], [n_x, 0] ]

n_z * σ_z gives:
n_z * [ [1, 0], [0, -1] ]
Which is:
[ [n_z, 0], [0, -n_z] ]

So adding these together:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Then multiply by ħ/2.

So the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

So that's our operator. Now we need to find its eigenvector for the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

So, let's write the matrix equation:

( (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] ) * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Wait, no: the right side is (eigenvalue) times vector, which is (ħ/2) times [a; b]. So the equation becomes:

(ħ/2) [n_z a + n_x b, n_x a - n_z b]^T = (ħ/2) [a; b]

We can multiply both sides by 2/ħ to eliminate the ħ/2 factor, so we get:

[ n_z a + n_x b, n_x a - n_z b ]^T = [a; b]

Which gives two equations:

1. n_z a + n_x b = a
2. n_x a - n_z b = b

Simplify equation 1:

n_z a + n_x b = a → (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0 → [ (n_z - 1) , n_x ] · [a; b] = 0

Similarly, equation 2:

n_x a - n_z b = b → n_x a - (n_z + 1) b = 0 → [n_x, -(n_z + 1) ] · [a; b] = 0

So the system is:

(n_z -1 ) a + n_x b =0

n_x a - (n_z +1) b =0

We can write this as a matrix equation:

[ (n_z -1 )   n_x          ] [a]   = 0
[   n_x       -(n_z +1)     ] [b]

For a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero. Let's compute the determinant:

Determinant D = (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) - (n_x)^2

= [ (-n_z^2 -n_z + n_z +1) ] - n_x^2

Wait, let's compute it step by step.

(n_z -1)(-n_z -1) = (n_z -1)(-n_z -1)
Multiply term by term:

= n_z*(-n_z) + n_z*(-1) -1*(-n_z) -1*(-1)
= -n_z^2 -n_z + n_z +1
Simplify: -n_z^2 +0*n_z +1

So D = (-n_z^2 +1) - (n_x)^2

But since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. So n_x^2 = 1 - n_z^2.

Substituting into D:

D = (-n_z^2 +1) - (1 - n_z^2) = -n_z^2 +1 -1 +n_z^2 = 0.

So the determinant is zero, which makes sense because the eigenvalues are correct.

Now, to find the eigenvector, we can solve one of the equations. Let's take the first equation:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b =0 → a = [ (1 - n_z) / n_x ] b  (if n_x ≠0 )

But wait, if n_x is zero, that would mean n is along the z-axis, but the problem says n is in the x-z plane, so n_x can be zero. Hmm, but let's proceed assuming n_x is not zero for now.

So, a = (1 - n_z) /n_x * b

Now, the eigenvector can be written as [a; b] = b [ (1 - n_z)/n_x ; 1 ]

We can factor out b, so the eigenvector is proportional to [ (1 - n_z)/n_x , 1 ].

But to make it a normalized vector, we need to compute the normalization factor.

The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

Let me compute the magnitude squared:

|a|^2 + |b|^2 = | (1-n_z)/n_x * b |^2 + |b|^2 = b^2 [ (1-n_z)^2 / n_x^2 + 1 ]

But since the direction is arbitrary, perhaps we can express this in terms of angles θ and φ, but since n is in the x-z plane, φ is zero, so θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So, n_z = cosθ, n_x = sinθ.

Wait, wait: if θ is the angle from the z-axis, then n_z = cosθ, and n_x = sinθ (since in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle φ is zero). So substituting n_z = cosθ, n_x = sinθ.

So, the eigenvector components become:

a = (1 - cosθ) / sinθ * b

So, [a; b] = [ (1 - cosθ)/sinθ , 1 ] * b

The normalization factor squared is:

a^2 + b^2 = [ (1 - cosθ)^2 / sin^2θ + 1 ] * |b|^2.

Compute (1 - cosθ)^2 + sin^2θ:

(1 - 2 cosθ + cos²θ ) + sin²θ = 1 - 2 cosθ + (cos²θ + sin²θ) ) = 2(1 - cosθ )

Wait, let me compute it correctly:

(1 - cosθ)^2 / sin^2θ + 1 = [ (1 - 2 cosθ + cos²θ ) + sin²θ ] / sin^2θ

= [1 -2 cosθ + (cos²θ + sin²θ) ] / sin^2θ

= [1 -2 cosθ +1 ] / sin^2θ

= (2 - 2 cosθ ) / sin^2θ = 2(1 - cosθ) / sin^2θ.

But 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So:

2(2 sin²(θ/2)) / [ (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2))^2 ]

Wait, let me compute the denominator: sin^2θ = [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)]^2 = 4 sin²(θ/2) cos²(θ/2).

So the numerator is 2*(2 sin²(θ/2)) ) = 4 sin²(θ/2).

So the whole expression is [4 sin²(θ/2)] / [4 sin²(θ/2) cos²(θ/2) ) ].

Which simplifies to 1/(cos²(θ/2)).

So the normalization factor squared is 1/(cos²(θ/2)).

Thus, |b|^2 * [1/(cos²(θ/2))] =1 → |b| = cos(θ/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ (1 - cosθ)/sinθ * cos(θ/2) , cos(θ/2) ]

Wait, let's substitute (1 - cosθ) = 2 sin²(θ/2) and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So (1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) ] = sin(θ/2) / cos(θ/2) = tan(θ/2).

So a = tan(θ/2) * cos(θ/2) = sin(θ/2), because tan is sin/cos, so tan(θ/2) * cos(θ/2) = sin(θ/2).

So the components are a = sin(θ/2), b = cos(θ/2).

Wait, let me check:

a = (1 - cosθ)/ sinθ * cos(θ/2)

(1 - cosθ) = 2 sin²(θ/2)
sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

So (1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] ) = [ sin(θ/2) ] / [ cos(θ/2) ] = tan(θ/2).

So a = tan(θ/2) * cos(θ/2) = [sin(θ/2)/cos(θ/2)] * cos(θ/2) = sin(θ/2).

And b is cos(θ/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ sin(θ/2), cos(θ/2) ].

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, the eigenvector equation was: (P·n)|ψ> = (+ħ/2)|ψ>.

But in our calculation, we have [a, b] = [ sin(θ/2), cos(θ/2) ].

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, in the spin-1/2 system, the eigenstates for spin up along a direction (θ, φ) are given by the spinor [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ]^T. But in our case, since n lies in the x-z plane, φ=0, so the spinor becomes [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T. But wait, that's not matching what I found earlier.

Wait, in my calculation above, I found that the eigenvector is [ sin(θ/2), cos(θ/2) ].

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the normalization factor. Let me go back.

Wait, earlier when I computed the normalization condition, I had:

a = (1 - cosθ)/ sinθ * b.

So a = [ (1 - cosθ)/ sinθ ] b.

Then the normalization is |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1 → [ (1 - cosθ)^2 / sin^2θ ] |b|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

Factor out |b|^2: [ (1 - cosθ)^2 + sin^2θ ] / sin^2θ * |b|^2 =1.

Compute numerator: (1 - cosθ)^2 + sin^2θ = 1 - 2 cosθ + cos^2θ + sin^2θ = 2(1 - cosθ).

So [2(1 - cosθ) ] / sin^2θ * |b|^2 =1 → |b|^2 = (sin^2θ) / [ 2(1 - cosθ) ) ].

Simplify denominator: 2(1 - cosθ) = 4 sin²(θ/2).

And sin^2θ = 4 sin²(θ/2) cos²(θ/2).

So |b|^2 = [4 sin²(θ/2) cos²(θ/2)] / [4 sin²(θ/2) ] ) = cos²(θ/2).

Thus, |b|= cos(θ/2), and a = [ (1 - cosθ)/sinθ ] * cos(θ/2).

Substituting 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ= 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2):

(1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] = sin(θ/2) / cos(θ/2) = tan(θ/2).

So a = tan(θ/2) * cos(θ/2) = sin(θ/2).

So the components are a = sin(θ/2), b = cos(θ/2).

So the eigenvector is [ sin(θ/2), cos(θ/2) ].

Wait, but wait, that seems to be the opposite of what the standard spin-up state is. Because the standard spin-up along (θ, 0) is [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ] which, for φ=0, is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Hmm, so in our case, the eigenvector came out as [ sin(θ/2), cos(θ/2) ].

But that's opposite of the standard. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake when writing the eigenvector as [a; b] = [ (1 - n_z)/n_x * b; b ].

Wait, for the direction n = (n_x, 0, n_z), with n_x = sinθ and n_z=cosθ.

So (1 - n_z) = 1 - cosθ, which is 2 sin²(θ/2).

n_x is sinθ, which is 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So (1 - n_z)/n_x = [2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) ] = [ sin(θ/2) ] / [ cos(θ/2) ] = tan(θ/2).

So a = tan(θ/2) * b.

So the vector is [ a; b ] = [ tan(θ/2) b, b ] = b [ tan(θ/2), 1 ].

Now, when normalizing, the vector is [ tan(θ/2) b, b ].

The normalization is |a|² + |b|² = |b|² [ tan²(θ/2) +1 ] = |b|² ( sec²(θ/2) ) ) =1.

So |b| = cos(θ/2).

Thus, a = tan(θ/2) * cos(θ/2 ) = sin(θ/2).

So the vector becomes [ sin(θ/2), cos(θ/2) ].

Wait, but the standard spin-up is [cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ].

So why the discrepancy? Am I getting the opposite? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the direction. Because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, but perhaps the way I wrote the matrix for P·n has the eigenvalue associated with the state.

Wait, perhaps the standard spin-up in the z-direction is [1,0], which would correspond to n along z. Let's see what the solution gives in that case.

If n is along z, then θ=0, so θ/2=0, so the eigenvector would be [0,1].

But wait, the spin-up along z is [1,0], not [0,1]. So this suggests that something is wrong with my calculation.

Ah, maybe I made a sign error. Let me re-examine the equations.

When I wrote the eigenvector equation, perhaps the eigenvalue was +ħ/2, but the matrix for P·n is (ħ/2) times [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the earlier steps.

The eigenvalue equation is ( (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] ) * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Wait, that's not correct. Because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so the equation is:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

So when I factor out ħ/2, I get:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] [a; b] = [a; b]

Which gives the two equations:

n_z a + n_x b = a → (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0

n_x a - n_z b = b → n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0

So in the case where n is along z, n_x=0, n_z=1.

Then the equations become:

(1-1)a +0*b=0 → 0=0.

0*a - (1+1) b =0 → -2b=0 → b=0.

So the eigenvector is [a; 0], which when normalized is [1;0], which is correct for spin-up along z.

But according to my earlier solution, when θ=0, the eigenvector I found is [ sin(0/2), cos(0/2) ] = [0, 1], which is not the correct spin-up direction. So there's a mistake.

Hmm. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution of n_z and n_x in terms of θ. Because when n is along z, θ=0, so n_z=1, but n_x =0.

Wait, then when I compute the eigenvector, I get for θ=0, the eigenvector [ sin(0/2), cos(0/2) ] = [0, 1], which is the spin-down state, not up.

So that's a problem. It means my earlier calculation might have an error.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the vector. Because the Pauli matrices have a specific orientation. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the eigenvalue as positive and negative and chosen the correct eigenvector.

Wait, another approach: for the spin operator in direction n, the eigenstates are |+> and |-> with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

The eigenvectors can be written in terms of the angles θ and φ as:

|+> = [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ]^T

|-> = [ -i sin(θ/2), cos(θ/2) ]^T

But in our case, since φ=0 because n is in the x-z plane (so in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle φ is zero), the |+> state becomes [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T.

Wait, so in that case, if I have n along z (θ=0), then |+> is [1,0], which is correct.

But according to my earlier solution, the eigenvector was [ sinθ/2, cosθ/2 ].

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when solving the equations.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the eigenvalue as +ħ/2 and chose the appropriate eigenvector.

Wait, let's try another approach. The eigenstates of σ·n are known to be |+> and |-> as I wrote above.

So for P·n, the eigenvectors are the same as for σ·n, scaled by ħ/2.

So for eigenvalue +ħ/2, the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ].

In our case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, φ=0, so the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Which is the standard result.

So in our problem, the normalized eigenvector should be [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but earlier my calculation gave [ sin(θ/2), cos(θ/2) ], which would have the opposite components.

So I must have made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-do the calculation.

Rewriting the equations:

The matrix is (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

So the eigenvalue equation is:

( (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] ) [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Dividing both sides by (ħ/2):

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] [a; b] = [a; b]

Which gives:

n_z a + n_x b = a → (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0.

n_x a - n_z b = b → n_x a - (n_z +1) b =0.

So the system is:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b =0 ...(1)

n_x a - (n_z +1) b =0 ...(2)

Let me try to express equation (1) as a = [ (1 - n_z) / n_x ] b.

Substituting into equation (2):

n_x [ (1 - n_z)/n_x b ] - (n_z +1) b =0 → (1 - n_z) b - (n_z +1) b =0.

Simplify:

[ (1 -n_z ) - (n_z +1) ] b =0 → (1 -n_z -n_z -1 ) b =0 → (-2 n_z) b =0.

So either b=0 or n_z=0.

If n_z=0, then n is along x, and θ=90 degrees. Then the eigenvectors would be different.

Otherwise, if b≠0, then n_z must be zero, which is a special case.

Wait, but if n is along z, then n_z=1, so (-2 *1) b =0 → b=0. Which leads to a= (1-1)/n_x *0 =0, which is not possible. So perhaps I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the case where the determinant is zero and find the eigenvectors from the row-reduced equations.

The system is:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b =0 → equation (1)

n_x a - (n_z +1) b =0 → equation (2)

Let me write equation (1) as a = [ (1 -n_z ) / n_x ] b.

Substitute into equation (2):

n_x * [ (1 -n_z ) /n_x b ] - (n_z +1) b =0 → (1 -n_z ) b - (n_z +1 ) b =0.

→ [1 -n_z -n_z -1 ] b =0 → (-2 n_z ) b =0.

So either b=0 or n_z=0.

Case 1: n_z=0. Then n is along x, so θ=90 degrees.

Then equation (1) becomes (-1) a + n_x b =0 → a = n_x b.

Equation (2): n_x a - (0 +1 ) b =0 → n_x a - b =0.

Substituting a =n_x b into equation (2):

n_x * (n_x b) -b =0 → n_x² b -b=0 → (n_x² -1) b=0.

But n is a unit vector, so n_x^2=1 (since n_z=0). Thus, (1 -1 )b=0 → 0=0.

So for n_z=0, the eigenvector can be any [a, b] where a =n_x b. So to make it normalized, we can choose a= n_x b.

So, for n_z=0, the eigenvector is [n_x, 1], normalized.

But n_x= ±1 (since n_z=0), so the eigenvector is [1, 0] or [-1, 0], which for spin-1/2 along x, the spin-up state is [1, 0], and spin-down is [0,1], but I think I might have the signs mixed here.

Wait, let's think: for σ_x, the eigenvalues are ±1. The eigenstates for σ_x are [1,0] and [0,1], but wait, no. σ_x has eigenvalues 1 and -1.

Wait, the eigenvectors for σ_x are [1,1] and [1,-1] normalized, I think.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's compute the eigenvectors of σ_x.

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]].

The eigenvalues are 1 and -1.

For eigenvalue +1: (σ_x - I)|v> =0 → [[-1,1],[1,-1]] |v> =0.

So equations:

- a + b =0 → a =b.

So eigenvectors are [1,1], which when normalized is [1/√2, 1/√2].

Similarly, eigenvalue -1 gives a=-b, so eigenvector [1,-1], normalized.

So for σ_x, the spin-up state (eigenvalue +ħ/2) is [1,1]/√2.

Similarly, for P·n when n is along x (n_z=0, n_x=1), the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 would be [1,1]/√2.

Wait, but according to the earlier standard spin state, when φ=0 and θ=90 degrees, the state is [cos(45 degrees), sin(45 degrees)] = [1/√2,1/√2], which is correct.

So, this suggests that for general θ, the eigenvector should be [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

So why did my earlier calculation give [ sin(θ/2), cos(θ/2) ]?

Ah, I think I know where I went wrong. In the earlier approach, I had the eigenvector as [ a, b ] where a = sin(θ/2), b = cos(theta/2). So [ sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ].

But according to the standard result, this should be [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

So perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me re-examine the equations.

Wait, in the solution I found, the vector was [ sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ].

But when theta is 0, this gives [0,1], which is the spin-down state. So that's the problem.

So perhaps I should have taken the eigenvector as [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But how?

Another approach: the eigenvalue equation.

Let me consider the matrix (σ·n) as:

[ n_z, n_x ]

[ n_x, -n_z ]

We can find its eigenvectors.

The eigenvalues are ±1, since the trace is zero and the determinant is -n_z² -n_x² = -(n_x² +n_z²) = -1 (since n is a unit vector).

So eigenvalues are ±1.

So for eigenvalue +1:

[ (n_z -1) a + n_x b =0 ]

[ n_x a - (n_z +1) b=0 ]

Expressed another way, (n_z -1) a +n_x b =0.

Let me express a in terms of b.

a = [ (1 -n_z ) /n_x ] b.

Substituting into the second equation:

n_x * [ (1 -n_z ) /n_x b ] - (n_z +1) b =0 → (1 -n_z ) b - (n_z +1) b =0.

Which simplifies to [1 -n_z -n_z -1 ] b =0 → (-2 n_z ) b=0.

So either b=0 or n_z=0.

Case 1: n_z=0.

Then, from equation (1): (0 -1)a +n_x b=0 → a = n_x b.

Substituting into equation (2):

n_x a - (0 +1) b=0 → n_x (n_x b) -b =0 → (n_x² -1 ) b =0.

But since n is a unit vector, n_x²=1, so 0=0.

Thus, the eigenvector is [a, b] = [n_x, 1 ] b.

But if n_x=1, then the vector is [1,1], which when normalized is [1/√2, 1/√2], which is correct.

If n_x=-1, the vector is [-1,1], which becomes [ -1,1 ] /√2, but wait, that would have eigenvalue +1?

Wait, when n_x=-1 and n_z=0, the matrix becomes [[0, -1], [-1,0]].

The eigenvectors for eigenvalue +1 would satisfy:

(0-1)a + (-1) b =0 → -a -b=0 → a = -b.

So the vector is [a, b] = [ -b, b ], which can be written as b [-1, 1 ].

So for n_x= -1, the eigenvector is [ -1, 1 ] / sqrt(2).

So in this case, the solution is [ -1,1 ] / sqrt(2), which implies when θ=90 degrees and n_x=-1, the eigenvector is [ -1,1 ] / sqrt(2).

But according to the standard spin state, when θ=90 degrees and φ=180 degrees (since n_x is negative), the state would be [ cos(45 + 180 ), ... ] Wait, no, φ is the azimuthal angle, so n_x= -1 and n_z=0 would correspond to φ=180 degrees.

So the standard spin-up state would be [ cos( (90 + 180)/2 ), e^{i phi} sin( (90 + 180)/2 ) ].

Wait, phi=180 degrees, so e^{i phi} = e^{i pi} = -1.

θ=90 degrees, so theta/2=45 degrees.

So the state is [ cos(45), - sin(45) ] = [ sqrt(2)/2, - sqrt(2)/2 ].

Which is the same as [1, -1 ] / sqrt(2).

But that's the opposite of the eigenvector we found earlier.

Hmm, perhaps the choice of eigenvector depends on the direction of rotation or something like that.

But let's get back to the general case.

Another approach: perhaps the eigenvector for eigenvalue +1 is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

But in our earlier calculation, we arrived at [ sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ].

But according to the standard state, it's [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

So perhaps I made a mistake in the sign or the order.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So perhaps in my earlier calculation, I should have taken the eigenvector as [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Let me try this: if the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], then it should satisfy the equation (σ·n) [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, let me compute (σ·n) [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Which is:

[ [n_z, n_x ], [n_x, -n_z ] ] [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

First component:

n_z cos(theta/2) + n_x sin(theta/2)

Second component:

n_x cos(theta/2) - n_z sin(theta/2)

If (σ·n)|ψ> = +1 |ψ>, then:

n_z cos(theta/2) + n_x sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)

n_x cos(theta/2) - n_z sin(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)

Let's see if this holds.

First equation:

n_z cos(theta/2) + n_x sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)

→ (n_z -1) cos(theta/2) + n_x sin(theta/2) =0

Second equation:

n_x cos(theta/2) - (n_z) sin(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)

→ n_x cos(theta/2) - (n_z +1) sin(theta/2) =0

Hmm, do these equations hold given that n is a unit vector in the x-z plane?

We know that n_x² + n_z² =1, and n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta).

So substituting n_z = cos(theta), n_x = sin(theta):

First equation:

( cos(theta) -1 ) cos(theta/2) + sin(theta) sin(theta/2) =0 ?

Let me compute:

cos(theta) = 2 cos^2(theta/2) -1.

So, cos(theta) -1 = 2 cos^2(theta/2) -1 -1 = 2 cos^2(theta/2) -2 = 2( cos^2(theta/2) -1 ) = -2 sin^2(theta/2).

So the first term is (cos(theta) -1 ) cos(theta/2) = -2 sin^2(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

The second term is sin(theta) sin(theta/2) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = 2 sin²(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So overall:

-2 sin²(theta/2) cos(theta/2) + 2 sin²(theta/2) cos(theta/2) =0. Which holds.

Similarly, the second equation:

n_x cos(theta/2) - (n_z +1) sin(theta/2) = sin(theta) cos(theta/2) - (cos(theta)+1) sin(theta/2 ) 

Let me compute each term.

n_x = sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So first term: 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) * cos(theta/2 ) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos^2(theta/2).

(n_z +1) = cos(theta) +1 = 2 cos^2(theta/2) -1 +1 = 2 cos^2(theta/2).

So (n_z +1) sin(theta/2) = 2 cos^2(theta/2) sin(theta/2).

So the second equation becomes:

2 sin(theta/2) cos^2(theta/2 ) - 2 cos^2(theta/2) sin(theta/2 ) =0.

Which is also true.

Thus, the vector [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] is indeed an eigenvector with eigenvalue +1.

So that must be the correct solution.

So where did I go wrong earlier? I think I must have made a mistake in the substitution or the way I expressed the equations.

So, the correct normalized eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Now looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is for a different parametrization, perhaps spherical coordinates for a vector, but not the spinor components.

Option D looks more complicated with sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors, which don't fit.

Option A has ħ factors, which don't make sense because the eigenvectors are dimensionless.

So the correct answer must be option C.


The problem involves calculating the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. The direction $\vec{n}$ is parametrized as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$ in the x-z plane, and the operator along $\vec{n}$ is $P \cdot \vec{n} = \hbar/2 \cdot (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})$, where $\vec{\sigma}$ represents the Pauli matrices.

The eigenvalue equation for $P \cdot \vec{n}$ is solved by finding the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The eigenstates of $\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}$ are known to be:

\[
|+\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ e^{i\phi} \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}, \quad |-\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -i \sin(\theta/2) \\ \cos(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix},
\]

where $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, $\phi = 0$, so the spin-up state simplifies to:

\[
|+\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This eigenvector is normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$. The eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$ corresponds to the spin-up state along the direction $\vec{n}$.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$  
  This is incorrect because the eigenvector components are not dimensionless (they include $\hbar$), and the form does not match the expected result.

- **Option B**: $(\cos(\theta), e^{i\phi}\sin(\theta))$  
  This represents a spherical coordinate parametrization of a direction vector, not the spinor components of the eigenvector. It is unrelated to the problem.

- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This matches the normalized spin-up eigenvector for the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$ along the direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane. It is correct.

- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This is incorrect because the components are scaled by $\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$, which are not present in the normalized eigenvector. Additionally, the inclusion of $\hbar$ is dimensionally inconsistent.

### Conclusion:
The correct normalized eigenvector is $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$, which corresponds to **Option C**.
