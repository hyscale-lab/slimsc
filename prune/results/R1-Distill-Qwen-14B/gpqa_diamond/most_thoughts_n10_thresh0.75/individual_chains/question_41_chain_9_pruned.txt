Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one. Let's see.

I remember that when dealing with light in a medium, the speed of light depends on the medium's refractive index. In a vacuum, light speed is c, but in glass, it's c/n, right? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. So in glass, it's slower than in vacuum.

But wait, this is a case where the medium itself is moving. So the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. Hmm. So I think I need to consider the velocity addition from special relativity here, but wait, is that necessary? Because glass has a much lower speed than light, but maybe it's negligible? Or do I need to apply the velocity addition formula?

Wait, but the problem says the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam. The beam is going through the glass, which is moving toward the observer. Wait, no, it's moving in the same direction as the beam. Oh, the glass is moving
