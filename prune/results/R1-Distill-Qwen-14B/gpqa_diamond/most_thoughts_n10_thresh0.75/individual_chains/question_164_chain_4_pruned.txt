Okay, so I've got this question about binary star systems. Hmm, binary stars, right. They orbit around a common center of mass. Okay, so the question is about determining which system is more massive and by what factor.

So, the systems are system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses, and the periods are given. System_1 has a period of 2 years, and system_2 has 1 year. Oh wait, the period is the time between two primary eclipses. I remember that in binary systems, the period is the orbital period, the time it takes for the two stars to orbit each other once.

Then there's the spectroscopic data. Radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So, the mass of each system is the sum of the two stars' masses.

Wait, what do I know about radial velocities in binary systems? Oh right, in a spectroscopic binary, each star's velocity variation is sinusoidal. The amplitude of those variations relates to the mass of the other star, I think. So, the more massive star will have a smaller velocity amplitude because it's orbiting a smaller circle.

So the formula I recall is something like the mass ratio. The mass ratio q is the mass of the secondary divided by the mass of the primary. And the velocity semi-amplitudes are inversely proportional to the mass. So if one star has a velocity amplitude K1 and the other K2, then q = K1/K2. Because the more massive star (primary) has lower velocity.

But wait, another point: the total mass of the system is M = M1 + M2. And from the radial velocities, each star's velocity is related to the other's mass. So, the velocity amplitudes are proportional to (M2 and M1) respectively, but inversely proportional to the sum of the masses, maybe?

I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The formula I think is:

M1 / M2 = K2 / K1

Because the star with larger mass has a smaller velocity. So if system_1 has K1 =10 and K2=5, then M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5. So the mass ratio is 0.5 for system_1.

Similarly for system_2, K1=15 and K2=10. So M1/M2 =10/15 = 2/3 ≈0.6667.

Wait wait, I'm not sure if the ratio is K2/K1 or K1/K2. Let me think about the center of mass. The more massive star is closer to the center, so it moves less. So if star 1 is more massive than star 2, star 1's velocity K1 would be smaller than K2. So M1 > M2 implies K1 < K2. So M1/M2 = (K2)/(K1) ?

No, wait another approach: the formula for radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:

K = ( (G * (M2) ) / ( (M1 + M2) * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 + q) * sin i )) )

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, from what I remember, the mass function is used, which relates the velocities and the orbital period. But since both systems have their own periods, we'll need to consider that as well.

Wait, the question is about comparing the total masses of the two systems. So, perhaps I should find the mass of each system and then take the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler approach.

Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M2 sin i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) ), but I'm not sure. Maybe another way: the ratio of the velocities is inversely proportional to the masses.

But I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of the mass function. The mass function for each star is:

f(M) = (K^3 * P) / (245.2)

But I'm not sure if that's helpful here. Alternatively, since both stars in a binary orbit each other, the ratio of their velocities is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses.

So, for system_1:

M1 + M2 = M_total_1

And M1 / M2 = (K2) / (K1) = 5 /10 = 0.5 → M1 = 0.5 M2 → so M_total_1 = M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

Wait, but that gives M1 as 0.5 times M2. So M_total_1 is 1.5 M2.

Wait, no, system_1's stars have K1=10 and K2=5. So K1 is for M2, K2 is for M1?

Wait, let me clarify: in a binary system, each star has its own velocity variation. Let's say star A has mass M_A, star B has mass M_B.

Star A's velocity semi-amplitude is K_A, and star B's is K_B.

The ratio K_A / K_B is equal to (M_B) / (M_A). So, K_A = (M_B/(M_A + M_B)) * something.

Wait, no. Because the more massive star moves slower. So if M_A > M_B, then K_A < K_B.

So, K_A / K_B = M_B / M_A.

Yes, that makes sense. So, for system_1:

K1 (for star A) = 10 km/s

K2 (for star B) =5 km/s.

So,

K1 / K2 = (M_B)/(M_A) → 10/5 = 2 = M_B/(M_A)

So, M_B = 2 M_A. Wait, that can't be right because if star A's velocity is higher, that would imply it's less massive.

Wait, wait, let's clarify. Let's say in system_1, the two stars are A and B.

Star A has K_A =10 km/s.

Star B has K_B=5 km/s.

So K_A is larger than K_B.

Which means M_B is larger than M_A. Because the more massive star moves slower.

So, M_B / M_A = K_A / K_B = (10)/(5)=2.

So M_B = 2 M_A.

So the total mass for system_1 is M_A + M_B = M_A + 2 M_A =3 M_A.

Similarly, for system_2:

K1=15, K2=10.

So K1 (star A) =15, K2 (star B)=10.

So M_B / M_A = K_A / K_B = 15/10=1.5 → M_B = 1.5 M_A.

Total mass for system_2 is M_A + M_B = M_A +
