Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A_y, which is given by c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix.

Wait, the matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So that's the matrix S. So S looks like this:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Hmm, I recognize this matrix. Oh right, this is one of the Pauli matrices, specifically σ_y. Pauli matrices are used in quantum mechanics for spin-1/2 particles, like electrons or muons. So S is σ_y, which is the Pauli Y matrix.

So A_y is c multiplied by S. So A_y = (h/(4π)) * S.

But wait, the problem says that A is the intrinsic angular momentum operator. Oh right, for a spin-1/2 particle, the intrinsic angular momentum components are given by ħ times the Pauli matrices divided by 2. Wait, let me think. The spin angular momentum operator S is (ħ/2) σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So S_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, same for y and z.

Wait, but in this question, A_y is given as c * S, where c = h/(4π). Hmm, I should clarify the units here. Planck's constant h is commonly used, but ħ is h/(2π). So h/(4π) would be ħ/2.

Let me compute that. c = h/(4π) = (2πħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2. So c is ħ/2. So A_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

Wait, but the standard spin operator is S = (ħ/2) σ, so A_y would be the same as S_y, so A_y = S_y. So then, the eigenvalues of S_y should be ± ħ/2.

Hmm, but wait, the problem is asking about an operator A_y that's c multiplied by S, which is S in this case. So if S is σ_y, then A_y is (h/(4π)) * σ_y, which is (ħ/2) σ_y, because h/(4π) = (2πħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2. So yeah, same as S_y.

So the eigenvalues of A_y would be the same as the eigenvalues of S_y. The eigenvalues of Pauli matrices are ±1. So when multiplied by (ħ/2), the eigenvalues become ± ħ/2.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the matrix operator is Ay = c·S. So if S is the Pauli matrix, then the eigenvalues are c multiplied by the eigenvalues of S. Since S's eigenvalues are ±1, Ay's eigenvalues are ±c.

Wait, wait! Let me recheck. The matrix S is the Pauli matrix σ_y, which has
