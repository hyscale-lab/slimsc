Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is given. The matrix S has first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y.

Wait, first, let me write down the matrix for A_y. Since c = h/(4π), A_y would be (h/(4π)) multiplied by matrix S. So,

A_y = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Alternatively, I can factor out the constant and focus on the matrix S when finding eigenvalues because the eigenvalues will just be scaled by c.

So the matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. I remember that for angular momentum operators, the eigenvalues of S_y (or any component) are ± ħ/2, but wait, here in this question, the operator is A_y which is c·S. Let me think about it.

Wait, the problem says A_y = c·S. So if I find the eigenvalues of S, then multiply them by c to get the eigenvalues of A_y.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because S is given. Let me think about S. Matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. I think this is the standard Pauli matrix for the Y-component, multiplied by something. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices are usually σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is actually the Pauli Y matrix, σ_y. So S = σ_y.

The eigenvalues of σ_y are ±1, right? Because for Pauli matrices, the eigenvalues are ±1. So if S has eigenvalues ±1, then A_y = c·S would have eigenvalues c*(±1) = ±c.

So c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues would be ± h/(4π). Wait, but let me make sure. Because in quantum mechanics, the spin matrices S (like S_x, S_y, S
