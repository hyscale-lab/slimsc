Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's try to unpack it step by step. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, I remember that in such a system, the potential is V(r) = (1/2)mω²r², which makes sense because it's the 3D version of the simple harmonic oscillator.

The question asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to that energy eigenvalue. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I think about the energy levels in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I remember that in three dimensions, the energy levels are determined by the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz, but since it's isotropic, the energy depends only on the sum of these quantum numbers. Wait, actually, in 3D, the energy is given by E = ħω(n + 3/2), but wait, no, that's for each direction. Oh wait, no, the 3D case is a sum of three 1D oscillators, so the total energy is E = ħω(nx + ny + nz + 3/2). Oh right, because each direction contributes n_i + 1/2 levels.

Wait, another way to think about it is that the energy levels are (n + 3/2)ħω, where n = nx + ny + nz, and each of nx, ny, nz are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). So the energy depends on the sum n, which can be 0,1,2, etc. Each increase in n increments the energy by ħω.

Now, the question is about the third excited state. Wait, what's the ground state? The ground state would be the lowest energy, which is when nx=ny=nz=0. So n=0, and energy is (0 + 3/2)ħω = (3/2)ħω. The first excited state would be when n=1. Then n=2 is the second excited, n=3 third excited, right? So the third excited state has n=3.

So the energy would be (3 + 3/2)ħω → (9/2)ħω. Oh wait, wait. Let me double-check. Ground state is
