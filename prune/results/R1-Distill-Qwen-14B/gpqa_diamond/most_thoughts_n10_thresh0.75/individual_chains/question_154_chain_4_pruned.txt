Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. I'm a bit rusty on my spectroscopy, but let me try to work through it. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. The options are four different compounds, and I need to figure out which one matches the given data.

Let me start by looking at the information provided.

The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, and it's 100%, so that's the molecular weight. There's also a peak at m/z 158 with a relative intensity of 32%. Hmm, molecular ion plus 2? Maybe something to do with the structure. Maybe a double bond or an isotope? Or perhaps a fragment with a different charge? Wait, 158 is two units higher than 156. That might suggest an addition of something like a Cl or another group. Wait, chlorine has an atomic mass of about 35.5, but that's way higher. Wait, maybe it's a fragment with an extra oxygen or something else. Alternatively, maybe a Cl would make sense. Wait, chlorine has an isotope at around 35 and 37. Let me think about that.

The IR data shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. Since it's in that region, O-H is more likely. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is indicative of a carbonyl group. A strong peak around 1720 is usually a carbonyl. Could be an ester, acid, aldehyde, or ketone. Let's note that down.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

- 11.0 ppm (s, 1H): That's a very downfield shift. A singlet. What gives a peak around 11 ppm? Probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid proton. Carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm. But wait, the broad IR peak suggests O-H, which fits with a carboxylic acid. So maybe this is a carboxylic acid. But wait, let me also think about other possibilities. Maybe an aromatic aldehyde? But the IR doesn't show the aldehyde's C-H stretch which is around 2820 and 2720 for the aldehyde C-H. Wait, the IR has a broad peak from 3500-2700, which could include an aldehyde's C-H stretch. But the sharp peak is at 1720, which could be a ketone or ester as well.

Now looking at the NMR protons:

At 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). Those are two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent and split into doublets. So if the aromatic ring has two substituents, each in the para positions, but wait, no,
