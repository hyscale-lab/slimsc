Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details right.

The problem says: There's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, which probably means I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed right at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places.

Hmm, so I think this is an electrostatics problem. Since the particles are identical and have the same charge, they are likely to be either all positive or all negative. But wait, the problem says "isolated system"—so maybe the charges can't move freely, but I need to think about their arrangement and the resulting potential energy.

Wait, the 13th charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So, each of those 12 charges is 2 meters from P. But wait, the problem says each of the 12 is constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So they're all at the same distance from P, but are they arranged in some particular configuration around P? Like, maybe all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters?

But wait, the problem just says they are at 2 m from P. So each of them is at a distance of 2 m from P. So each is 2 m away, but their arrangement relative to each other isn't specified. But since the system is isolated and the charges are identical, the configuration that would minimize the potential energy is when the charges are as close as possible to each other, right? Because like charges repel, so if they're as close as possible, the potential energy would be lower.

Wait, but no—wait, in electrostatics, the potential energy between point charges is given by Coulomb's law. The potential energy between two point charges is (k * q1 * q2) / r. Since all the charges are the same, and the system is isolated, the minimum energy would likely involve the charges being as close as possible, but the problem states that 12 charges are fixed at 2 m from point P where the 13th is. So the 12 are all at 2 m
