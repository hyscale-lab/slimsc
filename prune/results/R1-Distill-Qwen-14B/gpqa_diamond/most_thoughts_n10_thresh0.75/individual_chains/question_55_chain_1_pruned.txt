Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve. Let's see what I can remember about NMR and how to analyze it for structure determination. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are all some kind of propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans.

The NMR data given is:
7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)
5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
2.1 ppm (3H, s)
1.6 ppm (3H, d)

And the options are:
A) Cis-butenyl acetate
B) Trans-propenyl acetate
C) Cis-propenyl acetate
D) Trans-butenyl acetate

Hmm, I think I should start by drawing the possible structures and seeing how the NMR would look for each.

First, let's recall what these compounds look like. All of them are esters, so the structure would be something like R-O-CO-R', where R is an alkyl or alkenyl group.

Wait, the options are propenyl and butenyl acetates. So for propenyl, the R would be CH2CH2CH3 with a double bond, but wait, propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2- or CH2CH2CH2- with a double bond somewhere else? Wait, no. Propenyl is CH2CH2CH3 but with a double bond in the structure. Let me think: propenyl groups are either allyl (CH2=CHCH2-) or is it CH2CH2CH2- with a double bond.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. Propenyl groups come in two forms: the allyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, right? So propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, the butenyl would be similar but with four carbons. Butenyl could be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (trans or cis?), but wait, butenyl has a double bond between carbons 1 and 2? Or between 2 and 3?

Wait, butenyl is a four-carbon chain with a double bond. So butenyl could be either 1,2-doubly bonded (CH2=CHCH2
