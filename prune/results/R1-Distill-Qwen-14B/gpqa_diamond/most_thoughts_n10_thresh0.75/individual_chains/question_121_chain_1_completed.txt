Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the product when a specific epoxide reacts with Me2CuLi. Hmm, let me think this through step by step.

First, the question says that when saturated epoxides react with organocuprates like Me2CuLi, the alkyl group from the reagent is added to the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. Also, in disubstituted epoxides, there's inversion of configuration at the carbon where the nucleophile attacks. 

The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Wait, bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane... I remember that the numbering for bicyclic compounds can be a bit tricky. Let me visualize this structure. Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane has two rings: a four-membered and a one-membered? No, wait, bicyclo[m.n.p] means the substituents are connected in a way that the bridge lengths are m, n, p. So for [4.1.0], the bridge has 4, 1, and 0 carbons? Or maybe I should think of it as two bridge structures. 

Wait, 7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane would have an oxygen in the ring. So it's an epoxide. The structure has a seven-membered ring, but I think it's a bicyclic system with an oxygen atom as one of the bridge atoms. Let me try drawing it mentally. The main ring is probably a norbornene-like structure, but with an oxygen.

So the starting material has substituents at positions 1,3,4, and 6. The configuration is (1R,3R,4R,6S). So each of these positions has a methyl group except for position 6, which is the oxygen bridge.

When this epoxide reacts with Me2CuLi, which is a strong nucleophile. Organocuprates are known to attack epoxides in a specific way. Since the epoxide is disubstituted, the nucleophile will attack the less hindered carbon. 

Wait, but the starting epoxide is bicyclic. So the two carbons in the epoxide (the ones connected to the oxygen) are each attached to other parts of the bicyclic system. So which carbon is more hindered? The more substituted or the less substituted?

In the structure, the substituents are at 1,3,4, and 6. So the epoxide's two oxygens are on which carbons? Let me think. The 7-oxa would be the oxygen in the bridge. So the epoxide is between carbons 1 and 6? Or maybe carbons 6 and another. Alternatively, maybe it's between carbons 4 and another. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane has two bridgeheads. Let's think of it as a bicyclo with bridge lengths of 4 and 1. So the main bridge would have four carbons, and the smaller bridge has one. So the epoxide oxygen is part of the bridge, making it a smaller ring. 

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like a four-membered ring fused to a two-membered ring. No, that doesn't sound right. Maybe it's better to think of the structure as having a bridge between carbons 1 and 6 (as the 7-oxa would be the oxygen in that bridge). So the epoxide is between carbons 1 and 6, making a three-membered ring (epoxide is O connected to two adjacent carbons, which are part of the bicyclic system).

So the two carbons in the epoxide are 1 and 6. Carbon 1 is substituted with a methyl (since it's 1R) and part of the bicyclic structure. Carbon 6 is also substituted with a methyl (6S), but wait, no, the substituent at 6 is the oxygen, right? Because 7-oxa implies that the oxygen is at position 7. Wait, I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify the numbering.

In bicyclo[m.n.p]heptane, the positions are such that the bridgeheads are at positions 1 and something else. So 7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane would have the oxygen at position 7. So the structure has a seven-membered system where the oxygen is part of a bridge. So the epoxide is between positions 6 and 7? Or perhaps 1 and 6. I'm a bit stuck on the exact structure, but perhaps I can proceed without it.

Assuming that the epoxide has two carbon atoms connected by the oxygen. Each of these carbons is part of the bicyclic system and has substituents. The reagent Me2CuLi will add a methyl group (from the cuprate) to the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.

Additionally, in a disubstituted epoxide, the nucleophile (the cuprate in this case) attacks the less hindered carbon, and there's inversion of configuration at that carbon.

So, the starting structure is a bicyclic epoxide with substituents at 1,3,4,6. Let me imagine that the epoxide is between carbons 1 and 6, as 1 and 6 are substituted with methyl groups. Wait, 1 has a methyl (1R), 6 is S, but wait, the oxygen is at 7. So the epoxide is between 6 and another carbon, say, 5.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the epoxide is between carbons 6 and 7. No, because 7 is the oxygen. So maybe the epoxide is between 5 and 6? Or 6 and 7? I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the product.

The options are all cyclohexanol derivatives, but the substituents vary. So when the epoxide reacts, the ring opens, and the product is a cyclohexanol derivative.

Reaction of epoxides with cuprates typically leads to ring-opening to form alcohols. The cuprate acts as a nucleophile, attacking the less hindered epoxide carbon, leading to the opening of the ring.

In this case, the epoxide is part of a bicyclic system, so the ring opening would form a larger ring. Let me think: the bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, upon ring-opening of the epoxide, would likely form a cyclohexane ring, since the bicyclic system would open into a six-membered ring.

So the product would be a cyclohexanol with substituents. The substituents come from the original bicyclic structure. 

In the starting material, we have substituents at 1,3,4, and 6. After the epoxide opens, these substituents would become substituents on the cyclohexane ring.

Now, the original substituents are methyl groups except at position 6, which is the oxygen. So when the epoxide opens, the oxygen becomes an alcohol group. So in the product, one of the substituents is an -OH group.

Wait, but looking at the options, all are cyclohexanols. So the starting epoxide must have been part of a bridge, and opening it would connect to form a cyclohexane.

In the reaction, the cuprate (Me2CuLi) provides a methyl group. So after the epoxide opens, the methyl group from the cuprate would add to one of the carbons of the epoxide.

Since the cyclohexanol products have substituents at 1,2,4,5, etc., perhaps the numbering has changed, but I need to figure out the stereochemistry.

So, the mechanism: the organocuprate attacks the less hindered epoxide carbon. Since it's a disubstituted epoxide, the nucleophile will attack the less substituted carbon. Wait, no, the attack is on the less hindered, which might be the same as less substituted. Hmm.

Alternatively, in a disubstituted epoxide, the two carbons of the epoxide are each attached to different substituents. The cuprate attacks the less hindered one, leading to inversion.

So the stereochemistry at that carbon will invert.

In the starting material, the configuration is (1R,3R,4R,6S). Let's assume that the two epoxide carbons are 6 (S) and another carbon, say 5. So the epoxide is between 5 and 6.

When the cuprate attacks, it will add a methyl group to the less hindered carbon, which would be the one with fewer substituents. So if 5 is less hindered, the methyl adds there, and there's inversion at that carbon.

Wait, but the product is a cyclohexanol. So I'm getting a bit confused about the exact positions, but perhaps I can approach this through the configuration.

The starting material has four substituents: 1R, 3R, 4R, and 6S. After opening the epoxide, the alcohol group would come from the oxygen. So perhaps in the product, the positions will change.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the structure as a bicyclo with the epoxide, and upon opening, the ring becomes a cyclohexane with substituents.

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure. Let me imagine the bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane with an oxygen bridge. So, the main bridge is four carbons, a bridge connecting positions 1 and 6 (for example), and the oxygen is in another bridge, making a smaller ring.

So the epoxide is at position 6 and maybe position 5? When the cuprate attacks, the methyl group adds to the less hindered carbon, which would be the less substituted one.

Assuming that the epoxide is between C5 and C6, since C6 is part of the larger bridge. So C5 is more substituted and C6 is more hindered. Wait, maybe the opposite. If C5 is connected to more substituents, it's more hindered, so the cuprate would attack C6, which is less hindered.

Wait, but in the starting material, C6 is S configuration. So when the attack occurs, the configuration at that carbon inverts.

So, if the cuprate attacks C6, which is S, then after attack, the configuration would become R. But wait, that's the configuration of the starting material. How does that affect the product?

Alternatively, perhaps the attack is on the more substituted carbon, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the epoxide is between C1 and C6. C1 is R, C6 is S. So in the epoxide, the two carbons are C1 (R) and C6 (S). 

The cuprate will attack the less hindered of the two. So which is less hindered? Let's see, C1 is connected to methyl groups (1R), and perhaps other substituents. C6 has a methyl as well (6S), but is it more or less hindered?

If C1 is more substituted, the attack would be on C6. So methyl adds to C6. But wait, no, the cuprate adds the methyl to the less hindered carbon.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the steric environment. In a bicyclic system, the bridgehead carbons are typically more hindered because of the bridge structure. So perhaps C1 is a bridgehead and is more hindered, making C6 the less hindered.

So the cuprate attacks C6, adding a methyl group there. But wait, the starting material already has a methyl on C6. Oh wait, no, I think C6 is the bridgehead with the oxygen. So perhaps the methyl groups are on C1, C3, C4.

Wait, the starting material is 1,3,4-trimethyl. So C1, C3, C4 have methyl groups, and C6 is the bridgehead with the oxygen (so no methyl there). So when the cuprate attacks, it adds a methyl to one of the epoxide carbons.

So, in the starting epoxide, the two carbons are C1 and C6. C1 has a methyl, C6 is connected to the oxygen bridge. So C1 is more substituted (it has a methyl), making it more hindered. So the cuprate would attack C6, since it's less hindered.

Wait, but C6 is a bridgehead, which makes it more hindered. Hmm, maybe it's the other way around. Maybe C1 is less hindered because it's not a bridgehead. Or perhaps C1 is a bridgehead as well.

I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, so perhaps I should think about the product options. Let me look at the options.

Option A: (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol
Option B: (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol
Option C: (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol
Option D: (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol

So all products are cyclohexanols with multiple methyl groups.

In the starting material, we have three methyl groups (1,3,4). After the reaction, we're adding a methyl group from the cuprate, so the product would have four methyl groups. Looking at the options, all have 2,2,4,5 (A and B) or 1,2,4,5 (C and D). Hmm.

Wait, the starting material is 1,3,4-trimethyl. So adding another methyl (from Me2CuLi) would make four methyl groups in total. But looking at the options, all have four methyl substituents. So my confusion is which positions they are on.

Another approach: when the epoxide ring opens, the two carbons that were part of the epoxide become adjacent in the product. So, if the epoxide was between C1 and C6, then in the product, those would be adjacent, and the oxygen would form an alcohol group.

Wait, but in the product, the substituents would be on adjacent carbons. So if the epoxide opens to form a cyclohexanol, the positions would be 1 and 2, perhaps.

Wait, let me think. The starting material is bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane with an oxygen bridge. Upon ring-opening, the epoxide would break, and the two carbons (say, C1 and C6) become adjacent. So the product would have substituents on C1 and C2 (assuming the numbering shifts).

But I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the product's substituents come from the original structure.

The starting material has methyl groups on C1, C3, and C4. When the epoxide opens, the C1 and C6 become adjacent in the product. So the product would have substituents at C1, C2 (from C6, perhaps), C4, and others.

Wait, perhaps the product would have a hydroxyl group at one position, and the methyl groups would be at others.

In the reaction, the organocuprate adds a methyl group to the less hindered carbon of the epoxide. Then, the ring opens, forming a cyclohexanol.

So, the product would have four methyl groups: the original three plus the new one from the cuprate. Wait, but the starting material has three methyl groups (1,3,4). So adding one more methyl would make four, but looking at the options, they have four methyl groups.

Wait, the starting material is 1,3,4-trimethyl, so adding another methyl would make four. Let me see the options:

Option A: 2,2,4,5 → four substituents, including two on C2.
Option B: 2,2,4,5 → same as A.
Option C: 1,2,4,5 → four substituents.
Option D: 1,2,4,5 → same as C.

So, perhaps the product has two methyl groups on C2, implying that the cuprate added to C2.

Wait, the cuprate adds a methyl to the epoxide's less hindered carbon. So if the epoxide was between C1 and another, let's say C6, and the cuprate adds to C6, then in the product, C6 would have the methyl from the cuprate. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's configuration is determined by the attack and inversion at the less hindered carbon.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Identify the epoxide structure. The epoxide is at positions 6 and something else. Perhaps 6 and 5.

2. The cuprate attacks the less hindered carbon (say, 5 or 6). Let's assume it's 6.

3. The attack occurs with inversion of configuration at that carbon.

4. The ring opens, and the methyl from the cuprate adds to that carbon.

5. The oxygen becomes an -OH group as part of the ring-opening.

6. The substituents from the original structure (1,3,4) and the added methyl (from cuprate) would be on the cyclohexane ring.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents from 1,3,4 become substituents at positions 1, 4, and 5 in the product. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting structure is more like this: the bicyclo is a norbornane derivative, with the epoxide oxygen at position 7. So, the epoxide is between positions 5 and 6. So, when the cuprate attacks, it adds a methyl to position 6 (if it's less hindered). Then, the ring opens, leading to a cyclohexane structure where position 6 becomes adjacent to position 5.

But I'm getting stuck on the exact structure.

Alternative approach: consider the product structures. For example, option B is (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.

The alcohol is at position 1. So the oxygen from the epoxide becomes the hydroxyl at position 1. Then, the added methyl is at position 2.

Wait, the cuprate adds a methyl to the epoxide's less hindered carbon, and the ring opens to form a cyclohexanol.

So, if the methyl was added to position 6, which is now position 2 in the product, then the product would have methyl at 2.

Looking at the options, options A and B have methyl groups at 2,2,4,5. So, in option B, positions 2,4,5 have methyl, plus another at 2 (hence 2,2,4,5). Option C and D have methyls at 1,2,4,5.

If the cuprate adds a methyl to position 6 (now 2), then the product would have a methyl at 2.

So, the product would have methyl groups at 1 (original), 3 (now perhaps 4?), 4, and 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm misnumbering the positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting epoxide is between C1 and C6. When the cuprate adds to C6, which is less hindered, then the ring opens, and C6 becomes C2 in the product.

So the product would have a methyl from the cuprate at C2, and the original methyls would be at C1, C3, and C4.

Wait, but the product options don't have a methyl at C3. Hmm. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, in the starting material, the substituents are at 1,3,4. So when the epoxide opens, substituents from 1,3,4, and the new methyl (from cuprate) would be in certain positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbering shifts upon ring-opening, making some substituents appear at different positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclohexanol with substituents at positions 1,2,4,5, each having methyl groups, except in the case where the epoxide attack leads to a new methyl at position 2.

But looking at the options, only options A and B have substituents at 2,2,4,5, with the hydroxyl at 1.

In the starting material, the substituents are 1,3,4. So perhaps in the product, substituents at 1,2,4,5 correspond to these positions after ring-opening.

Wait, perhaps the original substituent at position 3 ends up at position 5 in the product. So in the product, positions 1,4,5 would have the original methyls, and position 2 would have the new methyl.

So the product would have methyls at 1,2,4,5. Looking at the options, options C and D have methyls at 1,2,4,5.

But wait, the options C and D have different configurations. Let me look.

Option C: (1R,2R,4R,5R)
Option D: (1R,2S,4R,5R)

So the question is about the configuration at the positions after the attack.

The cuprate attacks the epoxide, adds a methyl to the less hindered carbon, which was in the S configuration (position 6). Then, the attack occurs with inversion.

So, for the attacked carbon (position 6 in the starting material), the configuration was S. After attack, the configuration inverts to R.

But in the product, where is this position?

If the product's position 2 corresponds to the starting position 6, then in the product, position 2 would have a configuration R.

Looking at the options, both option C and D have position 2 as either R or S. Wait, option C has position 2 as R (since all are R), and option D has position 2 as S.

But in the attack, the configuration inverts. So if the starting position 6 was S, the product would be R. So in the product, if position 2 is the former position 6, then its configuration would be R.

Looking at the options, option C has position 2 as R, and option D has it as S. So option C is a possibility.

But wait, the product's configuration at position 2 (originally position 6) would be R because of inversion. So if the product has position 2 as R, then option C is correct.

But let's double-check. The product would have an -OH group at position 1, perhaps, as the ring opens, and the substituents from the epoxide become adjacent.

Wait, the starting material's epoxide is between 1 and 6. Upon opening, the oxygen becomes an -OH at position 1, and the methyl from the cuprate is added to position 6, which becomes position 2 in the product.

So in the product, position 2 would be where the methyl was added, and the configuration at that position would be R (due to inversion).

So the product would have substituents at positions 1 (OH), 2 (methyl, R), 4 (methyl), and 5 (methyl). So the substituents are 1 (OH), 2,4,5 methyl.

Looking at the options, the only products with methyls at 2,4,5 are options A and B, but they have two methyls at 2. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the original substituents at 3 and 4 become 5 and 4 in the product, leaving one methyl at 2 from the cuprate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mapping.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has the methyl from the cuprate at position 5, not 2. But then where is the hydroxyl group?

Alternatively, perhaps the product's numbering is such that the original substituent at 1 remains at 1, and the substituents at 3 and 4 shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has substituents at 1 (OH), 2 (methyl from cuprate), 4 (methyl), and 5 (methyl from original 3).

Wait, the starting substituents are at 1,3,4. So in the product, the substituents would be at 1 (OH?), 2 (cuprate methyl), 4 (methyl from 4), and 5 (methyl from 3).

So substituents at 2,4,5 are methyl, and 1 is OH. But that would make the product have four substituents, but the options have more. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is (1R,2R,4R,5R), which would be option C.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again about the mechanism.

In the starting epoxide, the cuprate attacks the less hindered carbon. Let's say that carbon is position 6, which is S. After attack, configuration inverts to R.

In the product, position 6 becomes position 2 (assuming the ring opens and the numbering shifts such that the new substituents are on adjacent carbons).

So, in the product, position 2 would have a methyl group (from the cuprate) and would be R configuration.

The other substituents would come from the original structure. Position 1 in the starting material would become position 1 in the product, with a methyl group. Position 3 would become position 5, and position 4 would remain position 4.

So substituents are at 1 (R, methyl), 2 (R, methyl), 4 (R, methyl), and 5 (R, methyl from position 3). So the product would have four substituents: 1,2,4,5.

Looking at the options, that's options C and D.

Option C: (1R,2R,4R,5R)
Option D: (1R,2S,4R,5R)

Since the attack leads to inversion, and the original position 6 (now 2) was S, the product would be R. So option C has 2R, which would be correct.

But wait, the starting material's position 6 was S. So upon attack, it inverts to R. Therefore, in the product, position 2 is R.

So the correct configuration would be 1R,2R,4R,5R, which is option C.

Wait, but in the options, option C is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.

Wait, but the starting material's position 1 was R, and in the product, it's still R. So that fits.

So the product would be option C.


When (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane reacts with Me₂CuLi, the reaction involves the attack of the organocuprate on the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. The epoxide is part of a bicyclic system, and the two carbons of the epoxide are likely positions 1 and 6. The less hindered carbon is position 6, which has an S configuration in the starting material. 

The organocuprate adds a methyl group to this less hindered carbon (position 6), and the attack occurs with inversion of configuration, changing the configuration at position 6 from S to R. Upon ring-opening of the epoxide, the product forms a cyclohexanol derivative. The substituents from the starting material (methyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 4) and the newly added methyl group from the cuprate are mapped to the product. 

In the product, the hydroxyl group (-OH) is at position 1 (formerly position 1 of the bicyclic system), the methyl group from the cuprate is at position 2 (formerly position 6), and the original methyl groups at positions 3 and 4 are at positions 5 and 4, respectively. The configuration at position 2 is R due to the inversion during the attack.

The correct product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
