Okay, so I'm trying to find the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian operator H. The problem says H is equal to ε times the dot product of σ and n vectors. Hmm, I remember that σ represents the Pauli spin matrices. So each component of σ is a Pauli matrix, like σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. And n is an arbitrary unit vector, so it's a vector pointing in some direction with magnitude 1.

Wait, the Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. So the dot product would be σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z. Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. But I'm not sure how that affects the eigenvalues.

I remember that eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix are ±1. But wait, each Pauli matrix is Hermitian and has eigenvalues ±1. However, when you take a linear combination like this, what happens? Or, wait, when you have a spin in a particular direction, the operator σ · n would have eigenvalues ±1 because it's like measuring spin in direction n. But then, multiplied by ε, so the eigenvalues would be ±ε?

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the properties of the operator. Because for any unit vector n, the operator σ·n is a Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues +1 and -1. So when you multiply it by ε, which is a scalar, the eigenvalues would just scale by ε. So the eigenvalues become ε*(+1) and ε*(-1), so +ε and -ε.

Wait, but wait a second. The Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. Each σ_i has trace zero and determinant -1. The eigenvalues of each σ_i are +1 and -1, yes. So the eigenvalues of σ·n would still be +1 and -1 because n is a unit vector. Because when you take a linear combination with coefficients that are the components of a unit vector, the eigenvalues remain ±1. Because for example, if n is along z, then H is ε σ_z, eigenvalues ±ε. If n is along another direction, like (n_x, 0, n_z), then the matrix is diagonal if n_y is zero, but in any case, the eigenvalues would be ±ε, right?

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. Let's consider H = ε (σ·n). Let me compute
