Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound using the given spectroscopic data. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1 suggests the presence of either O-H or N-H bonds. But since the options don't have nitrogen, it's probably an O-H group, maybe from an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But wait, the other peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1 are important. A peak around 1700 is typical for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. The 1650 peak could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like an aromatic ketone or something with conjugated double bonds. Hmm, but wait, 1700 is higher than 1650, so maybe the 1700 is an ester or ketone, and the 1650 could be from conjugation, like an aromatic ring or an amide. But since the options don't include nitrogen, it's probably not an amide.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to double bonds, so that suggests the compound has some kind of double bond, maybe in an alkene or perhaps in an aromatic ring. But if it's a vinyl proton in an aromatic ring, like in benzene, but then the substituents would affect the NMR. Alternatively, the compound could be something like an ester with an alkene group, or maybe a ketone with a double bond nearby.

Now the mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z=45. I remember that 45 is a common mass for a (CH3)2O group (which is 15+30=45), but wait, also, 45 is the molecular ion for something like C3H7O, but let me think. Alternatively, what fragments give m/z=45? Maybe it's a fragment from an ester group. For example, in an ester, the R-O group might break off. An ethyl group would have a molecular weight of 46, but maybe a methyl group is 15. Wait, perhaps if the compound is something like ethyl acetate, which is an ester. Ethyl acetate has the formula C4H8O2. But wait, the options here are all C6. So maybe the compound is something like propyl propionate or another ester. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with some substituents.

Let me look at the options again. The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O2.

Each of these has different degrees of unsaturation. Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation for each.

The formula for degrees of unsaturation is: Degrees = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Since there's no X or N here, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

Option A: C6H12O2. C=6, H=12. So (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14 -12)/2= 1. So one degree of unsaturation. That could be a ring or a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2= 2. So two degrees. Could be two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2. (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. Same as B.

Option D: C6H12O. (14-12)/2= 1. So same as A, one degree.

So looking at the data again: FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000 (probably O-H), and strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 (maybe two carbonyls or a carbonyl and something else).

Wait, but wait. Two strong peaks in the carbonyl region. That's a bit unusual. Maybe one is a carbonyl (like a ketone or ester) and the other is conjugated, like an aromatic ring with substituents. Or maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic ring with a substituent. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester with a conjugated double bond.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond. So the compound has a double bond. So that accounts for one degree of unsaturation. The other could be a carbonyl, so that's two. So in terms of the options, the molecular formula should have two degrees of unsaturation. Wait, let's see.

Wait, the options with two degrees are B and C. So that would be C6H10O or C6H10O2.

So if the compound has a double bond (one degree) and a carbonyl (another degree), that's two, matching B and C.

Looking at the IR again: 1700 is a strong peak, which suggests a carbonyl. So the compound has a carbonyl group. The 1650 might be an aromatic ring (like in an aromatic ketone) or perhaps an ester where the carbonyl is at 1700 and another peak at 1650 from conjugation. Or maybe it's an amide, but since no N is present, probably not.

The presence of O-H in the IR suggests either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But a carboxylic acid would have a broad peak around 2500-3300, sometimes with a strong absorption around 3000. But the peak here is very broad at 3000, which could be an O-H from a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, then the carbonyl would be around 1700 as well. But wait, in a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually a bit lower than in esters or ketones, maybe around 1700 or a bit lower. Wait, but the IR here shows two peaks: 1700 and 1650. So maybe the 1700 is the carbonyl, and the 16
