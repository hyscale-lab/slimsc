Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says a particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions, and the potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I need to find the energy spectrum, and there are four options to choose from.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, especially for particles in potentials, the energy levels depend on the form of the potential. The potential given seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.

So, V(r, θ) has two terms: the first is (1/2)kr², which looks familiar—like a harmonic oscillator potential in two dimensions. The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Wait, cos²θ... I think that can be rewritten using a trigonometric identity. Oh right, cos²θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the second term becomes (3/2)kr² * (1 + cos 2θ)/2. Let me calculate that: (3/2)*(1/2) is 3/4, so (3/4)kr² (1 + cos2θ). So V(r, θ) becomes (1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ.

Wait, combining the terms without the cosine: 1/2 + 3/4 = 5/4. So V(r,θ) = (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ. Hmm, that seems a bit better.

But wait, maybe I should think about this in terms of effective potentials or separation of variables. Because in polar coordinates, the Schrödinger equation can sometimes be solved by separating the radial and angular parts.

Alternatively, perhaps this potential can be expressed in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Let me think. In two dimensions, polar coordinates (r, θ) can be converted to Cartesian (x, y) using x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ. So cosθ = x/r, which means cos²θ = x²/(r²). So the potential can be written as V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k r² (x²/r²) ) = 1/2 kr² + (3/2)k x².

Oh wait, because (x²/r²) is cos²θ, so that's correct. So V(r,θ) becomes (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k x². Wait, but r² is x² + y². So substituting that in, we get V = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x². Let me combine like terms: the x² terms are (1/2)k x² + (3/2)k x² = 2k x². So V = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, so
