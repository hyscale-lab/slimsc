Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters. So, I need to figure out the formula that connects these quantities to the decay distance.

Wait, decay distance... I remember that particles that decay do so after traveling a certain distance, which depends on their lifetime. Oh right, the mean decay length is given by c multiplied by the lifetime, which is the mean proper lifetime τ. So L = c * τ. But wait, particles moving at relativistic speeds, so we need to account for time dilation, right? So the lifetime observed in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime τ.

Wait, but how do I find τ? I think the width Γ is related to the lifetime. The uncertainty principle says that Γ ≈ ħ/τ. Oh wait, but I should double-check that. Γ is the decay width, which is related to the particle's lifetime. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, right? So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, wait, units here. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in units of GeV·s or something? Hmm, maybe I need to convert all units appropriately.

Wait, let me
