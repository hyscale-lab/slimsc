Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. Let me try to recall what I need to do step by step.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I need to calculate both values.

First, the initial dilution. When you mix equal volumes of a solution, the concentration halves, right? So the initial concentration after dilution would be (0.05 M) * (20 cm³) / (40 cm³) ) = 0.025 M. Because volume doubles, concentration halves. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but when you titrate, you're adding NaOH which will react with the acetic acid. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So at the equivalence point, all the acetic acid will be neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ion.

Let me tackle the equivalence point first. Because that might be easier. At equivalence, moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid initially.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid: volume is 20 cm³ = 0.02 L, concentration 0.05 M. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

The NaOH concentration is 0.1 M. So, at equivalence, moles of NaOH would be 0.001. Volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

But wait, the question is about the pH at equivalence. So we have the acetate ion in solution. The acetate will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The pH at equivalence is determined by the hydrolysis of the
