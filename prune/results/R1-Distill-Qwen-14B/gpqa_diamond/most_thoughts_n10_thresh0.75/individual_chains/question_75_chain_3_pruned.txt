Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology techniques and transgenic mice. Let's try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. They're modifying the gene to add a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary cells and are having trouble overexpressing the protein. The plus strand of their construct is provided, and I need to figure out why it's not working.

Looking at the options, the possible issues are related to the construct's sequence. Let's think about each option.

Option A: The sequence for the HA tag has a missense mutation. That would affect the tag's recognition, but I'm not sure how that would prevent expression. Maybe if the mutation causes a stop codon, perhaps? Or maybe the tag isn't present, so purification fails. But the problem is about overexpression, not purification, so maybe not the main issue here.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would mean a premature stop codon. If the construct has a premature stop, the protein would be truncated. Looking at the coding sequence, I should check for stop codons before the end. Let's see the sequence's end.

Wait, the sequence given is the plus strand, which is the coding strand. I need to look for in-frame stop codons. The last part is ...GAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA. Hmm, the TGA at the end is a stop codon (since TGA is a stop in the coding sequence). Wait, but wait, the reading frame must be considered. Let me see.

Wait, the last part of the sequence is ...CTCCCCGAGTGA. Let me parse this. The sequence after the last exon would depend on the reading frame. Let's see, maybe I should look for the presence of any early TGA, TAG, or TAA in the coding frame.

Looking for triplets that are stop codons. Let me scan the sequence for TGA, TAG, or TAA. 

Looking at the sequence:

...TTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Let me see if any TGA is present. Let me look for 'TGA' in the sequence. Scanning through, I don't see a TGA until the very end. The last part is ...AGTGA. The last three nucleotides are AGTGA. Wait, no, wait. Let me think in terms of codons. Let's look at the end:

...GAGTGA. So the last codon is GAG (which is glutamic acid), then TGA. Oh! So the last two codons are GAG and TGA. TGA is a stop codon. So the construct ends with a stop codon at the very end. That would mean the protein would be translated correctly to the end. So why is the protein not being expressed?

Wait, but sometimes the presence of a stop codon can cause issues if it's in the wrong frame or if there's a frameshift. Alternatively, maybe the construct has a premature stop codon somewhere else.

Wait, another thought: The person added a HA tag at the N-terminus. The HA tag is a short peptide, maybe around 11 amino acids. The sequence of the HA tag is from the influenza virus. So the construct should start with the HA tag. But let's look at the beginning of the provided sequence: 5' ATG TAC CCATACG ATG... So ATG is the start codon, and the first few amino acids would be Met, Tyr, Pro, etc. So the HA tag should be right after Met. Wait, the HA tag's coding sequence is added before the GADD45G ORF. So the construct's coding sequence should start with HA tag, then GADD45G.

Wait, perhaps they used the HA tag sequence correctly, but maybe in the provided construct, the HA tag isn't present. Let me think about the start. The provided sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then TAC is Tyr, then CCATACG ATG. Wait, the HA tag's coding sequence: what is the actual DNA sequence? The HA tag is a short peptide, say, YPYDVPDYA. Let's see, the DNA sequence for the HA tag would be something like TAC TAC TAC ... Wait, no, let me think. The HA tag's DNA sequence is TAC TAC TAC GAT GGT CCA TAC GAT G (maybe? I'm not exactly sure, but perhaps that's the idea). 

Wait, maybe the construct includes the HA tag, but in the provided sequence, it
