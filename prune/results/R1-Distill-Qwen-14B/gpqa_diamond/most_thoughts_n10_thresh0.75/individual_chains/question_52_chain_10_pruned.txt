Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and break it down.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

The question focuses on the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels when the star has spots compared to when it doesn't. Specifically, when the star has spots, the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—so (ratio without spots) divided by (ratio with spots).

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the distribution of atoms between energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann factor is given by n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, E_i and E_j are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, we're dealing with two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The transition between them corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. I think that's in the near-ultraviolet or maybe far-ultraviolet range, but the exact wavelength might not be crucial unless we need to calculate the energy difference.

Wait, but I can find the energy difference using the wavelength. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. But how does that help here?

Wait, no, because the energy difference between the two levels corresponds to the photon emitted (or absorbed) when an atom transitions between them. So ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

Wait, but actually, the energy difference would be E1 - E2 if the transition is from level 2 to 1. So maybe ΔE = E1 - E2 = hc/λ. Because when an electron moves from a higher energy level to a lower one, it emits a photon of energy equal to the difference.

But in the Boltzmann equation, the exponent is -(ΔE)/(kT), where ΔE is E_i - E_j. So if level 1 is higher than level 2, then E1 > E2, so ΔE = E1 - E2 = hc/λ. So the exponent would be -(E1-E2)/(kT) = -hc/(λ k T).

Wait, but let me get the details right. Let's say level 2 is higher than level 1. Then E2 > E1. So the energy difference would be ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc/λ. So if an atom transitions from level 2 to level 1, it emits a photon of wavelength λ. So in this case, the Boltzmann equation would have the exponent as (E1 - E2)/(kT) = -ΔE/(kT).

Wait, no. The Boltzmann distribution is n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) ). So if E_i is higher than E_j, then (E_i - E_j) is positive, so the exponential becomes exp(-x), which is less than 1, meaning n_i is less than n_j. So the higher energy level has fewer atoms.

So in our case, when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So initially, when there are no spots, the Teff is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the effective temperature of the photosphere drops to 5500 K.

Wait, but wait. The star's surface is 40% covered by spots. But how does that affect the overall photospheric temperature? Oh, the problem states that when the spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So the entire photosphere is at 5500 K? Or is it a mix of hotter and cooler regions? Hmm, but the question says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases, so perhaps we can model it as the temperature being lower, which would affect the ionization and excitation of atoms in the photosphere.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. That suggests that the overall photosphere is at 5500 K. So the temperature T is 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K when there are none.

So the ratio of levels without spots (T=6000 K) compared to with spots (T=5500 K) is what we're looking for. The ratio without spots is higher or lower than the ratio with spots?

The problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So when the spots are present, the ratio is lower. So the ratio when without spots is higher than with spots. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

But let's proceed with the equations.

The ratio R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Assuming that the statistical weights g1 and g2 are the same, or perhaps the problem doesn't provide them, so maybe they're equal, or perhaps they cancel out when taking the ratio of ratios.

Wait, in this problem, when the star has spots, the ratio R decreases. So let's compute R1 (no spots) and R2 (with spots). The factor is R1 / R2.

But wait, when the spots are present, the photosphere is cooler. So T decreases from 6000 K to 5500 K.

The ratio R is proportional to exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T) ). Since E1-E2 is positive (as level 1 is higher than level 2?), no—wait, maybe I should think again: if level 2 is higher than level 1, then E2 > E1, so E1 - E2 is negative. Hmm, that would make the exponent positive.

Wait, perhaps I should define ΔE as (E2 - E1) = hc/λ, so ΔE is positive if level 2 is higher than level 1.

So the ratio R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, but that can't be right because if E2 > E1, then E2 - E1 is positive. So the exponent is positive. So R increases with higher T? Because exp(x) increases as x increases, but wait, when T increases, x = ΔE/(kT)—so as T increases, x decreases. So exp(x) would decrease, making R decrease.

Wait, let me think. Let me define R as (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

If E1 > E2, then E1 - E2 is positive, so -(E1 - E2) is negative. So the exponent is negative, and the ratio R is (g1/g2) multiplied by a small number. So if E1 > E2, then R is lower when T is lower because as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp becomes larger, making R larger.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to take the ratio without and with spots.

So, when there are no spots, T is 6000 K. When spots are present, T is 5500 K.

The ratio R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k * 6000) )

R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k * 5500) )

Wait, but the problem says that when spots are present (R2), the ratio R is lower. So R2 < R1. So the factor is R1 / R2 = [exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) ) ] / [exp( -ΔE/(k*5500) ) ].

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me define
