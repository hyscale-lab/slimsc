Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain properties. The star has 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

Then, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find by what factor this ratio changes when the star is spot-free compared to when it has spots. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Å, and the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

Hmm, I remember that in LTE, the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of populations in two levels depends on the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, and k is Boltzmann's constant.

In this problem, the transition corresponds to a specific wavelength, so the energy difference can be found using the relation E = hc/λ. But wait, the specific wavelength is given as 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet or far-ulfrared range. But more importantly, it's used to find the energy difference between the two levels.

Wait, the ratio of the number of atoms in two levels is given by (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(kT) ). Since E1 is higher than E2 (because the transition is from a higher to lower energy level, emitting a photon), E1 - E2 would be positive. So the ratio depends on the temperature and the energy difference.

But wait, when the star has spots, its overall effective temperature decreases. But I'm not sure how that affects the photosphere. Wait, the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the star's photosphere is at 5500 K in that case. But the spots themselves might be cooler regions, perhaps.

Wait, but the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases, so the photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. So in the photosphere, the temperature is now 5500 K, so when the spots are present, the photospheric temperature is lower.

But the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. So we're comparing the ratio when the star doesn't have spots (Teff = 6000 K) to when it does (Teff = 5500 K).

Wait a second, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So the photosphere's temperature has changed
