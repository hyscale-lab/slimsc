Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quasar question. Let me read it again. So, they observed a quasar's spectrum, and there's a peak at about 790 nm in the near infrared and optical range. Then, the flux drops significantly below that wavelength. Hmm, I remember that in quasars, emission lines can sometimes be broad, but why would there be a peak here?

Wait, oh, I think this has something to do with the Lyman-alpha forest. Or maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's the Lyman series. Let me think. The Lyman-alpha line is at about 121 nm. But if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, which is way longer than that, that suggests redshift.

Right, so if the emitted wavelength is, say, 121 nm and we observe it at 790 nm, that's a redshift factor z. The formula is observed wavelength = emitted wavelength * (1 + z). So 790 = 121*(1+z). Let me calculate that. 790 divided by 121 is approximately 6.5289. So 1 + z is 6.5289, so z is around 5.5289. So z ≈5.53.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the peak is at 790 nm. If it's a certain emission line, perhaps from the Lyman series, the rest wavelength is 121 nm, so the observed wavelength would be 121*(1+z). So if the peak is around 790, then z is about 6.5? Wait, because 121*(1+z)=790, so (790/121) is approx 6.528. So z is 5.528. Hmm, my calculation seems off. Wait, let me do the math accurately.

790 divided by 121. Let's see: 121*6 is 726, 726 +121 is 847, which is over 790, so 6.5 times. 6.5*121 = 786.5. Close to 790. So 790 is 6.528 times 121. So 1+z = 6.528, so z=5.528.

Wait, but wait, quasars can have various emission lines. Wait, the Lyalpha line is 121.6 nm. So if the quasar's emission is at 790 nm, that would be z= (790/121.6)-1 ≈ 6.495. So z≈6.5.

Wait, maybe I confused the emitted and observed. If it's a peak in the observed spectrum, then it must be the observed wavelength. So if the emitted wavelength is, for example, 121 nm, then the redshift is (790/121)-1 = 5.53.

But wait, another possibility: the peak is from a different line. Let me think. If the peak is at
