Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet has a higher chance of transiting so that the researchers can observe it. Let me think through this step by step.

From what I remember, the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the distance of the planet's orbit. Oh wait, I think the formula involves the star's radius and the planet's orbital distance. The transit probability is higher when the planet's orbit is closer to the star and the planet is bigger compared to the star. 

The question says both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. Since orbital period relates to the distance from the star, I remember Kepler's third law: the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from star). So if Planet_1 has a period three times shorter, its semi-major axis must be smaller. Let me think, if P1 is three times less than P2, then (P1/P2)^2 = (a1/a2)^3. Wait, no, Kepler's law is (P^2)/(a^3) = constant for the same star. Wait, but the stars have different masses here.

Wait, the host stars of the two planets have different masses. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But Kepler's third law when considering different stars is given by P² = (4π²/G(M+m))a³. But since the planets' masses are much smaller than the stars', we can approximate it as P² = (4π²/(G M)) a³. So the formula would be for each star:

For Planet 1: P₁² = (4π²/(G M₁)) a₁³
For Planet 2: P₂² = (4π²/(G M₂)) a₂³

Given that M₁ = 2 M₂ (since Planet_1's star is twice as massive), and P₁ = (1/3) P₂. So let's plug that in.

Let me write the equations:

P₁² = (4π²/(G M₁)) a₁³
P₂² = (4π²/(G M₂)) a₂³

Divide the two equations to eliminate 4π² and G:

(P₁²)/(P₂²) = (M₂ / M₁) * (a₁³ / a₂³)

We know M₁ = 2 M₂, so M₂/M₁ = 1/2. Also, P₁ = (1/3) P₂, so (P₁²)/(P₂²) = (1/9).

Putting it in:

(1/9) = (1/2) * (a₁³ / a₂³)

Multiply both sides by 2:

(2/9) = a₁³ / a₂³

So a₁³ = (2/9) a₂³ → a₁ = a₂ * (2/9)^(1/3)

Wait, to compute (2/9)^(1/3), let me think. 2/9 is about 0.222. The cube root of that is roughly 0.6, because 0.6³ is 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So a₁ is about 0.6 a₂. So Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2 is to its.

Now, transit probability. I think the formula for transit probability is R_p² / (a (1 - e²))^(1/2), but wait, that's for the probability once you have the inclination. Alternatively, the probability that the planet's orbit is such that it transits (i.e., the orbital plane is edge-on relative to us) is given by the ratio of the star's radius to the distance of the planet's orbit. Or wait, no, the primary transit probability is higher if the orbital distance is smaller because the chance that the planet's path crosses our line of sight is higher when it's closer.

Wait, no, the transit probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, but wait, actually, the probability is (R_star / a) * (something else?), but I think the exact formula is P = (R_star / a) * (some function based on inclination). Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula for the probability of an edge-on orbit, which is the geometric probability. The formula for the geometric probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits) is (R_star / a) * (some factor), but wait, I think the exact formula is (R_star / a) * (1 + (R_planet / R_star)), but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, this is approximately (R_star / a). 

Wait, no, I think the geometric probability is given by the formula:

P = (R_star + R_planet) / a * (something else?), but maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, it's the ratio of the star's radius to the distance, but that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Oh wait, I think the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a) * (something else?), but perhaps more accurately, it's (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 + (R_planet / R_star)). Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The formula I remember is that the probability of a transit is approximately (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 + (R_planet / R_star)) ), but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, the second term is approximately 1. So the probability is roughly (R_star / a). But wait, isn't that the same as (R_star/a), which doesn't make sense because it would be a unitless ratio, but probabilities can't be greater than 1. Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is the area of the star as seen from Earth divided by the area of the planet's orbit as seen from Earth. Wait, no, the actual formula is based on the relative sizes. The transit probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the distance of the planet's orbit, multiplied by something else.

Wait, the correct formula for the geometric transit probability is:

P = (R_star / a) * ( (1 + R_planet / R_star) / ( sqrt(1 - e²)) )

But since both planets have circular orbits, e=0, so it's just (R_star / a) * (1 + R_planet / R_star). But R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so this is approximately (R_star / a).

Wait, but R_planet is not given, but the question says both planets are Earth-like, so R_planet is similar for both. So when comparing the two planets, the R_planet term can be considered the same and thus can be neglected. So the transit probability is approximately proportional to (R_star / a). 

Wait, but let me make sure. The actual probability formula is:

P = [ (R_*/a) ) * (1 + (R_p / R_*)) ] / [ ... ]? I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe another approach: the probability of a transit is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter, plus some factor. Or, the transit probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by some function. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is about (R_star / a) * (something), but I'm not certain. Another source I recall is that the probability is roughly (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 + something), but perhaps I should just proceed with what's given.

Wait, in the question, both host stars have the same radii. Oh, that's an important point! So R_star for both is the same. So R1 = R2 = R. So when calculating the transit probability for each, the R_star term is the same. So P is proportional to (R / a). But wait, the formula might actually be (R / a) squared, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps P is proportional to (R / a).

Wait, no, perhaps the transit probability is given by (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 + something). Alternatively, maybe it's (R_star / a) times some factor. Wait, but if both planets have the same star radius, then R_star is the same for both.

So for each planet, the transit probability (geometric probability) is roughly proportional to (R_star / a), but wait, R_star is the same, so it's inversely proportional to a. So lower a (closer planet) would have higher transit probability.

Wait, no, because transit probability is higher when the planet is closer. So if a is smaller, (R / a) is larger, so P is larger.

So in our case, Planet_1 has a smaller a than Planet_2. Therefore, it has a higher transit probability.

Wait, but wait. Let me recap the data:

- Both planets have same mass (so R_planet is same? Because same mass, but I'm not sure if they have same radius. But the question doesn't specify, but perhaps it's not needed because the transit probability depends more on a and R_star, and R_planet is same for both? Or maybe it's negligible.)

But in the question, the host stars have same radii. So R1 = R2 = R.

So transit probability for each is proportional to (R / a) for each. So P1 = (R / a1) and P2 = (R / a2).

We found earlier that a1 is approximately 0.6 a2.

So P1 = R/(0.6 a2) = (1/0.6) (R/a2) ≈ 1.666... (R/a2)

And P2 = R/a2.

So P1 is about 1.666 times P2. So the probability for Planet_1 to transit is about 1.666 times higher than Planet_2. So the probability for Planet_1 is higher, so they should observe Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Options:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.

Wait, so my calculation suggests that P1 is ~1.666 times P2. So the probability for Planet_1 is higher, so they should prefer observing Planet_1.

Looking at the options, option C says 1.65 times, which is approximately 1.666. So option C is the correct one.

Wait, but let me re-calculate the a1/a2 ratio more accurately. Earlier, I estimated (2/9)^(1/3) as approximately 0.6, but let me compute it more precisely.

(2/9) is approximately 0.2222. The cube root of 0.2222.

We know that 0.6^3 = 0.216, which is very close to 0.2222. So a1 = a2 * 0.6, approximately.

So a1 = 0.6 a2.

Thus, P = R/(a) → P1 = R/(0.6 a2) = (5/3) (R/a2) ≈ 1.666 * (R/a2) = 1.666 * P2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is about 1.666 times higher than Planet_2. So the researchers should choose Planet_1, as its probability is higher, making option C correct, which states 1.65 times higher.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The probability of a transit depends on the relative size of the star and the planet's orbital distance. Specifically, the transit probability is approximately proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the star's radius and \( a \) is the planet's orbital distance. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_{\text{star,1}} = R_{\text{star,2}} \)), the transit probability depends inversely on the orbital distance \( a \). A smaller \( a \) corresponds to a higher transit probability.

### Orbital Distance Analysis
From Kepler's third law, the orbital period \( P \) is related to the semi-major axis \( a \) and the star's mass \( M \) by:

\[
P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M}.
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- Planet_1 has an orbital period \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2 \).
- Planet_1's host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star (\( M_1 = 2M_2 \)).

Using Kepler's law, we compare the orbital distances:

\[
\frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} \cdot \frac{M_2}{M_1}.
\]

Substituting \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2 \) and \( M_1 = 2M_2 \):

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{1}{3}P_2\right)^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} \cdot \frac{M_2}{2M_2}.
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{1}{9} = \frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} \cdot \frac{1}{2}.
\]

\[
\frac{2}{9} = \frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3}.
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
a_1 = a_2 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Approximating \( \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6 \), we find:

\[
a_1 \approx 0.6a_2.
\]

Thus, Planet_1 is closer to its host star than Planet_2 is to its host star.

### Transit Probability Comparison
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \). Since both stars have the same radius (\( R_{\text{star,1}} = R_{\text{star,2}} \)), the probability is inversely proportional to \( a \). Therefore:

\[
P_1 \propto \frac{1}{a_1}, \quad P_2 \propto \frac{1}{a_2}.
\]

Substituting \( a_1 \approx 0.6a_2 \):

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{1}{a_1}}{\frac{1}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67.
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.67 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Conclusion
The researchers should prefer observing Planet_1, as it has a higher transit probability (~1.65 times) compared to Planet_2. This matches option C.

**Answer: C**
