Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron, and I need to figure out how many revolutions a proton makes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. The alternating voltage is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The given data are Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. The options are A to D, and I need to find the correct number of revolutions.

Wait, first, I should remember what a synchrocyclotron does. Unlike a regular cyclotron, which has a constant magnetic field, a synchrocyclotron's magnetic field increases with time. This allows it to accelerate particles to much higher energies without the problem of relativistic effects making the radius too large. But how does this affect the number of revolutions?

In a cyclotron, the time for one revolution depends on the magnetic field B and the charge and mass of the particle. The formula for cyclotron frequency is f = qB/(2πm), right? But in a synchrocyclotron, B isn't constant. So the frequency changes, but the particles are kept in sync with the accelerating voltage by adjusting the magnetic field.

Wait, but since the proton is being accelerated, each time it goes around, it gains some energy. The energy comes from the voltage applied, which is alternating. So each time the proton completes a revolution, it's supposed to experience the voltage peak, which accelerates it.

But wait, the voltage is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. Hmm, I'm not sure what ν(α) is. Maybe it's the frequency that's adjusted as the magnetic field changes. Synchrocyclotrons have a varying magnetic field, so the cyclotron frequency ν depends on time. So ν(α) could be the instantaneous frequency at a particular point in the acceleration process.

The proton starts with T ≈ 0, so initial velocity is low. Each revolution, it gains a bit of energy. But since the magnetic field is increasing, the radius of the orbit increases, and the time for each revolution changes. But the key is that the particle is always in phase with the accelerating voltage, which is crucial for effective acceleration.

So to find the number of revolutions, I think I need to consider how much energy the proton gains each time it goes around and how many such steps it takes to reach 950 MeV.

Wait, but in a regular cyclotron, each half-cycle of the voltage provides a kick to the particle. Since it's an alternating voltage, the maximum energy gain per revolution is U0. Or is it per half-revolution? Because the voltage is applied alternately.

Wait no, in a
