Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all starting with C6H and varying in the number of hydrogens and oxygen atoms.

Let's break down the data step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR around that region usually indicate O-H stretching. So, that's a strong hint that the compound has an -OH group, like an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but I remember that carboxylic acids have very broad and strong O-H stretches, often around 2500-3300 cm^-1. But the question says 3000, so it's a broad peak. So maybe it's an alcohol. Or maybe a phenol, but that's also an O-H but part of an aromatic ring.

Then, the FTIR also shows two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, what could that be? 1700 is a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. But why two peaks? Maybe one is from a ketone and another from something else, but that seems less likely. Alternatively, maybe one is a conjugated carbonyl, like an ester or a conjugated ketone. Or perhaps the 1650 is due to another functional group. Wait, 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugation, like C=C stretching in an aromatic compound. Alternatively, it might be a conjugated carbonyl, such as an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester. Or maybe an amide, but the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not that.

Wait, another thought: sometimes in IR, the 1700 region is a carbonyl (like ketone, aldehyde, ester, carboxylic acid). The 1650 could be an aromatic ring's C=C stretch. But wait, aromatic C=C is usually around 1450-1600 cm^-1. So 1650 is a bit higher than that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated
