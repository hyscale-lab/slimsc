Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on various spectroscopic data. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

First, I'll look at the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretchingâ€”like from alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, a very broad peak might suggest a strong hydrogen bonding, which is typical for -OH groups. So maybe there's an alcohol or perhaps a carbonyl group with an O-H like a ketone? No, wait, ketones don't have O-H. Oh, right, maybe an ester or something else.

Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Those are in the range of carbonyl groups. 1700 is about right for a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The 1650 could be conjugated carbonyl groups, like an ester or maybe an aromatic ring with a carbonyl (like an aromatic ketone or an ester attached to a benzene ring). Alternatively, it could be an amide, but I don't see any info on N in the options, so maybe not. Wait, another thought: sometimes, conjugated carbonyl groups (like in an ester with an adjacent double bond) can show a peak around 1650.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like CH2=CH. So the molecule has a double bond somewhere. Maybe an alkene or an aromatic ring? But wait, aromatic protons are usually in a different region, around 7 ppm. Vinyl protons (like in alkenes) are typically around 4.5-6.5 ppm, depending on substitution. So the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests an alkene is present.

Then the mass spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, I need to think about what that could be. The molecular ion (M) would be the molecular weight of the compound. Let's calculate the molecular weights for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2.
Molecular weight = (6*12) + (12*1) + (2*16) = 72 +12 +32 = 116 g/mol.

Option B: C6H10O.
Molecular weight = (6*12) +10 +16 =72 +10 +16= 98.

Option C: C6H10O2.
Molecular weight =72 +10 +32 =114.

Option D: C6H12O.
72 +12 +16= 100.

The mass spec fragment is at 45. So, what fragment could that be? Let's think about common fragments. Maybe a ketone group or ester. Wait, the molecule could be an ester. An ester typically has the formula R-O-CO-R'. When it fragments, one common fragment is the loss of the R group, leaving the COOR' part, which can break down further.

Wait, the m/z 45. Let's find what has a molecular weight of 45. Let's see: C3H6O2 would be 3*12 +6 +32= 36+6+32=74. No. Wait, maybe it's a smaller fragment. Let's see, 45 could be C3H6O (3*12=36 +6=42 +16=58? No, that's too high. Wait, maybe it's C2H4O2? 24 +4 +32=60. No. Or maybe something like CH3COO- which is 60 (but that's more like 60). Hmm, maybe a different approach. The fragment of 45 could be a carbonyl-containing group. Like maybe (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. Acetone is (CH3)2CO, molecular weight is 58. No, that's not 45. Alternatively, perhaps a smaller fragment, like (CH2O), which is formaldehyde, but that's 30. Not 45.

Wait, maybe it's a ketene? I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think about the common fragments. For example, in esters, when the molecule breaks, one part could be the R-O-CO- part. Wait, if the molecular ion is 116 (option A), then subtracting a 45 fragment would leave 71. Not sure. Alternatively, if the peak is a fragment that's a carbonyl group plus some hydrogens.

Another thought: the 45 could be the tropylium ion, which is a fragment from aromatic rings. The molecular weight of the tropylium ion (C7H7+) is 91, but that's higher than 45. Hmm. Maybe not.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible functional groups. FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 which suggests an O-H. So the compound has an O-H group.

The peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1 suggests two carbonyl groups or
