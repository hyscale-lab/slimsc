Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully. The question is about identifying a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and figuring out the final product from the options given. 

First, I need to analyze the given spectral data: the IR and the NMR. The IR data shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But in this case, since it's a carbonyl-containing compound, maybe it's an acid. Or maybe an ester or something else. Wait, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Another peak at 1610 cm^-1 and 1450 cm^-1—those might be from aromatic rings, possibly C=C stretching. So perhaps the compound has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group, like a benzoic acid or an ester.

Now looking at the NMR data. The protons are split into several signals. The first one is at 10.5 ppm, broad singlet (bs, 1H). A broad peak around 10 ppm usually suggests an -OH proton, like in a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a broad singlet, it could also be an exchange with D2O, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 ppm and might not be broad. Hmm, a broad peak suggests it's exchanging with water, so probably -COOH.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). These are typical aromatic protons. The doublets suggest coupling between two sets of protons. So maybe para-substituted aromatic ring, with two sets of protons each integrating to 2H. Like a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. So if the 8.0 ppm is the protons next to the substituent, and 7.2 is the other set. Wait, for a para-substituted benzene, the protons would be in two sets of two each, as doublets. So that supports a para-substituted benzene.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). That's a multiplet integrating for one proton. That seems like a methylene (CH2) group that's adjacent to something else, maybe a carbonyl. Or perhaps it's a -CH- group near an electronegative atom.

Next, 1.7 ppm (m, 2H). Another multiplet, this time for two protons. Maybe another CH2 group, perhaps in a chain. Then, 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which is a triplet of three protons. That's a typical methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH2. And finally, 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)—that's a terminal methyl group, like at the end of an ethyl chain. So putting this together, perhaps there's an ethyl group attached somewhere.

Putting the NMR together: The aromatic signals suggest a para-substituted benzene. The 10.5 ppm peak is likely an -OH from a carboxylic acid. The 2.9, 1.7, and 1.4 ppm signals could be a chain attached to the ring. Let me try to visualize this.

If it's a para-substituted benzene with a carboxylic acid group, perhaps. But then what's the rest of the structure? The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH between two CH2 groups. So maybe the structure is something like benzene with a substituent that's a chain. Wait, the substituent would be like -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)COOH? Not sure, but let me think about the chain.

Wait, the NMR data: 1.
