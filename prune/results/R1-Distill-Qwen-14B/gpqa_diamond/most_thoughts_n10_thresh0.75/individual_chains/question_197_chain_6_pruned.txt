Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

The question is about Compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product. The options are A, B, C, D. 

Let me look at the IR and NMR data given for Compound X. 

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are in the ranges 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720, 1610, 1450, and 1450 cm-1. Wait, 1450 is listed twice—probably a typo, maybe it's 1450 and 1400? Not sure, but I'll note the 1720 cm-1. That usually indicates a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. But wait, the 3400–2500 range suggests maybe an OH group or an alkyne. The broadness (bs in the NMR) might indicate an OH.

Moving on to the 1H NMR data:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) – that's a strong, broad peak. Could be an acidic proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 and might be a triplet or something else, but broad could fit for a carboxylic acid -OH.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) – this looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. Each doublet (d) with 2H each suggests two sets of equivalent protons. So, maybe a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. Like 4-substituted.

Then the other signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) – maybe a methylene group next to an electronegative atom or something. 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) – perhaps another methylene. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) – a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH2 group. 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) – a terminal methyl, like from an ethyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that has a carbonyl group. The 1720 cm-1 in IR is a strong carbonyl. So, maybe it's a benzoyl group or something like that. But wait, the NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5 ppm. If that's a carboxylic acid, then the carbonyl would be around 1700. Also, 1720 could be an ester, maybe.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show a lot of splitting for the aromatic protons beyond the doublets. So probably a para-substituted ring. Let's say the substituent is in the para position, and perhaps the substituent is a side chain.

Looking at the substituent: The signals at 2.9, 1.7, 1.
