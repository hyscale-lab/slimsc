Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. I need to find the elements of the normalized eigenvector from the given options.

Hmm, wait, the operator components are given for P_x, P_y, and P_z. Oh right, because in quantum mechanics, the angular momentum operator is often represented in terms of its components. So the total operator P would be the vector sum of these components, right? But wait, no, the operator itself is a vector operator, so the components are P_x, P_y, P_z.

Wait, but the question says the operator is P, and we're looking for its eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction n would be a unit vector in the x-z plane, so it can be written as n = (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) or something like that? Wait, no, in spherical coordinates, the unit vector in the x-z plane would have φ=0, so maybe n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact parametrization. Alternatively, since it's in the x-z plane, I can think of it as making an
